Jul 24 2023,neutral, synopsis journalist eddie brock tom hardy is trying to take down carlton drake riz ahmed the notorious and brilliant founder of the life foundation while investigating one of drakes experiments eddies body merges with the alien venom  leaving him with superhuman strength and power twisted dark and fueled by rage venom tries to control the new and dangerous abilities that eddie finds so intoxicating unfortunately in todays world a film isnt good or bad because its truly good or bad there must be an excuse for each of these cases especially if were discussing a big franchiserelated flick being venom a superhero movie obviously theres no middle ground either you love it or hate it usually if you think its just okay youre the anomaly this time that didnt bother me as much as the next thing since every fanboy must defend their favorite studio the reasons for venoms poor reviews were apparently due to lady gaga fans blindly trashing this film since a star is born also premieres this week its not even a dc x marvel dispute fans reluctance in accepting that a movie from their favorite cinematic universe can be disappointing reaches unbelievable levels even more when it is in fact a complete boredom of a story with a generic plot paperthin characters who only serve as plot devices and extremely terrible editing maryann brandon alan baumgarten there is some good stuff to write about so ill start with the absolute standout tom hardy dunkirk when you have such a remarkable actor saying they cut off my favorite scenes you cant possibly have high expectations for the respective film hardy fantastically incorporates the character of eddie brock delivering tons of scenes where the actor simply shines his versatile ability to interpret such an expressive character makes hardy himself the best thing about venom the interactions between eddie and the symbiote are the most fascinating aspect of the movie from the funny banter to the unusual method of character development their relationship is by far the strongest in the entire film which ends up becoming a negative point as well  unfortunately the screenplay written by jeff pinkner the dark tower scott rosenberg jumanji welcome to the jungle and kelly marcel fifty shades of grey is packed with numerous useless subplots and secondary characters who dont add anything to the main narrative or the protagonists arc the first half of the movie has no venom whatsoever which wouldnt be an issue if the story and characters were compelling while eddie has indeed an engaging personality literally every other character in the film is either a cliche stereotype or an onthenose plot device  michelle williams the greatest showman blandly portrays eddies lover anne someone i dont even have words to describe based on her development riz ahmed rogue one an actor i adore tries his best as carlton drake a forgettable villain who holds the generic villain hunger for power finally there are a bunch of scientists who only serve as exposition devices to explicitly explain to the audience everything thats happening dealing with these characters becomes astonishingly dull and tiresome most of the comedic scenes dont really work without venoms voice to provide a different take on them so hardy finds himself carrying the whole thing by himself however the worst aspect of the movie is undoubtedly the editing it doesnt matter if its an action scene or a simple dialogue in a diner the editing is a total mess exceptionally frustrating to be honest ruben fleischer zombieland is a talented filmmaker but i cant defend cutting a simple dialogue on every single line while weirdly switching the positions of each actor despite a couple of riveting action sequences the vast majority is filled with quick cuts and blurred camera movement due to an abusive employment of shakycam matthew libatique the final battle is extraordinarily underwhelming since its impossible to understand most of whats happening when an occasional fight between venom and some random bad guys is better than the supposed climax of the film you know somethings not right the pg13 rating clearly affected the movie some scenes were cut because there was no way of toning them down and the lack of blood or heavy language is definitely a setback the score is actually pretty great ludwig göransson and it helps revitalize some slow moments tonally the film is wellbalanced overall even if fleischer irregularly loses control here and there i dont consider it one of the worst movies of the year but i wont ever feel the need for a rewatch unless a sequel is made venom is yet another missed opportunity to deliver a great movie about the symbiote antihero this time the character of eddie brock is beautifully handled with tom hardy offering an impressive performance the actor carries the entire film which finds its entertainment peak in the interactions between eddie and venom unfortunately the movie is drastically brought down by a generic narrative with an incredibly dull first half an unnecessary focus on uninteresting subplots and a disappointing amount of paperthin characters the shockingly terrible editing basically ruins any sort of excitement that could be found during the action sequences the production issues condemned this film to be a letdown lets just hope the next one isnt worse

Nov 16 2022,negative,ironically the film lacks a bit of bite 
Aug 21 2022,neutral, venom had two encouraging things going for it since its initial announcement first it stars tom hardy an actor ive really liked since his 2001 debut in ridley scotts black hawk down second it features a truly great marvel comic book villain and eventual antihero with a compelling backstory and formidable superpowers those are two big steps in the right direction does sony pictures make the most of hardy and the titular title character it seems critics would say no as most have panned the film moviegoers seem to have had a different reaction not being nearly as harsh and having helped the film rake in 205 million globally on its opening weekend lets say i fall somewhere in the middle versions of venom have been in the works since 1997 but this particular iteration had its own set of challenges fans of the character will immediately notice how far the movie strays from his comic book origins the filmmakers arent entirely to blame sonys deal with marvel studios to allow spiderman into their carefully guarded mcu handcuffed the writers forcing them to create a webslingerfree origin interestingly they did shelf the idea of an rrating leaving the door open for a potential crossover hardy plays eddie brock a bay area investigative reporter with a knack for uncovering deepseated corruption he sets his sights on the life foundation and its ceo carlton drake riz ahmed turns out drake has discovered and captured samples of splotchy alien lifeforms he calls symbiotes eddie gets a whiff of potential human testing and confronts drake during an onair interview it goes bad for eddie who loses his job and even his fiancé michelle williams who works as a life foundation attorney six months pass and a downonhisluck eddie is contacted by a life foundation scientist begging him to blow the lid off drakes experiments while secretly infiltrating the labs eddie is exposed to the symbiote which instantly gives him superpowers and a gruesome appetite for violence and human heads check that it isnt eddie who has those appetites they belong to his new parasitic alterego venom from there the movie becomes a weird blend of horror and humor set within the framework of a superhero movie i kind of like what its going for even if its tone can be wildly uneven eddies backandforths with the menacing venom voice in his head can be amusing there is also the intriguing duality of two distinct characters warring within one man the film flirts with the idea more than exploring it which seems like a missed opportunity this is also where the action amps up but not in a particularly thrilling or impressive way most of it is encapsulated in the trailer  a big chase sequence in downtown san francisco and several fight scenes featuring a reluctant eddie and the more violent venoms stretchy tentacles it all culminates in a cgisoaked finale that doesnt do the movie any favors tom hardy does his best to bring energy and nuance to his character its a good performance with several interesting layers director ruben fleischer clearly wanted to make an atypical superhero movie with a distinct edge to it i applaud that aim and see glimpses of what hes going for but ultimately its the script and some pretty uninspired action that left me feeling a bit deflated sadly a good tom hardy fleishers edgy ambition or even a killer end credits scene cant quite keep venom from disappointing ahmed really is getting some great roles i loved him in nightcrawler films in production for such a long time do tend to get negative reviews ahmedis a really good actor but did you feel he was a bit shortchanged here that is the thought that kept ringing in my head for the entire movie as for the movie i really felt going in that the changes that have been made over the years sounded like good ones and i truly believe there are ingredients here for a much better movie i feel the same ill eventually get my thoughts up kinda excited for the 2nd but they may really be handcuffing themselves with a refusal to consider a r rating you may be right but i dont really think an rrating is essential this one felt darker and edgier to me i felt it really came down to the script and some pretty mediocre special effects true that maybe an r isnt needed and im far from one of those ratings hounds but im intrigued to see how they do the sequel with one of the more violent characters in marvels lore  if it wasnt for tom hardys performance and the character of venom the film would have been just another generic origin story with a generic villain  weve had way too many of those  the problem here is sony  theyve never been able to really get their marvel movies right in any fashion  even sam raimis spiderman movies werent that great  the only reason spiderman homecoming was any good was because marvel had a direct hand in it more so than sony  i did enjoy venom but it feels like there was a lot of stuff cut out that needed to be in there so im hoping for an extended cut on bluray its funny i was t nearly as high on homecoming as most were dont remember the exact score i gave it but there were several things about it that pushed me away i will say that i liked raimis spiderman and loved spiderman 2 the third movie thoughugh i love tom hardy but i think ill wait for it on tv  i just hope its not as bad as the amazing spiderman 2 i dont think its a bad movie  its just not the movie it could have been  its definitely worth watching at least  if you can catch it on 5 dollar tuesday at your local theater then do so but dont expect anything revolutionary its not terrible youre right for me its a case of a movie trying new things but falling short in some pretty key areas i felt it ended up being a very okay movie good move just wait for it on dvd its definitely not as bad as amazing 2 in fact i almost gave this 3 stars just too many disappointing elements though it does get credit for trying new things amazing 2 was just plain bad which is why im curious if theres going to be an extended cut of the movie for home video  i want to see what was cut out and see if it wouldve improved anything  it might not but it would still be interesting to see  for me venom wasnt the disaster that the predator was great review keith i went into this one expecting the worst so i was quite pleasantly surprised it definitely has its faults but all in all im quite looking forward to a sequel thanks i felt it was better than the drumming it took by critics still i felt it left so much potential on the table i do think there is enough there for a good sequel id sure watch it i was disappointed here the best thing about this move was the after credits scene hardy was great but your right the writing and direction made this film hard to watch nice write up im among the vocal bunch who never wanted this film in the first place whether that makes me a monster or not i cannot judge but the fact this film succeeded in the face of such opposition is frankly surprising one wonders whether its mediocrity will generate interest in a sequel and although i suspect the law of diminishing returns wont work in sonys favour theres an argument to be had that the boxoffice return is enough to warrant such an investment what im keen to examine is whether or not this was just a fluke or whether there are enough people keen to see a villainverse so to speak from this studio without the core heroes they sprang from im still in denial about that but if it works ill shut up and enjoy i dont think the idea of movies centered around villains is a bad idea  the problem is that in order for them to work properly you need strong writing in terms of script and character development  you also need to have filmmakers and a movie studio that truly understand the character theyre making the movie for  venom didnt really have any of that  the only real reason that a lot of people enjoyed certain parts of the movie were because of tom hardys performance but even one persons performance cannot carry a movie that is hindered by substandard writing  ill be honest  im very curious to see if they can correct the mistakes made in the first movie with a sequel  you never know  some sequels have ended up being much better than the original film i really wanted this to be good and there are some promising things here i feel if they could get a better script things could work we shall see i think sony had a choice  either copy marvel or jump on the deadpool bandwagon  but by choosing to satisfy both it somehow completely misses the mark  thats an interesting way of looking at it and it makes sense they do seem to be straddling that line which ultimately hurts the movie it would have been better for sony to jump on the deadpool bandwagon  the film would still have been successful and not divided the audience as much  deadpool and logan proved that there is a market for hard rrated marvel movies  that being said considering the weak script that the movie had i seriously doubt that an rrating would have helped  venom reminds me a lot of alien vs predator  an enjoyable romp that ultimately didnt live up to the hype and was sabotaged by a studio that was trying to appeal to everyone  but by doing that it ultimately ended up pissing everyone off  i keep seeing it happen and nobody seems to learn from it 100 agree the rrating not curing the films script woes i dont mind the ratings but im not a fan of writing towards an rrating that said this did looked like an example of a movie that would have benefitted by having more of an edge  certainly agree here  hardys performance would have been far more enjoyable if it hadnt been for the fact that everyone else in the film were going in the completely opposite direction better than some of sonys other spiderman related movies granted that hardy saved it from being below average the sequel could be cool if it has a stronger script and better action i hate to bring up the rating again but while the first movie managed to get away with a pg13 rating the sequel must be rated r  if they plan on bringing carnage into the fray then you cant have it pg13  if youve read the comics carnage and kasidy are two of the most violent villains in comic book history  if you really want carnage you need to be able to let him off the leash  you cant do that with a pg13 rating  again writing is very important but they have to take the character and violence of carnage into consideration  if they screw up carnage you can kiss any more venom movies goodbye
Apr 6 2022,negative, so basically sony went a bit mad and the first result was the 2018 comic book adaptation venom it has taken me a long time to watch it so long in fact that its sequel has already come and gone i am in addition to being a film enthusiast a big comic book fan its been mostly wonderful watching marvel studios and warner bros bring a host of childhood favourites into liveaction cinema of course before setting up their own production studio marvel comics bought its way out of bankruptcy by farming its suite of characters out to the highest hollywood bidder 20th century fox scored the rights to the xmen and the fantastic four new line cinema made good bank on secondstringer blade universal pictures grabbed the incredible hulk and submariner  although they never did wind up making anything out of the latter sony through their subsidiary columbia pictures bought the film rights to spiderman  one of the most popular superheroes there is  and as long as they continue making films with the character they never have to give it back this worked well at first with sam raimi directing three immensely successful films starring tobey maguire in the lead then feeling that the third film didnt wow audiences the way they wanted it to sony rebooted the franchise with andrew garfield in the lead at the same time marvel studios surprised everybody with their box officesmashing interconnected universe of superhero movies rather than make a third film with garfield sony elected to reboot spiderman a second time  only this time the films would be produced by marvel studios on sonys behalf and the character was allowed to also appear in marvels own avengers pictures it was a canny method to cash in on marvels success clearly at least one executive at sony felt particularly canny because of course the rights to spiderman also came with the rights to all manner of supporting and subsidiary characters if spiderman allowed sony to profit from marvels achievements then surely sony could exploit those extra characters for a shared universe of their own of course in practice this is a terrible idea why make a film about a spiderman villain if they have no spiderman to fight it is a bit like watching a princess without a ball to go to or a ping pong match with only one player sony are fixated on the idea of a shared spidervillain universe and have already produced two venoms and a morbius towards that goal kraven the hunter is already in production madame web shoots soon thus far i see no indication that this continuing franchise is sustainable venom made a lot of money it is clear morbius will not i am generally not one to place a bet but if you are i suggest kraven is much more likely to be a morbius than a venom commercially speaking in venom investigative journalist eddie brock tom hardy is infected with an oily black alien symbiote and uses his newfound powers to strike back against a diabolical genius billionaire who is murdering people for scientific research purposes it would be the best superhero released in 1998 were it not released in 2018 two decades out of date in terms of script plot character tone and content it is a bizarrely oldfashioned film tom hardy is actually rather enjoyable as brock and manages to lift the first half of the movie into something broadly entertaining it is in the second half that the film wobbles and then flounders a need to actually drive a plot results in some terribly underwhelming choices and action sequences culminating in my least favourite hollywood tradition the climax where two visual effects punch each other decent supporting actors like michelle williams and riz ahmed get very little to do and seem to run through the motions both are definitely worthy of much better fare than this as is hardy to be honest  but he at least likely scored a bigger pay cheque ruben fleischer directs this first instalment although sadly brings little of the humour that made his zombieland films so delightful theres a line in the opening scene of aaron sorkins failed tv drama studio 60 on the sunset strip that has always resonated with me i goes like this theres always been a struggle between art and commerce and now im telling you art is getting its ass kicked all hollywood blockbusters are commercial exercises but the best ones  even the mediocre ones  make room for the art venom feels like 100 per cent commerce it is there to create a shared universe via blunt force it is there to make a lot of money and it did  grossing more than 800 million in cinemas alone there is no room for art though not in sonys liveaction spiderverse venom blandly wants you to shut up and consume it really is worth pondering whether or not you should im also not a fan of cgi pixel stoushes as the climactic boss battle of a superhero movie particularly when theyre filmed at night to make the sfx easier to render
Mar 11 2022,negative, tom hardy stars as spidermans professionalrivalturnedarchnemesis in venom an antisuperhero movie that neither features new yorks friendly neighborhood arachnidperson nor exists in the same cinematic universe as tom hollands current iteration for the marvel cinematic universe topher grace appeared as venom however briefly and frustratingly in sam raimis second sequel to the tobey maguirestarring spiderman series and fans have been clamoring for a proper deployment of the character ever since hardy gives a spirited alwayswatchable occasionally mumbling performance as eddie brock the reporter who becomes the host to a braineating alien organism the actors commitment to his jekyll and hyde routine is admirable if comically absurd as opposed to the terrifying quality usually associated with the character but not even hardys presence can distract from the scripts tired use of wisecracks bombastic action sequences and a complete disregard for the characteristics that made venom a memorable character in the comics a standalone feature about venom is a desperate move on sonys part although they own the rights to marvels webslinging hero their last three attempts to make a spidey movie that connected with audiencesspiderman 3 2007 the amazing spiderman 2012 the amazing spiderman 2 2014failed quite miserably despite making hundreds of millions at the boxoffice seemingly incapable of making a movie that pleases comic book fans or anyone else sony has since loaned spiderman out to the mcu along with a select few of his associated villains meantime theyve made a desperate attempt to produce a number of spinoff movies in a cartbeforethehorse move reminiscent of universals dark universe that began and ended with the mummy 2017 the studio has given a lofty name to their planned movie continuum the sony universe of marvel characters venom is the first of them and it plays as though some sony executive whos been locked in his office since 2003 finally emerged and dictated the movies banal kitschy tone and cheaplooking cgi the result looks and feels like its from the same era as the punisher 2004 and fantastic four 2005 the traditionally new yorkcentric eddie brock arc has been resituated to san francisco a move explained in a throwaway line about brocks renegade brand of investigative journalism getting him ostracized from the east coast but really its a choice meant to rationalize why spiderman isnt swooping in and saving the day now with some celebrity from his news show the eddie brock report brock lives a comfortable life with his fiancée anne weying michelle williams a highpowered attorney when brock is tasked with interviewing tech mogul carlton drake riz ahmed as part of a puff piece he cant resist asking the tough questions about drakes shady deals and rumors of human experimentation as a result the vindictive drake arranges it so that brock loses his job anne leaves him too as her firm represents drake and they fired her over brocks confrontation and so brock hits rock bottom nevermind that in the comics he was an unhinged lowlife and bully here hes a strangely incongruous mixture of activism and motorcycleriding rebel that feels like an excuse by the manycredited writers to make him a hero at the same time a space shuttle owned by drake crash lands on earth carrying several alien symbiotesgoopy slime creatures that need a host to survive drake hopes to achieve humansymbiote integration to allow people to explore space and in his dastardly elon musk way hes willing to sacrifice a few homeless test subjects to achieve his vision meanwhile a whistleblower jenny slate approaches brock to expose drakes plan and the downonhisluck reporters snooping exposes him to venoma black symbiote that speaks to brock in a monstrous voice and grants him among other advantages super strength and a greasy organic suit with stretchy tendrils drake orders a group of mercenaries to capture brockvenom and a series of chases goonbashing and infrequent headeating ensues its all delivered with a light pg13 quality that robs the venom character of its potential for an alternative kind of superhero movie that splices together sciencefiction and horror director ruben fleischer zombieland concentrates on comic book action first characters second eventually drake finds himself bonded with a symbiote of his own a baddie named riot who intends to bring millions of symbiotes to our planet the battles between venom and riot look like two cgi blobs of gack smashed against each other in an indecipherable mess the climactic showdown has a mindnumbing quality that causes the viewers eyes to gloss over from an overdose of computergenerated nonsense unfortunately the scenes with brock as a human arent much better regardless of how much effort hardy puts into every gesture or exaggerated vocal inflection moreover the character itself is poorly articulated although venom should be augmenting and twisting brocks inner darkness the writers of venom suggest that brocks goodness turns venom into a hero its a dull trajectory for the character and a particularly gutless approach by the studio commanding this intellectual property worse its all capped by a lousy eminem song over the end credits featuring the cornball lyric venom they aint gonna know what hit em venom spends most of its runtime with hardy giving little screentime or development to the characters played by williams ahmed or slate not even brock or venom have more than two dimensions aside from both being losers of their respective species who then become heroes as a result of their newfound partnership given its disregard for the integrity and nature of the comic book property one has to question why this movie exists those unfamiliar with venom probably wont care about the movie anyway while casual spiderman fans the target audience are bound to feel disappointed by its treatmentdoubly so after sony messed up venom once before who was sony trying to appease besides their investors because venom looks and feels like a slapdash attempt to exploit the rights to a sony property in the wake of the mcu the movie apparently exists as a commercial enterprise and not much more at least mcu titles mask their commercialism in their devotion to characters and telling a good story by contrast venom seems like a knockoff or perhaps a throwback to the early2000s era of superhero movies that is best left forgotten
Feb 11 2022,negative, by the time eddie brock tom hardy and his snarky symbiote venom also tom hardy intertwine director ruben fleischers excursion into the spiderman villain er antihero in this edition finally starts to link with what its capable of the latest in well we want in on the marvel money too studio excursions venom a film about the bigteethed gooey black space alien shapeshifter with a taste for tater tots and people crawls around in confusion for about an hour before it really starts to figure out what it wants to be as many have noted the film straps its audience back into a premarvel cinematic universe mode where heroes and villains fought through angst pulp danny elfman scores lagerthanlife performances and altrock soundtracks to entertain audiences the pinnacle example would be sam raimis first two spiderman movies artpop masterpieces of dazzling style and emotion venom feels like a dorky fast food spinoff of the raimi films with mounds of barry sonnenfelds first men in black movie thrown in for good measure how dated does this movie play it shouldve ended in a sum 41 theme song hardy one of or most prolific gifted actors working only gets so much to do before he nearly gets too much to do as the titular character for about 3045 minutes hes walking around with a weird tmz reporter accent until a jaunt into sketchy life foundation run by a sorely misused riz ahmed to do some investigative reporting gets him in contact with the venom symbiote which apparently is not a real word go figure the stretch where everything is established just struggles to take root youre practically begging an alreadyrushed into to go even faster to get to the reason were here from here on the film gets weird and chunky and shamefully fun hardy goes into overdrive to play the body humor of being infected with a talking parasite that can transform him into a manmunching alien monster at the drop of a hat its grand comedy to watch him power through venoms bizarre instincts one moment sees a ghoulish hardy hop into a lobster tank at a fancy restaurant and eat one live in front of flummoxed patrons venoms not really a bad symbiote trust us those come later as the films obvious plot churns on and his and brocks backandforth can be quite charming in a fresh burger from mcdonalds sort of way their banter is corny and contrived but hardys skittish overacting and the creepy venom cgi combine for one of 2018s oddest cinema pleasures everything outside of our antihero lacks bite ahmeds carlton drake a tech guru and business maven who tests the symbiotes that come to earth on unwitting humans needed more pop to sizzle as he is hes just a monologue in a suitandtie michelle williams also gets the shaft as brocks exfiancé who he wrongs earlier in the film shes too talented an actress to make this role completely a stock role but the script tries its darndest fleischer of zombieland fame uses need bluetinted lighting in select action scenes though only an assault in the lobby of a building really meets the typical bar for a superhero brouhaha everything else is just kind of static thats where venom lives and dies in the margin between how goofy and trashy fun it is and how boring its structure stands its too endearing to write off just as its too basic to really make a mark its a film youll connect with just as youll withdraw from it for a movie that was seemingly shot for a certain rating and edited down to meet another thats not a bad spot to be in

Aug 17 2021,neutral,the first half hour of the film feels very rushed as if the director is trying to get all the backstory and all the set up out of the way sucking away all the emotional investment that the viewer is supposed to have
Jul 13 2021,positive, ten years ago if a superhero movie had characters with a passing resemblance to their comicbook counterparts a semiintelligible story and acting that wasnt laughably bad it was considered a pretty good movie  for a comicbook movie that is sony pictures venom arrives in theaters at a time when every comic book movie is expected to either be a faithful blockbuster preamble for the next nothing will ever be the same event or a dramatic nihilistic deconstruction of heroism and the human condition all things considered its not exactly the most welcoming environment for a wacky oddcouple comedy about a headchomping alien and the poor guy whos forced to share a body with it directed by zombieland filmmaker ruben fleischer venom casts hardy as eddie brock a crusading journalist who ends up becoming the reluctant host of a powerful symbiotic alien creature the alien which goes by the name venom gives eddie amazing abilities that make him practically invulnerable but it also has a mean streak and an appetite for human heads among other body parts as eddie struggles to reconcile the cohabitation of his body and the recurring need to convince venom not to take a bite out of the people they encounter the reluctant partners soon find themselves battling a powerful genius trying to harness the aliens power for his own nefarious reasons hardy throws himself into his performance with all of the manic energy he has at his disposal and elevates one scene after another that could have easily devolved into something more campy than comedic with a different actor the mad max fury road and bronson star has always been at his best when theres an underlying current of crazy in his character and venom wisely provides him with more than enough material on that front whether hes fighting the alien for control of his own body or engaged in what appears to be to everyone around him at least a heated violent argument with himself although the film relies heavily on computergenerated elements to bring venom to life the creatures fluidlike composition plays to the strengths of the films digital effects venom has always been a morphing viscous entity that doesnt shy away from sprouting the occasional tendril or shapeshifting into whatever object is needed with the exception of a few wonky scenes that try to blend hardys face with venoms toothy maw the films visual effects team generally finds a good balance between the alien and the organic in what appears on the screen in a supporting role riz ahmed feels similarly invested in his performance as the films diabolically brilliant antagonist but the premise of venom turns the typical herovillain relationship on its head in ways that make it difficult for the storys bad guy to stand out in any other comic book movie a sociopathic scientist experimenting with alienhuman hybrids would be the craziest person in the room but the frantic bipolar nature of hardys hero character makes the most coldblooded villain seem calm and collected in comparison on the down side fourtime academy award nominee michelle williams feels a bit underutilized and out of place in a script that doesnt give her character much to do venom offers a nice reminder that theres still a lot of entertainment to be had in a film that just wants to be crazy fun in the runup to the films release there was no lack of debate regarding the studios decision to tone down the violence to a more familyfriendly pg13 rating to its credit venom doesnt feel stunted or held back by its generalaudience rating though the films relatively bloodless brawls dont appear to be watered down and the aliens affinity for eviscerating bludgeoning and chewing humans doesnt seem conspicuously reined in thats not to suggest that venom couldnt have been improved by adding a few more severed limbs and gory encounters  only that the film doesnt feel like it suffers for the lack of those elements it will be interesting to see whether venom can find its audience in the current comic book movie environment if sony had brought the same film to theaters a decade ago it would have made a fantastic year for comic book movies even better released in 2008 instead of 2018 venom wouldnt have received the critical acclaim the dark knight earned and it wouldnt be the careerredefining project for star tom hardy that iron man was for robert downey jr that year but the darkly comedic crazy niche that venom carves for itself would have been celebrated as another win for the genre the bar has been raised significantly for comicbook movies over the last decade and thats a good thing still venom offers a nice reminder that theres still a lot of entertainment and escapist value to be had in a film that just wants to be crazy fun  and then delivers on that promise its never a bad time to watch an action movie they provide perfect escapism from the stressful daytoday grind they are thrilling exciting and offer highoctane storylines that keep you engaged the entire way through like clockwork a plethora of movies and tv shows are added to and taken away from almost all streaming platforms each month with barbenheimer pulling everyone

Apr 29 2021,negative, when sony released spiderman in 2002 it was hard to deny that they had seemingly pioneered the winning formula for a multiplexslaying superhero movie in the 21st century far from being the perfect package for fans who prefer their antiheroes to literally have a little bit more bite venom is a flawed beast that feels every bit as outdated as it does confused tom hardy is fearless investigative reporter eddie brock who lands himself in hot water after probing reports of sinister experiments at a shadowy corporation owned by carlton drake riz ahmed acting on a tipoff he finds himself alone in drakes facility late at night  and it isnt too long before a series of escalating events end with a mysterious alien parasite taking over his body of the films many faults this depiction of brocks origin story is perhaps the most pressing its crucial to establish his background but its tediously stretched to the point where hardys full transformation comes at the end of the films overwrought first hour marvel fans will also baulk at the absence of spiderman in the origin story  in the canonical version the alien symbiote latched on to spidey as a living costume during the intergalactic secret wars explaining venoms similarity with his image when the transformation finally does happen so too do the films few highlights  a sequence that sees hardy dispatching a group of goons on the streets of san francisco is deliciously dark and effortlessly skews marvels sense of moral responsibility on its head but the fun soon stops as the pressure ramps up hardy finds himself plodding his way through a series of increasingly anonymous fight sequences that lack the engaging thrills of other modern superhero movies as for hardy himself hes a satisfactory fit as a grizzled eddie brock  but hes let down by a script burdened by dated comic book cliches that should be relegated to another era entirely its the same for michelle williams as eddies girlfriend anne weying  shes entirely wasted in a role that lacks empowerment and righteousness  right up to the moment where shes saved by the strangest of interspecies romances still its not an entirely wasted venture hardys relationship with the titular beasts voice inside his head often proves to be unexpectedly funny  there are several zingers that offer a small glimpse of what couldve been venom could have been so much more a real chance for sony to mark the beginning of a darkened alternative universe that was capable of taking on the multiplex slaying might of the mcu as it stands it seems that theres very little for disney to worry about
Mar 1 2021,negative, venom the first film in the brandspankingnew sony marvel universe gives us not one but two tom hardy performances in a dual role the oscar nominee plays eddie brock an investigative reporter with an awshucks accent and the title character an amorphous sentient alien who requires a host usually human to bond with for its survival its kind of an antisuperhero jekyll and hyde situation where ed and venom are a hybrid two beings in one body when we first meet brock hes the host of a popular television show when he is assigned to interview genius inventor carlton drake riz ahmed he goes off script asking some difficult and embarrassing questions his rogue behaviour costs him everything his job his girlfriend michelle williams and his house to get revenge he breaks into drakes facility with an eye toward exposing drakes evil doings instead he ends up merged with the extraterrestrial symbiote venom becoming a toothy creature with a tongue that would make gene simmons envious bestowed with superhuman strength and power he must learn how to manage his not only his new gifts but also his rage the way i see it we can do what we want venom says to his host venoms advertising tagline the world has enough superheroes refers to the titular characters antihero status but could also be a comment on the surplus of comic book characters seen on screens in recent years so is venom one superhero too many maybe depending on your level of fandom comic book heads may complain about the absence of spiderman the symbiotes original host and other deviations from the canon but on the flip side the bodyhorror aspect of venoms metamorphosis coupled with the inherent humour of eddie and venoms interactions are brought to vivid life by hardys commitment structurally for fans venom offers something different from the marvel formula by the time hardy is flailing around in a restaurant lobster tank there will be no mistaking this for anything that came before it casual viewers may not be as interested the first half the origin story gloomily drags on leading up to the eddies transformation then its followed by a series of darkly lit chase scenes as drakes baddies try and stop venom the there are the women in the wonder woman world we live in its a disappointment that williams as eddies girlfriend and jenny slate as a scientist working for drakes life foundation are underwritten acting as placeholders more than actual characters venom has its moments but its hard to tell whether were laughing with or at the movie it feels unintentionally funny as if all the actors except for hardy understood they were acting in a generic comic book movie hes a hoot the movie isnt richard crouse shares a toast with celebrity guests and entertainment pundits every week on ctvs exciting talk show pop lifesaturdays at 830 on ctv newschannel midnight on ctv
Feb 17 2021,neutral, a bad scifi horror thriller thats weakly directed without joy or imagination by ruben fleischer zombieland30 minutes or less and flatly written with a silly plot by the team of kelly marcel jeff pinkner  scott rosenberg who adapt it from pinkner   rosenbergs story its based on the marvel comic created by todd mcfarlane and david michelinie venom was introduced in spiderman comics in 1984 this could be the most inane marvel put on the screen and it also might be the worst acted one despite its talented casta spaceship containing alien specimens crashlands at east malaysia an astronaut chris ohara who is a symbiote escapes alive while the other dead ones are taken to a lab in san francisco for testing by the suspicious conglomerate called life foundation thats run by its crazed wealthy and sociopathic british ceo carlton drake riz ahmedthe motorcycle riding investigative tv reporter eddie brock tom hardy discovers that drake despite his fame and prestige in the science world to be a bad guy a mad scientist one who does harmful experiments in which he makes a lot of money and gets to be a world powerbroker brock gains this intel by using the computer of anne weying michelle williams his blonde prosecutor girlfriend and checks out court documents on the site that indicate drake has been accused of doing illegal human experimentsgetting unwitting volunteers off the street to be guinea pigs for his deadly experimentsforced by his station boss ron cephas jones to interview drake and told to make it a softball interview brock instead comes on hard to drake when they meet in an intro before the tv interview as he confronts him with his misdeeds a vengeful drake cancels the interview and uses his influence to get both eddie and his girlfriend fired thereby anne dumps brock and hooks up with a medical doctor dan lewis reid scott for the next 6 months the blackballed reporter is despondent having lost his girl his apartment and his career in this state he is out of the blue contacted by the guiltridden assistant of drakes dr dora skirth jenny slate the researcher wants brock to collect evidence to put the evil genius out of the science business and in jail before he destroys the earth with his diabolical experiments at first reluctant brock soon accepts the challenge and sneaks into drakes secure fancy facility with her help inside the facility the nice guy people person brock tries to help a homeless lady melora walters he knows from the streets who is a captive but she turns on him when he frees her from the glass cage and he becomes the host for another symbiote in a rage she turns out a parasite cgi created and it looks like a piece of slimy squirmy bluishblack seaweed that merges with him by going up his backside he now becomes a powerful badass venom who is able to change appearances as a monster regenerate himself and become superstrong the gooey creature visuals are the best thing about this misguided filmall drake can think of is to get the missing creature back so he sends his sadistic paramilitary security force team after brock and a fight between them ensues in the comics venom is a villain however the movie keeps him as a good guythe more the story goes on the more absurd it becomesnone of the characters have a personality to give the film a jolt especially the films lead character tom hardy who received praise for his recent films yet doesnt have any appeal to carry this dumb film all the characters are underwritten and the story is told without humor the only funny thing was the films advertising tagline the world has enough superheroes my tagline would be the world has had enough marvel comics put on film to ponder for a lifetime
Dec 7 2020,neutral, hen investigative reporter eddie brock tom hardy is assigned an interview with technology giant carlton drake riz ahmed he picks a fight he cant hope to win instead of inquiring about drakes life foundation space exploration he hounds the science prodigy about unethical pharmaceutical maneuvers which quickly results in brock losing his job and his relationship with fiancee anne weying michelle williams months later distressed scientist dr dora skirth jenny slate approaches brock offering evidence of drakes heinous practices resuscitating the washedup journalists sleuthing savvy to help expose the subversion what he uncovers is far more shocking than anything he could have imagined the life foundations otherworldly excursions have brought back alien parasites with which drake has been conducting human trials before brock can abscond with proof of drakes atrocities hes attacked and infected by one of the lifeforms giving birth to the halfman halfalien mutation known as venom the first act of venom plays out like a zombie movie rife with horror elements that set a specific tone its definitely a different take on superheroes considering that intentional scare tactics are a rare combination for marvels universe of course this entry isnt a traditional marvel entity as sonycolumbia still retains production and distribution control curiously the horror moments soon dissipate replaced by the duality of a buddycop or good copbad cop routine wherein heroism and mischief are continually at odds additionally the comic relief ramps up with slapstickoriented mishaps occurring during host acclimation along with the humor of adapting to venoms ravenous appetite the tension with loveinterest anne and the symbionts gravelly voice which might divide fans steering his newfound pawn at certain points the laughs goes so far that the filmmakers probably should have taken their subjects more seriously as with suicide squad the antihero of this latest venture must also be redeemable few audiences would embrace an unwaveringly evil character as their only guide into the drama and adventure unfortunately it takes awhile before venom shows up in the form that allows for brock to bicker with himself or to unleash havoc on armed goons who strive to retrieve the valuable space alien a good 20 minutes or so are devoted to introductions which couldnt be more generic from the organism sample being valued above human life to the interview of a crooked billionaire to a date night to a montage of the eddie brock report television program to small talk with a front desk guard to a tour of the life foundation facility the dialogue manages not to present any originality it isnt until the phrase fake news is spoken that viewers will note a hint of something out of the ordinary though its a largely incompatible utterance that will likely distract from the fantasy of the scifi happenings a sizable suspension of disbelief is already necessary and those words certainly dont help brock isnt sympathetic at the start which makes it even more challenging to welcome him as the protagonist his egotism and thoughtlessness disguised as a mission of uncovering corruption are exacerbated by a rockbottom downward spiral that finds him unwilling to hold onto the morals he initially claimed to have as these films go it takes very little for him to do an aboutface perhaps because hes the only character designed to fall into that role skirth contacts him to ease her mind about disreputable human testing yet hes in no real position to utilize her information after the horror and comedy disperse the film transitions into an action picture full of flurries of cg tendrils and sludge venoms design is fascinating when the commotion slows down enough to take in the complexity of his shapeshifting capabilities and those same frenetic qualities stifle the effectiveness of the action choreography as well whether its closequarters combat or car chases the frenzied editing only detracts from the stunts a motorcycle chase through san francisco boasts some impressive destruction if nothing else this contributes to the mediocrity of the climax which suffers from the same problems seen in wonder woman when the actionpacked showdown is a computeranimated muddle it only appears as chaos  and not the carefully orchestrated duel that it could have been still the film is a notable effort in giving venom his own theatrical episode proving  to debatable degrees  that he doesnt have to be relegated to a supporting part or as an antagonist for another superhero designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Nov 10 2020,negative, in the end ruben fleischers film will leave you wondering if there was another cut of the film if this was his actual intention and how he will explain this to hardys kid  who reportedly sparked his baneplaying dad to do the film all the questions are valid and troubling because this is clearly not a good movie  by now you should know the story behind this thing that is if you did manage to delete spider man 3 from your mind eddie brock hardy is an overly courageous reporter who goes after the most timely stories much to chagrin of his employers the latest involves a large corporation led by carlton drake riz ahmed who is in everything this week a rich man with too much ambition risking human lives to make a scientific breakthrough  as most comic book flicks do the movie opens with a ship carrying devious things that obviously arent groceries crashes to earth and a deadly parasite that can take human form gets loose i think your mind can take it from there lets just say it effects every character in the film namely eddie fights ensue with lots of uneasy voiceover from the creature who becomes eddies alter ego venom  ill be honest with you and admit this movie may become a parasite that attaches itself to your brain for exactly 112 minutes before letting go and instantly disappearing its a sloppy mess that lost me with the very first sight of the comic character in action and then found me periodically with humor  was the comedy intentional when venom and eddie have a discussion about whether its okay or not to rip a bad guys head off i found myself quite giggly in my chair when eddie watches his exfiance michelle williams turn into a crimefighting venom sister clone mere months after dumping him i also laughed a bit the first question id ask the director was rather he intended to make me laugh so much if that was his goal more power to you  hardy can make most train wrecks watchable hes that good being one of hollywoods greatest actormovie star hybrids who can fill the skin of an outlaw who wears a mask or a cardigan but the only thing he accomplishes here is saving the film from being a catwomandaredevil level abomination its like watching a guy try to deadlift more than he possibly can in a gym but look good in his efforts theres no endgame where hardy can save this film but if you love the guy his squinting and obliviousness to the entire idea of the plot could nurse you through it  williams and ahmed are literally wasted here playing types instead of true organic characters with a purpose they show up and put makeup on but fail to produce an actual performance im just glad john turturro didnt show up like he did in multiple transformers films good on you john  the special effects sequences are amateurish lacking the wow quality of even the second sam raimi spider man film a motorcycle sequence could have ignited the film like a certain car chase did in tom cruises jack reacher but it ends up coming off as a cgiinfused bike ride instead of an exhilarating launch theres way too much cgi in this film making the very concept of a venom film highly debatable  fleischer became somebody with 2009s zombieland but lost a lot of favor with 2013s gangster squad while he nearly achieved brilliance in breathing fresh air into the zombie franchise with the woody harrelson who shows up here for a second actioncomedy he wasted a great cast with the the mickey cohen gangster drama while harboring the ability to ride between great and garbage he appeared to be a nice choice for this sonymarvel joint but in the end fails to leave his mark  the story feels like four separate brains and pair of hands were applied to it lacking any shred of nuance or poignant grace to separate it from the rest of the noisy late summer offerings maybe the writers passed the laptop around trading ideas and finally decided to stop at some point someone could have screamed out mercy in the end id avoid this film its a film without intent and carrying little enjoyment or entertainment factor i thought hardy could no wrong but then we both met venom and things changed  the tag line for the film reads the world has enough superheroes i think the world has enough venom films as well you can stop now 
Oct 28 2020,positive, a pretty random review here but i literally had nothing to do for two hours at the end of sunday and so stuck this film on after seeing it on netflix and going oh yeah i always wanted to see what that was like so what was it like erm it was okay i was originally turned off at the idea of venom without spiderman it seemed like it just wouldnt work but ill at least give them credit in finding a workaround that was good enough what about the rest of the film read on while trying to take down carlton the ceo of life foundation eddie a journalist investigates experiments of human trials unwittingly he gets merged with a symbiotic alien with lethal abilities as i mentioned in the opening paragraph the way they dealt with introducing venom without spiderman was fine basically the symbiotes are taken to earth as specimens and eddie brock tom hardy still a journalist ends up merged with one while investigating around the lab they were kept in while i still think skipping the whole venom fighting spiderman thing and going straight to antihero venom is a shame especially as our only live action depiction of the two fighting was less than stellar it didnt go too badly here there are some good action moments in the middle of the film brock finding out about his venom powers while they protect him from a bunch of thugs trying to assault him in his flat was entertaining and a subsequent motorcycle chase down the streets of san francisco was good bit of fun there was also a big shootout in brocks old news corporation building that was really fun plus one or two scenes of venom chomping peoples head off much to brocks disgust all entertaining way to pass the time even if they wont win any awards for beautifully written drama or anythingand if thats what you expected going in then huh ive seen online criticism about venoms voice for being really cheesy but i mean yeah i found it the funny kind of cheesy though given venom is a product of his times and hard to actually take seriously i think it works as a fan of the spiderman cartoon growing up in 90s i wouldnt want a more serious sounding grounded venom anyway so we all know that with a few exceptions the main problem with marvel and indeed comic book movies in general is the villain is often underdeveloped due to more screen time being devoted to establishing the hero well the same is absolutely true here riz ahmed as unethical genius carlton drake is extremely generic to the point where unethical genius is literally his entire character never straying from it at all towards the end he merges with the symbiote known as riot but that doesnt change his character much beyond wanting to find a new place for the symbiotes to conquer rather than finding a new place for humanity to live either way hes killing innocent humans just one is bit more dramatically bad michelle williams plays anne weyin brocks fiancée who rightfully dumps him when he uses her secret password protected legal documents to try and nail drake in an interview she comes back into the picture when he creepily hangs around outside her house as she and her new boyfriend dan lewis reid scott return home dan is a doctor and helps eddie several times while weyin starts to feel sorry for her old flame as he goes through hell and helps him at several points including becoming shevenom briefly in order to transfer the venom symbiote back to brock when it gets ejected due to soundwaves towards the end of the film the problem is well i didnt really care for either of these support characters theyre both nice especially helping brock when hes clearly a complete knob even prevenom but neither exactly exude anything other than being slightly spoiled rich people with amazing wellpaying jobs thats about it for characters really there is a female scientist who helps brock for a bit and a few recurring thugs but other than that its quite focused on brock and his mental battle with venom venom is a mixed bag it has some fun setpieces and worked around the lack of spiderman quite well but the finale is disappointing and every character who isnt brock is rather dull and onedimensional still it passed twohours reasonably especially given it was just a part of one of my regular streaming services if id paid a bunch of money to see it in the cinema i think the flaws wouldve annoyed me a lot more a middling score it is then
Sep 26 2020,positive, but yeah almost despite itself venom is a pretty entertaining film if youre willing to surrender to its chaotic lunacy and just go with it  so if youre going to try to make venom then why not also toss into the mix an academy awardnominated actor say tom hardy who should be able to handle the characters complexities but who wont be so familiar to american audiences that itll be distracting if it doesnt quite work ruben fleischer zombieland gangster squad directs though if rumors are true that didnt work particularly well for hardy as its said the two had more than a few creative differences along the way if true my gut tells me that hardy was probably right because fleischer does an awful lot wrong here  it all starts off with eddie hardy a laid back investigative reporter who takes his work seriously and who isnt particularly thrilled when his boss tosses anything less on his desk so hes not exactly enthusiastic when assigned to do a profile piece on carlton drake riz ahmed a human hating entrepreneur who prefers finding superior life in the universe rather than dealing with earths weaklings  much to its detriment venom starts off quite a while before eddie and venom are united a union resulting from a rocket carrying a lifeform crashing in malaysia destined to be known as the symbiote for reasons i never quite grasped this lifeform sort of transplants itself inside alternative life beings either killing them or serving up superhuman powers or hey maybe even both  the only real reason to see venom but its a really good reason is for the performance of tom hardy turning in the ultimate buddy performance as both eddie and venom hardy i cant help but believe actually gets this film and gets this character and throws himself at times quite literally into the films dark humor turned pitch black and humor that is so ridiculous that its downright funny if youve allowed yourself to surrender to it all hardy has a better chemistry with himself than with michelle williams his love interest in the film nor do things really click with jenny slate as dr dora skirth a scientist who tips eddie off as to whats going on rather fortunately both williams and slate are tremendously underwritten here and hardy spends most of his time at least in the films latter half in his hilariously offkilter dual roles  there will be some especially purists who will complain passionately about a certain well known absence in the film that i wont spoil here but is likely already known by everyone who is passionate about seeing venom while the complaint is valid from a purists standpoint the truth is that considering the films narrative arc and tone it was a valid choice that works really well  i wasnt expecting to enjoy venom a film that i skipped when critics had their promo screening in favor of catching it when it was convenient to me and with a more authentic audience im glad i did while the haters were vocal the laughs were even louder and it looks like the films scathing reviews wont translate into anything resembling boxoffice poison 
Jul 25 2020,negative,it all feels so constrained by its pg13 rating and with the anarchy appearing so anesthetized its up to hardy to carry the picture to the finish line
Jul 18 2020,negative,venom is basically the mask with a slobbery tongue and none of jim carreys slapstick charm
Jul 17 2020,negative, since the beginning of time we have seen many a comic book movie covering a characters origin story ok maybe its only been in the past ten years worth of the superhero boom but isnt it hard to remember a time before these movies what happens though when you want to show the beginnings of a character but you need to separate it from its source material you get a movie like venom eddie brock tom hardy is a downonhisluck former journalist whos had a rough time over the past six months after he went off script during an interview with carlton drake riz ahmed the elon muskesque head of the life foundation asking him about topics eddie should know nothing about he was fired his girlfriend anne weying michelle williams a lawyer whose firm represents the life foundation also got fired as a result of eddies actions so she dumped him meanwhile a life foundation spacecraft crashes while returning to earth its carrying four samples of organisms of unknown origin called symbiotes three are recovered while the other attaches itself to a human and escapes the recovered symbiotes are taken back to the life foundation for study and experimentation when drake authorizes testing of the symbiotes on humans dr dora skirth jenny slate has an attack of conscious she seeks out eddie to get him to report on the story which could help him also prove everything he accused drake of doing everything that got him fired for saying is true while in the lab gathering the evidence he needs one of the symbiotes the one that calls itself venom gets loose and attaches to eddie heres the good news because of the backlash they received after the first trailer was released the filmmakers went and redubbed every time characters said symbiote correcting the pronunciation andwellumlet me see herethatsyep thats about it venom is an origin story that feels originless some of this is the fault of the filmmakers almost every moment of the movie feels rushed the crash happens in the opening moments we dont spend much time with the characters before the six month time jump we dont spend much time getting to see eddies postbreakup life before hes infected even the action scenes are too rushed moments like the central car chase sequence and the climactic fight happen in such quick frenetic edits that its difficult to tell whats happening if the editors couldve kept just a few more frames before making their cuts maybe the movie wouldve succeeded in being exciting instead everything is simply fastpaced and speeding things up doesnt build the intended tension better in fact it has the exact opposite effect it almost feels like the filmmakers wanted to keep things moving at a fast speed so the audience doesnt have time to notice any flaws yet the biggest flaw is the plot for those of you who dont know venom is a villain that first appeared in the spiderman comics it began as a cool looking new suit spidey got while on another planet but was soon revealed to be a living organism when he finally got rid of it it attached to eddie brock and became venom since sony pictures has loaned spiderman to marvel studios for the time being they had to try to make a spideybased origin film without the spidey connection while i went in with an open mind about this i just couldnt shake the feeling like a piece was missing they make an admirable attempt even incorporating the spaceship crash that the 90s cartoon show came up with because it couldnt tell the story from the books but the end product feels flat another thing to consider is even though venom is a comic book movie and venom a very popular character there are some scenes that could be downright frightening for younger viewers im not here to tell you how to parent im a firm believer that you and only you know what your children can and cannot handle just be aware that some of the parts with symbiotes especially where theyre being used in experiments are pretty intense there is the occasional if not rare moment that shows this franchise has some potential the relationship between eddie and anne is a nice element id like to see expanded upon if this goes to additional movies the backandforth between eddie and venom has brief flashes of fun even making me smile a few times and is also something id like to see more of in the future overall venom feels like something sony made so they could retain control over one of the few aspects of the spiderverse they still owned without spidey to anchor the storyline though it just feels adrift hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites
Jul 5 2020,positive,its worth focusing your attention on tom hardys amazing physical and enthusiastic performance full review in spanish
Jun 30 2020,positive,i cant say i like venom and i cant say i hate venom but i am glad i watched it its a bizarre slice of schlock insanity thats simultaneously the product of outofcontrol interference by the studio and the singular dedication of tom hardy
Jun 23 2020,negative,i suppose one could say that about just about any bad movie but venoms energy and a couple of its performances elevate it above the worst of the worst its also a very bad movie make no mistake
May 20 2020,positive,i didnt hate this movie i had a fun time
Mar 3 2020,positive, not since ghost rider spirit of vengeance 2011 has a marvel comics adaptation centered on such a splendidly weird lead performance tom hardy speaking in a madeup american accent plays a disgraced investigative journalist who becomes the host for an intelligent parasite from outer space before the parasite completely takes over his body turning him into a superpowered killing machine the journalist engages in lots of strange behavior uncontrollably moving his limbs eating live lobsters that doesnt require special effects to look interesting director ruben fleischer zombieland maintains an agreeably cartoonish tone establishing an atmosphere in which hardy can get as nutty as he wants the film devotes way too much time to exposition the first act feels like it goes on for about an hour but once it gets going its decent fun with michelle williams riz ahmed and jenny slate

Nov 19 2019,negative, venom is looking to launch sonys marvel universe an isolated world from the marvel cinematic universe filled with its own interconnected stories and tom hardys eddie brock at the forefront but does the film deliver enough to warrant sequels spinoffs and ensembles at the front of the film is eddies relationship to venom a symbiote from a foreign planet the film certainly takes its time with their introduction establishing eddies rise and fall as a journalist and fiancé first as well as dr carlton drake riz ahmed and his life foundations transparently evil schemes when the humansymbiote relationship does take the screen venom finally gets a bit of excitement and the pacing picks up slowly audiences get to know the character who prospered in his career as an investigative journalist when assigned to an interview with dr drake he is asked to tone down his instincts and allow the piece to be puffy if a bit dishonest knowing eddies history and inability to do so eddies boss asks him anyway prompting the first question of the film from audiences of why he would get such a task to begin with  because of course he goes off the rails with the interview to create the films plot and ultimately house a symbiote still hardy gives the film everything hes got he impressively trots around atlanta streets disguised as san francisco acting like a wild skitzophreniclooking former journalist who has lost everything some scenarios will tee the performance up for mocking such as a sequence seeing him jump into a lobster tank which wasnt intentionally funny but hardy is clearly committed to the part more of the actor as brock and venom could be a good thing in the future if a more compelling or original narrative comes along for him like eddie brocks body under alien control the movie doesnt know if it wants to be gritty funny tough or something else entirely when a random feeling bout of hip hop music takes over the theaters speakers early on it feels as though venom is trying to identify as something else which has worked for other movies but suffers from never committing to a certain tone above all its a poorly conceived script which hurts the film in the end awkwardly nuanced attempts at comedy often clog up scenes which fleischer gave his best efforts to direct despite crowded environments and wild choreography fleischer kept the mayhem easy to follow and brought out the best possible from his stars ultimately fleischer shouldnt be blamed for the stiff moments and simple scenarios which were written into the movie the action sequences are very entertaining often offering a sense of raw terror and grit many push the boundaries for the mpaas pg13 rating as the film also makes full on its quota for colorful language fans of the character will also love to see venoms wild tongue letting loose in clouds of smoke before he takes out a entire swat team however the movie could have only thrived if it came before the incredible hulk  or about five years before the incredible hulk it not only offers vibes of that decade old marvel movie in its cgi fights but also feels a bit creatively dated by comparison to todays super hero epics inevitably venom shows clear plans for sequels and expansions but the studio should take a look at the few bits of venom which worked and scrap the larger portions which didnt if theyre going to continue that said more of tom hardy in this part wouldnt be the worst thing to come of it

Oct 18 2019,negative, with audiences insatiable thirst for superhero movies it was inevitable that the villainous foils would start headlining their own films as well one of the first out of the gate is venom and it tells the origin story of one of spidermans key enemies spidey is nowhere to be found in this film and thats part of the problem other issues mar it more like the wildly uneven tone as well as rushed and choppy editing the final product looks like the result of a lot of lastminute reworking and indeed stories have circulated online for months about efforts to save this from becoming another dud like 2015s fantastic four reboot venom isnt that bad but it is a big disappointment especially when you consider what it could have been  a dark and scary take on the duality of those in the superhero universe early on the film seems set up to be just that like deadpool this one too is built around a snarky cynic in antagonistic tv reporter eddie brock tom hardy hes a selfabsorbed manchild always picking a fight always shirking responsibilities even with his elegant attorneygirlfriend anne michelle williams he doesnt seem to be capable of even feeding her cat let alone following directions from his network boss ron cephas jones despite all that eddiedoes manage to be the champion of the little guy in his reporting especially when he takes oncorrupt business tycoons like carlton drake riz ahmed drake is up to all kinds of skullduggery and eddie will soon discover that the megalomaniac is sending rockets into space in efforts to harvest a parasitic alien that takes over other life forms and infuses them with super powers drakes latest ship crashes upon reentry yet two specimens manage to be salvaged a containment tank holding one symbiote with all its oozing tarlike texture intact is safe as is another hiding inside the body of the sole surviving astronaut back in san francisco drakes scientists start testing the symbiote on homeless people theyve snatched off the streets the other one is traveling towards them by jumping from body to body along the way dr skirth jenny slate one of drakes more noble colleagues hates that patients are being eaten from the inside out by the parasite when their dna doesnt meld with theirs and calls eddie to make him aware of the nefarious goings on soon he breaks into the compound to investigate and before you can say radioactive spider hes infested by the symbiote surprisingly the alien invader takes to eddie even though hes a hardliving shambles of a man just exactly why isnt explained well enough but soon the horrifying parasite stops being so serious and turns comical venom as the symbiote calls himself even starts conversing with eddie in his mind the alien also shares his super powers with eddie to keep him from harm as drakes henchmen come after him when they show up at his apartment to kill him venom uses his morphing skills to help eddie combat them as the fight turns into a chase scene eddie and venom start bickering about whos controlling his body like an old married couple bickering about whos driving the car their banter is amusing at times albeit miles away from the more serious tone of the first act did writers scott rosenberg kelly marcel and jeff pinkner intend the tone to turn so silly or was dialogue between eddie and his new id rewritten to make the movie less dark and mean no matter the confusing tones are confounding to an audience trying to get a handle on it 30 minutes in other inconsistencies plague the proceedings too why doesnt venom just kill the henchmen who come to harm eddie especially when the parasite has shown no problem with slaughtering innocent people for that matter why does venom allow for the ludicrously long and damaging chase happen following the intrusion all venom had to do is have eddie stand still and swat all the villains and their drones that come at him with elongated gooey tentacles for such a vicious villain the ooze quickly turns into a snooze literally and figuratively pulling punches as the movie churns on director rubin fleischer seems to let everything become more and more comedic as eddie and venom practically turn into oscar and felix sparring throughout every moment theyre together logic lapses too as venom exits eddies body for a time and feels comfortable taking over annes body or even that of a yapping dog now everyones dna is an acceptable match even a canines even venoms serpentine tongue and racks of fangs are played for comic effect the symbiote has a lot of teeth but little bite hardy tries to give it his method all but hes often illegible and at times seems to be channeling nick noltea sixtyyearold nick nolte great actors like williams and ahmed are given precious little to do as the film grinds on and williams isnt even given a proper wig to wear even the comic talents of slate and featured player reid scott are never properly exploited here scott is a droll foil as annes rebound boyfriend at least and its nice that venom doesnt kill him thats one of the better surprises in the story fleischer brought us the superb zombieland and the writers have done well before but what shows up onscreen feels like there was too much interference from the powers that be who clearly chopped this one up left and right some transitions dont match a lot of the cgi seems rushed and hardy has gone on record stating that many of the best bits he filmed ended up on the cutting room floor in the end some of the action is fun and some of the dialogue gets laughs but this materialshould have stayed edgy and more serious the narrative could have examined themes of duality and the jekyll  hyde aspects of those who play vigilante but film would rather snicker one scene towards the end finds eddie and venom stopping a thief by biting his head off with the symbiotes ginormous fangs then they walk away like its no big deal committing murder shouldve eaten eddie alive but he laughs it off he smirks at his amorality as if its nothing to marvel at whatsoever jeff york has been writing film criticism online since 2011 his weekly blog the establishing shot is read in 27 countries and he was a film critic for the examiner online for six years covering mainstream cinema as well as horror until the magazine shuttered in 2016 jeff comes from the world of chicago

Aug 29 2019,positive, its well known that superhero films are empowerment fantasies its less well understood that horror films can be too yes jason and freddy and michael myers stalk and terrorize but at the end of each movie some final survivor gets to pick up the axe and kill the monster while the audience cheers more horror movies often encourage you to identify with the monster itself who doesnt get a rush of satisfaction in aliens when the xenomorph devours smug oleaginous paul reiser superhero and horror narratives both imagine beings with great power and its fun to imagine yourself as having great power even if that means wearing embarrassing tights or trailing chunks of gore venom takes the parallels between superhero and horror films and squeezes them into a single gleeful glob of ooze the movie follows investigative reporter eddie brock tom hardy as he discovers that wealthy mad scientist carlton drake riz ahmed has brought gelatinous alien life forms to earth drake is worried that earth is overpopulated and doomed he hopes humans infected by the alien parasites will be able to survive on other planets eddie inevitably gets possessed by an alien named venom giving him you guessed it superpowers and an appetite for biting peoples heads off the movie grinds through its first half and takes far too long to get venom and eddie together but once the monster and man do become one the plot picks up dramatically eddie early in the movie loses his job his fiancé and his selfrespect after failing to expose carlton drake hes depressed and useless living in a rundown apartment next door to a rocker who plays his guitar at earmelting volume in the middle of the night once eddie is possessed by a demonic toothy alien however everything changes he beats up phalanxes of thugs he engages in awesome car chases he even terrorizes his neighbor into turning the music down many of the films funnier moments involve eddie and venoms internal conversations in which they essentially argue about whether theyre in a superhero film or a horror one in a deep guttural voice venom keeps urging eddie to feed on the bad guys eat their heads and pile the bodies in a corner the parasite insists eddie for his part tries to explain to his symbiote that in superhero stories there are good people and bad people and youre not supposed to murder the good people how can you tell them apart venom asks speaking for horror films in which everybody is guilty and everybody is eaten venom ultimately leans much more towards the superhero genre than the horror one the monster eats a few peoples heads but the movie keeps the gore to a minimum venom ultimately leans much more towards the superhero genre than the horror one the monster eats a few peoples heads but the movie keeps the scenes of gore and dismemberment to a minimum venom himself actually has a character arc that feels more like a hero than a demon the alien glop admits that he was a loser on his home planet but inspired by eddies selflessness and general nobility he decides to become a heroic glop and fight for whats right by joining with eddie to try and prevent an alien invasion of earth giving a noble empowerment story to a nightmare demon with a gene simmons tongue is obviously ridiculous but its charming too horror movies are sometimes denigrated as violent fantasies which appeal to viewers worst sadistic impulses but venom suggests a less invidious reading maybe horror films are really just a chance for people to imagine theyre stronger faster and more effective than they really are we dont watch horror films because we are filled with hate and rage we watch them because we all want to be like venom that little ichor that could if venom allows us to see the innocuous side of horror films though it also points to the toothy maw hidden beneath the superhero narratives mask superheroes are generally careful not to kill people  but deep down do they really just want to tear peoples arms off venom has some of the same queasy charge as robert kirkmans marvel zombies comics in which noble characters like captain america are infected with a zombie plague and murder everyone they hold dear spiderman even eats his beloved aunt may with great power comes great appetite after watching venom you half expect superheroics in other films to be accompanied by that distorted monster voice bellowing feed me this is the darker side to the empowerment narrative theres nothing really wrong with dreaming about being able to get far above all your troubles as venom does when he climbs a skyscraper and looks down admiringly on the city below but theres something more insidious about a yearning for dominance control and satiation you can want power to right wrongs or you can want it to revenge yourself on everything and everyone who ever dared to thwart your ambitions superhero stories usually focus on the good impulses but venom suggests the darker ones are there too crawling around inside the desire to be the noble savior and the desire to eat everyone are symbiotic so twined around each others black tendrils that you cant pull them apart venom is an indifferent movie but it deserves some credit for suggesting that inside many heroes lurks a nightmare horror with teeth
Aug 21 2019,negative,this is one hot mess that will enrage marvel fans and confuse newbies
Aug 8 2019,positive, venom admittedly gets off to somewhat of a rickety start but its in these awkward moments that the film lays the groundwork for its unusual overall nature  and very well may lose many viewers in the process flawed investigative journalist eddie brock tom hardy isnt the typical comic book character and centering his conflict on a commitment to exposing hard truths versus remaining loyal to those who love him  in this case fiancée anne weying michelle williams  may be basic this or that marvel storytelling but it feels more fleshed out and shaggier in a good way than the studios usual hero dilemma on a collision course with eddie the crash of a spacecraft carrying important samples controversial testing by the elon musklike carlton drake riz ahmed and the moral conundrums of dr dora skirth jenny slate are developed well enough to propel the story forward and encourage audience investment and the biologygonewild design of the symbiote being tested in the lab is just weird enough to want to see more venom really takes off however when the titular alien pairs with eddie like upgrades ai it speaks to its host and can control his actions  a handy feature when drake dispatches his army to retrieve his missing specimen entertaining fights and chase sequences follow enacted through slick special effects and steady camerawork under the guidance of director ruben fleischer zombieland but its the banter between eddie and the titular visitor that gives the film its distinct personality the funny often random things said by each echo a classic vaudeville duo and allow hardy to display an exciting awkward comedic side rarely seen from the often serious actor the chatter is sure to fall flat for plenty of moviegoers and the sudden appearances of another symbiotes master plan and a crucial decision by venom dont help matters but an epic climactic battle does along with the setup for a sequel with a character more appealing than anyone introduced in an avengers film tag scene charming in its messiness venom joins the ranks of thor ragnarok and the guardians of the galaxy movies as welcome wackos under the marvel banner even though  true to its outsider vibe  its technically a sony product

Jul 17 2019,negative, ever since marvel brought spiderman into the mcu sony has been greenlighting multiple projects starring supporting characters from his corner of the marvel universe creating an umbrella of productions best described as spiderman without spiderman venom the first and sadly most viable of these endeavors may also be its last it is without question one of the worst superhero films in recent memory in a crowded landscape where even the pretty good ones feel worthy of eyerolls  while later stories would see him grow into something of an antihero venom is one of spidermans most iconic villains already having appeared in sam raimis rightfully maligned spiderman 3 but here the character has been reconceived as a quirky protagonist the strange center of a world designed if nothing else in the hopes that no audience members mind will drift to the natural question where the fuck is spiderman so the action moves from new york city to san francisco eddie brock tom hardy instead of being a jock bully is a pathetic but wellintentioned muckraker eddie is engaged to a hot lawyer anne michelle williams and does a secondrate version of his once popular news show where he uncovers corruption in a city that doesnt seem to give a shit about his work elon musktype nutjob carlton drake riz ahmed is obsessed with finding a life for humanity beyond earth so one of his rockets comes back with alien life forms known as symbiotes gross little goo monsters who need host bodies to survive eddie tries to expose drakes shifty practices then drake ruins eddies life then one of drakes aliens possesses eddie and youve got a makeshift superhero origin story in almost every way the films generic structure loosely calls to mind the raimi interpretation of the wall crawler with its mixture of weird humor and horror but it lacks raimis coherent vision and his gift for actual filmmaking its also a movie blatantly written by several different people with conflicting aims because none of the films disparate elements line up to form a coherent whole the dialogue is often terrible the action messy and even the basics of visual storytelling fail from scene to scene it feels like a movie from 2003 not 2018 complete with awkward comic book frames culled from ang lees hulk film  fleischer since zombieland has made nothing but critical and commercial failures yet gets this cushy gig directing a megabudget superhero flick anyway he brings nothing unique to the table and trails the pack of similarly experienced music video helmers turned feature directors karyn kusama was stuck in director jail for ages after aeon flux bombed but given that hes a youngish white dude in hollywood do not expect venoms demonstrably poor filmmaking to deter the industry from lining him up another sweet job in a calendar years time that his movie turned out watchable at all is a major testament to his talented cast each of whom are trying their damnedest with material very much beneath them williams deserves some kind of award for transforming her threadbare love interest role with enough chutzpah to feel like a real character even when that couldnt be further from the truth ahmed as the films villain is miscast but he doesnt let not belonging anywhere near this production stop him from trying his ass off but really its the tom hardy show  for the films doughy first third his decision to make eddie brock so whiny and pathetic is pretty grating but by the time the symbiote comes into play and he gets to play an overthetop alien monster thats equal parts seymour from little shop of horrors and eddie murphys buddy love from the nutty professor its impossible not to be entertained had this movie been a little less toothless and not wasted so much time getting to the absurd magic of tom hardy talking to himself during an otherwise boring motorcycle chase it would at least be guilty pleasure territory hardy through sheer force of will nearly makes the relationship between eddie and the symbiote seem like a fullyfledged buddy film a dynamic heavily teased for a sequel thats unlikely to ever be made  but outside of the odd thrills to be found in his actual portrayal of venom the movie is basically trash a project destined for a home alongside catwoman and elektra in every bad superhero movie listicle to be published until the end of time early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Jul 12 2019,negative, not every adaptation into film needs to be 100 faithful to the source material there have been tons of successful works that have changed combined or left out major narrative elements of stories and characters that audiences lovebut the films work just as well the two main questions one should ask when watching an adapted film is 1 does it capture the essence or spirit of the original story and 2 is it a good movie when it comes to venom directed by ruben fleischer the answers are kinda and no it is not while there are moments that honor the inherently silly xtreme nature of the spiderman antiheros 90s origins far too often it is a boring uninspired piece of cinema that fails to engage or do anything truly entertaining eddie brock tom hardy is an investigative reporter that loses his job and his fiancée anne michelle williams when he decides to look into the nefarious underbelly of billionaire carlton drake riz ahmed months pass and brock finds himself once again investigating drakes shady dealings this time as it relates to fatally exposing homeless subjects to extraterrestrial creatures known as symbiotes when brock and venom one of the symbiotes merge they must work together to survive escape drakes army of cronies and foil the mad corporate titans ultimate evil plan there were a lot of possibilities in telling venommultiple directions that filmmakers could go that would make the movie stand out it could be an ultraviolent antihero story where the protagonist rips through the city inflicting pain to many in gruesome ways but ultimately stopping a greater evil or venom couldve been a superhero tale via a weird cerebral body horror story in which brock and venom fight over control of the body and explore the weird ways they interact to fight off others there are a myriad of other possibilitiesbut instead of something distinct or new that would involve combining various genres fleischer and company deliver a completely bland superhero origin film the action is pedestrian there are no character arcs to speak of the comedy is easy though sometimes winningthere is nothing that truly works well in venom hardy is employing a weird mush mouth new york accent his character is from nyc but the movie takes place in san francisco he is dedicated to acting foolish and out of sorts as he freaks out about the alien parasite bonding with his biology but there isnt a lot for him to do with dialogue or action or really any defining character traits brock goes from a flawed dogooder that occasionally does the wrong thing for the right reasons toa flawed antihero that occasionally does bad stuff in the pursuit of doing good there is no growth no lesson nothing at best theres an awkward but intentionally funny scene where venom makes brock apologize to anne it doesnt pay off in any way and doesnt lead to anything at all but its a feigned attempt at showing some sort of change too much of venom is lethargic and feels lacking any sort of charm or energy there are a few intentionally funny moments that work but there are also just as many unintentionally funny moments that are pretty funny lots of serious glancing and awkward phrasing that provides a glimpse of the ludicrous movie it couldve been ultimately it is a forgettable film that doesnt properly entertain and feels completely unnecessary for those looking for a good movie about a charming but flawed bearded white dude working with a presence in his head to take out scores of bad guys see upgrade and for everyone else its best to avoid getting ensnared in venoms dull web sign up for our 100 free daily grindhouse newsletter youll receive instant access to exclusive insider movie content member only deals first dibs at limited editions and more its the greatest cult movie newsletter in the world
Jul 10 2019,neutral,venom as a cgi creature is brilliant to watch especially when he makes those formidable shields and weapons but these bits and pieces are not enough to keep one interested through the length of the movie
Jun 18 2019,positive, everything is weird and stupid lately so why should movies be any different at this point why not have a movie about a spiderman villain without spiderman in it sure go ahead and let tom hardy do a 112minute audition for benecio del toros secret society of actors who give every character a drunken cartoon voice whats that jenny slate and riz ahmed want to be in it fine but she has to play a ladyscientist whose character name is one letter away from dr skirt and he has to basically be elon musk with actual charisma oh and add in loads of very muddled gay subtext in the relationship between hardy and his cgi costume that is actually a sentient space alien venom is an almost irritatingly fun total catastrophe if you can endure the wretched and boring first hour wherein everyone involved briefly pretends this is a regular movie and not one where hardy will eventually converse with a monster coming out of his butt the last half is a willfully silly spectacle that is oddly satisfying its enough to make you wonder if the whole thing could have been legitimately great if it wasnt for the transparent studio interference and a hobbling pg13 rating frustratingly venom has an incredibly thin plot that was spaghettied into being annoyingly timeconsuming during the editing process eddie brock hardy is a hip cool journalist who is obviously beloved by millennials because he does video reports while wearing johnny depps bracelets carlton drake ahmed is a hip cool billionaire who is attempting to get alien creatures that one of his rockets found to bond with human beings drakes lead scientist dr dora skirth slate is troubled by the fact that drakes experiments are killing tons of homeless volunteer test subjects so she gets brock to investigate of course he accidentally bonds with one of the aliens which gives him crazy powers the alien also talks to him inside his mind often eats peoples heads and turns brock into an 8foottall creature with a 3footlong tongue with the help of his exgirlfriend anne michelle williams and her hilariously patient new boyfriend dan reid scott brock becomes the antihero known as venom please insert franchise dollars to continue if you dont have a good time watching hardy slurmumble in brooklynese as he talks to a gooey alien that emerges from his body thats fair for those of us who prefer captivating oddness the more preposterous director ruben fleischers film gets the more an rrated cut of venom seems kinda fantastic honestly a thousand wacky bodyhorrorromcomsuperhero sendups before one more stale and grounded comic book origin story please venom is a narrative nightmare in which every scene feels rushed and yet by the power of slimy black tentacles possessed dogs and children and hardys fearless lunacy it is a wickedly watchable experience despite a classclown rotten tomatoes grade and conservative projections remember who told you this will be a tongueheavy french kiss at the box office hooray
Jun 3 2019,neutral,a surprisingly generic listless film filled with poorly rendered cgi effects and painfully tineared dialogue
May 21 2019,positive, i walked out of venom with the dopiest smile on my face its slightly disorienting that venom which in its promotional materials leans in heavily too heavily on its darkactionoriented premise is least effective when it works at being a superheroaction movie of course venom is an anomaly despite being based on a marvel comics character venom is not part of the extended marvel cinematic universe from marvel studios that includes last years spiderman homecoming but rather the first in whats expected to be a series of sonyproduced marvelinspired films that include the characters from the spiderman universe except for spiderman who is currently part of the extended marvel comics universe the battle between sony and marvel battling for rights to spiderman is as fascinating as it is confusing buoyed by ambiguous statement from sonys amy pascal and marvel studios kevin feige as to whether or not venom is part of hollands spiderman universe so who exactly needs venom in a superhero world already overwhelmed by the exploits of marvels avengers and dcs justice league what does sony have to contribute to the superhero film genre its that difficulty of placing the purpose of venom in a larger scale that i suspect has had so many scratching their heads trying to identify a point to it all except it is this outlier quality of venom that the film effectively harnesses to deliver a superhero that is perhaps less effective at being a superhero but it is relentlessly rewarding at being something else altogether for venom works best not when measured in the comic book ethos but as a chaotic and bizarre and relentlessly personable shaggy dog of a comedic character study for that dopey smile i mentioned earlier i cant think of another liveaction superhero film that ended on just the right beat to emphasise its casual humour rather than its realworld import venom the film and venom the character depend on the leading man  oscar nominee tom hardy hardy plays eddie brock perhaps the most regular person he has portrayed on screen in at least a decade he is an investigative journalist known for his politically charged pieces and he finds that he cannot keep the personal away from the private when he betrays the trust of his fiancée in an attempt to deliver a hitpiece on the bioengineering mogul carlton drake  brocks entire life is pulled out from under him and at his lowest point  both professionally and personally  the symbiotic lifeform venom enters the picture venom is one of four such lifeforms from space that end up on earth for nefarious reasons and through an unlucky twist of fate eddie brock becomes the unwitting host for one of them whatever you think of venom tom hardys performance is a weird sort of marvel in the context of the film and his career the film depends on him in an aggressive way that is only matched by the sam raimi spiderman films as far as recent superhero films go in my memory even as the machinations of riz ahmeds dr drake take up a great deal of the narrative hardy doesnt appear until ten minutes into the film for example everything subsequently depends on hardy and its either to hardys credit or my incredibly idiosyncratic taste that this is possibly the most ive enjoyed watching him on screen this is not the visceral manliness of his work in the revenant or the seductive elusiveness of his tiny role in tinker tailor soldier spy instead in a mix of fitful irony the increasingly anxious and paranoid eddie brock and then brock as played by venom allow for tom hardy to deliver one of the loosest and most naturalistic performances of his career also reader he is funny its the funniness that caught me off guard for even at his best hardy exudes a quality of seriousness that seems less inherently funny and more amusing after the fact the gruff demeanour of his bane in the dark knight rises for example is cripplingly pseudoserious but has a delightful memeable quality to it that makes it work in retrospect but here hardy is fun funny and incredibly moving in my favourite performance in a comic book film this year certainly the film is less certain of itself and yet im suspicious of the somewhat viscerally negative reaction to it venom is decidedly low stakes on world building but its structural stiltedness seems charming in a strange way as it argues for the value of the homeless and ruminates on our destruction of the world on a global scale that feels idealistic and warm even amidst the body engrossing hosts that seem out of a very 90s horror picture i tend to be charmed by the sincerely frenetic despite myself and venom is very much chaotic and frenetic but tonal symmetry seems pointless in the world the film represents  a world that is destroying itself for no real purpose and even as venom flirts with romance horror and social realism it is its comedy that keeps it most firmly planted in reality theres a plotdefining kiss that occurs late in the film that mixes horror humour and romance in a way that would be difficult to explain without seeing it in theory it is almost aggressively ridiculous and yet if youre willing to suspend your disbelief there is a slightly childlike sincerity to it that becomes irresistible just like the film
May 15 2019,negative, director ruben fleischer summary when eddie brock acquires the powers of a symbiote he will have to release his alterego venom to save his life its been almost twenty years since the 123 punch of blade xmen and spiderman and while those movies are good in their own way the genre has changed a lot in that span of time of course it has because that is the way of things tastes change as does the various forms of cinematic language that are used to construct these films unfortunately it seems that sony and all of the people involved believe that time has stood still and they can keep doing the same things that worked back then today and it really does not work the entire movie feels like a blast from the past in the worst possible way the tone is all over the place with moments that are supposed to be funny and other moments where the audience will break into hysterical laughter even when its really a moment that was supposed to be serious the tonal yoyoing makes it hard to take anything seriously and every moment that is supposed to emotionally resonate falls flat there is a ton of set up at the beginning and it throws the pacing off it makes the first act feel overly long the second act is all over the place and the third feels rushed the movie makes the mistake that the earlier superhero movies did  taking no time to develop the villains there isnt any reason to care about riot his motivations are simply i am a comic book villain 101 while riz ahmed is utterly wasted as carlton drake we see that he has motivations and we understand why he is doing what he is doing but there isnt any moral ambiguity to him he might be talking about doing the best for humanity but we also see him sacrificing people and not even blinking it is a waste of a performance and by the time riot gets involved no one cares and it makes no sense then there is the problem of venom himself he is just not very interesting half of the movie is star tom hardy reacting to a voice that we can barely understand and a bunch of jokes that only work maybe half of the time venom tells eddie to do things like apologize to annie or do anything like character growth at one point venom says that it has changed but its all tell and no show in fact venom literally says i have changed and we are supposed to take it at face value then the is a big emotional moment toward the end that ends up falling completely flat because we havent had enough time with eddie and venom to believe they have any sort of connection the movie once venom gets involved anyway takes place over the course of a day or two much like movies that try to make us believe a romantic relationship that rushes to the finish line this movie does the exact same thing that dynamic between eddie and venom is the backbone of the movie and it is broken venom is a bad movie but it is bad in a way that feels lazy and unfocused rather than rage inducing youll wonder if you watched a movie that came out twenty years ago rather than today and then promptly forget about it a few hours later
May 7 2019,positive,from the comic book nods to the amazing battles and on point cgi  comic fans will love venom a few plot holes  some humor is a miss but overall a super fun movie
May 1 2019,neutral, the road as of late for venom hasnt been the smoothest to travel the trailer failed to live up to the expectations of salivating fans and those hoping it would follow in the footsteps of deadpool and logan by embracing its more adult classification were bitterly disappointed when it was announced the film would be catering to a more general audience so now that its here where does one stand feeling like a product ripped straight from the cinematic scene of 2004 venom is immensely flawed packed full of cheese and occasionally hokey effects and far removed from any of the grandeur achieved within the marvel universebut that doesnt mean it isnt fun after an uninspired turn from topher grace in the much maligned spiderman 3 2007 the character of venom hardly left an impression so its safe to say that an actor of tom hardys ilk feels like a vast casting improvement reimagining venom as more an antihero as opposed to a straight villain director ruben fleischer zombieland and screenwriters jeff pinkner the dark tower scott rosenberg jumanji welcome to the jungle and kelly marcel fifty shades of grey have fun letting the reins loose on the characters more playful nature which in turn allows hardy to completely unhinge and run the performance far from the grounds of reality prior to venom taking front and centre its reporter eddie brock hardy that the film focuses on showcasing his will to break any news story regardless of the consequences his latest target is smarmy carlton drake riz ahmed a millionaire doctor of sorts who is planning space travel and has been involved in a series of mysterious deaths due to his questionable experiments drakes been successful in spinning positive pr for himself but brock isnt buying it and when he learns about wrongful death claims he intends to corner drake in a bid to evoke an admission losing his job and his fiancee michelle williams as a result of the unauthorised interview brocks life begins to spiral out of control but after being approached by a whistleblower working for drake dr dora skirth jenny slate he comes into close contact with a symbiote thats been brewing in drakes laboratory essentially transforming him into an alienlike form who is nearinvincible and has a thirst for eating humans sounds delightful right the dark more violent tone that was expected of the film in its initial stages is evident throughout some of the story beats  namely venoms lust for eating human flesh and drakes relentless experiments on the homeless  and whilst its violent in nature theres next to no actual bloodshed on screen and the eventual jokey tone the film adopts leaves venom to play out like an overthetop creature feature that embraces its sense of humour this isnt masterful storytelling but it would appear the film is aware of itself or id like to believe it is and is enjoying its ridiculous mentality theres a messy 1980s vibe about the film that will undoubtedly irk a lot of devoted comic fans but for the uninitiated and those who have lowered their expectations venom could very well entertain with its nonsensical temperament and surprising comedic tone though far removed from even the more middleground marvel titles iron man 2 and thor the dark world for example venom still holds as passable entertainment value even if for nothing else than being inexplicably fascinating due to its uneven mentality of an r rated story watered down with tweenfriendly shtick hardy is having an absolute ball and the mental unbalance he displays throughout could very well be worth admission alone this wont convert comic book film naysayers nor please the faithful masses but when most productions within the comic realms are taking themselves seriously its difficult to not be a little charmed by a title that seems to just not care about its perception journalist eddie brock is trying to take down carlton drake the notorious and brilliant founder of the life foundation while investigating one of drakes experiments eddies body merges with the alien venom  leaving him with superhuman strength and power twisted dark and fueled by rage venom tries to control the new and dangerous abilities that eddie finds so intoxicating
Apr 28 2019,positive, venom 2018 directed by ruben fleischer screenplay kelly marcel jeff pinkner  scott rosenberg starring tom hardy michelle williams riz ahmed scott haze reid scott jenny slate melora walters woody harrelson  peggy lu  12 father gore is admittedly not a huge fan of comic book movies but a huge comics lover a few of the marvel movies are downright fantastic ex captain america the winter soldier is a favourite whereas some others are just a series of setpieces with cgi designed to usher audiences from one movie to the next on a factory line often its the movies willing to be different even weird which stand out venom is at its worst incredibly messy though at its best its fun slightly horrific and an accidental slice of superhero socialism tom hardys eddie brock is less morally sketchy than in the comics allowing the character and in turn the story to take a definitively moral stance against the slicktalking meeklooking banality of evil that is late capitalism the screenplay takes a dollop of marxism and adds it to societal fears about outer space cramming everything into a strange comic book flick listen if you were looking for a site to either trash this movie or put it up on a pedestal keep looking father son holy gore is a place for critical theory many of the articles here arent ultimately about movies being objectively good or bad this wasnt an amazing movie in a lot of ways though it has exciting things to offer venoms story  the screenplay written by kelly marcel jeff pinkner and scott rosenberg  encompasses our fears of what space exploration could reveal namely were concerned with being top of the universal food chain symbiotes represent the possible terror that venturing into space will irreparably change us on a fundamental level symbolic of human narcissism in believing ourselves galactic apex predators untouchable by all other species the symbiote attaching itself to eddie acts as an element of body horror confronting these anxieties in our postmodern world suddenly whats outside our world becomes a part of it what was alien becomes us because the symbiote cant survive on earth without a human host its essence suggests theres an element of its monstrosity not actually alien to us after all the animalistic violent and uncontrollable aspects of the venom symbiote posit these are innately human aspects buried deep below our seemingly evolved surface several great moments between eddie and venom are shown similar to the relationship between a schizophrenic and the voices speaking to him and theyre hilarious they double as unsettling moments illustrating eddies reluctance to accept this dangerous and volatile part of human nature when the symbiotes are deliberately used for villainous purposes other societal fears emerge  likewise carlton drakes riz ahmed exploitation of the symbiotes is representative of the venn diagram where capitalism and technocracy collide again the postmodern state of a western capitalist society drives our fear drake uses economically disadvantaged people tossed to the wayside of society  namely the homeless  for human trials in the name of scientific breakthrough drake as brock puts it has built an empire on dead bodies hes the embodiment of capitalism at its nastiest core using the lower classes to make capital their blood providing the grease to keep the worlds wheels turning carlton fittingly mentions fake news to eddie before turning around and ruining the journalists life over truthful allegations its not hard to see the drakebrock rivalry as a reflection of the current sociopolitical climate with president dementia in the white house drake is figuratively scarier because hes a technocapitalist  an actual smart man  posing as someone looking to help humanity make scientific advancements when hes only concerned with making money and moulding himself in the image of god in one scene drakes overseeing a test subjects body receiving a symbiote which he hopes will create an entirely new species he sees himself as god only better remarking to a lab tech how humans were made with such poor design eddies body horror struggle with venom is a perfect microcosm of the working class struggle in that the symbiote causes him to become alienated from himself exactly what marx saw as one of the effects of capitalism in the beginning of the movie eddie represents the many casualties mowed down genuinely trying to affect change an unjust world although he becomes alienated from himself hes able to embrace the symbiote  in a sense one of the life corporations means of production  and defeat him  venoms body horror and its outer spacetechnological thrills pull together all the anxieties we face living amongst a postmodern society in which corporations control space travel and its advancements human beings are experimented on in the same cruel way as poor animals are today and every level of societys rotten with corruption in order for eddie to regain any sense of controlpower he must ironically give his mind and body to the symbiote drake as capitalist literally becomes a monster because of his heartless manipulation of other humans whereas eddies able to retain his humanity and coexist with the symbiote this is a fun movie giving in to its darker themes while never losing sight of its foolish excitement either hardys a huge reason why this is so enjoyable if not for his charisma and the obvious fact hes having a blast acting as eddievenom this wouldnt be half as engaging plus there are wonderful if not accidental socialist themes that creep in through a critical engagement with the screenplay others are going to think its crazy such is the subjective journey through cinema everybody takes on their own youll never convince father gore one of the screenwriters isnt a fellow marxist yeah you read it right
Apr 16 2019,negative, most superheroes have a secret identity but venom might be unique in that hes in a constant fight with his secret identity as normal guy eddie brock is taken over by a viscous vicious murder machine from outer space that only he can hear when he accidentally bonds with a very hungry alien symbiote called venom its only the latest blow for brock who lost his fiancée and his job when he stumbled onto the nefarious plans of a silicon valley tech billionaire and the pair make an entertainingly deranged odd couple one highlight involves hardy causing a scene in a restaurant a hilarious moment of slapstick lunacy that deserves to be remembered alongside the blues brothers scarface and other great restaurantbased causingascene scenes but the delirious double act really begins to sing when venoms own personality emerges suggesting the slurping symbiote is more than just a straightforward nasty alien whether dispensing surprisingly sound relationship advice or revealing unexpected motivations for bonding with brock the quirky symbiote has the makings of a genuinely funny foil for its human host who in turn seems content to run a hightech highly illegal lab that anybody can apparently wander in and out of but this isnt the kind of movie where you pick apart the logic  this is the kind of movie where you just roll with the bmovie shenanigans the opening of venom straightup rips off the opening of rampage previously the dumbest movie of the year why would you do that venom did you see the rampage guys around town and they were all sad they made the dumbest movie of the year so you were like hold my beer its no infinity war but venom delivers flashes of saturday night silliness when the unhinged humanalien twohander are onscreen like eddie brock himself the movie is fairly unexciting until the bad guy pops out
Apr 9 2019,neutral,it often feels like the bad ideas are methodically consuming the good ones  not unlike the symbiotes themselves  but if you can stay awake through the dreadful first hour theres definitely some fun to be had
Mar 25 2019,negative, it is such a letdown when you so badly want a badass antihero like deadpool but end up being served a hot mess called venom  you are not sure if this movie is supposed to be a drama horror or comedy and that is one of the reasons venom will not resonate with many people despite having some great talents involved the film lacks any sort of depth to make it memorable it begins with a rocket crashing into the jungles of sibu woo hoo and the paramedics discovering one of the scientists onboard still alive turns out the rocket was carrying some alien lifeforms and one of them has gone missing you kind of expect what happens next and this particular alien parasite thingy starts moving from body to body we are then introduced to eddie brock tom hardy a committed investigative journalist who seems to be enjoying a good career and also a great life with his lawyer girlfriend anne michelle williams given a simple assignment to interview genius inventor and billionaire carlton drake riz ahmed for a public relationstype segment for his channel eddie decides to pose some very hard questions about some controversial experiments that drakes company has been carrying out with no proof to back his claims eddie gets fired and also loses his girlfriend after he not only breaks her trust but gets her fired from her job as well months later a completely downonhisluck eddie is approached by dr skirth jenny slate a scientist who works for clayton appalled by claytons human experiments with the symbiotes aka alien lifeforms which were taken off a rocket she sneaks eddie into the lab but eddie ends up getting infected instead when clayton sends his goons after eddie the symbiote  which has become one with eddie  unleashes havoc the best parts of the film are obviously in the trailer while eddies constant wisecracks not as enjoyable as deadpools during tense scenes are neither funny nor necessary the actors try to do their best with their roles but it is a pity that riz never got to utilise his considerable talents fully there are two postcredit clips one of which shows there are plans for a sequel maybe the studio executives should consider waiting until they see how well or badly this does at the box office
Mar 21 2019,positive,theres a lot of fun to be had if you go in and turn your brain off and go with it
Mar 5 2019,negative, so apparently were now watching comic book movies where the hero bites off peoples heads and its funny and cool because he also eats tater tots okay and the movie totally deserves a pg13 rating since its not terrifying for kids at all or completely disgusting for adults its edgy right like deadpool is edgy so shut up and laugh or whatever septic shock is the only acceptable reaction to venom a pitiless strangely dark dryheave into the perpetuallyexpanding marvel cinematic universe except this is an alternate universe to the actual mcu where lots of spidermans bad guys exist without the hope of spiderman ever appearing because he belongs to another corporation its intellectual property but not very intellectual and the propertys cheap venom  15 stars directed by ruben fleischer written by jeff pinkner scott rosenberg kelly marcel starring tom hardy michelle williams riz ahmed scott haze reid scott running time 112 min   bay area news reporter eddie brock tom hardy becomes unsuspecting host for the titular monster an insecure outerspace parasite with a deep inner voice that looks like black latex phlegm and sounds like a wannabe james earl jones back on my planet i was kind of a loser he huffs guess what youre a loser on earth too venom itd be nice to say that hardy a fine actor is actually given a chance to act but hes basically just a looneytunes punching bag dude is flung through windows rammed against brick walls thrown from a motorcycle in midcollision and forced to slide down the side of the transamerica building pussy laughs his parasite up yours parasite venom is on earth because of ersatz elon musk visionary carlton drake riz ahmed whose life foundation has been combing the galaxy for superior life forms called symbiotes so they can fuse with human beings and turn them into homicidal dicks otherwise capable actor ahmed clearly realizes that his villain character is dead inside so hes cut his losses by going on glassyeyed performance autopilot while screeching launch the drones and find my symbiotenow speaking of symbiotes this movie has more than just venom theres also riot and shevenom and a postcredit tease for somebody named carnage they travel from body to body giving us joyless visions of an old malaysian grandma shuffling away from heaps of corpses and a little blonde girl staggering blithely through airport terminals and highsecurity skyscrapers waithow does the girl not get noticed by anyone oh fuck it who cares multiple oscar nominee michelle williams is in this hot mess too doing her level best with dialogue like oh no i just bit that guys head off her special skills include being brocks exgirlfriend and also the ability to find a volume knob anywhere and deliver intensely loud highfrequency noises the movie ends with a pact to keep up the cannibalismbut only with very bad peopleand also hints at a possible interspecies devils triangle because kids are watching and its a marvel movie oh and woody harrelson is carnage so you can look forward to that stephen garrett is the former film editor of time out new york and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years a rotten tomatoes certified reviewer garrett is also the founder of jump cut a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent foreignlanguage and documentary films
Feb 25 2019,neutral, so i havent done one of these minireview posts since august honestly i have been so busy with both of my podcasts i havent had much room to breathe lately my hallmarkies podcast just keeps growing each week and i am so primed for the massive countdown to christmas season starting in october i have also done some really interesting things on my personal podcast rachels reviews including monthly talking disney podcasts and obscure animation with my friend stanford animated news posts previews and wrap ups with my friend david and various podcasts with another friend conrado talk about false advertising im someone who really enjoyed 47 meters down so i like a silly shark movie but this was just boring and bland with hardly any of the fun moments promised in the trailer it made the fatal mistake of taking itself seriously which made the terrible dialogue stand out because i couldnt laugh it off as silly fun what a disappointment very entertaining film with strong performances especially by adam driver who has to play the racist as a jewish man some of the choices feel selfindulgent and are a bit distracting but overall a really interestingthought provoking and even funny movie lana condor is super charming as the lead character lara jean in this perfectly pleasant teen romance however is it one of the best high school movies ever made as some have said heck no if we think about the truly great high school movies more than just the lead grows and changes the boys in this movie are just there to do ljs bidding someone like josh in clueless had dreams ideas thoughts of his own not so much here that said its perfectly harmless i did not like director masaaki yuasas film lu over the wall from earlier this year it made me nauseated watching it and the cute moments felt very derivative of miyazakis ponyo fortunately i felt the opposite about this film it is completely bonkers so it wont be for everyone but i enjoyed it its basically about a female college student who goes on a giant bender and the crazy things that happen to her along the way the animation is so bright colorful and inventive and the story is random but very fun it even evolves into a musical at one point and you know i love that this movie is pretty terrible the director seemed to have a strange fascination with the lead taking off her shirt and wearing super short skirts and the camera lingered on her in ways that made me uncomfortable shes supposed to be underage for goodness sakes also her friend was the worst he was completely selfish and even claims ownership of her at a point and the screenplay never calls him out on that this deutchthompson family collaboration had moments and id be very interested to see what they do next as i feel there is a lot of potential obviously they all have chemistry unfortunately the script was just too uneven for me to recommend most of the humor falls flat and it didnt go anywhere interesting or charming some people will describe this as a stranger things copycat and they would be right but i think it is a pretty well executed copycat it definitely has nostalgic elements so if that isnt your thing than you wont like it but i enjoyed it the boys all have chemistry and the mystery was fun it definitely gets a little gory by the end but i thought it was a good little horror movie with some genuine scares this movie is about a billion times better than it has any right to be i joked that it is like the revenant for teens but about a nice person kodi smitmcphee is practically a one man show and he is does a fantastic job the cinematography and music are tremendous i really enjoyed it and would watch it again if given the opportunity as a hallmark movie fan youd think i would love a movie like this but i did not the leads are very charming but the script was vulgar and unpleasant from start to finish these kind of movies work because they are light and fluffy entertainment you dont want unending sex jokes and cynicism in a movie like this because i wasnt enjoying the romance the stereotypes were tough to ignore especially a gay character that felt right out of 1995 i will try to find time to write a legit review about this soon but for now this 4th attempt at telling this story is surprisingly decent the chemistry between bradley cooper and lady gaga is fantastic and the singing is amazing for once a modern musical has good singing and great songs all the supporting work particularly sam elliott is tremendous and i was invested despite it being a story ive seen many times not just in the previous iterations but in movies like walk the line still it is proof a formula story isnt necessarily a bad thing if it is executed well and this is this movie was really strange everything from the messaging to the story to the weird musical choices to the bloated voice cast was odd it was kind of interestingly odd but i dont think id ever want to watch it again despite it having some nice animation whoever said this is as bad as catwoman probably hasnt seen catwoman in a long time it definitely is a big mixed bag but not one of the worst superhero movies ever the main problems is all the supplementary characters to venomeddie are lame and its 30 minutes too long so a lot of it drags however there are fun parts with some inventive action and humor that worked for me tom hardy is pretty good and id be open to seeing a sequel where they could iron out the bugs i cant really recommend it but its not awful i think a house with a clock in its walls is the only one of these movies that id wanna see that i havent already venoms definitely not as bad as catwoman  everything about catwoman was awful while venom does have a few good things about it venoms design eddie and the symbiotes interactions but i did find it a disappointment after the later trailers and clips were looking promising
Feb 13 2019,negative,  up until avengers infinity war  in april this year the marvel cinematic universe managed to successfully up the ante with every release then came antman and the wasp  which while exceedingly entertaining couldnt quite whet the excitement infinity war  created the latest comic book character to get a standalone film is venom  a sony release in association with marvel which exists in a separate universe  an antihero with a heart of gold  eddie brock tom hardy is a reporter intent on taking down carlton drake riz ahmed the latter a filthy rich inventor is the founder of the life foundation whos using homeless people to explore the symbiosis of alien organisms and humans in a twist of fate the symbiote from outer space venom enters eddie giving him superpowers   while venom  takes almost the first half of the film to pick up when it does it has its few thrilling moments that said without hardy it would have nothing going for it its the british actors nervous diffident vibe that separates his disposition from the alien within him he alone injects the extremely sparse humour into a tepid and predictable screenplay and its hardys chemistry with the parasite within that supplies most of the entertainment supporting characters remain forgetful right till the credits roll case in point michelle williams as brocks love interest  unfortunately director ruben fleischer fails to maintain a grip on the films tone and flavour  oscillating between dark and bland  often leading to very confusing and incongruent feelings though he deserves a hat tip for the single extremely brilliant fight sequence between hero and villain and their respective symbiotes even the films soundtrack cant rouse audiences to get the adrenaline pumping the otherwise talented riz ahmed as drake the films primary antagonist also fails to impress or in this case intimidate audiences as a villain whos lost the plot on his way to saving the world ahmed ends up flat and unidimensional thats perhaps because writers scott rosenberg jeff pinkner and kelly marcel fell short of succinctly blending together proper character development and an origin story venom  is a treat only because of hardy but try as he might he does very much so the actor cannot shoulder the disappointing film  comments have to be in english and in full sentences they cannot be abusive or personal please abide by our community guidelines  for posting your comments  we have migrated to a new commenting platform if you are already a registered user of the hindu and logged in you may continue to engage with our articles if you do not have an account please register and login to post comments users can access their older comments by logging into their accounts on vuukle
Feb 10 2019,neutral,though tom hardy is game and the friends with venefits shtick is fun and clever the overall story is too messy and cornball for the combination of the two to stick the landing
Feb 7 2019,negative, theres a line in venom about a turd in the wind that seems tailormade for angry critics but to use it in a review would give the screenwriters too much credit it would be easy to blame all the films problems on its troubled production originally envisioned as an rrated answer to the likes of logan and deadpool its clearly been hacked to pieces for the sake of reaching a wider audience plot holes have been widened until a bus could pass through them characters make huge decisions seemingly at random and the few meagre and oddly bloodless action beats would give even michael bay a headache  tom hardy has complained that his favourite 40 minutes ended up on the cuttingroom floor but this one wont be saved by a directors cut the badness goes right down to the bone venom comes from the early2000s school of superhero movies where everyone wore black and the only acceptable facial expressions were scowls everything from the cringeinducing dialogue to the awful eminem single that plays over the credits feels specifically designed to please a particularly unpleasant specimen of teenage boy there are brief manic flashes of what might have been hardy gives an unhinged performance even by his own unique standard and what little amusement there is to be had comes from watching him frown in puzzlement as he performs inhuman stunts hes the only person having any fun riz ahmed wears the defeated look of a promising actor watching his career stall before his eyes while michelle williams and jenny slate can barely disguise their boredom venom is an appalling trainwreck of a film a bad idea executed poorly in an attempt to make a quick buck come back justice league  all is forgiven phil is a copywriter from sheffield with an unhealthy addiction to lotus biscoff cookies and hendersons relish though not at the same time that would be weird when hes not writing he spends his time fruitlessly trying to convince people that the worlds end is the best movie in edgar wrights cornetto trilogy
Jan 31 2019,negative, venom is not a bad movie its just not the movie most people were expecting from the trailers it looked set to be a rather sinister and scary interpretation of the eddie brocksymbiote dichotomy offering a sort of jekyll  hyde dynamic but the final movie turned out to be more of a buddy comedy and thats disappointing the character is one of marvel comics most legendary villains an iconic adversary of spiderman who has kept the webslinger on his toes since the 80s but it wasnt until the symbiote bonded with eddie brock that it truly became the superheros worst nightmare even the moniker given to brocks alterego reflected the venomous tabloid stories he was writing after being fired from the daily globe an incident he blamed on spiderman for years venom tried to kill peter parker both in civilian and superhero form but with spidey out of the picture much of the storylines focused on the duos antihero antics like in venom lethal protector which is what sonys movie is based on sadly in the transition from page to screen the character becomes a hero too quickly leaving out much of the villainous traits that hes famous for which is a shame considering who is playing the role tom hardy has a penchant for peculiar characters and so often weve seen him bring an intensity and nuance to his roles especially those that err on the more machiavellian side of caution it made sense that he was cast as this dual marvel character but he would have done a better job if he was allowed to bring out the darker sides of both eddie and the alien parasite the symbiote feeds off of brocks hatred for spiderman but also the man himself  remember this is a parasite who is simultaneously making the body it attaches to both stronger but weaker too its a terrifying concept but the film doesnt push hard enough to showcase this or the lack of moral code that venom brings to proceedings and even without spiderman as a target the writers could have still focused brocks vengeful murderous attitude on another character like carlton drake or even annes new boyfriend the same problematic interpretation can be seen in the xmen franchise many fans were disappointed and still are with jennifer lawrences portrayal of mystique who is far more antagonist than heroic protagonist in the marvel comics on screen raven pretty much always ends up being the hero  this is fox seemingly trying to cash in on lawrences hunger games popularity  thus retconning her villainous persona established by rebecca romjin in the original trilogy one could argue that lawrence should have been cast as emma frost instead as at least the source material corresponds with a transition from supervillain to superheroine but thats a whole other matter  with venom theres no denying that he has become an antihero on the page and with spiderman out of the picture for sonys cinematic universe right now the lethal protector route was a far easier direction to go in but that hasnt made for a better film if they had amped up the darker cannibalistic side of venom contending with a more tortured and jaded eddie brock making the movie focus on the issues of that relationship  rather than doing the kneejerk end of the world narrative weve seen so many times before  it would have paid a better homage to both classic and contemporary iterations of the character as well as be more convincing sony themselves have come up with some great spiderman villains in willem dafoes green goblin and alfred molinas doc octopus bringing to the screen the human side of these bad guys that have been reflected in the mcu universe too erik killmonger hela and thanos are nuanced villains that are victims of their own background andor warped sense of morality  elsewhere punisher and deadpool are great examples of the superantihero that has been brought to life without sacrificing the violence or moral ambiguity they are known for and theres a reason why logan is considered the best wolverine movie and for some the best marvel one too because it was allowed to showcase the real brutality of the iconic character and he doesnt pull his adamantium punches maybe if sony trusted the audience more to embrace this kind of character they could have empathised with the eddie brockvenom dynamic that comic book fans have for years and its not like we havent seen this type of split personality done well on screen already leigh whannels upgrade is a tense gritty and violent thrill ride that tells the story of a quadriplegic who is taken control of by an ominous computer program after a chip is implanted in his neck then theres m night shyamalans split which showcases james mcavoys 21 distinct personalities seven we meet that scare charm and creep you out in equal measure  both movies show that the lead can be likable but it doesnt mean the film has to end with them on a heroic pedestal they can lose or their bad side survives and the audience is still satisfied with the results as the comic book movie genre expands and studios look to more than just superheroes to lead their output its important that they remember this obviously sony had an angle for where they want venom to go the midcredit scene pretty much confirms that and with rumours they are hoping to have him cross over into spidey territory at some point one can understand the sanitised version they put out but were talking about this film this establishing of an iconic marvel character and it seems too many variables have led to a shallow antihero that doesnt hold up to fox or marvel studios offerings zendaya finds herself in a lovetriangle in sportsdrama challengers from call me by your name director luca guadagnino heres everything we know about it so far
Jan 30 2019,negative, when screen junkies released their honest trailer for avengers infinity war a few months back they described spidermans role in the film as essentially being the boy whod rather hitch a ride into space and die than stay home and be in venom and to be honest they werent far off the truth spidey dodged a massive bullet when it comes to this particular film since despite having a new lease of life thanks to his inclusion in the marvel cinematic universe and the recent into the spiderverse animated flick sony still acts like the desperate studio that wants to launch their own cinematic universe even though they fell flat on their faces last time they attempted this trick with the terrible amazing spiderman duology their pitch this time is having a universe that involves spidermancentric characters but is completely removed and disconnected from spiderman and his world what we have with venom is an origin story that bears no resemblance to his comic book history and mythology thats hugely connected to spiderman  already there youre losing his motivations and why hes called venom in the first place instead venom goes for a completely different origin that involves generic evil corporations and secret experiments that go wrong along with plenty of forced conveniences and plot contrivances along the way to be fair a solo venom movie couldve worked at least a good one but the last thing anybody wanted was a venom movie made by avi arad matt tolmach and amy pascal a venom movie that takes place in a universe where spidey doesnt exist and most of all a venom movie that was essentially made in order to screw over both marvel and their mcu yet that is what we got and sadly this schizophrenic misfire makes spiderman 3 look like citizen kane venom is a cobbledtogether trainwreck that sony constructed as a means to try to catch up with disneymarvels mcu without putting any real time or effort into making it functional or coherent in any way shape or form there is a clashing of tones in this film from one scene to the next with the first 40 minutes or so being this very bland drawnout prologue with long exposition scenes the dearth of drama and dull character moments that dont make that much impact  in the end you dont even care whether or not eddie brock is going to get his job and girlfriend back in fact eddie has no character development in this film at all since he starts the movie as an arsehole and ends as an arsehole making his character completely flat each minute of the prologue feels long and ponderous  with some really bad editing  and once eddie bonds with the alien symbiote and transforms into venom all of a sudden the film becomes this incredibly goofy awkward ridiculous black comedy it goes from being an increasingly boring movie to being a very bizarre and stupid one where we have a wet and sweaty tom hardy puking his guts out making weird sounds eating live lobsters in water tanks at a public restaurant and making out with his symbiote its such a bizarre mixture of tones that venom feels like the perfect successor to the amazing spiderman films almost to the point where you begin to wonder whether or not this was originally intended to be a spinoff to those films apart from tom hardy and his awkward performance michelle williams is sorely underused in a thankless role while riz ahmed is very miscast as the cold ceo businessman that acts like a cardboard cutout baddie with clichéd generic motivations even though the translation of venom in both voice and design on screen is brilliant but its still annoying that he has no white spider symbol the rest of the cgi is very rushed and corny to look at especially during the motorcycle chase sequence its quite hard to see at times particularly during the climactic battle between venom and riot which appears to be nothing more than a cgi splooshfest the action sequences are also a real let down since they are choppily edited and completely bloodless despite the fact there are people getting their heads chewed off and spat out which makes you wonder if the filmmakers involved were trying to make an rrated flick but were constricted to a pg13 by sony its a real shame since director ruben fleischer has made notable movies in the past like the amazing zombieland the middleoftheroad 30 minutes or less and the mediocre gangster squad but this is easily his worst film to date as its everything a movie shouldnt be boring this feels more like a sony cashgrab than a true ruben fleischer film and its pretty shocking that acclaimed screenwriter kelly marcel was involved with rewriting scott rosenberg and jeff pinkers screenplay sure some of the interactions between eddie and venom are nicely played but does that matter when the rest of the film is so lacklustre if you want a great recent spiderman related film from sony then just check out into the spiderverse itll give you more happiness and joy than this will
Jan 29 2019,positive,the venom relationship isnt swoon worthy but its actually a whole lot of fun
Jan 28 2019,negative,jenny slate kudos to you for getting one of those superhero movie paychecks if only this film were worthy of your talent
Jan 28 2019,positive,takes what it has runs with it and bounces around within its parameters to mostly engaging effect
Jan 28 2019,negative, an entertainingly skittish performance by tom hardy keeps  things lively but venom falls short  of the bar raised by other marvel fare thanks to mediocre filmmaking and a  refusal to push the boundaries when it comes to adapting marvels antihero characters  to the big screen a crossroads has emerged either honour the tone of the  character and risk losing a younger demographic or neuter that character in  service of creating a more accessible product venom firmly belongs to the latter venom stars  tom hardy as eddie brock an investigative journalist who is fired from his job  after ruffling the wrong kind of feathers in his attempted expose of bioengineering  ceo carlton drake riz ahmed whose discovery of alien symbiotic lifeforms  leads to illegal human experiments one of the symbiotes  known as venom   infests and bonds with brock as an at first reluctant partnership turns into a  deadly union  it is hardys portrayal of brock which is the films  strength charmingly skittish and even funny at key moments hardy brings a  unique energy to the proceedings propping up what is in many ways a generic  vfx laden superhero movie that could  and should  have utilised that keven  feige marvel entertainment ceo magic just as spiderman homecoming did last year the interplay between hardys brock and his alien symbiote virus  turned alter ego is quite fun yet the films inconsistent tone swaying from  superhero cartoon to oneman buddy comedy along with some truly bad  supporting turns a miscast michelle williams the lowlight results is a truly  farcical example of what this genre of movie can do 
Jan 22 2019,positive,if nothing else its a mostly fun monster movie that proves tom hardy can put on any mask and shine through
Jan 19 2019,neutral,its too much of a stretch to say venom is good but its certainly not terrible and maybe worth seeing for hardy alone
Jan 9 2019,positive,the action is not bad and as rubberstamp superhero films go its adequate
Dec 22 2018,negative, dark of the sun 1968 based on the bestselling novel by wilbur smith dark of the sun appears to have been one of the first films to cash in on the landmark success of the previous years bonnie and clyde in allowing more violence to make it onto the screen this is a startlingly brutal movie with rod taylor and jim brown cast as two mercenaries who agree to rescue a group of civilians trapped deep in the congo by rebel forces while also taking time to locate and retrieve a stash of diamonds taylors bruce curry is only in it for the money while browns ruffo is fighting for his country those under their command include wreid kenneth more a perpetually soused doctor and henlein peter carsten a former nazi whos not above murdering small children much of the action takes place aboard a train although the two most jolting set pieces are set on terra firma a chainsaw battle between curry and henlein and the african rebels capture and slaughter of a group of civilians released in the uk as the mercenaries and filmed in jamaica rather than on the african continent dark of the sun was directed by jack cardiff who helmed a handful of films over a twodecade span but was better known as a cinematographer for over 70 years including an oscar win for black narcissus bluray extras consist of audio commentary by filmmakers larry karazewski ed wood coscripter and josh olson  a history of violence scripter and film buffs brian saur and elric d kane and the theatrical trailer forty guns 1957 may i feel it nuh uh just curious might go off in your face ill take a chance as powerful rancher jessica drummond asks us marshal griff bonell if she may fondle his phallic pistol its clear that the double entendres will continue to fly at a fast and furious pace in writerdirector samuel fullers rowdy western saga the great barbara stanwyck stars as jessica whose status as an arizona territorys most prominent citizen is reinforced by the fact that she has 40 gunslingers constantly at her beck and call barry sullivan no match for stanwyck but managing to hold his own plays griff who rounds up criminals with the assistance of his brothers wes gene barry and chico robert dix his latest assignment requires him to arrest one of the 40 cowboys in jessicas employment although even more dangerous than this desperado is her own hotheaded brother brockie john ericson as well as a sniveling sheriff an excellent dean jagger whos as cowardly as he is corrupt cinemascope productions in the 1950s generally cried out for eyepopping color but fullers offbeat western instead unfolds in blackandwhite lending the film a suitably nittygritty feel that adds extra depth to the unexpected bursts of brutality scattered throughout bluray extras include a new interview with fullers widow christa lang fuller and daughter samantha fuller a 1969 audio interview with fuller and 2013s a fuller life a featurelength documentary directed by samantha fuller in which various filmmakers and actors including william friedkin and mark hamill read passages from samuel fullers memoir the happytime murders 2018 a clever concept  people and puppets living sidebyside  gets off to a roaring start before eventually losing its way in this adultsonly effort directed by brian henson son of the late muppets creator jim henson and a muppet veteran in his own right the plot concerns the stars of the vintage television sitcom the happytime gang being systematically murdered by an unknown assailant phil philips bill barretta a disgraced puppet cop now working as a private eye becomes personally involved with the case meaning that he must again join forces with his former partner connie edwards melissa mccarthy to solve the mystery along the way phil visits a porn shop specializing in such titles as little kitties with big titties gets reacquainted with an old human girlfriend elizabeth banks who costarred on the happytime gang and receives invaluable assistance from his loyal receptionist bubbles maya rudolph this begins as a meaningful message movie as puppets are treated by many humans as secondclass citizens and subject to frequent instances of police brutality unfortunately any interest in social criticism gets chucked out the window as the movie continues with all subtext completely abandoned as the filmmakers become increasingly interested in only offering vulgar gags some are quite funny while others are quite flaccid though theres no telling which gags will work for which viewers for example a restaging of the sharon stone nopanties scene from basic instinct allows audiences a peek at puppet pudenda  if that strikes you as the height of hilarity then knock yourself out horror of dracula 1958 boxers or briefs beer or wine the beatles or elvis and universal or hammer that last query is a particular tugofwar among film aficionados who lean toward either the universal monsters from the 1930s and 1940s or the hammer horror from the 1950s and 1960s personally speaking its universal now and forever  with one major exception universals 1931 dracula is a bona fide classic that benefits from bela lugosis iconic performance and a terrific opening act set in transylvania but the picture creaks badly once the action moves to london for the second half hammers horror of dracula on the other hand is a mesmerizing achievement from start to finish with director terence fisher writer jimmy sangster and stars peter cushing and christopher lee managing to produce a picture even better than the previous years hammer legacy jumpstarter the curse of frankenstein lees dracula is arguably the most sexual bloodsucker ever seen on screen a suave and debonair aristocrat who nevertheless exhibits pure animalistic lust in those moments when the blood hits his nostrils matching him beat for beat is cushing registering as the best professor van helsing cinema has ever gifted us this film further showcases the finest directing of fishers career particularly in the terrific climax known only as dracula in its uk homeland it was renamed horror of dracula in the us to avoid confusion with the lugosi version this was successful enough to spawn eight sequels six of which are already available on bluray including 1972s dracula ad 1972 and 1973s the satanic rites of dracula recently reviewed here and here the jerk 1979 steve martin was already known for his grammy awardwinning comedy albums and his guesthosting stints on saturday night live when he elected to cowrite and star in the jerk a sizable hit that became one of the top 10 grossing movies of 1979 just above the james bond adventure moonraker and the muppet movie the latter featuring martin in a cameo appearance in viewing stupidity as an endless source of comic invention the jerk seems to be the missing link between the jerry lewis comedies of the 1960s some of which were hilarious some of which were anything but and the dumbanddumber comedies of the 1990s nearly all of which were awful including the stupids jury duty and yes dumb and dumber basically a series of skits that are barely tethered to a plot this works better than expected thanks primarily to martins infectious performance in the central role of navin johnson because he was raised since infancy by a black farm family navin is shocked when hes finally told that he is in fact white electing to head out into the world for the first time he decides to journey to st louis whereupon he lands a job at a gas station run by the kindly mr hartounian jackie mason becomes the boy toy of a tough biker woman catlin adams and falls in love with the sweet if simple marie bernadette peters middling stretches are easily bailed out by bits that remain comic gold among them the phonebook scene the cameo by director carl reiner who would make three more pictures with martin the snail sequence and shithead the dog peppermint 2018 lets take a moment to shed a tear for jennifer garner a terrific actress who has received too few breaks from hollywood sensational on tvs alias her film career since then has been a spotty one as the highlights a delightful turn in 13 going on 30 a strong performance in juno that should have earned her a bushel of award nominations are often forgotten in the wake of so many box office duds andor standard mom roles if nothing else peppermint at least allows her to flex her muscles  both the internal and external ones  in a leading role its just too bad the film itself is nothing more than a formulaic death wish knockoff pierre morel whose helming of taken resulted in a satisfying action flick packed with kinetic sequences isnt able to muster the same degree of excitement with this yarn in which happy wife and mother riley north survives a shooting that leaves her husband and daughter dead learning that this wasnt some random driveby shooting riley removes herself from the map and spends five years honing her body and her mind  when she returns shes ready to exact bloody revenge on everyone involved with her family tragedy from the corrupt judge to the oily lawyers to the drug lord juan pablo raba who initially ordered the execution revenge flicks often offer some measure of catharsis but the plotting here is so generic and the twist involving the identity of a duplicitous character so obvious that its hard to generate enthusiasm for anything aside from garners committed performance the predator 2018 the predator is the latest failed attempt to again jumpstart a franchise that has been on life support since the 1987 original that nifty action flick found arnold schwarzenegger squaring off against an imposing extraterrestrial hunter who thanks to oscarnominated visual effects was able to shimmer in and out of sight at will shane black who appeared in a supporting role in the original here takes on scripting and helming duties but the result is ultimately a disappointment black is known for his heman casts and quipheavy dialogue and both are on full display in this film which finds army ranger sniper quinn mckenna boyd holbrook squaring off against more than one predator with the help of his autistic son jacob tremblay a courageous scientist olivia munn who got the call to study these predators because im sure i heard this right she once wrote the us president when she was a little girl and told him she wanted to meet aliens and a group of exarmy inmates who seem to have escaped from a dinner theater production of one flew over the cuckoos nest this motley crew of ptsd soldiers is meant to represent the heart of the picture but their juvenile antics and moldy humor lots of your momma jokes grow tiresome far more engaging is sterling k brown whos cast as the primary human villain and seems to relish playing such a transparently odious character a talented cast and some exciting interludes during the first half compensate for the rampant idiocy but enough is enough alas the ending hints at a sequel but unless they come up with a new angle whats the point alien vs predator didnt quite do it in the past  might i suggest smurf vs predator as an innovative way to goose the proceedings a simple favor 2018 far from a cookiecutter comedy that rolled straight off the hollywood assembly line a simple favor is basically gone girl if it had been played for laughs instead of thrills yet even that description doesnt hint at the murky depths occasionally found in an invigorating effort that doesnt quite maintain its highwire act yet deftly avoids a fall and a splat anna kendrick stars as stephanie smothers a widowed single mom who operates a cooking vlog her online videos already maintain a solid following but they become even more popular once she uses it to relate the sordid tale of how her newly acquired best friend the confidant and nononsense emily nelson blake lively suddenly goes missing emilys husband sean henry golding claims not to know the whereabouts of his wife a stance also taken by her boss fashion designer dennis nylon a funny rupert friend concerned about emily stephanie opts to do a little sleuthing on her own  an unwise decision since it brings such unpleasantries as incest adultery and murder floating to the surface directed by hitmaker paul feig bridesmaids spy and written by jessica sharzer working from darcey bells novel a simple favor is outstanding for about an hour thanks to its unexpectedly dark themes its mordant humor and a knockout performance by lively but if the first half is mostly about the characters the second part is chiefly about the mystery and the movie isnt quite as compelling as it works through its convoluted plot some of which relies on happenstance and employs dramatic devices that were already growing hoary back in the 1940s still as a robust way for home viewers to close out the year a simple favor gets the job done texas chainsaw massacre the next generation 1994 filmed in 1994 the third sequel to the excellent 1974 horror classic the texas chain saw massacre scarcely saw release in 1995 under the title the return of the texas chainsaw massacre before it was yanked but in 1996 two of its heretofore unknown players became big stars renée zellweger with jerry maguire and matthew mcconaughey with a time to kill to capitalize on their success plans were set for a major 1997 rerelease under the moniker texas chainsaw massacre the next generation but the studio cowardly pulled the plug once the stars particularly mcconaughey began using their newfound clout to squash the film in its tracks barely seen in 97 the film has since emerged as a minor cult item and has turned up in various editions along the way admittedly this is a remarkable amount of backstory for a movie that lets face it remains pretty lousy zellweger is the virginal lead who gets stranded with her destinedtodie prom night pals out in the middle of nowhere while mcconaughey plays the murderous redneck vilmer slaughter whose family includes the crossdressing leatherface robert jacks the film manages to pin the kennedy assassination on this clan so obviously anything goes as far as the script is concerned zellweger acquits herself rather well although mcconaugheys eyerolling overthetop performance is a matter of personal taste shout factorys new collectors edition bluray offers both the rrated theatrical cut and an unrated directors cut that runs an additional seven minutes extras include audio commentary on the directors cut by writerdirector kim henkel new interviews with costar tyler cone director of photography levie isaacks and special effects creator jm logan and the theatrical trailer venom 2018 this weeks theatrical release of aquaman serves as a reminder that wonder woman aside dc still has trouble producing quality pictures postnolan and continues to be beaten by marvel on a regular basis but this months homevideo release of venom serves as a reminder that not even marvel is immune from the occasional dog despite its massive box office venom is one of the lamest superhero sagas to venture down the pike in quite some time with tom hardy valiantly carrying on the good fight but getting walloped at every turn hardy pretty much apes 90sera jim carrey as he stars as eddie brock a selfstyled investigative reporter whose career is destroyed after he goes after carlton drake riz ahmed the slimy ceo of a bioengineering company a downandout brock later breaks into drakes hq looking for evidence of his crimes against humanity instead his body gets coopted by an alien entity who enjoys making wisecracks and biting off peoples heads venom attempts to break away from the more formal plotting that drives most marvel movies opting instead to offer a rollicking approach that hews closer to the likes of the deadpool and guardians of the galaxy efforts unfortunately director ruben fleischer and his trio of scripters have assembled a clumsy and chaotic work thats stridently stupid and eternally annoying michelle williams is wasted as drakes exgirlfriend and even the obligatory cameo by stan lee rip packs little punch bluray extras include venom mode aka a trivia track a behindthescenes featurette deleted and extended scenes a piece on venom and his comicbook and bigscreen histories a look at the stunt work a short peek at the easter eggs hidden in the movie and the music video to eminems venom
Dec 22 2018,negative, as far as marvel superhero movies go venom ranks as one of the worst this watered down bore is dumb loud and brash with nothing to say the film suffers from an identity crisis with so many jarring shifts in tone that i struggled to stay engaged with the character and story investigative journalist eddie brock tom hardy is seeking out his next big story when he accidentally becomes the host of an alien symbiote that gives him a violent super alterego called venom eddie becomes the ultimate antihero as he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from an evil bioengineering corporation a character like venom is crying out for the deadpool treatment it quickly becomes clear that the studio was too afraid to go allout and make an rrated villain movie although making this film for adults wouldve greatly helped there are feeble attempts at comedy that just arent funny i can think of just two scenes that barely made me chuckle even worse are the lame action scenes and cheesy cgi director ruben fleischer takes the worst parts of michael bays style with lots of shaky jump cuts and fiery explosions and slaps em all together for lazy sequences like an animated motorcycle versus drone chase through downtown san francisco in a bigbudget marvel superhero movie i shouldnt be bored senseless during the action scenes yet here i was disinterested and disengaged every single time hardy is likeable enough as eddie but his nemesis carlton drake riz ahmed and lawyer girlfriend anne michelle williams add little to the plot or in terms of onscreen charisma i wouldnt go so far as to say the film was miscast but nothing really clicks between any of the performers hardcore fans of the comics may enjoy venom more than an average moviegoer but the film is ultimately too weird and confusing with an ending thats just stupid good review kind of agree with you about this movie while i love tom hardy and he literally does carry the film on his performance but it wasnt exactly the best superhero movie personally i think it didnt live up to its own hype im definitely with the minority on this one  i cant make a case for it being a great or even good movie but i had a lot of fun watching it
Dec 15 2018,positive,it succeeds as a piece of entertainment despite the foundational lunacy upon which it was built
Dec 13 2018,negative, venom is a spiderman spinoff movie without a hint of spiderman a cynic may see this as a studio finding ways to make money off the back of their most popular characters success yet in some ways this spinoff movie is more faithful to how comic books work than how marvel manages their films comic books rely on serialized melodrama where major plots carry on for months or even years and part of the fun is knowing your favourite heroes and villains may show up in any random issue marvel excels at bringing these aspects of the medium to the big screen but by doing so marvel isnt tapping into a large chunk of the genres storytelling potential tom hardy plays eddie brock an investigative reporter who is all about uncovering the truth his boss assigns him an interview with carlton drake riz ahmed a steve jobslike businessman whose work crosses ethical lines though his boss wants a puff piece eddie cant resist sticking it to drake so he steals confidential information from his fiancé anne michelle williams and uses it to expose the evil genius the interview goes badly and his betrayed fiancé dumps him leaving eddie a sad broken and lonely man eddies life takes a turn when he encounters an evil alien life form brought to earth by drake its a gross little pile of black goop that looks like what would happen if a dozen coal miners sneezed into a jar but looks are deceiving this powerful alien came to earth with sinister motives to unlock its full range of abilities it must join with a human in a symbiotic state and as fate would have it eddie is a perfect biological fit together the duo becomes venom a hulking nightmare creature that looks as though tim burton dreamed up spiderman the alien wants to eat people and reign chaos but eddies influence makes it want to be a better man thing despite their clashing personalities theyre on the same page about two things taking down drake and preventing an alien invasion you wont find a blockbuster movie as unusual as venom anytime soon its dark violent and has tone and pacing issues coming out its symbiotic wazoo but at its heart venom is still an action movie so its disappointing that its action set pieces are a mixed bag theres a fun chase sequence midway through the picture where eddie and venom get familiar with each other as men with guns chase them through the winding san francisco streets eddie goes on autopilot while venom takes over venom uses his powers firing out long gooey tendrils in creative ways ripping a car door off its hinge and using it as a shield using a tendril as a grappling hook and making an impossible turn while theres an overreliance on shoddy cgi some impressive practical effects  explosions and flipped cars  help create a genuinely thrilling sequence this alltoobrief chase is venom at its best much of the film though is straightup bad and falls back on lazy comic book movie tropes its heavy reliance on cgi spectacle is the worst offence the cgi action beats arent dynamically choreographed or wellshot and they feel like watching a sardonic version of loony toons  i halfexpected venom to reshape a tendril into an anvil and drop it on some poor assholes head the symbiote versus symbiote fights are real eyesores between the shoddy effects and poorly lit scenes you cant make out whats going on it feels like watching the first couple transformers films where autobot versus decepticon battles turned into metallic cyclones of metal sparks and tire treads when the movie ended my memories mushed together into an indistinguishable hodgepodge the movie is so tonally and thematically inconsistent its hard to know for sure what hes trying to do venom feels like several competing films  a jekyll and hyde story an odd couple movie a broad comedy  stitched together into one incoherent mess eddie brock is one of the most passive protagonists youll find he spends the movie running away or getting dragged along with no sense of agency until the final act when the film pivots and discovers its heroes purposes venom doesnt show up until 40minutes in and its longer still before fleischer hints at what this movie wants to say at its beating black heart venom is about eddie and his parasite merging together and accepting each other and at the end of the film they figure out how to live in harmony the problem here is that the story doesnt provide examples of how this unlikely pairing reach their blissful bromance venom begins as a terrifying presence invading eddies mind and remains so until he starts cracking wise  his wit and comedic timing are as sharp as his rows of jagged teeth not only does this alien menace have jokes but hes also hellbent on winning back eddies former lady why you say who cares its funny when his booming voice chimes in with snarky oneliners this film never finds its groove until it goes all in on the duos batshit crazy repartee sadly this doesnt happen until the tailend of the movie seeing them both on the same page is a blast even though these moments dont feel earned venom features a cast so talented that a director would have to go out of their way to waste them and yet thats exactly what we have here hardy is the only standout and its obvious why he signed on to the project if you think he went too overthetop with bane you aint seen nothing yet at his most subtle eddie speaks like a new jersey plumber with a coke habit at other times you would swear hes channelling al pacino circa heat i understand his intentions but he feels out of step with most of a film featuring talking alien goop talented actors like michelle williams riz ahmed and jenny slate have zilch to do williams plays the thankless concerned loveinterest role which is well below her pay grade slate still exudes charm as a lab nerd who stands out for her dope glasses and not her personality and ahmed plays the type of bland nonthreatening and forgettable villain reserved for old white guys in marvel movies i would rather watch a director go for a creative long shot and fail than sit through another bythenumbers origin story venom feels like an artistic gamble but still comes across as generic nonsense its dark but not too dark weird but restrained wellcast but lacks personality venom had the potential to invigorate the genre much like how its fellow antihero deadpool did in 2016 instead were left with something closer to a train wreck although i didnt enjoy venom i remain perhaps masochistically enthusiastic about what the series does next all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not my mother a hole in the ground and men in this unboxing video jason gorber checks out the joni mitchell archives volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release
Dec 10 2018,negative,well sorry to break it to you but venom is one massive missed opportunity
Dec 7 2018,neutral, its been over a year now since spiderman homecoming gave our favorite webslinger his own solo movie in the marvel cinematic universe after debuting in 2016s captain america civil war that movie while the third version of the character since his bigscreen debut in 2002 was a commercial and critical success giving a fun youthful spin on peter parker where other films seemed to be in a hurry towards adulthood and not dwelling on the high school experience it was this uniqueness that made the announcement of venom particularly odd to process eddie brock and his hulking symbiote counterpart was birthed on the pages of spiderman comics and his ties to spidey go far deeper than just having a large white spider on his chest his appearance motivations and overall purpose are intrinsically tied to spiderman so here we have a film that is created in association with marvel and spoileralert not featuring tom holland as peter parker or even mentioning him ties to anything in the overall mythos are scant but there are some so obviously there are some liberties taken with the character but overall with a lead actor like tom hardy front and center and bigbudget specialeffects it all works out right well partly in the film we focus on eddie brock hardy a docujournalist ala vice that has much going for him in san francisco engaged to a beautiful lawyer anne  weying played by michelle williams all is well until eddie makes a choice with some sensitive information surrounding life foundation and their ceo carlton drake riz ahmed this shakes things up for eddie from the top down months later he is wrapped back up investigating life foundation but he brings more than just a story from it he is infected with an alien parasite a symbiote that comes to call itself venom imbuing eddie with  incredible powers and abilities we see him try to come to grips with a foreign presence inside his mind controlling and manipulating him almost like a marionette we spend the rest of the film following eddies struggle and quest to deal with the problems brought about by the symbiote organisms on earth with the casting of tom hardy i knew a few things would result most obviously the physique of eddie brock would be convincingly portrayed as it should be sorry topher grace in addition i knew that the performance could wind up being a lot of things but it would definitely be attempting something unique we get that here definitely while not entirely likable brocks problems with becoming venom create something different than we are used to seeing and boy is it different taking what the comic page shows as duality and really running with it we get a frantic muttering performance that displays full commitment for sure but it isnt without missteps the verbal interplay and spats between eddie and venom provides some of the films highlight moments but when you slow down and start to think about why venom would say or behave the way he does over the film things dont always add up the missteps i mentioned in the performance we get come mainly from the writing i would say tom mostly chews through it like his character does through anyone that gets in his way but there were plenty of moments where the dialogue and character motivation left me like what its hard to imagine who came up with what in relation to the strangeness of it all but i have to imagine hardy pushed for the weird and boy do we get some here the supporting cast does their job but they dont get near as much material to work with as hardy indie darling michelle williams is finally coming into more mainstream material after the success of the greatest showman but i really wasnt wowed by too much here as she and tom exhibited little to no onscreen chemistry jenny slate  reid scott both known primarily for their comedy work do great playing it straight as their characters here but neither are given enough to do to elevate the rest of the film riz ahmed is very capable as an actor but the godcomplex speeches he has to deliver here as carlton drake feel oddly dated and outoftouch for a film in 2018 the film doesnt waste much time in showing him to be a guy with nefarious means in play great villains have understandable and nuanced motivations but none of that really comes together here what really does shine here beyond the erratic work of hardy is the special effects my biggest takeaway from the film is that venom even in the crazy ways he is realized on the pages of comics can be effectively translated to live action paradoxically massive yet lithe in his movements savage in his exercises of strength and horror and completely strange and horrifying to witness the characters realization onscreen is quite an achievement for all of the special effects studios involved here its not all perfect but it is all effective venom was realized onscreen before in sam raimis spiderman 3 but its best we forget about how all that turned out again sorry topher strangely in that film the effect of venom worked best when the suit was removed from the host as shown above but in this film the symbiote works on the host off and wherever else in transition its as if the effects team scavenged every nerdy 90s kids trapper keeper and realized what we all were trying to draw when we should have been listening to our teacher alluding to the 90s feels key here because while the film implies at least to me some interesting parallels with addiction and its effects on lives it never fully sticks that it seems to be shooting for this results in there being not much that is very deep going on with the film beyond a story that doesnt have that much motivation going for it prior to the successes of the marvel cinematic universe and even the masterclass that is christopher nolans dark knight trilogy it was enough for a comic book movie to just look right even if it didnt have really anything interesting to say one could argue that the mcu films arent saying a whole lot either and i could see their point still a main strength of those films is a dedication to tone and feel even as that tone may change between marvel properties this film doesnt do too well here as it goes all over the place with tone the direction of ruben fleischer zombieland amplifies all the horror beats effectively which is largely where it should have stayed but the film mixes in strange comedy liberally by way of some truly weird dialogue i was a fan of the humor that naturally came from watching the physicality that tom hardy brought to it all but that dialogue though a turd in the windyeah it gets ugly with regards to content i did feel the film would have been better suited as an rrated affair everything attempted here winds up feeling stunted by the pg13 limitations with no demonstrable links to the mcu spiderman here why wasnt this film even edgier that said with what we do get in terms of language violence both implied and shown implied sex and just overall darkness this really isnt a film to take the kids to if anything i see them more likely leaving terrified rather than mesmerized as i said earlier there are speeches revolving around god and biblical characters like abraham and isaac are erroneously discussed think of these mentions as prompts to discuss with friends what the bible really shows and there is some utility there listening to how the film portrays the god of the bible on its own word will only disappoint sincere believers showing the effects of a man possessed by something other than himself can be a parallel to understanding sin and addiction but again these can be things one lifts out and discusses on their own rather than seeing them correctly stated by the film all in all i liked parts of the film but it is definitely one of the strangest bigbudget films ive ever watched my inner child reveled in seeing the venom of the page brought to life but stripping away spiderman from it all left it hollow to me i respect tom hardy for his performance and inevitably i think there could be more coming especially if that endcredits scene is any primer and i hope to see him develop things that said sony tie in spiderman directly asap because those ties make venom interesting with what we get here everything winds up forgettable in many ways and thats a shame tom hardy brought the goods now we just have to have some reasons to care because this films plot pacing and inconsistent tone wasnt compelling enough on its own the above image says it all come to enjoy tom hardy acting crazy and some slick visuals other than that its likely youll be disappointed on some level
Dec 7 2018,negative,the entire endeavor has a bitter aftertaste that frequently overwhelms the sensibility of mad spectacle that fleischer and his performers strive to tease from the material
Dec 6 2018,negative,its not a good movie but considering the box office numbers it wont be long until we see the sequel that this movie hamfistedly foreshadowed
Nov 27 2018,negative,venom is fun but it is not good fun if you understand
Nov 19 2018,neutral,feels like a comic book adaptation that was scripted in the late 1990s filmed in the mid2000s and given a cgi facelift in the last couple of years but not a good one
Nov 17 2018,negative,a movie that pushes any intellectual connotation warrants much more careful and precise technical values halfway through this film and i was ready to pop an ibuprofen

Nov 6 2018,negative,if youre not going to do right by these characters go give marvel them back why are you still trying to make all this money if youre not doing right by the fans
Nov 5 2018,negative, watching the talented actors latest film its easy to tell that no one on screen cares more about their performance or has thought about their character more than hardy everything about his work is nuanced with immense planning given to the affectation of each line the physicality involved and the jekyll and hyde quality his work espouses but stuck in a superhero movie not produced by marvel studios hardy feels like hes running in quicksand with venom a spiderman spinoff that cant or wont reference spiderman hardy stars as eddie brock an investigative video journalist who learns of experiments combining the homeless of san francisco with alien symbiotes when eddie is exposed he begins an unlikely alliance with his symbiote venom in a struggle of good versus evil from the outset its clear that hardy is working the layers of eddie and venom who he also voices in internal conflict as some sort of mashup of superhero origin story and literary commentary each part of the characters are distinct and unique and hardy does an impressive job blurring the lines between normality and insanity his reluctant charm carries the day especially opposite michelle williams who doesnt seem all that interested in participating in the film though williams is intended to be hardys fiancee they have the chemistry of mild acquaintances hardys banter with his venom alterego resonates ten times as much riz ahmed has been much more impressive as a villain than he is here as the rather bland carlton drake and a talented jenny slate is largely wasted with a small nothing part as one of drakes scientists that aided eddie hardy has said that his favorite 40 minutes were cut from the film and its unclear but likely that most of those changes were made as sony insisted on a more marketable pg13 rating for the film rather than the intended r rating all of the violence that resonates in the venom character through the comics is lost without the gore you might find in a deadpool or predator film as a result the film feels unnecessarily handicapped there are some great sequences within venom usually involving eddie and venoms inner monologue as they tear through the city but 15 percent of a good film does not a quality film make if venom ends up becoming the green lantern hardy makes on the way to something better then all hardys effort will have been worth it this doesnt feel very likely however given the 80 million opening weekend box office sony raked and their affinity for churhing out bland pg13 material in the quest for the almighty dollar a sequel is coming whether its deserved or not that nothing would have to be trimmed to make venom ready for broadcast television should tell audiences everything they need to know about a movie where alien lifeforms steal peoples bodies and bite their heads off
Nov 5 2018,negative, as honey bunny and pumpkin so sagely taught us in the opening scene of pulp fiction its important for petty thieves to think things through before conducting a robbery its a lesson that could have been of great benefit to the four american tertiary students who in 2004 planned to relieve their university library of a number of extremely rare and valuable books their plot and the impulses that drove them are the subject of american animals an absorbing detailed unintentionally humourous account of the harebrained heist that blends expository interviews with the real culprits with the movie recreation of the events its odd that these four didnt pick up on the wisdom of honey bunny and pumpkin too because they actually reference quentin tarantinos film reservoir dogs at one point as they plan their crime regarding themselves as cool criminals in the mould of steve mcqueen from the thomas crown affair they plot out their heist in what they think is great detail only to witness reality come crashing in once the moment of truth occurs as amusing as their incompetence is  conducting a major robbery in the middle of a school day in a building full of people should have been a hint that this was a bad idea  the caper is played fairly straight by british director bart layton the imposter with a nod to the rashomon effect  not all the versions of the plan match up and the trust they had in each other was certainly not equal were there really international buyers ready to pay millions for the books or was something else going on some heist movies cheekily invite you to admire the ingenuity of the crims and even to get a vicarious thrill out of the possibility the robbers might get away with it the original oceans 11  the italian job and the aforementioned thomas crown affair are prime examples you could even include heat here however youre the observer of some very peculiar behaviour that is far from admirable yet quite enjoyable not the least because it shows again how ultimately crime doesnt pay and how greed and the adventure of committing crime can obliterate all traces of common sense with venom marvel studios have now officially hit the bottom of the barrell as one of its thirdrate cgrade creations known mainly to marvels fanboy base gets his own mediocre movie tom hardy plays a gungho reporter whose body becomes host to an alien sludge that transforms him into a large alienlike beast with large almond eyes a smiling mouth full of nasty teeth and a rather winning sense of humour apart from a handful of laughs the film is an ugly largely incomprehensible mess its swirls of frenetic action set mostly at night making it tough to figure out precisely whats going on the best of the marvel films have real personality the lack of which has afflicted most of the first sequels venom comes to us bland right out of the box its promising moments  such as when the alien spore infects a little girl  overwhelmed by the need to pour on the fireballs and vfx for the record the closing credits list around 420 digital artists for those who care venom is part of the spiderman universe and he in turn is part of the marvel universe but spiderman and venom are owned by sony while disney owns marvel so seeing spiderman in those avenger films took a lot of studio wheeling and dealing and though the marvel stamp is on venoms opening credits the plan right now is for venom to stay within sonys spiderman world though its possible for a deal to be made where he enters the marvel space to join the other superhero characters though venom is yet to prove itself with audiences  its already struck out with critics who are not the guide they once were to a films popularity  there are already two venom sequels on the books so theres faith for you by the way hardy was one of the producers here obviously keen to get a nice big slice of that lovely superhero franchise action smart guy a small struggling rural town is brought back from the brink via cricket as a forwardthinking local man troy carrington damian callinan rebuilds the local team by recruiting multicultural members through the local refugee centre naturally the smalltown setting gives rise to smallminded thinking as stalwart locals such as bull barlow john howard rally opposition to the new team seeing it as an affront to their aussie sense of identity theres no question the film directed with careful attention not to offend by mark grentell backyard ashes has its heart in the right place as the film bounces around the idea of accepting people of other lands into the community if only the film was funnier there is a stilted feel to the pace and too much caution in its messaging proving that nothing dilutes fun quicker than preaching adapted from the oneman play by melbourne comedian damian callinan who wrote the screenplay stars and produces the film proved a big hit when it played as the centrepiece at the melbourne international film festival building expectatons for its cinema run now on its last legs after four weeks of theatrical release the merger cant be said to have done all that well with a local box office take of around 400000 hope remains that once it hits the stream the film will connect with the audience it struggled to find via the cinemas with a relentless work ethic damian callinan has

sportsmans night proxy heroes  he has been nominated three times for the melbourne international comedy festivals barry award callinan created the merger as a stage work after being commissioned by regional arts victoria and vic health the brief being to address the problem regional towns were encountering with xenophobia and racism the piece proved extremely popular once he began performing the oneman show in 2010 a common response to the play being that it would make a great film a week after the release of the merger callinan was kind enough to carve some time out of his busy schedule to sit down and talk about the making of the merger and other things

Nov 2 2018,negative, venom is an anomaly for modern superhero films existing outside a broader connected universe the irreverent alien symbiote made its film debut in 2007s spiderman 3 the year before iron man kicked off the marvel cinematic universe forever changing the way studios approach comic book adaptations though a few dozen superhero movies have come and gone between the topher grace and tom hardy versions of the character venom as a film seems to want to pay homage to the idea that a movie can exist as a movie without any broader ramifications for future teamups down the road freed from shared universe obligations venom never seems sure what it wants to do with its time the plot never really exists as more than an excuse to pair up hardys eddie brock with the titular symbiote riz ahmed plays a competent menacing villain in carlton drake but the character lacks any compelling traits to set him apart from the mad scientist trope that defines his place in the narrative michelle williams has a few standout scenes as brocks exfiancée anne weying but largely feels wasted in a wooden supporting role created more out of obligation to give brock more human characters to interact with than anything else venom shines when it lets hardy run wild with his alterego venom is a hilarious character who develops an oddly charming buddycop romance with brock as the film settles into its second act the relationship produces a number of laugh out loud moments that serve in stark contrast to the films otherwise grim tone such moodswings seem to define the entire experience like brocks relationship with venom the movie exists in constant turmoil between dueling desires to be simultaneously formulaic and spontaneous the action scenes feel wooden but theres enough humor to make you wish you were enjoying yourself just a teensy bit more on the site you will find a lot of naked girls online for every taste brunettes blondes and even redheads young and mature shaved and hairy with small medium and large breasts with sex toys students who love squirting and anal choose a girl who is online and communicate with her in freelivesex girls in shorts fishnet stockings girls in overalls in a nurses costume in addition the girls show anal fisting and squirting girls spread their legs girls spread their asses and labia girls fuck each other with big dildos hardy makes the most of what hes given as an actor but the narrative is too all over the place to create a cohesive experience venom is a very fun mess to watch but it would be a stretch to call it a good film which isnt to say that venom doesnt have a place in the crowded superhero genre the narrative is far more chaotic than any mcu offering and never as grim as a dceu installment venom gets its titular character right but fails to supply a worthy vehicle for him to play in the film is perhaps best enjoyed in snippets on premium cable where one can focus on the humorous elements while forgetting that movie doesnt really know how to tell a story five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up 
Nov 2 2018,neutral,venom poisons the well of its own goodwill by a series of misfiring illogical plot points and lack of respect for its own universes rules
Nov 1 2018,negative, an aimless awful embarrassment for everyone involved venom imagines a world where a dopey peter parkertype was instead bitten by a radioactive turd creatively bankrupt filmmaking from top to bottom venom bows under the weight of an insufferable script flatout strange performances and a mishmash tone that tries to levy the darkness of a character that waxes about snacking on eyeballs and fingers and  livers in with scatalogical jokes that truly only the prepubescent in the audience would giggle along with  like an import from another decade one where superhero fare came barreling down the hatch without its fair shake of quality control venom is a bold vision of cinematic notgivingafuck think the likes of fantastic four and daredevil batman and robin and catwoman and youll have an inkling for the flabbergasting directionless mania of this shockingly bad sony outing director ruben fleischer of zombieland and gangster squad fame proves epically unqualified for the chair failing to breathe the faintest glimmer of soul into this feral abomination  hardy who has long been a beacon of quality when it comes to the roles he selects has only once belittled himself with material far beneath his talents in the rather bad 2012 action romcom this means war and if you thought that was bad you aint seen nothing yet his signing on for venom in the first place signaled tantalizing promise suggesting an outofthebox antihero origin story with some real bite fans expected rrated insanity that really focused on character the madness of a man merged with hubris itself i mean why else would the multiple oscarnominated actor enroll himself in such tripe  the answer remains unclear after watching  there is no hint of a grand scheme gone amiss just a tacked together hodgepodge of lackluster moments and hurriedly written hacklines hardy himself isnt good by any measurable standard his performance is all kinds of frantic and bugeyed tacked to a weird accent and constantly demeaning itself with some of the worst dialogue imaginable even the interplay between hardys eddie brock and venom essentially the heart and soul of this whole project isnt fun banter venom demands food hes the base level of maslows hierarchy given voice everything about the character is childish dreck plain and simple the plot of venom as if the movie is interested in an actual plot and not just churning the laziest cinematic universe imaginable is pseudogritty origin story banality ostensibly a disgraced reporter bonds with hungry alien goo to take down big pharma eddie brock is a noholdsbarred reporter who will do anything to get a story including invading his lawyer fiancees played by michelle williams god knows why personal email to get the scoop on a nefarious pharmaceutical big whig riz ahmed who also costars in this weekends excellent the sisters brothers a symbiote from space named venom crash lands on earth and hitches a ride on brocks immune system

review of the four aforementioned movies this quartet have worked on before should speak nay scream volumes about the lofi sewage in store the script is undoubtedly venoms achilles heel  the lowest wrung in a ladder from hell their choice of words is so unrelenting awful that you may find yourself amazed that hardy and williams and ahmed agreed to utter many of these lines in front of a camera ever at one point hardy says my legs were broken and now they are not broken with a look of amazement on his face that could only be matched by my own amazement that i was actually watching this happen in an actual movie starring actual tom hardy  venom is the result of a studio trying to have its cake and eat heads too superficially there is a dark air to brocks transformation into a powerful supersentient asskicker but its all about as hardcore as smoking ecigs outside the hot topic in your local mall with its immature humor and barbarically stupid dialogue venom will only appeal to the kids in the audience a decision made evident by its awful musical choices including an overthehill eminem ballad this is lowest common denomination debris the rubble of some unseen insider shakeup that was beaten and battered into film form on the venom press tour tom hardy commented that his favorite 40 minutes had been cut from the film but with what weve seen youd need a whole new 120 minutes of movie to find anything even halfdecent much less anything worth calling your favorite when not plugging away at his computer matt can be found holed up in his seattle home or hidden

Oct 31 2018,neutral, lets get this out of the way venom isnt a particularly great character on his own as a dark mirror of spiderman he can work in the right hands but his lasting popularity is mainly down to the edgelord boom of comics in the late 80s and 90s that still somehow overshadows much of the industry and its film adaptations there is a way of making him relevant in the modern era but removing him from spiderman completely is an incredibly bad first move sony have been trying to get a solo venom movie off the ground since the sam raimi era and after multiple false starts and despite having just gotten on good terms with marvel studios theyve gone and finally made it anyway the final result is as messy and confused as you might expect but also hilarious enough in its own ineptitude to be worth witnessing for the curious throughout its runtime venom makes a lot of bold and daring decisions its a shame so few of them are the correct ones the plot is fairly simple and yet haphazardly told mainly evident by the inconsistent pacing and jarring mood shifts that suggests this thing was hacked to pieces in post the first act is relatively grounded and crams in a lot of information but relies heavily on predictable clichés for character motivation and relationships when there even is any shifting into the second act the film takes a turn for the absurd with a bizarre mix of body horror and slapstick comedy that plays out like evil dead ii as directed by a 90s teenager that then quickly segues into a final act that is an incomprehensible blur that most resembles street sharks action figures covered in nickelodeon slime being slammed into each other by a nineyearold then some sudden sequel setup and a midcredits scene then its over its a superhero film that feels like it was made over a decade ago making all of the mistakes this genre has made and corrected in the years since and its never quite clear if this is meant to be a tongueincheek homage or to be taken dead seriously its a sloppy mess that is often endearing in its own ridiculousness but its too unfocused and cynically slapped together to fully appreciate by the time its all over the whole experience feels like as the already infamous line from the trailer said a turd in the wind it blows by quickly but leaves a distinctive smell why tom hardy of all times now decided to be in this picture is a mystery to me but he is pivotal to this whole enterprise remaining afloat his performance most reminded me of nicolas cage in his 90s action movie phase unhinged and hilarious and yet still somehow charming he gives eddie brock some interesting depths as an ambitious but pathetic provocateur journalist which helps differentiate him from the roidedout jock of the original comics or the peter parkerbutanasshole topher grace version from spiderman 3 meanwhile hardy then goes flipping nuts once the venom symbiote is inside him giving full gusto to the variety of absurd situations the script rights him into itd be embarrassing if it wasnt so unbelievable he also does a good job of playing the double act of being both brock and venom as they verbally spar inside his head but its a shame the symbiote itself lacks depth beyond his monstrous image venoms motivations are incredibly tenuous and only really decided upon allofasudden in the third act which dont feel at all informed by the preceding film and also take away much of the creatures menace regardless if hardy hadnt made the potentially careerruining decision to star in this we would have a far worse movie on our hands the rest of the cast feels incredibly wasted playing stock characters that really dont demand the high calibre actors theyve managed to get for some of them i applaud michelle williams for somehow managing to play this whole thing incredibly straight and give depth to a character that has none of the page purely through her performance but its all for nought any actress could have played this role and better or worse it wouldnt have affected the final product much riz ahmed never quite manages to hit the right beat as carlton drake constantly trying to go for the villain with noble intentions but questionable methods character when the film really demands a gonzo overthetop supervillain to match hardys level of performance scott haze and reid scott are in relatively thankless roles though i do applaud scotts role as williams new boyfriend for having the decency to make him both plotrelevant and not a jerk and why is jenny slate even in this movie the role demands someone nowhere near her level and doesnt even use her comedic talents methinks there is a lot of her left on the cutting room floor on a technical level the film feels just as out of time as the rest of the picture the action sequences are a michael baylevel mess overloading the eyes with dynamic motion and moving too fast for the eye to register whats going on thats when action is even there as there is a surprising lack of it theres only really two and a half venomheavy action sequences in the whole thing maybe all of this is because the visual effects themselves look incredibly dated too the symbiotes actually look worse than the one in spiderman 3 going for a slimy goop effect that never looks right no matter the lighting or animation the venom design itself is impressive as a faithful recreation of the character but in motion it ends up looking as goofy as ghost rider did on the big screen some thins just dont translate from page to screen the film even has a tiein eminem song that plays over the credits how much more anachronistic can this movie get at this point venom is a bad movie there is no questioning that its a film conceived for cynical intellectual property reasons telling a nearincomprehensible plot cobbled together from the indecisive minds of behindthetimes producers featuring a wellrespected actor giving a bonkers performance that would be impressive if it wasnt so confusing and all slapped together with a veneer that brings to mind earlytomid2000s comic book movies for all the wrong reasons however if you are in the right mindset its still incredibly watchable as a sobaditsgood hot mess some have compared this movie to 2004s catwoman and whilst there are parts of the comparison that are apt both concern villains to a more famous hero removed from their source material star lead actors way too good to be in them engaging in bizarre tickled overacting have an evil corporation based near water as the villain feature cgi that look at least five years past their prime and have a subplot where the main character is annoyed by their neighbour playing music too loud and only having the nerve to do something about it after gaining powers but id say that is going too far venom is more like the ben affleck daredevil or nicolas cage ghost rider tonally incoherent and ripe with edgelord angst but so blissfully unapologetic about its inherent ridiculousness that its hard not to find enjoyment in it so if you go into this knowing not to expect anything more than trash youre going to have a great time if you were expecting anything more then what hole have you been living in since 1997
Oct 31 2018,negative,the crux of it is this venoms strength lies in its ridiculousness because thats all it really has going for it
Oct 31 2018,negative,michelle williams near the very end says what feels like the most sincere heartfelt thing anyone says in the entire movie im sorry about venom
Oct 31 2018,neutral,what works in this movies favor is a tone that makes it feel less like a response to the marvel cinematic universe than an escapee from the troma pictures vaults that somehow managed to evade release for the last quarter century

upper body gainz but also putting his life in danger and making him a target for drakes schemes thats a lot of plot setup and the film doesnt hold back in dumping it all on us as quickly and unceremoniously as possible one thing you might have noticed wasnt in that summary is the name of a certain webspinning wallcrawling hero named spiderman you know the character that venom originally served as an antagonist for and who gave venom his start 30 years ago thats because this is a venom film without any connection to spiderman or the marvel cinematic universe which makes about as much sense as a catwoman film with no connection to batman that doesnt mean the film itself cant be an interesting exciting piece of superhero entertainment of course that also doesnt mean that venom is any of those things either the biggest problem venom has is a clear lack of identity and purpose its a narrative reflection of eddies confusion after he bonds with venom but its ultimately not a good look for the film it begins as a serious drama with some mild tepid attempts at light comedy but once venom himself shows up it turns into a neutered black comedy a pg13 attempt to replicate the sarcastic metatextual vibe of deadpool that only occasionally works its a film about an alien invader that eats brains and indiscriminately kills people thats appropriate for the whole family and it takes forever for venom to show up we dont get eddies first fullon transformation into the big black mother from outer space until nearly the halfway point of a film that isnt even two hours long eddie doesnt even get bonded to venom until at least 30 minutes into the films runtime and before that were treated to situations and plot lines so mundane and pointless that they threaten to bury the film before it even begins even after venom starts his rampage and finally injects some semblance of life into the proceedings the film feels ridiculously earthbound and restrained that relative simplicity worked well for direct ruben fleischer in his previous film zombieland but he seems wildly out of his depth with a barely ninedigitbudget superhero tentpole theres none of the wit and clever action from zombieland here there is plenty of confusing choreography blurry movement poor framing and dated lackluster cgi work venom itself looks great but the rest of the effects all look secondrate in comparison fleischer isnt solely to blame for the films schizophrenic and muddy tone however between the three screenwriters theyre responsible for the 5th wave the dark tower kangaroo jack and 50 shades of grey so maybe we never stood a chance aside from the dialogue between eddie and venom which provides the film with some of the only moments of intentional comedy and genuine chemistry the script feels sloppy inorganic and automatic as if it was generated by a computer program trying to make the hottest superhero film of 1998 characters tend to be blunt and prone to exposition and aside from eddie nobodys dialogue has much color or flavor what makes the film worth watching however is tom hardys committed offthewall performance as both eddie and venom as eddie hes fascinatingly bizarre slurring and mumbling most of his dialogue and reacting even to the most extreme moments with a strange detachment its like a nicholas cage performance if cage was in it for love and not money as venom hardy is sinister and wickedly charismatic and its here the we get the most fullyrealized moments of the film this is the venom we want to see on screen and this is the venom that actually works as a main character sorry topher gracestill love ya though the interplay between eddie and venom has more chemistry than anyone else in the film especially between eddie and anne tom hardy tries his best but michelle williams seems completely uninterested in selling it or even being on screen shes a talented actress but shes clearly not checked in here painfully smiling through her scenes in a discount vicki vale wig theres also no chemistry between eddie and riz ahmeds carlton drake again a talented actor stuck in a thankless role that he isnt investing with any of his own energy drake is so generic a villain that he barely makes an impact fueled completely by negative space in many ways venom feels like a film that should have come out in the late 90s or early 00s more along the lines of more mercenary films like spawn and the hulk as opposed to something like spiderman homecoming its not interested in explicitly setting up its own franchise  even though thats clearly what sony has started doing  but it also doesnt try to make itself anything more than a glossedup ashcan copy produced just to keep the character inhouse the in association with marvel credit during the opening titles might as well have read thanks to marvel for not buying back the rights to characters we dont know what to do with if sony does go ahead with their own cinematic universe though at least they have a great venom in tom hardy if only he had a betterequipped director screenwriters visual effects and supporting cast for my money halle berry would have made a great catwoman too you know if only
Oct 29 2018,positive, for a movie thats currently living in the shadow of the marvel cinematic universe you can tell everyone involved in venom really wanted to do their best to show off in the movie tom hardy takes on the familiar comic book character eddie brock who bonds with the symbiote known as venom and though there are a few messy moments in the condensed hour and fiftysomething minute movie lets just get this out the way now its a big improvement from spiderman 3 the key to seeing this film is coming in with a fresh mind it may be hard to not think about the smashing success of avengers infinity war or black panther but we have to remember that superhero and comic book movies are about having fun sometimes they dont have to have a profound message or make leave a huge mark on pop culture and thats where venom sits described as a movie that somehow escaped from 2004 and found its way to the present day there is certainly a premcu movie feel to it theyre not reinventing the wheel here things are quite formulaic hardy starts out as a man who has everything until things get turned upside down and hes suddenly a loser his fiancée anne played by michelle williams dumps him for another guy and hes out of his highprofile job the character building for eddie is a bit elusive at the start and its not quite clear what were supposed to think of him we know venom is an antihero but thats not really what eddie brock is about until he meets venom although its hard to engage my suspicious of disbelief that tom hardy is a wellmeaning loser when only a few years ago he was kicking batmans butt as bane needless to say hes still pretty ripped from that movie and it makes it hard to believe that this guy is supposed to be as sweet and innocent as a basket of kittens the pacing is a bit slow until venom finally bonds with eddie there are a few jokes here and there before that but its venoms character that really livens the movie up itll make you ask why he wasnt introduced much earlier and its his character that ultimately saves the day  or rather the movie venoms whimsical moments are also why youll understand that this movie definitely deserves a rating of pg13 and not the rrating that so many people had imagined it also seems like a marketing snafu where many assumed by the trailers that it would be a much darker movie than it actually is venom is definitely a more lighthearted movie and while there are definitely some pg13 moments the action and comedy are something akin to the michael bays transformers movies in contrast to venomeddie is the powerful carlton drake riz ahmed the wilson fisk kind of guy who appears to be nice on the outside but on the inside hes pulling some series illegal strings like testing symbiotes on unwilling subjects kind of strings ahmeds performance isnt terrible in this hes just playing a cutanddried villain whom weve seen so many times before really he himself is hardly a thorn in eddievenoms side until the very last moment and this brings up one of the most glaring problems of venom the pacing with most actioncomic book movies reaching well over the twohour mark venom sets itself aside technically the official runtime is 1 hour and 52 times but that seems to be because of the long credits and two yes two midcredits scenes the actual movie feels a lot shorter than that with supposedly around 40 minutes of scenes being cut you might actually find yourself wondering is the movie actually winding up it seems like this is the end but everything is happening so quickly so much so in fact that it might be hard to see what the whole point of the final boss battle is about in the first place all that being said yes the movie deserves a bit of criticism it isnt perfect and if you hold it up to the mcus or even foxs deadpools light you might come out disappointed but if youre just in for a fun time that includes some laughworthy moments and a great spin on an old character then youll be in for a pretty enjoyable time  2024 minute media  all rights reserved the content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only all betting content is intended for an audience ages 21 all advice including picks and predictions is based on individual commentators opinions and not that of minute media or its related brands all picks and predictions are suggestions only no one should expect to make money from the picks and predictions discussed on this website for more information please read our legal disclaimer if you or someone you know has a gambling problem call 1800gambler
