"Sep 27, 2023",positive," Peter Jackson draws on the original 1933 classic in his 2005 remake of King Kong and the film is every bit the epic that one would expect. The 1933 classic is iconic for its pioneering use of stop-motion technology. It would also go onto inspire Peter Jackson to go into special effects. Lo and behold, the Oscar-winning filmmaker would tackle a remake after finishing up The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. After all, the filmmaker knew he was going to make a remake when he was 12 years old. The road got bumpy throughout the years but in 1995, Universal Pictures gave Jackson an opportunity to remake the film. As with any filmmaker, he said no at first before coming around to it. King Kong was in the public domain at this point. Anyway, the plan to film in 1997 is what would become a roadblock due to other remakes coming out. Production was delayed and Jackson focused on the Middle-earth trilogy. Things would resume in 2003. Jackson’s films contain the same or similar set pieces but with modern technology allowing the filmmaker to do so much more. Instead of stop-motion technology, Andy Serkis utilizes motion performance capture to depict the giant gorilla. I’ll touch on the visual effects in a moment but I cannot say enough good things about them. Despite the modern technology, this is a period film through and through. Jackson goes as far as paying homage to the vaudeville performances of the era. Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling vaudeville performer, is hired by Carl Denham (Jack Black) for his new movie. She’s all set to decline before learning that Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is the screenwriter. Denham is filming on SS Venture, which is captained Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann). What Denham doesn’t mention is that they’re really going to Skull Island, not Singapore. It’s a recipe for disaster but not even a warrant for Carl’s arrest is going to stop them. Before you know it, the crew finds itself on Skull Island. This goes as anyone would expect–the natives take Ann as an offering to Kong and they both flee into the jungle. This was my first rewatch since seeing the epic film in theaters when it was released. Upon its release, I felt that they could have cut out a half hour but that it would probably win an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Lo and behold, they won Oscars for Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and yes, Visual Effects. It’s only other nomination was for Art Direction, which we now refer to as Production Design. The thing with Peter Jackson movies is that there is a lot of care and attention that goes into the technical categories. King Kong missed out on a Best Picture nomination in an era before the category expansion. I do not know if the film would get a Best Picture nomination under with the expanded field. It just might. But back to the film’s visual effects, you cannot say enough good things about them. When a filmmaker of Peter Jackson’s caliber is directing a film, you know that the visual effects are going to be top-notch. There are a few scenes that draw back to the very iconic scenes that inspired them. Hell, the work that went into building CGI New York is just astounding! The first sequence in question is the fight between Kong and the three T. Rexes. The second sequence is the climactic ending with the Empire State Building. Of course, both scenes go above and beyond what we see in the 1933 classic. It helps that animators had the ability to work off of the pre-viz animatics in designing the sequence for the big screen. Recreating the Eighth Wonder: The Making of King Kong is a documentary that offers a substantial amount of insight into the film. For instance, Peter Jackson took Naomi Watts up to the 86th and 102nd observatories and even went up into the cone of the Empire State Building. There were a number of years where the 102nd observatory had been closed but it more or less looks like it did in 1933. Regardless, their 2004 tour would inspire the interior design in the film. Watts and Jackson also met Fay Wray in early March.

"May 7, 2023",positive,"The visual effects are glorious -- a circus of cliffhanging suspense sequences that go on and on and on. But rather than just padding the story with gummy exposition and silly action, Jackson delves deeply into the psychology of the characters."
"Jan 7, 2023",positive," King Kong (2005) is an old-fashioned monster movie/jungle thriller pushed to the limits with new technology by a filmmaker with both the skill and the heart to recapture the thrills of his adolescent moviehouse dreams. It’s a remake of a 1930s classic via the wondrous creatures and primeval world of Jurassic Park and the devil-may-care cliffhanger spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Jackson sets it in the same era as the original 1933 film—the depths of the depression in the early 1930s—with Naomi Watts as aspiring actress Ann Darrow, a young woman so desperate that she takes a job on a mysterious movie safari for director and adventurer Carl Denham (Jack Black). Where Denham was a reckless visionary in the original film, Jackson recasts him as a morally ambivalent entrepreneur who lies, manipulates, kidnaps, and risks the lives of everyone around him, first to get his picture and then to capture the mighty ape and get his prize discovery back to America. In fact, it’s a little too much of a good thing, running almost twice as long as the original and filled with unnecessary side characters and spectacular scenes of man versus monster and ape versus everyone that go on long past the moment you’d think he could sustain them. Jackson makes it all work with his showman instinct and his unconditional love of movies. He fills all of those extraneous scenes and characters—especially those involving the cabin boy (Jamie Bell) and the African American First Mate (Evan Parke), his big brother/father figure—with a love and respect that gives the film an emotional grounding. And when Jackson is at his best as an action craftsman you overlook the CGI overkill to marvel at the scenes, especially the signature scene where Kong takes on not one but three T-Rex beasties while juggling lady love from hand to foot. It’s astounding and fierce and as impressive as any spectacle of its era. And of course there is the performance of pioneering motion capture actor Andy Serkis, whose superb body language performance brings the completely animated Kong to life. He gives the creature an astounding personality, a playful spirit and a sense of humor. The interlude on the frozen lake in Central Park is joyous as he explores the ice and slides across it like a little kid. And the chemistry between Serkis’ beast and Watts’ beauty, much of it communicated through their eyes, gives the adventure its love story. Adrien Brody is our human hero Jack Driscoll, Andy Serkis gets a flesh and blood role as the crotchety cook Lumpy (and in the process lands both of the film’s best death scenes), and Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, and Kyle Chandler co-star.

"Mar 26, 2021",positive," Back in 2017, the heavily hyped Kong: Skull Island wasn’t the first time that year that movie audiences saw King Kong thundering across the screen. After all, a more diminutive — and blockier — version of the character made a cameo appearance in The Lego Batman Movie. And now the great ape is returning yet again, roaring into theaters and onto HBO Max March 31 in Godzilla vs. Kong. Clearly, a constant presence on the pop-culture scene is expected with a figure as iconic as this one. Since King Kong first appeared in 1933, there’s been no small measure of great-ape movies seeking to either honor or pillage his legacy. From a pair of long-lost Japanese films from the 1930s to a Bangladeshi musical in 2010, numerous filmmakers have sought to usurp the King’s throne through (usually) unauthorized versions. There have been animated television series, straight-to-video features, and even movies starring a professional wrestler named King Kong. Then there are the following 16 theatrical releases, all of which were either officially licensed Kong productions or imitators hoping to snag a share of the box office pie. Here, then, is every giant ape movie ranked from worst to first. It might seem unfair placing 1986’s King Kong Lives at the bottom of this list, considering that — unlike several other great-ape movies — it at least boasts of a decent-sized budget, slick production values, and Linda Hamilton. But the hint of talent is actually what drives home its utter worthlessness — there’s simply no reason for this movie to be this abysmal. Producer Dino de Laurentiis’ 1976 King Kong may have received a mixed reception from critics, but it proved to be a hit with audiences. Clearly not understanding the adage of striking while the iron is hot, de Laurentiis waited an entire decade before getting around to making the sequel. That delay plays into the plot, as the film reveals that Kong survived his plunge off the Empire State Building and has since been in a coma. To revive Kong on the 10th anniversary of his fall, the attendant doctor (Hamilton) states that he needs both a heart transplant and a blood transfusion. The former comes courtesy of a gigantic artificial heart, installed during a sequence that stands among the most risible in all Kong flicks. The latter comes courtesy of an oversized female gorilla that conveniently has just been discovered by an adventurer (Brian Kerwin, more Ratso Rizzo than Indiana Jones) in Borneo. Kong is revived, the great apes fall in love, and, once baby makes three, Ms. Kong finally gets to put to use the most unconvincing animal boobs since the ones showcased earlier that same year in Howard the Duck. The cross-eyed gorilla isn’t the worst element of 1969’s unspeakably awful The Mighty Gorga. Admittedly, it’s a distraction wondering why no one took a couple of minutes to fix the wayward peepers on the unfortunate ape costume borrowed for this picture, but even this seemingly simple-minded simian looks genuine when compared to the dinosaur that eventually pops up. Apparently made out of discarded popsicle sticks and chunks of cheap plastic, this just might be the most laughable prehistoric puppet to ever appear in a movie. Then again, that’s right in line with the rest of this amateurish slop, which finds a circus owner (Anthony Eisley) journeying to Africa to locate the giant gorilla that can save his business. It’s hard to ascertain what’s more ludicrous: the spectacle of actors constantly flubbing (or, heck, even remembering) their lines or the parade of California beach bums hired to play African natives. Best (worst?) of all is the witch doctor gleefully sacrificing virgins to Kong — as played by Bruce Kimball, he possesses the countenance of a disreputable lodge’s Grand Poobah while delivering his lines like a bad Borscht Belt comedian. Incidentally, another creature appears later in the movie, and it’s far superior to the dinosaur spotted earlier. Lest anyone think the filmmakers were suddenly infused with a modicum of minute talent, be aware that this monster was actually “borrowed” (via stock footage) wholesale from another film — 1960’s Goliath and the Dragon, for those keeping score. An inept Italian production that appears to have been made for a buck fifty, the film was known as Eve, the Wild Woman in its homeland. That’s certainly a more fitting moniker, since the plot does involve a woman named Eve, and she is indeed wild. Played by Esmeralda Barros, she comes along late in the game to help hunky mercenary Burt Dawson (Brad Harris) exact his revenge against Albert Muller (Marc Lawrence), a fellow merc who once betrayed him. Muller is now spending his days toiling as a mad scientist — hidden away in his jungle lair, he’s busy planting tiny radio receivers inside the heads of gorillas, thus enabling him to control all their actions. It’s up to Eve, a female version of Tarzan, to help Dawson locate Muller’s hideaway and save his damsel in distress (Ursula Davis). Obviously, there’s no King and no Kong in King of Kong Island — heck, there’s not even an island (the story unfolds in Kenya). But American audiences weren’t the only ones to get Konged — excuse me, conned — by false advertising. In West Germany, the film played under the title King Kong and the Tan Goddess, while in Greece, the picture was known as The Runaways of King Kong. The opening credits for 1976’s A*P*E signal the level of quality that defines this Korean production, as the word “Transportation” (as in, “Transportation Provided By …”) is misspelled as “Transporation.” Following this alphabet-challenged intro, the action begins with a dangerous 36-foot ape being sent to Disneyland(!) for a promotional tour. The creature breaks free from the ship’s cargo hold and proceeds to destroy the vessel, which actually looks like a toy boat bobbing around in presumably the producer’s swimming pool. The primate then battles a rubber shark (or, as the Spielberg-attentive ads plugged, “See A*P*E defy the JAWS of Giant Shark”) before heading to terra firma to watch kids frolic on a playground, demolish several buildings, and — because every Kong-size contract requires it — halfheartedly make off with a blonde. The heroine in this case is an actress (Joanna DeVarona, later Joanna Kerns of Growing Pains fame) who terrifyingly shrieks like one of the victims in The Last House on the Left before inexplicably turning into Mae West and purring at the great ape, “Be gentle, big fella.” Rarely in the annals of cinema have so much plywood and lighter fluid been expended in the service of visual effects magic — be sure to also check out the falling rocks that flake off Styrofoam pieces as they hit the ground. A*P*E, incidentally, stands for Attacking Primate monstEr, although the movie also made the rounds under The Great Counter-Attack of Kong Kong, Hideous Mutant, and Attack of the Giant Horny Gorilla. Like A*P*E, 1976’s Queen Kong was a King Kong rip-off produced to profit off the hype surrounding the Dino de Laurentiis version making its way into theaters. Unlike the Korean flick, this British spoof barely saw the inside of theaters, as a lawsuit hurled by de Laurentiis successfully blocked its release in most of the world (and certainly in the U.S. and England). As the title suggests, the film is basically a gender-switch King Kong, with a giant female gorilla mixing it up with a slacker named Ray Fay (Robin Askwith). Drowning in kitschy excess, Queen Kong strains hard for laughs that simply don’t materialize — the opening song sets the tacky tone with such lyrics as,  “She’s a genie who ain’t teeny, She’s the queenie, queenie for my weenie. When I’m feeling mighty spunky, I wanna do it with my hunky monkey.” Yet what’s interesting about the movie is how it predates pictures like Airplane! and The Kentucky Fried Movie as a spoof of all trades, with timely zingers aimed at such hits as Jaws, The Exorcist and Airport 1975. Even more intriguingly, Queen Kong positions itself as a feminist flick, with Ray Fay delivering a climactic speech about how the oppressed ape represents all women attempting to assert their independence in a patriarchal society. “Everybody loves the monkey!” producer Dino de Laurentiis would frequently chirp, explaining why he decided to remake a classic that had long been hailed as one of cinema’s finest achievements. But 1976’s King Kong turned out to be a ham-fisted version of the venerable yarn, replacing the excitement and gravitas of the 1933 original with a jokey attitude that bordered on camp. The only area in which it improved upon its predecessor was in delineating the relationship between the ape and the woman he loves, and even this was subsequently handled better in Peter Jackson’s 2005 update. Jeff Bridges, appearing almost as hirsute as Kong, gamely tries to lift the proceedings as a paleontologist, with Charles Grodin doing his part as a greedy oil company executive. But in the central role of Dwan, newcomer Jessica Lange fights a losing battle against a script that transforms her into a New Age ninny (when first encountering Kong, she inquires about his zodiac sign) — her performance led to withering reviews that kept her off the screen for three years. Incredulously, King Kong earned an Oscar for its visual effects, sharing that year’s honor with the far more accomplished Logan’s Run. Considering the shoddiness of the visuals — especially in the close-up shots when Kong unconvincingly leers at Dwan as if he were auditioning for a Benny Hill skit — there might be some truth to the long-standing rumor that some Academy members resigned in disgust after their colleagues voted for this unearned distinction. Today, Rankin/Bass is best known for such animated TV specials as 1964’s Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and 1970’s Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town, but among the company’s prolific output during its heyday was 1966’s The King Kong Show, which aired as part of ABC’s Saturday morning lineup for a couple of seasons. The 1967 feature film King Kong Escapes, a live-action collaboration between Rankin/Bass and Japan’s Toho Studios, was directly inspired by the series, which explains why it seems mainly geared toward children. It’s certainly perky enough to maintain adolescent interest, as Kong squares off against Mechani-Kong, a robotic replicant created by the nefarious Dr. Who — no, not that Dr. Who, though he does bear a passing resemblance to Dr. No. In fact, much of King Kong Escapes plays like a romper room version of a James Bond adventure, even borrowing Mie Hama, Kissy Suzuki in the 007 outing You Only Live Twice, to portray the slinky villainess Madame X. As for Kong, his dance card is filled with battles against Mechani-Kong, the dinosaur Gorosaurus, a sizable sea serpent, and a rather raggedy monkey costume. It almost feels as if 1962’s King Kong vs. Godzilla deserves two spots on this list, considering the vast differences between the original Japanese cut and the radically reworked American version. The genesis of the film began with, appropriately enough, Willis O’Brien, the visual effects genius behind the original 1933 King Kong. O’Brien had long envisioned making King Kong vs. Frankenstein, but when no American studio jumped at the opportunity to finance such an awesome-sounding movie, other hands got involved and King Kong eventually ended up (much to O’Brien’s displeasure) at Toho, the outfit behind the Godzilla flicks. King Kong vs. Godzilla was a smash in its homeland, but for U.S. consumption, many of the more satiric moments were axed and replaced with tedious scenes of a United Nations broadcaster (Michael Keith) and a stuffy scientist (Harry Holcombe) alternately providing deadening exposition. Still, “the most colossal conflict the screen has ever known” (per the posters) was the sole reason global audiences packed theaters, and viewers of either version got their money’s worth. While the Kong costume itself was particularly woeful, the thrill of seeing these mighty monsters rumble kept customers content — and convinced Toho to fully throw its muscle behind Godzilla via countless movies, merchandise, and more. Herman Cohen met with success by producing and (under pseudonyms) writing the 1957 features I Was a Teenage Werewolf and I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, so why not go for the hat-trick by unleashing I Was a Teenage Gorilla onto an unsuspecting world? Alas, a rash of similarly titled cheapies from other filmmakers (Teenage Caveman, Teenage Zombies, Teenagers from Outer Space, etc.) led to understandable audience burnout — by the time Cohen was ready to release his monkey movie in 1961, he opted instead to go with Konga. Set in England, the titular gorilla only grows to Kong-size proportions at film’s end — before that, he begins life as a harmless chimpanzee brought back from Africa by Dr. Charles Decker (Michael Gough), a scientist who’s obsessed with perfecting his growth serum. Testing the formula on the chimp, he quickly learns that it turns the little fellow into a hulking gorilla ready to carry out his murderous bidding. A standard entry in the “mad scientist” genre, Konga is elevated by the suitably intense turn by longtime horror veteran Gough (perhaps best known for playing Alfred to Michael Keaton’s Bruce Wayne/Batman). But once the monkey gets super-sized, the terrible visual effects take over, with the climactic sequences centered around a guy in an ape suit standing listlessly next to a Big Ben model while the Brits blast away. Disney’s 1998 Mighty Joe Young, a remake of the popular 1949 version, is at its best when it — pardon the pun — apes its predecessor and falters when it attempts to strike out on its own. As before, the movie details the loving relationship between a young woman (Charlize Theron) growing up in Africa and the oversized gorilla she hopes to protect from civilization. Theron brings enormous warmth to her role, and effects guru Rick Baker uses animatronics and a dash of CGI to fashion a central creature that looks absolutely believable from first frame to last. Unfortunately, the majority of the film proves to be even more hokey than its forebear, thanks chiefly to the addition of one-dimensional villains (poachers and black marketeers) seeking to make life miserable for our hirsute hero. Still, it’s hard to resist a film in which Bill Paxton, as an affable conservationist, addresses Mighty Joe as “ya big palooka.” The 1933 King Kong was such a smashing success that the studio excitedly demanded that a follow-up hit theaters in the same calendar year. Nine months later, Son of Kong was released, but despite reassembling most of the key personnel from the previous picture, it was merely a pale — if likable — shadow of its predecessor. Filmed on a much smaller budget, it brings back King Kong co-star Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham, here returning to Skull Island to search for treasure and running across Kong’s cuddly albino kid. “Little Kong” is almost incidental to the story and doesn’t even show up until well past the halfway point — primarily, this is about Denham’s crisis of conscience regarding his treatment of Kong in the first film. In that respect, it’s an interesting piece, but it’s far too short at 70 minutes, and it ends with an all-too-convenient earthquake making short work of the various storylines. Originally released in the U.S. as Goliathon, 1977’s The Mighty Peking Man is arguably the best of the countless Kong rip-offs that have glutted the marketplace. It’s easy to see why both Roger Ebert and Quentin Tarantino were enthusiastic fans. The plot borrows from both King Kong and Mighty Joe Young, as an explorer named Johnny (Danny Lee, later of John Woo’s The Killer) stumbles across not only an oversized apeman known as Utam but also the lovely blonde who’s been his companion over the years. She’s Samantha (Evelyne Kraft), who survived the plane crash that killed her parents and has since been running around the jungle clad only in skimpy, Tarzan-approved duds. She and Johnny fall in love, and together with Utam, they head to Hong Kong, where all hell breaks loose. The Mighty Peking Man doesn’t flow as much as lurch forward, and cheesy interludes (such as Samantha frolicking with leopards in slow motion) are the norm during the film’s first half. But because the project was generously financed by the Shaw Brothers, those purveyors of classic kung fu flicks over the decades, the model work is far more polished (if still not always convincing) than that seen in other similar efforts. Yet what’s most notable about The Mighty Peking Man is the utter nihilism that rears its head during the final act. The King Kong template is one that naturally lends itself to tragedy, but the consequences here are downright startling. The second film in the up-and-running MonsterVerse, 2017’s Kong: Skull Island is a definite improvement over 2014’s Godzilla — it’s also frequently clever, occasionally inane, and always exciting. Certainly, the human players matter less than ever, with all but one character painted in the broadest strokes possible. The glorious exception is Hank Marlow, played with the right mix of cheer and fear by John C. Reilly. A fighter pilot who’s been stranded on Skull Island since World War II (the film itself is set in 1973), Marlow proves to be the most sympathetic character in the film, the go-to figure for audience involvement. The others are the usual stock assemblage of hunky adventurer (Tom Hiddleston), feisty pacifist (Brie Larson), gung-ho military man (Samuel L. Jackson), government wonk (John Goodman), whiny company suit (John Ortiz), and various expendables in the form of scientists and soldiers. All are part of an expedition that arrives on Skull Island and proceeds to get ambushed not only by Kong but by other oversized inhabitants. The script, cobbled together by several sets of hands, isn’t nearly as impressive as the direction by Jordan Vogt-Roberts — love the visual shout-outs to Apocalypse Now — although it’s as a creature feature that Kong: Skull Island works best. The visual effects are truly dazzling, particularly when employed to bring the movie’s towering star to roaring, rattling life. “Presented” by no less than the legendary John Ford, 1949’s delightful Mighty Joe Young reunited the key players from 1933’s King Kong — director Ernest B. Schoedsack, writer-producer Merian C. Cooper, co-scripter Ruth Rose, and special effects wizard Willis O’Brien — for another story about an ape run amok. Comparatively more benign than Kong but still a dangerous, oversized animal, Joe lives in Africa with his human companion Jill Young (Terry Moore), who has raised the gorilla since infancy. Jill gets talked into bringing Joe to America by garrulous showman Max O’Hara, who wants to use him as the main attraction in his jungle-themed nightclub. To play Max, the filmmakers once again turned to Robert Armstrong, who’s basically asked to essay the same type of role he tackled in King Kong and Son of Kong. Mighty Joe Young climaxes with a devastating fire at an orphanage; interestingly, this lengthy segment was filmed in sepia tone rather than black-and-white. In creating the picture’s stop-motion effects, O’Brien was assisted by a young Ray Harryhausen — the film earned the Best Special Effects Oscar, but its lackluster box office performance led to the cancellation of a proposed sequel, Joe Meets Tarzan. Whereas the 1976 version of King Kong was made by profiteers, the 2005 remake was handled by a filmmaker with a genuine affinity for the 1933 original. Fresh from his success with the Tolkien trilogy, Peter Jackson turned his attention toward honoring one of his favorite films with an expensive homage. Jackson’s King Kong was a box office hit, earned a trio of Oscars for its sound and visual effects, and showcased a superb turn by Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow. Its chief drawback is its length, since Jackson took the template of the 103-minute original and stretched it to 190 minutes. This hefty running time aids the first act, with filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) preparing to head out into uncharted waters to make his epic, and the third act, which places the action back in New York in time for Kong’s fateful encounter with the Empire State Building. But the middle section, set on Skull Island, is where the film lags, due to Jackson’s insistence on steering the story away from Kong and focusing on the territory’s dinosaurs and other beastly inhabitants. It’s as if Jackson wanted to make his own Jurassic Park — a waste of time since Steven Spielberg had already done it perfectly. Still, Kong himself is a visual marvel, with an expressive range of emotions sweeping across his face (as usual, Andy Serkis handles motion-capture duties), and fans of Jackson’s Dead Alive will chuckle at the sign in the ship’s cargo hold that reads “Sumatra Rat Monkey.” A gargantuan hit upon its original release and subsequent reissues, 1933’s King Kong goes beyond being a mere staple of film history. In much the same manner as The Wizard of Oz and It’s a Wonderful Life, this masterpiece about “The Eighth Wonder of the World” long ago entered into the national consciousness as an enduring part of our heritage. As Ann Darrow, the beauty who captures the beast’s oversized heart, Fay Wray became an overnight star, although equally memorable is Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham, the boisterous filmmaker who sets the story in motion with his plan to shoot his next exotic picture on the uncharted Skull Island. Under the auspices of producer-directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, Willis O’Brien (with a major assist from Marcel Delgado) contributed extraordinary stop-motion effects that brought to life many classic sequences, including Kong’s destruction of a native village, his battles with prehistoric beasts, and his tragic last stand atop the Empire State Building. O’Brien’s effects were both innovative and influential — the same goes for Max Steiner’s excellent music, credited not only as the first feature-length movie score but also one of the earliest to employ a full symphony."
"Oct 9, 2020",positive," audeville performer Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) suffers alongside everyone else during the Great Depression, struggling to earn enough to eat – particularly after her revue is shuttered. She’s nevertheless hopeful that if she can just get an audition with legendary playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), she’ll find her way to stardom. But the competition is dishearteningly tough, and the easiest fix is to resort to a disreputable burlesque show. Meanwhile, hotheaded producer/director Carl Denham (Jack Black) is in the middle of getting his latest picture shut down when he decides to flee to the waiting ship that he’s paid to sail to a shoot at a mysterious destination. He’s obtained a map to a most exotic, virtually undiscovered locale, and he’s intent on going – before the studio bigwigs can put a stop to the departure of the vessel, the S.S. Venture. When his leading lady drops out, Carl is forced to snag the first Size-4 dame he can find – preferably one with a pretty face. As luck would have it, he crosses paths with Ann, in time to sucker her into joining the expedition. Carl is also silver-tongued enough to trick Driscoll, who happens to be in a cabin aboard the Venture, to hand over the first 15 pages of a script – and to then get shanghaied for the journey. From here, the Venture stumbles upon a craggy, seemingly deserted landmass with a sizable wall that was surely designed to keep something very large out. As the captain (Thomas Krestschmann) hustles to repair his ship, Carl and a few of his filmmaking crew wander onto the island, where they’re attacked by natives in an eerie deviation from the former tone. For the first time, momentary horror movie notes creep into the picture (which starts to resemble the chills of cannibal movies), though the poor editing once again ensures that it’s a temporary ghoulishness. In another pointless subplot, first mate Hayes (Evan Parke) and his young protege Jimmy (Jamie Bell) trade observations about “Heart of Darkness” – made more insincere via histrionic voiceover moments. These two are – by far – the worst pieces of the project. With a ceaseless flair for the overdramatic, director Peter Jackson does everything with larger-than-life characters, exaggerated wide-eyed enactments (and intense stares), swelling music, rousing or ominous speeches in close-up, and plenty of intricate details. His details, however, are so overwrought and exhaustive that the end result is a whopping three-hour production. In Jackson’s world, there are no bit-parts; the overabundance of players all receive so much screentime that the pacing suffers considerably. The actors (and actress) are amusing, but even when audiences get to know them all intimately, it doesn’t much alter the impact or emotions as they succumb to the horrors of Skull Island. Here, the editing is correspondingly over-the-top, using visual gimmickry to generate false thrills – excessive manipulations that absolutely didn’t need to be utilized. Jackson sticks with the Great Depression-era setting for this third major theatrical adaptation, but he goes to much greater lengths to set the stage than in the 1933 version. The introduction spends many minutes building up its characters and locations and financial hardships, as if the roles needed some added sympathy to humanize them for their inevitable confrontation with the monstrously inhuman (curiously, the sexual undertones – or overtones – of the previous two iterations has all but vanished). As a film enthusiast, Jackson does incorporate numerous nods to the black-and-white classic, borrowing exact lines or mimicking specific scenes, but on a few occasions, he duplicates a couple of the faults from the 1976 take, which is one of the worst choices – or accidents – he could possibly make. The love story between Ann and Jack is one such problem, as it’s built upon an unconvincing montage that is as fleeting and insignificant as the running time is long. “Monsters belong in B-movies.” To its credit, Jackson’s update finally gives its title role the hi-tech CG makeover for which fans have been waiting. Some sequences are less convincing than others, but the technology has improved to such a degree that it’s undeniably impressive to see Kong during his most famous routines. A bit of this is ruined as well, however, as the animators have attempted to duplicate primate movements so authentically that Kong has lost some of his beastly identity. Mostly, he’s just a gargantuan gorilla – a rather predictable animal, even if significantly overgrown. In the end, the adventure is ambitious to match the graphics, but it isn’t always effective in its extremeness (especially during an unintentionally comical brontosaurus stampede, in which the lumbering dinosaurs manage to sidestep all the tiny humans scampering beneath their enormous feet). A later T-Rex fight is far better (as well as the aerial finale atop the Empire State Building), though the choreography still favors explicit fantasy over much-needed realism; wherever it could get believable imagery, it definitely should have gone for it, yet this notion is sadly infrequent.

"Nov 19, 2019",positive," With the success of &#8220The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, clearly Peter Jackson had a tough act to follow. Yet Jackson's follow-up, another remake of the epic adventure &#8220King Kong,” proves to be the right project for a director who clearly understands the art of the action genre. &#8220Kong” does trudge along at times with a three-hour running time, but it still works, thanks to the final two-thirds in which each action sequence trumps the previous one. &#8220King Kong” follows a film crew to a remote island in the 1930s. The film's director, Carl Denham (Jack Black), is desperate to finish his work and convinced that shooting on location in this remote land will be just what he needs to secure the picture's shaky financial backing. Among the people joining Denham on this journey are Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a down-on-her-luck actress, and Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), a writer and friend of Denham's. Once the group gets to the island, they get more than they bargained for, with a land full of prehistoric creatures and a 25-foot ape, which happens to develop an affection for Darrow. Jackson takes a slow and methodical approach to the story, with Kong not appearing until over an hour into the film. But like that first climb on a rollercoaster, once the action picks up steam, it is nonstop. Jackson fills the screen with one fabulous chase after another. It's like watching &#8220Jurassic Park” on amphetamines. There are dinosaurs, bats, man-sized insects - enough danger to fill three action movies. But &#8220King Kong” has more going for it than the action sequences. At its core, the film is a love story between woman and beast. Their love has a sense of credibility that gives &#8220Kong” a touch of tenderness and Jackson (and especially Watts) deserve praise for making that relationship work. This remake is sure to be compared to its two predecessors. It's been a while since I've seen the original and honestly, my only memory of the 1976 version centers around me sneaking into a theater to watch the last half of the film (a long story best saved for another day). With that in mind, I don't think I'm the one who can accurately compare the three films. But I do know one thing - I enjoy a good action film just like the next person. And this isn't just a good action film, &#8220Kong” is a very good one. - Sportswriter/movie reviewer Micheal Compton now has reviews available on the Web.

"Nov 6, 2019",positive," Once upon a time there was a 9 year old boy with an amazing imagination. And on one fine day, he saw a movie that would impact him forever – “King Kong.” Directed by Merion C. Cooper and Ernest Shoedsack, shot in black and white and released by Universal Studios in 1933, “King Kong” was such a success on its release that it saved the studio from going under. Years later, when this little boy saw the mighty Kong, he was so taken with the movie and the concept of movie making that he fashioned himself his own cardboard King Kong model, used his mother’s fur-collar coat, cutting the collar into fine threads and gluing strands of fur one by one on his model, and then grabbed a movie camera to make his own version of “King Kong.” Okay, so that version wasn’t a huge commercial success beyond his own living room, but fast forward to the present. What that 1933 “King Kong” did do was create a love and desire in a young Peter Jackson that inspired him to become one of the consummate filmmakers of our time. Having helmed one of the true epics in movie history, “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, Jackson now had the means to do the film he had always held close to his heart – a big screen version of “King Kong.” And let me tell you right now – this is no remake or reinvention of a classic. This film is a loving re-creation of a timeless tale. Clearly a labor of love, the memories held all these years by that 9 year old leap from the screen with every shot, every effect, every nuance, every word, every creature creation, every beat of Kong’s heart. True to the original film and story but with the added polish that is offered by today’s technology, Peter Jackson’s “King Kong” is a visual masterpiece. The time is 1933. America faces the Great Depression. Ann Darrow is a struggling vaudeville actress. Without income and without wanting to lower herself to performing burlesque, Ann has little in the way of prospects – that is until she steals an apple from a street vendor and finds herself rescued by Carl Denham. A man with a slightly nutso streak in him, Denham can relate to Ann’s little theft – especially since he just heisted his unfinished adventure-travelogue from the studio after execs threatened to pull the plug and funds. (Some things never change!) Rushing to get his cast and crew aboard a Singapore bound steamer, Denham has another little problem. His star has pulled out of the picture. Second problem – she’s a size 4 and all costumes have been made. Luckily for him he met Ann. Not only is she desperate for work, she’s a size 4! Convincing her to sign on to the project is a bit tougher though (like she has many options!), that is until she finds out that up and coming playwright Jack Driscoll has written the screenplay and is going along for the ride. With all on board, the S.S. Venture sets sail from New York Harbor, but what no one realizes is that Denahm doesn’t plan on going to Singapore. Always with an eye on his ego, Denham’s true plan is to head for Skull Island and a mythical beast of mighty proportion. With a slow build to the arrival on Skull Island, Jackson uses the time wisely to establish time, place, motive and characters. But the fun really starts once man steps into this lost world. Paying great homage to the original film but with a CGI twist, we are met with prehistoric dinosaurs, carnivorous sea slugs, a lost race of “man” that are more savage than anything ever depicted in a National Geographic, a brontosaurus stampede and tyrannosaurus triplets, and of course, King Kong – all of which are used to establish the love story between Kong and Ann. Notable is Jackson’s use of the “spider-pit” sequence which was cut from the original but given new life here with some of the creepiest and crawliest arachnids ever seen. Despite the grandeur of the special effects, it is the story of Kong and Ann that still touches the heart and is the essence of the movie. Be it Ann using her song and dance talents to “sooth the savage breast” so as not to be eaten or crushed, or waggling a finger at a tantrum throwing Kong, or Kong tearing up trees, tossing boulders and beating his chest in a huff over his frustration with Ann (be it man or ape, the male species just don’t get us females!) the story of true life is timeless and endearing. And let me tell you, Kong is more a gentleman, more gallant and more loveable than almost any man on the planet. But leave it to the call of fame and fortune and one’s man ego though to spoil everything and here that falls to Carl Denham. Seeing gold at the end of the rainbow, Denham has Kong and his sweetie Broadway bound with what we all know have terrifying results. Although the human performances are not as compelling as that of Kong, they are nevertheless not to be overlooked – and especially when it comes to Jack Black. With his portrayal of Carl Denham, Black can finally be described as a movie star. Stepping out of type, yet so in type, Black’s Denham is an over-the-top egomaniac that only adds to the underlying social commentary of the story. Don’t be surprised to hear Black’s name called out on January 31, 2006 for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Oscar winner Adrien Brody takes on the role of Jack Driscoll. With a performance that is weak, wimpy and weepy, one can easily see why Ann would prefer to be with a great protectorate like Kong. And as for Ann Darrow, this is one of the finest examples of perfect casting I have seen in many a day. Naomi Watts is enchanting, idyllic and golden. Clearly born to play in period pieces, her range of emotion and adaptability in either a green jungle or concrete one is exciting to watch. But it is her heart that radiates with her performance here. Simply magical.  But the real star here is not the human actors. Nope. That honor goes to the Mighty Kong himself. Great pains were taken to develop Kong with such exacting detail so as to create a great ape that has weathered the ages but who really is an old softie inside. Complete with battle scars, a droopy eye from a prior battle and even a broken jaw (not to mention some pretty bad cavities), Kong’s humanness is both touching and enlightening. Much of the success of Kong goes to Andy Serkis, himself filmed and then digitized with Kong-like fur, who provides the fluidity and personality that create the most layered and emotionally fulfilling character of the film. From the blink of an eye to a raucous laugh to a gentle touch of his finger to a Darwinian ferocity, it is Serkis’ work that brings believability to the forefront. For the first time in Kong history, we see Kong moving on all fours – leaping, jumping, running. It is Kong’s actions that set the pace for the film once on Skull Island and Serkis is the one behind it.  And of course, what about those CGI guys? Calling on a good portion of his team from LOTR, they all outdo themselves here – and never more so than a pivotal “battle” sequence involving Kong trying to save Ann, while suspended over a gorge battling the Tyrannasaurus Three and falling from tree to tree, threatening to plummet all the way down before our very eyes. Mesmerizing. Dizzying. Heart-stopping. But just when you think you’ve seen it all, they break out the climactic ending with airplanes, Kong Kong and the Empire State Building! Whew!  From set design to costuming of 1933 Manhattan to the imaginative artisans responsible for Skull Island, there is not a deficiency anywhere in this film. Even Jackson and his co-writers, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, give the story a social conscience without becoming preachy or detracting from the original tale or the love at its very core.  Under the guiding and loving hand of Peter Jackson, “King Kong” proves to be mightier than any that have gone before and surely any that will come after. From start to finish, this is an extravaganza, a classic and a love story that you will long hold in the palm of your hand as Kong holds us in his."

"Sep 18, 2017",positive,"It's a pity that the film is such a miserable slog to start off, because the second that it arrives on Skull Island, it suddenly explodes into life."
"May 29, 2011",positive," Peter Jackson’s gripping 2005 remake rethinks the characters from the 1933 original, turning its stark Jungian fantasy into a soulless but skillful set of kinetic and emotional effects. Carl Denham (Jack Black)—originally a self-portrait of codirector Merian C. Cooper—is now a comic villain personifying, and thereby displacing, the movie’s own cynical contrivances and hypocritical exploitation. Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) has lost most of her hysteria and gained an Electra complex; the putative hero (Adrien Brody) is now, improbably, a playwright; a black sailor (Evan Parke) has been added to offset the jungle stereotypes; and Kong is anthropomorphized to the point of becoming first an audience stand-in (for whom Watts performs a few vaudeville turns), then a Christ figure."
"May 29, 2011",positive,"As it is a remake, it doesn't have the shock Lord Of The Rings possessed upon its release, but this is a beautiful beast of a B-movie, thrilling and touching."

"Oct 18, 2008",positive," Film critic Bob Mondello reviews director Peter Jackson's version of the classic 1933 movie, King Kong. This full-color, digitally generated Kong nearly doubles the length of the original — and Mondello says it's worth nearly every minute.      MELISSA BLOCK, host:      ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson has said that the 1933      black-and-white ""King Kong"" is the film that made him want to be a      moviemaker. Dino de Laurentiis had already revisited the story in 1976,      but Jackson wanted to look at it again.  And our critic Bob Mondello says      his $200 million remake is a beast that's a beauty.      BOB MONDELLO reporting:      There was never much doubt that the special effects would be spectacular.      The trailer makes the film look ""Jurassic Kong.""      (Soundbite of ""King Kong""; screaming)      MONDELLO:  But were you expecting much from the script?  Well, it takes a      while to get everybody to Skull Island, about 70 minutes, but it's time      extremely well-spent.  Nearly every line of dialogue fleshes out      characters you thought you knew but in ways that make them more      interesting.  Denham, the movie director who discovers Kong, for      instance--he used to be flashy, successful, well-financed.  Now he's a      jokey huckster played by Jack Black, who's on the run from creditors.      (Soundbite of ""King Kong"")      Mr. COLIN HANKS:  (As Preston) You're finished, Denham!      Mr. JACK BLACK:  (As Carl Denham) Don't worry, Preston.  I've had a lot      of practice at this.      MONDELLO:  Ann Darrow, the beautiful blond starlet, who Fay Wray played      almost entirely as a screamer, is now a plucky vaudeville performer with      a fairly complicated worldview as well as ideas about the character      she'll be playing.      (Soundbite of ""King Kong"")      Ms. NAOMI WATTS:  (As Ann Darrow) If she loves someone, it's doomed.      Mr. BLACK:  (As Carl Denham) Why is that?      Ms. WATTS:  (As Ann Darrow) Good things never last, Mr. Denham.      MONDELLO:  Little does she know.  And there are brand-new characters,      too:  a preening matinee idol, a pair of shipboard ""Heart of Darkness""      fans who look like Huck Finn and his buddy Jim, and a lovesick      screenwriter who's great with words for Ann on the page but not with      words to Ann on the ship.      (Soundbite of ""King Kong"")      Unidentified Man:  Good legs.  Sea legs.  Yeah, sea legs.  Yeah.  Not      that you don't have good legs.  I'm just making conversation.      MONDELLO:  Lots of character development on the way to Skull Island.  And      then the fleshing out gives way to flesh in danger in encounters with      lizards the size of trucks, bats the size of biplanes and bugs big enough      that instead of swatting them, our heroes shoot them.  Jackson knows the      original movie so well that there are lots of little treats for fans      along the way:  lines, music, even a dance that show up in slightly      altered form this time.      There are things that Jackson sells too hard:  a brontosaurus stampede      that wears out its welcome before it wears out the beasts, for instance.      But most of the time Jackson's enthusiasm for sensory overload carries      you along with him, in a T. rex sequence, for instance, that goes      airborne at about the point that any other director would be ending it      and turns into a vine-swinging, mind-blowing Ape du Soleil routine.      (Soundbite of ""King Kong""; growling; scream)      MONDELLO:  All this, plus the only tragic love story this year that comes      close to rivaling the one in ""Brokeback Mountain.""  Though it may not      have occurred to you that the way to Kong's heart is through his funny      bone, that's more or less what Jackson tells us.  Naomi Watts and a      digitally enhanced Andy Serkis make the interspecies bonding work, and,      happily, they do it without turning ""Kong"" into the tale of a girl and      her 25-foot-tall puppy.  In fact, at the screening I attended, there were      lots of teary-eyed adults as the lights came up after the credits.      This could have been the running time, of course; at three hours and      seven minutes, the film is undeniably longer than it really needs to be.      I estimate that if Jackson had taken an ax to all the repetitive, boring      stuff and sequences that don't wring you out like a dishrag, either      emotionally or from sheer panic, he could easily have made an excellent      ""King Kong"" at three hours and five minutes--easily.

"Jan 15, 2008",positive," There’s an old joke about a 500-pound gorilla sitting anywhere he wants to that suitably applies to the leading monkey of “King Kong”, and I ain’t talking its titular star. Having successfully transferred legendary literature epic “The Lord of the Rings” into one of the biggest cinematic franchises in history, director Peter Jackson has decided to follow that up with a three-hour remake of the classic that made him fall in love with films. With Jackson now in the position of being one of the few directors that’s a household name who can do what he wants, the syndrome has begun where people seem unable to stand up to him and question his decisions. Around the middle of 2005 it was announced that Universal had originally asked Jackson to deliver a cut of the film at around the two and a bit hours, but he wanted to go with his three hour version and they acquiessed. There’s always a tough line to draw between keeping a filmmaker’s vision intact and delivering a product that will do business – too much one way and a film becomes a lifeless soulless vehicle robbed of any emotional core, too much the other and it can become a bloated self-indulgent mess that only a small handful of film enthusiasts will ever really warm to. Maybe they should’ve put their foot down in this case. Kong is an entertaining adventure/action film that certainly looks like the $200+ million it cost, has some pretty intense action and popcorn thrills for all audiences, and thankfully understands that effects should be used to enhance the emotion and narrative of a story rather than be a crux for it to fall back on. Indeed at times whether it be the great opening shot in New York Zoo, to the drawn out reveal of Kong himself, it actually reaches points of great filmmaking. Yet too often it falls into traps – action sequences drag out way too long, setups range from clunky to great and back again, characters change behaviours and attitudes on a dime (whilst others never change at all), dialogue is clunky, humour is scant to non-existent, and pacing veers wildly. The net result is our level of interest often swamps between compelled and bored, the product too schizophrenic and unpolished to be of real interest or rewatch value. Jackson obviously has put a lot of love into the product and it shows, but unlike say “Lord of the Rings” in which he had so much background material that a three hour film barely covered it, here he only has Merian C. Cooper’s 1933 original story – one that was a cinematic classic in its time and certainly a big leap forward in terms of visual effects, but much like the similar “Star Wars” forty years later, wasn’t exactly a movie notable for its inventive narrative. Taking that familiar albeit thin story and stretching it over twice its original length means that Jackson has had to reinvent some key parts of it and does so with mixed success, never quite overcoming the inherit flaws that come with both the original story and stretching out said material to its current length. The first and weakest act sets up the characters and situation, but takes over an hour to do it. The logic here seems to be that the filmmakers are given time to develop most of these characters so that when they get killed, we’ll feel empathy for them. Trouble with that thinking is that we have to like or at least feel for all these characters and we don’t. Watts and to a lesser extent Black are the only ones of any interest as in that whole time they’re the only ones that get any development. Aside from that all we’ve got a bunch of one-dimensional forgettable gruff sailing crew including an utterly vain actor, a feral kid, a stern first mate who loves lecturing the feral kid, a geeky personal assistant, pudgy film crew members, and a Sawyer-esque Captain who only seems to complain and look brooding. Andy Serkis at least realises his human character of the ship’s cook is merely a caricature and plays up his cameo, yet others (eg. Brody) try their best with some clunky setup for their character and ultimately end up a waste of space. Despite some impressive background matte shots, the opening spends a bit too long on the ground of New York showing us Watts and Black having a run of bum luck and how fate brings them together. Still, these scenes are necessary setup so are understandably inserted in, and the two actors make the trite developments endurable. They also play better than some of the early scenes onboard the ship where we get to see the aforementioned dull as dishwater crew. What does work well in this first act is the suspense elements – Jackson delivering a handful of really well done scenes (the talk of the castaway pickup, the first entrance into the fog, the native attack and capture of Ann) that are appropriately foreboding and eerie, despite one clunky misfire with the mate giving a long winded monologue that bluntly draws to clueless Jimmy an analogy between their present situation and Joseph Conrad’s literary classic “Heart of Darkness”. This leads into the second act within Skull Island itself which essentially plays out like Jackson’s attempt to do an entry in the “Jurassic Park” series. Most of the film’s action is concentrated here in a bunch of quite thrilling action sequences that suffer from the Stephen Sommers syndrome of trying too hard – sacrificing credibility in favour of making its sequences bigger and wilder. A brontosaurus stampede is visually cool but goes on for far too long, is truly stupid in terms of how the human characters are involved, and contains some surprisingly slipshot effects. A vampire bat attack serves only as filler in an already too long film. A lot better is the ‘bug pit’ scene which is suitably icky and at least one of the few bits of the film that feels slightly fresh. There’s also a cool action sequence between Ann, Kong and some T-Rexes which starts out well, then turns into a overblown vine swinging affair before coming to a bone-crunching great ending. Where this act works is the establishment of Kong and Ann’s relationship, easily the film’s strongest aspect. Jackson’s languid pacing works to his advantage here, giving us a little time to get to know Kong as a character and understand him – such as a cute sequence in which Ann performs her vaudeville routine for him and he responds with fun baby-like tantrums and glee, or the very sad scene of his capture. The third act is back in New York and the famous climax which pretty much everyone is familiar with. Before it gets to that comes the theatre breakout, Brody looking soppy and Watts tearing up over going back into showbusiness before being snatched by Kong again. Like the second act there’s many sequences that drag out, most notably here Kong’s long rampage through New York and then transport of Darrow to the Empire State. However once it reaches the building, it becomes pretty thrilling with some great shots and visuals of the bi-plane attack. Performances are a mixed bag. Naomi Watts is a great actress and delivers as always with a quality job that, whilst not up with some of her other work, nevertheless shows her commitment and really engages us as an audience – especially in some of the quieter moments. Jack Black, like Will Ferrell, always seems to do the same old overblown schtick to me which I never particularly like. Yet here Jackson has him playing against his usual grain, more understated and serious than we’re used to seeing and it shows off a decent actor with potential underneath that could really shine. Not so well played is Brody, a man of obvious talent but a character so vapid and useless that Brody’s dour presence inhabiting it sucks the life off the screen, especially in the non-action scenes. The rest of the cast ranging from Bell to Hanks all do serviceable jobs but none of them are given decent roles so don’t get to do anything with their limited screen time. Visual effects are sometimes too rushed, but work well for the most part. The score is a little too bombastic, but again works well for the material for the most part. Pacing veers wildly. At times it drags on, at other points its almost skips too fast over some – Watts and Brody share a moment talking in the corridor on the ship, then suddenly it cuts to a very pretty scene with Naomi on the stern of the ship crying against the sunset during a film shoot. In that scene she spots Brody and gets emotional, and the next scene after that they make out in one of the cabins – the pair suddenly went from her insulting him to falling in love? What did I miss. With such a long voyage to the island, the film also quickly jumps from Kong’s capture to his return to New York, yet once there it takes an age before it hits the famous Empire State Building sequence. When ‘Kong’ was announced one wonders why did they need to remake it, and the final product offers no real answer to that question short of more impressive effects. Good remakes should improve upon their originals in every way, not just in flash bang but in the core substance as well – with the exception of the Kong/Anne relationship aspect, this fails to do that. If you have a love for the original story or film then most certainly you’ll see the fun and/or love this, if you don’t then while you probably will enjoy it, the assorted flaws in its structure will stand out like sore thumbs and ultimately take away from it. Ultimately ‘Kong’ is a good film – it’s not a soulless endeavour like many a tentpole blockbuster, its one obviously crafted with love and care and attention to detail. Yet it’s not a particularly memorable or even interesting one either, certainly not when compared too some of the other remake/sequel blockbusters of late which are more entertaining and emotionally engaging because they were tight and handled their familiar characters and plot elements far better. A bit more time in the editing room could’ve lifted it into great blockbuster territory.  Instead we’ve got a sporadically entertaining escapade that never captures our hearts like it so desperately wants too."
"Nov 1, 2007",positive," I gave my heart to Peter Jackson's gargantuan ""King Kong"" at the moment when the grizzled giant gorilla gave his heart to Naomi Watts's Ann Darrow. As the scene opens, they're on a high ledge over Skull Island, where the terrified wanna-be actress realizes the big galoot who carried her off in the palm of his hand is her protector, not her enemy. A vaudeville veteran, she tries to communicate by entertaining him with old routines. Kong is enchanted. A spark of understanding passes between beast and beauty, and lo, the cinema's most venerable interspecies love story is born again. There's a similar moment of cross-species magic in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" directed by Jackson's fellow New Zealander Andrew Adamson. It occurs early, when Lucy (Georgie Henley), the youngest of the Pevensie children, first emerges from the wardrobe into the enchanted land of Narnia. There she encounters a Faun (James McAvoy) with hooves for feet, an umbrella in his hands and a diffident English charm. Rather than pound his chest and roar, he invites her for tea. The two most eagerly anticipated Hollywood entertainments of the holiday season are packed to the brim with all manner of digitally enhanced beasts, mutants and slimy creatures. Centaurs and Minotaurs, talking beavers and the lion king Aslan populate ""Narnia,"" a faithful, politely rousing adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved tale. Dinosaurs, giant centipedes and the vilest (and most phallic) man-eating slugs you'll ever encounter pop up in the spectacular ""King Kong."" It's zoology that draws us into the theater--just ask Carl Denham (Jack Black), the flimflam moviemaker who exhibits Kong as the Eighth Wonder of the World. But in both epics, it's the intimate moments that keep us there. ""Narnia,"" brightly lit and kid-friendly, has an appealingly old-fashioned feel to it. Adamson, codirector of ""Shrek,"" wisely doesn't try to hip-ify the tale, leaving its curious blend of medieval pageantry, Christian fable and children's bedtime story intact. Lucy and her siblings have been packed off to the country to escape the Blitz but encounter greater perils in Narnia, which has been turned into an eternal winter under the cruel reign of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). ""Narnia's"" greatest concession to contemporary movie fashion is in its elaborate battle, which owes a debt to Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings."" But that's fitting: without the success of that movie, ""Narnia"" would never have been made. And without ""Rings"" on Jackson's resume, no one in his right mind would have given him three hours and $205 million for a ""King Kong"" remake. The gamble has paid off: ""Kong"" is a showy, state-of-the-art popcorn movie, faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original but generously adrenalized with the best effects money can buy. It takes more than an hour to get to Kong's entrance. The real fun doesn't begin until Denham, his screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) and the ship's crew crash on the island that time forgot, where the natives are beyond unfriendly, and the smallest bug is the size of an overfed housecat. From here the movie goes into a delirious, hourlong free fall of nonstop action, highlighted by a marauding herd of brontosauri. Many battles later, just as you're feeling enough is enough , Jackson moves on to the famous third act: Kong in chains in New York. Kong on the loose. Kong on the Empire State Building, his beloved blonde trying to ward off the lethal biplanes. The remarkable thing is how deeply you believe in their emotional bond. Aside from Black's and Brody's characters, most of the supporting roles are forgettable or worse. But you couldn't ask for a better ape. Credit goes not just to Weta Digital but to actor Andy Serkis, who, as he did with Gollum in ""Rings,"" provided the physical moves that are the template of Kong's character. But it's the look in Watts's eyes that seals the deal. Action-movie performances don't get much respect, but what Watts brings to this role is extraordinary--a daredevil's physicality, a wistful melancholia, an irony-free emotional investment and, needless to say, a scream that could shatter glass."
"Aug 4, 2007",positive," Peter Jackson’s King Kong is a massive fetish object — his Christmas gift to himself for bringing home the bacon (and the Oscars) with his Lord of the Rings trilogy. He’s unquestionably a master, and this is unquestionably a piece of work — an impassioned act of tribute to Jackson’s favorite movie, the hoary old 1933 original — but I can’t really call it a masterpiece. I found it diverting yet exhausting, a nineteen-course meal from a chef who insists on feeding you long after you’ve unbuckled your belt and called it quits. This Kong rumbles on for three hours and seven minutes, twice as long as the ’33 version, and also twice as long as Jackson’s previous (and, I continue to think, his best) ode to star-crossed love, Heavenly Creatures. Yet the movie’s length isn’t really the issue (aside from a few flabby spots, it flies by); the problem is Jackson’s eagerness to wow you. He’s like a little kid making you sit through an epic re-enactment of his fantasies using his toy dinosaurs and gorillas. And not just one or two toys, but dozens of them. When the tramp steamer Venture finally arrives at the desolate Skull Island (after about an hour of screen time), the heroes — including struggling actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), obsessed moviemaker Carl Denham (Jack Black), and playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) — spend lots of time running away from dinos, bats, large and disgusting bugs, and a director with a serious case of overindulgence. After a while the spectacle becomes like a blunt object grinding into your forehead. In all versions of this tale, the beast’s tragic error is to fall for a blonde. Jackson has blithely retained the material’s sexist and racist elements; in some schools of thought, the story is a warning to black men to stay away from white women. Naomi Watts’ Ann Darrow is a comedienne who wins Kong’s heart by doing Vaudeville routines. The erotic subtext of the 1933 version (who can forget Kong pulling off Fay Wray’s clothes and sniffing his fingertips?) and also the 1976 version is gone, replaced by a sort of teddy-bear affection that goes both ways: Ann and Kong think of each other as lovable pets. She also asserts herself with Kong, but not nearly as much — or as amusingly — as Jessica Lange in the much-criticized ’76 remake. King Kong is curiously humorless for a movie about a 25-foot simian going mooshy over a dame. Even at its sprawling length, it scarcely has room to breathe; Jackson is always rushing along to the next thing, and even the sporadic attempts at beauty (like the overtly Hallmark-card moment when Ann and Kong enjoy a sunset and she teaches him the word “beautiful,” a moment sappily reprised at the end) are banal. Happily lost inside his WETA kingdom in New Zealand, Jackson appears to have forgotten what people are about. He gets a terrible performance from Adrien Brody, who seems restless — he’s not a green-screen actor by temperament. Jack Black does Orson Welles lite, cranking his damn camera when all hell is breaking loose; Jackson clearly identifies with Carl Denham’s relentless showman’s instinct, but all we see is an arrogant twit willing to get everyone killed just to make a name for himself. Some of King Kong is entertaining, if oversold. A fight between Kong and one T-rex would be fine (and was fine in the original), but Jackson has Kong fend off three of them at once, until we can finally enjoy a showdown between the big ape and the toughest of the dinos. The New York of the 1930s is, to use a cliché, lovingly recaptured, though it’s a New York known only in movies. King Kong is far from a failure of energy or imagination — Jackson’s enthusiasm is often infectious, and the critical rhapsodies probably refer to the sheer big, thick, movie-movieness of the thing. I succumbed more than once; its good parts are enough to recommend it, with serious reservations. But, dear God, I wish Jackson would shake off his addiction to gigantism, his apparent need to punch everything up three times as much as it needs to be. As the creators of another big-monster remake a few years ago found out, size isn’t everything."
"Jul 14, 2007",positive,"Mr. Jackson not only improves on the original, he somehow seems to create the film that King Kong was always meant to be."
"Jul 10, 2007",positive," Not just the ape, but the budget. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson forked out millions of his own dosh to finish this film the way he wanted. It has that labour-of-love look about it. You could pitch the story from the back of a fag packet. Hollywood director accompanies skeleton crew, plus a couple of actors, to an island off Sumatra, where they discover a giant gorilla that takes a shine to the lead actress. By means never entirely believable, they bring the beast to New York where it is exhibited in chains at a theatre on Broadway. Ape escapes, finds girl and climbs The Empire State Building. Cue army and air force. Much screaming. This latest version (no 3) is so well made that discrepancies in the script and holes in the plot don't make any difference, because you sit there with your jaw on the floor, amazed by the bare brilliance of it. Jackson takes his time to set the scene, gather his characters, find the boat. The director, Carl Denham (Jack Black), has been grounded by his producers for wasting their money on footling safari pictures. He grabs a camera and legs it out of there, picking up an unemployed vaudeville clown, called Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), from outside a burlesque theatre and tricking playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into staying on board. By the time they are at sea, there is a warrant out for Denham's arrest and Ann is finding Driscoll's advances anything but unwelcome. They reach Skull Island in a fog and immediately are faced by natives, who live in caves, protected from the rest of the island by a high wall and a gaping chasm. They are not the topless patronise-my-ethnic-purity types, who can be bribed with Hershey bars. They are vicious, savage and superstitious. The first thing they do, after subduing the white invaders, is string Ann up in a wooden contraption that carries her across the chasm, as a sacrifice to the great Kong. That part of the island where the natives never go is like Conan Doyle's The Lost World, only scarier, because the animals and insects have been supersized, which makes you wonder about Mrs Kong and the Kong kiddies. Where are they? Are they? If not, why not? Resistance becomes futile at this point. Ann's ability to create a kind of rapport with this wild creature is neither sentimental, nor beyond belief. Kong saves her many times from the carnivorous dinosaurs and she repays him with her trust. It is unspoken, unexplored, and due to Watts' performance and Kong's empathy the centre holds, for this is the heart and blood of the film - Beauty and the Beast. King Kong is a B-movie, dressed up to look like the real thing. The story - Edgar Wallace had a hand in it, which explains a lot - is pure pulp. The romance between a starlet and a big monkey is on a par with those daft sci-fi flicks about blobs taking over Mid-Western small towns. And yet Jackson treats it with the utmost respect and MAKES you believe, not by throwing money at the CGI bods (okay, he does!), but by caring so much, it's contagious. Like Spielberg, he is a film fan, neither arty farty, nor a snob. He understands that genres have rules and you break them at your peril. Michael Cimino broke them in Heaven's Gate. James Cameron didn't in Titanic. Jackson's King Kong works on several levels, as a monster movie, a love story, a Boys Own adventure, a thriller, a period piece, and if looks could kill, we'd all be dead, because every scene and every location has been immaculately prepared. It is not difficult to think of half a dozen plot defects - what's Ann doing walking about the streets of New York at night in a white satin dress with snow on the ground in mid winter? - but they really don't matter. The centre holds. When you walk out of the cinema at the end, something has changed. Is it the world? Is it you? Did the earth move? Ann teaches Kong a sign word. He uses it tentatively as they sit together at the top of The Empire State Building, with the sun coming up over the Hudson and the biplanes circling. The word is ""beautiful""."

"Jul 1, 2006",positive," At one point in King Kong, Naomi Watts's Ann Darrow is desperately trying to read the mind of the giant gorilla which has claimed her as his new toy. She fears that he's already bored with her and is about to hurl her off a cliff, so she tries to entertain him with the moves she's learnt from her career in vaudeville. She bounces through a soft shoe shuffle, segues into an Egyptian dance, tosses in a handstand and somersault and finishes with a little juggling, but at the end of the routine he looks more bored than ever. He could be one of the jaded moguls who ruled the Hollywood jungle in 1933, the year in which the film is set - Harry Cohn, say, whose nickname happened to be King Cohn. But as his gaze softens and he turns towards the horizon, Ann realises that all he really wants is somebody to appreciate the sunset with him. Kong is no King Cohn after all. He's an aesthete. This doesn't mean that writer-director Peter Jackson's highly anticipated Kong remake is skimping on the schlockier attractions of Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack's venerable creature feature. Kong's home, Skull Island, is Jurassic Park-on-Sea, teeming with an array of land, sea, air and swamp monsters, bent on demolishing all living things as grotesquely as possible. And they really are experts in the art. You laugh; you shudder in old-fashioned B-picture style, without ever losing sight of the fact that what you're watching is anything but B-grade. It's the most playful film of the year - as well as one of the most serious. Loss of innocence is one of its themes. Humankind's disconnectedness from the natural world is another. But it's also about the evil that can lurk behind the old Hollywood mantra ""the show must go on"". Or as the film's quasi-villain, the movie director Carl Denham, puts it when he conceives the idea of trapping Kong and exhibiting him as a freak of nature: ""... we can all have a piece of it for the price of an admission ticket"". Admittedly, there's nothing new in that line. The Carl Denham character in the original film was prompted by the same sentiment. But Jackson's version adds edge and ambivalence. Played with beady-eyed zest by the comic Jack Black, who's been given all the best lines, this Denham is not just a huckster. He's a passionate huckster who fancies himself as an artist. This injects a Faustian note - as if Jackson is sending up his own obsession with movie-making by floating the suggestion that he, too, could be tempted into selling his soul in return for putting something as remarkable as Kong up on screen. The film begins in Depression Manhattan, where the animals in Central Park Zoo are only marginally more miserable than the New Yorkers forced to find shelter in the shantytown next door. Yet the city's glories are there as well, in the shimmering scenes of lights and skyline. Although it's largely a digital creation, augmented by sets built in New Zealand, the film's New York has a wonderful solidity. The tone of the script, lightly pitched between satire and schmalz, also carries you over the flimflam involved in getting Denham and his film crew aboard a tramp steamer bound for the island. With him are his stars: Bruce Baxter, played by Kyle Chandler, having fun as a preening wannabe matinee idol, and Ann Darrow, who finds herself falling in love with the screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). Later, when she's kidnapped by the islanders and given to Kong as a present, it's Driscoll who leads the rescue party. As for Kong himself, although the computer has played a large part in his creation, he could never be considered as anything less than real. Jackson has again drawn on the talents of Andy Serkis (Gollum from The Lord of the Rings) and, short of wearing a gorilla suit, Serkis has done everything possible to slip inside Kong's skin. As before, his facial movements were recorded by the computer, but this time they have been adapted to the bone and muscle structure of a silverback gorilla. While the result avoids Disneyfied anthropomorphism, it leaves you in no doubt of what Kong is thinking and feeling. And what he feels for Ann is something pretty complex. The script wisely rejects all sexual innuendoes, along with the idea of love at first sight. It's only after saving her from the island's other horrors and after she's adopted him as her protector that he responds to her charms, hitching her on to his shoulder with the gruff insouciance of John Wayne. Yet it's a relationship that never loses its innocence. Later, in Manhattan, we get a marvellously lyrical King Kong on ice moment when the two of them venture on to a frozen lake in Central Park and slide around like children. And in the climactic sequence atop the Empire State Building, they reprise their first meeting by watching a sunrise together - the last Kong will see. For out of that sunrise comes a swarm of biplanes, out to shoot him down. As he tries to fend them off, it's as if he's making a last-ditch stand against the future. Not surprisingly, the script keeps the 1933 film's famous concluding line - ""...beauty killed the beast"". But this time it has a poignant new resonance. As I said, this Kong is an aesthete - as is Peter Jackson."

"Feb 11, 2006",positive,"  Watching Peter Jackson's version of King Kong, it is abundantly clear that the man feels as strongly about the original 1933 film as he did about Tolkein's Lord of the Rings books. One can really feel how earnestly he guided this film, paying homage to the original while expanding on it more than just a little bit. Unfortunately the ""expansion"" is one of the problems with the movie, but I'll get to that in a bit.   I don't suppose I really need to go into the story itself, but there are a few changes from and additions to this version when compared to the 1933 film. Here, Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is shown to be a stage performer at the outset of the film, basically doing Vaudeville shows during the Great Depression in order to make a living. Time is spent up front showing the state of things in New York City in regards to the struggle to survive in that devastating economic downturn (to great effect). We meet her co-perfomers, a tight-knight little family including an elderly gentleman who passes for a father figure for her, and we get to know at least Ann and this gentleman well enough in the few early minutes of the film to really feel for them when the theater where they perform is unceremoniously closed down.   Cut to Carl Denham (played by an unusually subdued Jack Black) in a meeting with ""money men"", trying to pitch his movie-in-progress and get more money to go shoot on location at the mysterious island indicated on a map which has just come into his possession. He is portrayed as a man with a vision throwing his cinematic pearls before monied, but ignorant swine. The financiers have already sunk $40,000 into his picture (big bucks back then) and decide to cut their losses and sell off what Jack has filmed so far as stock footage.   He talks his way onto the ship despite the Captain not trusting him and also wrangles playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) into coming along in order to finish the only partially done screenplay. It turns out that the only reason Ann decided to come along was because Driscoll was writing the film and she was a big fan of his plays. So one major difference is that instead of a lowly sailor, Driscoll is a well known and sophisticated playwright. We're also introduced to Hayes (Evan Parke, who seems to play a role closer to that of the original Driscoll) and Jimmy (Jamie Bell) as a young former stowaway out to prove himself.   Finally, we find ourselves out to sea and on the way to the island. It took a very long time to get to this point and we also spend what seemed to me to be an inordinate amount of time getting to Skull Island. Peter Jackson took a while developing the relationship between Jack and Ann in order to make it more real for the audience. The problem is that a lot of that effort went to support nothing more than Jack's determination to not leave Ann behind. The real relationship in this movie is between Ann and Kong (some of you reading this, don't even go there).   Fortunately, while a lot of time is spent showing the development of the Kong/Ann relationship, it is time well-spent. Andy Serkis (the actor whose expressions/movement is behind the CGI Kong) did a phenomenal job (as did the animators) of making Kong real. Much like the original filmmakers, the idea here was that the more fearsome Kong was at the beginning of the film, the more we would feel upon his death. King Kong and Naomi Watts really stole the show here, no question.   The time spent on screen showing the both of them was a joy to watch. The process of the relationship changing from fear and curiousity to geniune caring and concern was completely believable. However when the action shifted to the rest of the crew, things did start to drag. Although the effects were spectacular, there did come times where I found myself thinking ""isn't this scene over yet?"". With a remake of such an iconic film, one cannot help but make comparisons, and many times throughout the film I asked myself why this one took three hours to tell the same story the original did so effectively in half that time.   Strangely, the one character that I thought was going to be closest to the original was Carl Denham, and he really wasn't. I actually would have preferred to see Jack Black tap into some of his over the top energy to portray Denham more like the barely supressed carnival barker that Robert Armstrong played in 1933. Jack just never worked for me, but not for the reasons I had expected going in. I think it was more due to Peter Jackson's take on the character than the acting itself. This Denham was more ""human"", yes, but he didn't strike me as the kind of man that would have the sheer force of will required to bring back the great King Kong.   Towards the end of the film, the scene where Kong is introduced to the paying audience was quite well done and effective, right through to where he escapes his bonds and rampages in Times Square. There is a new sequence in this film showing how Kong calms down once he finds Ann, and how they go off and reconnect like old friends until their peace is shattered by the military coming after Kong.   Of course they eventually end up at the top of the Empire State Building, but here again, things seem to go on longer than they need to just for the sake of more screen time with Kong and special effects. When it does come down to the end and Jackson focuses in once more on the characters it does all come together once more, except for two things: The weakly delivered ""It was beauty done killed the beast."" by Jack Black, and the final scene between Kong and Naomi Watts which looked like it was lifted straight from the end of Titanic.   Final notes: CGI effects, especially for Kong were flawless. I did not for a second think I was looking at a CGI creation. The scenes on the island with the natives might be too intense for the 7 and under crowd... some of them looking REALLY creepy and in extreme close ups that even creeped me out a bit.   All in all a really good movie that could have been a great movie if it had 30 minutes or so trimmed from it. Of course the DVD version will probably be 4 hours long and will no doubt suffer for it.

	If there's a common theme to movies released in 2005, it has to be an overly long running time. In my opinion, the perfect running time for movies is 90 minutes for a comedy and 2 hours for a drama. Far too often this year though, especially in these last months running up to award season, we've seen far, far too many 2 and a half to three hour length movies. King Kong, at a full three hours is at least an hour too long. Like a meal of good cooking, it all tastes great, there's simply too much of it and you'll be fully sated long before it is over. 
	The set up to the movie, which isn't that complicated, but takes a way too long to get going, involves a down on her luck vaudeville actress, Ann Darrow (Watts) in 1930's New York who runs into an even more down on his luck movie director, Carl Denham (Black) who's about to sail off to an uncharted island to film what he hopes will be his masterpiece. When his star actress quits he hires Ann and along with a film crew, the script writer, Jack Driscoll (Brody), and the ship's crew of seedy adventurers, set off in a tramp steamer for their destination on Skull Island and with their destiny. 
	An hour into the movie and they finally arrive on the island where they are greeted by the not very friendly natives who kill several of the crew and kidnap Ann so that they can offer her to the giant ape Kong, whom they seem to revere as a god. By the time the gargantuan gorilla makes his appearance to swoop Ann off into the jungle, over an hour of the movie has already elapsed. 
	The middle and longest portion of the film involves the misfit crew's attempts to rescue Ann. This mainly involves them alternately running from and fighting a variety of CGI monsters, ranging from dinosaurs to giant insects. Most surprisingly to me was the fact that some of the special effects are obviously quite phony. Particularly when they are running from the Brontosauruses and the cliff is crumbling beneath them. Other scenes however, are both exciting and well put together. 
	While the crew is blindly crashing through the jungle, Ann, in the arms of Kong is being forced to contend with Tyrannosaurus Rexes and other creepier denizens of the island. In the movie's best action scene, Kong does battle with three of the Rexes in a knock down, drag out fight scene. 
	By the time Ann is rescued and Kong is captured, you are left feeling completely glutted on CGI action scenes. And I was also left wondering just how in the hell did all of these monsters manage to live for so long on one god damn island. I mean, just how big is the fricking place? The final climatic scene in New York is very well done, with the exception of the silliest moment in the movie when Kong and Ann share a “romantic"" moment in Central Park. Coming as it does during one of the tensest scenes in the movie makes it particularly annoying. Which brings up another confusing aspect of the film. Is the relationship between Kong and Ann supposed to be romantic or that of father and daughter? Either way, it's a little disturbing. 
	As an action film Kong would have worked superbly if only it had about an hour of its running time trimmed from the final release. Obviously however, no one was prepared to tell Peter Jackson this, coming as he was so hot off of the success of Lord of the Rings. Because of this the final result for King Kong is that of a bloated and severely flawed movie. 
The Lord of the Ring's movies were based on a series of long winded books. It made sense that the movies were three hours plus. King Kong is based on a movie that ran just over an hour and a half. There is no reason for it to be so long. 
	Peter Jackson did the impossible with The LOTR movies. He turned an impossibly long, complicated story into film masterpieces. With all of the success from that series Jackson may have become too full of himself. King Kong is just the story of a bored giant ape who likes hanging out with an actress. 
	As Scott wrote, the action scenes seem to go on forever, whereas they are the meat and potatoes to the movie, they do not come until after an hour of screen time. At that point in the movie you are almost ready for the climax of the film. While the main characters battle for their lives on the island my 10 year old asked if the movie was almost over. He was not bored with the movie. In fact he has a stuffed King Kong because he liked the movie so much. It just seemed at that point in the movie that is should be about over. 
	I actually enjoyed the first hour of the film where Kong is no where to be seen. However, it almost feels like a different movie. For this movie it should have been edited. Ann is an out of work vaudeville actress. We see her perform and talk backstage to fellow thespians. Early on she shares a couple of emotional scenes with an older gentleman and then says goodbye to him. He is never seen in the movie again. She gets turned down for a role and referred to a burlesque theater. All of that could have been cut. Start the movie with Carl looking for an actress. He finds her like he does in the movie. 
	The biggest problem with King Kong is that Kong is just an overgrown ape. How can the audience really invest any emotion into a movie about a monster? Okay, so he is a lonely monster who saves Ann a bunch of times, but Kong starts the whole thing by grabbing her in the first place. So he does have what is coming to him. 
	Is there some messages in the film about leave nature alone, or we can all learn to understand each other no matter what our species. I have no idea? I just saw an action packed, special effects loaded film that went by fairly quickly for its running time, but still could have been trimmed for better results. 
	The original King Kong, in comparison to the new one, had cheesy special effects and corny dialogue. Peter Jackson's expensive new version is visually amazing 99% of the time. But, as both my brothers pointed out, 2005 Kong is bloated and slowly paced especially when contrasted with the 1933 original. 
	I agree with Eric, the movie should have started with the search for the actress like the 1933 version, which opens with a shot of the tramp steamer getting ready to leave port. This is followed by a short scene where Denham meets Ann Darrow and convinces her to join his adventure. 
	Also most of the journey to Skull Island should have been cut. We really don't need to get to know all the crew members, most of them will die or at the very least be gone from the picture by the time the action switches to New York City. And to be perfectly honest none of the three main human characters are all that interesting anyway. The ape has always been the star of the story. 
	The CGI action is fun but it crosses the line of believability too often. For example during the brontosaurus stampede you have Denham and Driscoll running around and between the feet of huge dinosaurs. This goes on for quite a while, but of course neither one is trampled. When main characters can so easily escape dangers in this impossible manner it lessens any real tension. Sure some of the smaller characters die gruesome deaths but there has to be a logical reason for the main stars to live beyond just the fact that they are the stars. Know what I mean? 
	The New York City scenes are very exciting and they do manage a bit of an emotional punch. The climax on the Empire State Building is beautifully shot. Still I had stopped caring long before that. 
	In all honesty I'm glad this version has failed to surpass the original. Cheesy special effects and corny dialogue notwithstanding the 1933 version is still a superior movie."

"Dec 28, 2005",positive," Peter Jackson’s 500-pound vision exceeds his $207-million budgetary grasp occasionally in his epic take on King Kong — mostly whenever the great ape’s not around. Kong’s isolation as the dominant animal on Skull Island leads to insecurity, boredom, disdain, anger — all soothed by the unlikely understanding of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), an actress who knows a thing or two about the bum hand of fate. Sure, it’s impressive to watch a big, angry monkey upend foliage like a Tennessee Williams character would furniture. But Kong is a fighter with unquestionable issues, emotions and power. He’s identifiably human, but also frighteningly animal. This computer-generated creation is an exceptionally expressive effect that grabs both the throat and the heart. Actor Andy Serkis provided the same actorly basis for Kong as he did for Gollum in Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings films; their work here, along with the visual-effects crew, sets an unmatchable standard for the medium that demands to be seen on the largest screen possible. It’s unmatchable because the movie trots out a parade of other computer creatures that pale in comparison — dinosaurs, gigantic beetles and nasty, slimy, sharp-toothed worms that like to suck on their prey. (That last monster, though, does provide a horrific, unsettling end to one of the film’s supporting characters.) A brontosaurus stampede is filled with too-frantic editing and digital clutter, as is Kong’s display of physical prowess when taking on not one, not two, but three T-Rexes at once. The action is leaner, crisper and more brutish when Kong fights one antagonist — such as he does toward the end of the T-Rex sequence as the brawl continues on a set of vines. Giving Kong a Smackdown-style card of villains seems even more unnecessary given the film’s last act — the beast’s majestic, mind-blowing and flawless solo rampage through New York City. Whether apocalyptically destroying a theater, discovering snow for the first time or making his perilous climb atop the Empire State Building, Kong’s final hour also is the film’s finest. At an unnecessary three hours, the takes a while to find its sea legs, trying to drum up the same hardscrabble beats of Depression-era squalor as Cinderella Man. It doesn’t quite get there. Not surprisingly, the movie is more in tune with the passion and madness of filmmaking, embodied by hearty helpings of Heart of Darkness symbolism and a surprisingly dark turn by Jack Black as director Carl Denham. (Think Paul Reiser’s character from Aliens, always trying to turn a profit.) Threatened with a cutoff of studio funds for his latest creature feature and without a leading lady, Denham hijacks his footage and hightails it for the New York docks. There, a crusty crew awaits to sail him and his filmmakers to what they’ve been told is a Singaporean film shoot. Along the way, Denham picks up down-on-her-luck vaudevillian Ann to play the lead and hijacks harried playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody, kicking digital butt Brendan Fraser style) to provide him a suitable script. Ann and Jack fall in love, perhaps as convincingly as is possible in a three-hour movie about a gorilla. Mid-voyage, Denham reveals to everyone that they’re really headed for the mysterious Skull Island — a location on a treasure map (source never revealed) that Jackson films the first mention of so as to suggest it’s the SCARIEST PLACE EVER. A foggy run aground tunes the violins for the symphony of destruction that is to come. Surviving the truly grotesque, demonic cult of dead-eyed Skull Island natives is but the first of the film and boat crew’s problems. When they kidnap Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to the mighty Kong, Jack battles the island’s creepy crawlies to save her and Denham gets the idea that live theater might trump movies after all — especially if Kong could be the star of the show. If Jack and Ann aren’t quite the convincing couple, Ann and Kong certainly are. When all escape attempts fail, she entertains. It turns out that Kong is a sucker for slapstick in a sensible scene showing a human appeasing the ape in a non-meal manner. Ann and Kong’s communication with one hand gesture sets up a particularly heartbreaking moment in a transfixing climax that balances spectacle with intimacy and violence with restraint. It’s a stupendous close to a breathlessly paced film that could have been an all-time great had Jackson and company kept their focus more squarely on the title character."

"Dec 21, 2005",positive," A movie that proves the old adage, “a fool and his monkey are soon parted,” King Kong is every bit as big as you’ve heard — and filled in with something like equal parts inspiration and cinematic hot air. Its 187-minute running time is undeniably too much and really does seem born more of Peter Jackson’s desire to attain the scope of his Lord of the Rings films than out of any dictates of the story. Let’s face it, this is a pretty simple tale: Overzealous filmmaker goes to uncharted island to make a movie, finds giant ape, brings ape back to New York; ape then breaks loose, causing death and destruction, climbs Empire State Building and gets shot to death by airplanes. Everything else is incidental, and while the incidentals are fun, there’s a limit. Without thinking about it too hard, I could name at least three things that could be trimmed or cut out entirely that wouldn’t hurt this film. These things are just overkill — and not Jacksonian overkill, either. They feel more in the realm of Spielberg or Lucas in a kind of simplistic “more is better” manner. In other words, if the 1933 Kong fought one T. rex, the 2005 model will take on at least three of them. If the sailors ran from a brontosaurus in the original, they’ll be imperiled by a veritable stampede’s worth here. If our old simian buddy picked up one woman, saw it wasn’t Fay Wray and blithely dropped her to her doom, Jackson’s big monkey will do it in his search for Naomi Watts four times — to a point where you almost expect the venerable ape to grumble, “Sure are a lot of blondes in this town.” That said, King Kong is a pretty remarkable film, and one that was made by someone who is quite obviously nuts about the original (evident even from the beginning, when the opening credits … er … ape the design of the ones from 1933.) Jackson’s Kong is as much homage as remake — and that may well be its strength and its weakness in one package. The director clearly intended to honor the 1933 film, and for the most part, he has. The problem is that he’s honoring not just what the movie was in 1933, but what it has become since then in our collective pop-culture consciousness. When King Kong came out in 1933, it was a somewhat different experience than it seems from the vantage point of 70-plus years later. That’s in part because movies that were frightening years ago have become cozily familiar old friends now. But it’s also because of changes made to the film in subsequent releases. It used to be a common practice to re-release popular titles to theaters — a practice that posed a problem for films made in the early 1930s. What was permissible in the early years of sound was often not so after 1934, when the Production Code came into being. To re-issue a film after that point, the movie had to be made to conform to those later censorship standards, meaning that the films were often recut to remove “offensive” material. As a result, later releases of King Kong were shorn of scenes of violence and sexuality. Footage of Kong undressing Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and subjecting her to some rather indelicate scrutiny were taken out, as were scenes of Kong chomping on natives and grinding them underfoot. (Ironically, no one caught the fact that Fay Wray’s top comes off when she emerges from the water at one point, meaning we actually see more of her anatomy than we do of Naomi Watts in these less-censorious times.)  If you see the movie today, you see it as it was originally released, since the censored footage was cut back into it in the early ’70s. But the film attained much of its legendary status in its truncated form, which made King Kong less threatening, less horrific and more sympathetic than he had been when the film was made. Kong was always as much victim as monster, but he was a monster — something that’s largely absent in Jackson’s version, which plays up the sympathy angle. Moreover, Jackson’s film buys into the fantastic notion put forth by several essayists over the years that there’s a bond between the big fellow and Ann Darrow — a nonsensical notion, since the original Ann Darrow spends the entire film screaming her head off whenever she deals with Kong. The one comment she makes about him is, “I don’t like to look at him, Jack. It reminds me of that horrible day on the island” — hardly an expression of simian devotion. Jackson’s Ann (Watts) is a different proposition, one grounded in the bonding idea. That change is understandable, since the days of selling a mere “damsel in distress” are long over. Making Darrow a more active participant in the proceedings is only reasonable. The problem is that this not only robs Kong of even more menace, but — as with so much of the film — Jackson takes it too far. By the time the new Darrow puts herself in harm’s way a second time (and after Kong has taken pains to try to keep her safe), the film topples over into absurdity. Again, you expect the ape himself to utter a complaint: “Good Lord, woman, won’t you please stay put?” (I won’t even get into the gentle breeze atop the Empire State Building that merely ruffles Darrow’s skirt in a decorous manner.) Setting the new film in 1933 was smart. The story works better in that time period, not in the least because disposing of an overgrown gorilla posed a considerably greater problem then than it would now. And Jackson’s film brilliantly captures the era, though one might rightly question the choice of the late-1940s Decca recording of Al Jolson’s “I’m Sitting on Top of the World” on the soundtrack to set the mood rather than the 1925 Brunswick version. (There’s an even more debatable use of a 1950s Peggy Lee recording of “Bye Bye Blackbird” elsewhere in the film.) Many of Jackson’s expansions are well-judged. In the original, it was never clear how filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) planned to give his latest documentary a love interest and a plot by simply dragging along an actress and a trunk of costumes. Turning seaman Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) into playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), who’s along to write the script, and throwing in a leading man, Bruce Baxter (TV actor Kyle Chandler), makes more sense. It’s also a bit cheeky on two levels. Making Ann’s romantic interest a writer is almost certainly a nod to Fay Wray’s real-life penchant for marrying writers (John Monk Saunders, Robert Riskin) or becoming involved with them (Clifford Odets). The inclusion of a preening leading man (named Bruce, no less) suggests a casual distaste for Bruce Cabot as the hero in the original — a suspicion aggravated by Cabot being the only star of the original not included in the film’s dedication! There’s room for criticizing the changes to the character of Carl Denham (now played by Jack Black), who is much more an unsympathetic, egomaniacal opportunist here than in the original. Black’s Denham has more in common with other unregenerate characters of the era — think of turning newspaper editor Walter Burns in The Front Page into a filmmaker — than he does with Armstrong’s characterization. If it is wrong-headed, it’s nonetheless deliberate. This Denham is actually given a line originally assigned to a newspaper photographer — “Let him roar! It makes a great picture” — that helps to fuel Kong’s fury to the point that he breaks loose and runs riot in New York, making Denham even more culpable. (That this Denham sometimes resembles Jackson himself is another point to ponder on a self-awareness level.) The addition of a sub-plot involving a sailor (Evan Parke, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) and his young protege (Jamie Bell, Billy Elliot) is a strange case of the film wanting to stretch its fantasy/adventure quality and imbue it with some deeper meaning (the protege is reading Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and finally realizes it’s not really an adventure story at all). But this doesn’t really go anywhere. The screen time devoted to this subplot would have been better used explaining the rift between Darrow and Driscoll that exists by the time they get back to New York. And it would have certainly helped to have incorporated Denham into the film’s last act. As it stands, he simply vanishes once Kong escapes and then wanders back into the film to deliver the famous last line — and it feels sloppy, as if someone remembered he needed to return for that purpose at the last minute. Fans of the original should be delighted by the choice of recreating the original film’s “sacrifice” of Darrow as the “bride of Kong” as part of the stage show Denham puts on with the ape in New York. But this is a double-edged sword, since the use of the original Max Steiner score on the soundtrack for these scenes calls attention to the fact that James Newton Howard’s new score is rarely more than serviceable. (In fairness to the composer, he was called in at the last minute to score the film after a falling out between Jackson and composer Howard Shore.) Fans of Jackson will get a kick out of a crate labeled, “Sumatran Rat Monkey,” a reference to Jackson’s zombie movie, Dead Alive (aka Braindead). Of course, it’s a simple matter to pick the movie apart. You can do the same with the original — starting with questioning why you’d build a wall to keep a giant ape out and then include a door big enough for him to come through (not to mention how you kept from becoming monkey chow while the wall was being built). I’m inclined to cut the movie some slack in a lot of areas, because it does have a cumulative mythic power, regardless of any missteps. King Kong is, however, a flawed work — sometimes in surprising ways. While the new Kong himself is a marvel (I never felt I was looking at an effect, but at a living creature), the dinosaurs are another matter. They come across as something less than believable — more like escapees from Jurassic Park than anything to do with King Kong — and the effects in the frankly preposterous stampede are wanting. Still, Jackson’s King Kong is overall a pretty impressive show that definitely deserves to be seen in its theatrical incarnation. This is not a movie to wait for on DVD.

"Dec 18, 2005",positive," Carl Denham (Black) has a vision.  Okay, well, Leonard Cohen would call it a scheme.  He’s known for going and making safari movies, but now his backers want more.  So he’s lined up a name actor (Kyle Chandler) and a name actress…oops, she’s dropped out of the project.  Denham has to find a replacement actress (Watts), get his screenwriter (Brody) to finish his work, and somehow convince everyone that they’re filming in Singapore, when in fact they’re headed to a place called Skull Island with nothing but a strange map of how to get there and a load of bad checks.  Once there, however, they’re going to get much more than they bargained for.  Much more indeed.  Mooha. Okay, it’s nearly pointless to worry about spoilers for a film, at least for major plot points.  The only thing more ridiculous would be being concerned about the end of Hamlet or something.  We know where this is going.  So the trick with this film is to make the ride to get there an enjoyable one.  With Jackson on board to make the film he’s been wanting to make since before Lord of the Rings, can the ride be worthwhile? 
[ad#longpost]The answer is of course, an infuriating yes and no.  First, let’s talk about what works.  The action sequences on Skull Island are some of the most ridiculous things you will see in your life.  Just when you think things can’t get more insane, they do.  Again.  And again.  And you’re wrong so many times you just give up and understand you’re in the grips of a director who’s absolutely out of his freaking mind.  They are amazing.  Imagine Jurassic Park (with a touch of Starship Troopers) on some serious acid…and you’re close.  And the effects are mind-blowing.  I had to continually remind myself that they did not, in fact, build a twenty-five foot tall ape for the movie.  Just like Gollum, there’s no problem accepting Kong as a full-blown character.  I’m not sure if it was the sound that they used or what, but everything felt like it had weight.  Impacts had real impact.  When Kong lays a smackdown he lays a Smack-down and you’re wincing because it’s just so damn real. Of course, the effects, amazing as they are, are only part of the equation.  Andy Serkis (who also is unrecognizable as the cook) brings Kong to life like he did with Gollum, and his performance is impressive as well.  I can’t wait to delve into the behind-the-scenes stuff and see the split screen where they show him doing his thing, before and after.  Serkis is just gifted, that’s all there is to it.  The stand-out amongst the human cast is Jack Black, because he’s just got a lot to work with.  And he’s perfect for the part of the slightly sleazier Carl Denham we have here.  Watts and Brody are good for what they’re there to do, but Watts gets to fall in love with a monkey and Brody gets to lose out to a monkey.  So they’re limited in material. This brings us to some of the problems.  First up, the film is over three hours long and most assuredly did not need to be.  It takes a while to get started and doesn’t really start to flow until you get to the island.  If you had chopped some stuff out of the beginning and maybe cut in half the number of times the planes would fly by without anything happening later on, you might could lose thirty minutes easy.  Also, Jackson wants to make it crystal clear that this is a love story.  I was under the impression he was beating the audience about the head and shoulders with it at times, because during those sections it would work, then slow, then crawl to a dead stop.  I get the feeling that Jackson’s love of the material led to him becoming a bit too enthralled to cut anything out of his baby.  And either his enthusiasm was too infectious to be denied by others, or everybody was ready to write him a blank check after LOTR.  Dunno.  And worse, some bits in the film just don’t make sense.  Peter, I was with you until the sequence with the bats.  That’s…all I can say without spoiling some details.  But after that I just couldn’t recover.  And once my ass fell asleep, the ending just lost some of its punch.  Again, some editing here and there would have been nice. Because of the problems, what could have been a tentpole film that actually had to be seen to be believed is an overlong mess where the best bits are when Kong is laying out the kicksplode.  The moment the giant monkey isn’t in frame, you know that there’s a good chance you’re going to find yourself devoid of any tension and praying for some more action to take place.  Jackson has proven that he can out-Spielberg Spielberg when it comes to over-the-top action, but anytime the fur isn’t flying, he really needs an editor.  No, I mean really.  See it on the big screen for maximum carnage, but see it in the afternoon to save coin and pack a lunch. Actually, PJ thought he had a 2:15 long movie–til he started cutting it. Actually, he had about 4-5 hours of material, and the first thing the execs asked him to do when they saw it was add in more scenes. I do agree, though, that the airplane sequence lost a bit of its zing. Still, very very good movie with Oscar written all over it!"

"Dec 18, 2005",positive," To begin with, it’s a love story, the old-fashioned Hollywood kind that is rarely if ever attempted these days without first injecting enough winking, snarky irony to justify this whole suddenly silly idea that ""love conquers all."" Well, to hell with that: It does. Peter Jackson’s three-hour-plus remake of Merian C. Cooper’s 1933 cinematic godhead is more than the sum of its gargantuan parts (big budget, bigger stars, biggest simian ever); it’s also a sweet-natured romantic fable, albeit one that packs in carnivorous cockroaches, rampaging brontosaurs, and the ever-Freudian Empire State Building among its requisite emotional baggage. And, too, it’s a corker of an action/monster movie: part RKO serial (natch); part square-jawed, testosterone infused manly romp; and part classic journey into the unknown that recalls and references, surprisingly and splendidly, Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness – ""Mistah Kong – he dead."" Jackson’s film is littered with canny references to Cooper’s original – the director knows that film is untoppable, a touchstone of dreams and dreamers the world over – but never fails to be its own unique hybrid. Much of that uniqueness, which makes the whole familiar story fresh again, comes from advances in special-effects technology. Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings’ Gollum) played Kong for the motion-control cameras and then had his image animated into the final, furry product, resulting in an inspired and heartbreaking tour de force of acting and gimmickry that’s, hands down, the single finest piece of special-effects wizardry yet achieved. It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that contains enough subtle nuance and emotional resonance to give technophobes serious pause: This half-human, half-CGI creation will make you reach for your hanky, so bring one and snuffle with abandon. The story, by Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh, is an expansion of Cooper’s original. Filmmaker Carl Denham (Black), unscrupulous, unpolished, and very much of his time (and ours), sets out aboard tramp steamer The Venture to the uncharted Skull Island with Watts’ starving vaudeville hoofer Ann Darrow and the Clifford Odets-like playwright Jack Driscoll (Brody) in tow. The sea voyage encompasses the first third of the movie, and while it takes a bit too long to get going full ahead, Jackson luxuriates in it, dropping a handful of Cooper’s own shots into the mix while introducing the main characters, their back stories, and plausibly setting up the dread ahead. Skull Island, of course, is the main attraction, rife with flora and fauna both bewildering and beautiful, and here Kong is truly King. The interplay between Watts’ melancholy blond and the great ape is almost too real to be believed. It’s touching and heartfelt in a way even modernistic, non-effects-driven films can’t manage. The film’s climactic act – the return to New York City, all Depression-era half-finished skyscrapers and Hooverville encampments bordering the moneyed splendor of the Great White Way – is pure, soulful Hollywood filmmaking at its finest (although the film was made almost entirely at Jackson’s New Zealand-based WETA Studio). It’s enough to make you weep not only for the displaced and doomed Kong but for the nearly lost art of cinematic panache, embodied here by the reckless Denham and in our own reality by the genius of Peter Jackson and precious few others. Only Jackson would have the presence of imagination to include a third-act pas de deux in the frozen wonderland of Central Park. The sequence borders on the cornball but rises above it by sheer old-fashioned Hollywood chutzpah. Watching it, you want to laugh but the awful lump already forming in your throat won’t let you: You know how it all ends.

"Dec 18, 2005",positive,"With King Kong (2005), Jackson has made a film that if you don't like it, you might just hate movies."
"Dec 17, 2005",positive,"Peter Jackson's King Kong provides a good, stirring, heroic-sized motion-picture event, without ever quite moving one the way his Lord of the Rings epics did."
"Dec 17, 2005",positive," Summary: It’s a great movie, made by the best director in the business who just wanted to honour the film that started his love affairs with cinema. OK. We’re both busy people so I’ll keep this brief. King Kong kicks the proverbial bottom. Yes, at 3 hours it’s bum-numbingly long, with too much exposition at the beginning and a slightly-dissappointing ending. And for some people who won’t admit that black and white films are generally boring and only say they like them to look cool, a remake of the 1933 ‘classic’ might be considered a little pointless. But this doesn’t negate the fact that for pure, abundant cinematic joyfulness, Peter Jackson’s latest magnum opus rocks out like several large boulders at a Led Zeppelin concert. The film is a game of three halves. The first bit is very well made but somewhat surplus to requirements, as we follow Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts looking like a healthy Nicole Kidman) picked from the squalor of 1920’s New York to be the lead female role in Carl Denham’s (Jack Black and his amazing acting eyebrows) latest film, which is set in some deserted island ‘near Sumatra’. As Ann chugs along in the boat that will take her to meet her gorilla-shaped destiny, she falls in love with the film’s writer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody, whose nostrils compete with Kong as being the biggest thing in the film), and there’s a whole load of other interesting but pointless bits with young Billy Elliott, Gollum as a lardy chef, and some Scandinavian skipper. After an hour of this lovingly created exposition, we finally get to Kong’s island, where Ann gets kidnapped by native pole vaulters who look like they run a few stalls down Camden Market, and is offered to the mighty beast as a nice juicy sacrifice. We then get to the middle part of the film, which is worth the admission price of the movie several times over. For King Kong is the best damn celluloid monkey since King Louis suggested he wanted to be a bit more like you-oo-oo. He is by turns terrifying, cute, funny, sad, sarcastic and extremely large. His relationship with Ann is the cornerstone of the movie, and it’s more believable than most modern Hollywood couplings. And as well as adding pathos to the film, Kong also manages to mash up a couple of freaking dinosaurs. Which is pretty damn cool. The middle section of the movie is an unrelenting hour of action as a seemingly never-ending number of the ship’s crew get chewed, crushed, ripped or sucked to death by the plethora of nasty beasties that plague Kong’s island. It’s just bloody fantastic. Once Kong gets captured and taken back to New York (exactly how is never quite explained. Maybe he watered skied off the back of the ship) the pace of the films dips a bit, and by now your screaming buttocks might be asking why old Peter spent so much of the film’s first hour not focusing on Kong. Anyway, Denham makes the huge mistake of turning Kong into a public spectacle, and after a disagreement over a share of gross profits or something, the monkey throws a bit of a moody and starts mashing up New York with a joyful abandon. The only person who can calm this raging id is Ann, and the two of them spend a few brief and peaceful moments messing around on a frozen lake in Central Park, in one of the most romantic scenes I’ve seen in a very long time. And then some spoilsport Yankee soldiers start trying to put an end to all of this monkey business by blowing the crap out of the big ol’ gorilla. You probably already know the film’s ending, which involves the Empire State Building and a bungee jump without the elastic, so I won’t go into it. Suffice to say, Kong and Ann don’t settle down whilst he gets a desk job and she raises their monkey man babies. Be prepared for a few tears before bed time. So, go see King Kong. It’s a great movie, made by the best director in the business who just wanted to honour the film that started his love affairs with cinema. But if you do go, make sure you go to an early performance in a comfortable cinema and don’t take the kids, because they’ll be asking ‘where’s the monkey’ so many times in the first hour of the film, you’ll be forced to send them back to the car with only a couple of jelly babies to keep them going. King Kong’s long, you don’t get to see his schlong, it’ll win a few gongs, buy it on DVD and you can’t go wrong. But if you think your ass can take the punishment, do yourself a favour and watch this one on the big screen. You won’t be disappointed."

"Dec 17, 2005",positive," eter Jackson’s “King Kong” is spectacular but spectacularly flawed, filled with several awe inspiring moments but ultimately undone by a director who is so in love with his subject that he is too blind to see when enough is enough. Universal was in a tricky position here; after all, Jackson swept the 2004 Academy Awards with the epic “Lord of the Rings: Return of the King,” which means that no one was going to tell him that he can’t make a three-hour “King Kong” movie. Pity, because someone should have grown a pair and put Jackson in his place. Man, where’s Harvey “Scissorhands” Weinstein when you need him?  Set in New York during the Great Depression, Naomi Watts is Ann Darrow, a Vaudeville performer who finds herself out of work when the show in which she performs is shut down. She has a chance encounter with Carl Denham (Jack Black), a movie producer / con artist who’s trying to keep his latest movie afloat, even if it means stealing the footage he’s already shot before his benefactors can sell it. Carl has plans of taking his cast, whether they know it or not, to the presumably uninhabited Skull Island, and even tricks his screenwriter, playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), into staying on board just long enough to not be able to swim back to shore. Jack curses Carl for his trick, and tells him that he would rather write for the theater. “If you loved the theater that much, you would have jumped,” Carl replies.  Once they arrive on the island, the crew encounters a most primitive race of humans who offer Ann up for sacrifice to Kong, a gigantic ape. Kong takes Ann, but unlike his other sacrifices, he doesn’t kill her; rather, he seems enchanted by this exotic beauty, and defends her honor against all sorts of suitors who would like to have her for lunch, from dinosaurs to the biggest, nastiest bugs you’ve ever seen. Carl, of course, has far greater plans than his movie once he sets his sights on Kong, and hatches a plan to subdue him and bring him to New York, creating the most incredible show New York has ever seen.  It seems simple enough on paper, right? Take a stop motion classic from the ‘30s, dress it up in some modern day special effects, and everyone will be happy, right? Well, sure, provided that the modern day action has some basis in modern day reality. For example, there is no way that Ann is getting through the jungles of Skull Island at a dead run in bare feet. Likewise, there is no way that the crew only loses one or two members under the feet of a stampede of brontosauruses in a ravine, with Velociraptors nipping at their heels. They’re all dead, simple as that. Also, is it possible to have an island with so many predators and so little prey? Ann and her crew run into nasties both big and small, from T. Rexes to the largest bugs you can imagine (fans of Stephen Sommers’ only good movie, “Deep Rising,” will enjoy one scene in particular). What were all of these baddies feeding on before the crew arrived? Perhaps it’s unfair to focus on what Jackson got wrong before talking about the many things he got right. For all of the times where Jackson pulls a stunt that is nothing short of improbable (Watts should have been torn to ribbons in the finale), the movie strums all of the right emotional chords at the right time. We laugh at Carl’s sleight-of-hand manipulation of everyone around him (Black was an inspired choice to make a very unlikable character likable); we thrill at the sight of Kong rescuing Ann from three (!) T. Rexes; we’re devastated when Carl and the crew succeed in subduing Kong in order to bring him to New York, we laugh when Kong discovers ice for the first time in Central Park, and we’re devastated again when he meets his inevitable fate. Those emotional notes go a long way to erase the logical leaps of faith – it’s disturbing how few directors know this – and Jackson makes these moments count. Still, he could have told this same story in 75% of the time, and it would have lost none of its emotional or visual impact. If anything, the impact would have been even greater. “King Kong” should absolutely be seen on the big screen. Jackson, after all, went for the brass ring the way that few directors do, and despite his less than perfect results, there is far more to like about “Kong” than there is to decry. The guy has balls, damn it, and you have to admire that. However, like every other guy with balls, you can’t help but want to kick him in the kitten every once in a while, just to make sure he knows that he’s not the only person on the planet who owns a pair. It’s a philosophy that even Kong would appreciate, I imagine. Fans of Universal’s three-disc Deluxe Extended Edition DVD  will be disappointed to discover that the Blu-ray release is but a shell of  that amazing set. Along with the extended and theatrical versions of the film,  the only other extra to appear is an audio commentary with director Peter  Jackson and co-writer/producer Philippa Boyens. Sure, some of the production  featurettes have been folded into the studio’s trademark U-Control picture-in-picture  video track, but even that feels rather anemic considering the deluxe   edition had more than six hours worth of bonus material, including the excellent   documentary “Recreating the Eighth Wonder.” Universal really dropped  the ball on this one, so unless you absolutely must own a high-def version of  the film, you’d be better off just holding on to your current edition instead.
