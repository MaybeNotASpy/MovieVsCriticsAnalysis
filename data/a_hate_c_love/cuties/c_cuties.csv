Mar 13 2023,positive, growing up is messy and alienating the confusing process of finding your own identity and the best crowd can be overwhelming at any age but especially in a moment when selfesteem is so precarious and the biggest concern you have is to be liked by others in addition todays environment is not a friendly one the internet social media and the expectations of society make it too hard to grow up unscathed this reflection is at the center of cuties the movie portrays the complicated path of maturity and finding yourself nevertheless unsatisfied with this scenario director maïmouna doucouré focuses this coming of age story in a black senegalese girl trying to adapt in a foreign country and a liberal society completely different from her conservative background cuties follows the story of amy fathia youssouf with a wideeyed face and a nervous smile an 11yearold girl that must deal with too much at once she has arrived in paris with her mother and two baby brothers and her father will join them soon after her position as the oldest sister means that she must take care of her siblings  including an adorable demba diaw  while embracing her communitys old traditions in addition her relationship with her mother is complicated who is struggling with her own grief after discovering that her polygamous husband will arrive in france with a new wife once amy arrives in her new school her sight is caught by a group of young girls that seem to own the place the typical mean girls that destabilize your whole world and make you want to be part of theirs even if their attitudes and actions go against your own in this aspect amys new conundrum is too real and identifiable every girl has been there these girls are confident extroverts and dressed in too provocative attires for 11yearolds they also have a dancing group called cuties copying their moves from mature and yet accessible music videos amy will do everything in her power to be part of this gang even when they treat her wrongly and call her names in a matter of days amy changes her appearance adopts new attitudes towards her family and starts making questionable decisions soon enough she is an entirely different person even going further than her new friends had ever gone before and adopting attitudes that are too complex and sexual for her to even understand it is easy to understand that this movie reflects the complications of growing up in a lonesome way these girls are lost and afraid with no figure guiding them through these confusing times the feeling of aloneness is at the heart of the movie cuties has inadvertently become the target of conservative critics in an overwhelming discrediting campaign what would have been a success story of a frenchsenegalese director selling her first movie to netflix after positive reactions in sundance became a nightmarish experience because of a careless marketing strategy by the streaming giant which was obscenely exploited by conservative trolls however reducing this movie only to its evident critique of the oversexualization of girls would be too easy and narrowminded as a matter of fact amys thoughts regarding her fathers decisions combined with her apprehension towards the changes in her household and body are the most interesting things of the movie her rebelliousness even feels revolutionary the movie does not shy away from uncomfortable topics that are present in real life and that shape our process of maturity and attainment of selfesteem cuties reflects the reallife emotional abuse that young girls suffer through examples of slut and fatshaming oversexualization of girls the inappropriate content in the media and how easy it is for children to get access to it although hard to watch at times  precisely when the director makes it evident that the girls are acting foolishly  the movie accurately portrays the complications and conflicts of growing up now regardless of its quality it seems that cuties has been judged and condemned this is the real tragedy considering that the movie is directly criticizing the things that it is being attacked for furthermore many of the themes and emotions that are part of our protagonists story are recognizable more so if the audiences are formed by black women and foreigners trying to adapt to a new social paradigm as such it is impossible not to feel protective of the movie sometimes uncomfortable and others too radical cuties is an eyeopener with an inspired ending despite the troublesome scenes we witnessed seconds earlier people should be concerned not at the movie itself but at the realities that it clearly reflects
May 10 2021,positive, cuties has already been condemned by hundreds of thousands of people who will never even watch it when it premiered at the sundance film festival in january this deliberately discomfiting french comingofage drama won largely though not unequivocally positive reviews it only became a cause célèbre a few weeks ago when netflix shared a promotional poster showing four preteen girls  each around 11 years old  imitating very adult poses familiar from countless recent music videos more than 300000 people signed a petition accusing the film of sexualising an 11yearold for the viewing pleasure of paedophiles prompting netflix to apologise for the artwork which was inappropriate and not representative of the film director maïmouna doucouré has since received death threats and said last week that netflixs coceo ted sarandos called her personally to apologise that apology was definitely warranted because doucouré is clearly trying to hold up a mirror here her film is a powerful exploration of the way young girls are subconsciously encouraged to perform for the male gaze she lifts the lid through the heartbreaking growing pains of 11yearold amy fathia youssouf a young girl living in a humble paris apartment with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and two younger siblings amys father is still in senegal where the family hail from but will soon be joining them in paris with his second wife in tow mariam is devastated to have to share her husband but is urged by her stoic oldschool aunt mbissine therese diop to put on a brave face in front of the community the aunt also wields a significant influence on amy telling her a grandiose wedding to a suitable man should be her ultimate goal in life doucouré who is also of senegalese heritage neatly illustrates how amy finds herself caught between the traditional values of her muslim family and the imageconscious western ideals of her peers in an early scene we see her trying to straighten her natural afro hair with a regular household iron after she sees stylish classmate angelica médina el aidiazouni doing the same thing desperate to fit in amy begins to dress like a teenager instead of a child and joins angelica in an allgirl dance troupe called the cuties copying the provocative twerkheavy routines they see in contemporary music videos the cuties are determined to qualify for a big dance contest in central paris their practice sessions and performances are difficult to watch  if they werent doucourés film wouldnt be such a damning indictment of the premature sexualisation of young girls elsewhere though the directors lack of subtlety can slightly undercut her message one scene features a vague and lazy suggestion that kim kardashian might be partly to blame for the cuties misguided aspirations and doucouré relies on a few contrived plot developments to bring her film to its ripe climax still theres no denying she makes her overall point effectively this is a vivid and very alarming portrait of a young girl struggling to live up to two competing forms of deeply ingrained patriarchy

Mar 19 2021,positive, maïmouna doucourés first feature drawing on her own experiences as a child cuties caused tremendous controversy when it first reached screens it has since won a césar for its star fathia youssouf who was named best newcomer theres no doubt that the subject matter is difficult dealing with issues around preteen sexuality but the very fact that we struggle to have necessary conversations around this topic is one of the concerns it addresses and any danger that it might titillate some adult viewers has to be considered in light of that fact that similar material is available in considerable quantities online  usually without any such challenging demand for empathy with the youngsters it depicts youssouf stars as amy an 11yearold girl from a senegalese community whose strict religious upbringing clashes with the values of mainstream french society like any kid that age shes trying to find her niche in the world and establish ways of expressing herself kids at school mock her plain clothing whilst cooing over the cuties mignonnes in the original french a term which doesnt carry quite the same history of association with pornography a group of girls into fashion and dance so naturally she wants to be like them shes not cool enough however so she follows them around eventually earning a place as a videographer for their routines and subsequently replacing one of their number after a fallingout her relationship with the group is troubled and inconsistent as is often case with female friendships at that age it is also intense the idea that they might win a competition together becomes allconsuming amy needs a distraction from hr home life where her mother is struggling to cope with her fathers plans to take a second wife her grandmother is trying to force her into a traditional role and punishing her for the smallest infractions but she can see quite clearly that theres no guarantee of such a role making her happy other members of the community are more sympathetic but nobody really has time to give her the attention she needs and the message handed down from female elders is that girls should be kept away from sin by sheltering them from all discussion all concept of sexual expression or desire caught between two differently confusing worlds amy pursues her own desires aggressively as if trying to force the mixed messages she receives into some form that makes sense at no point does she or any of the other girls evince desire for another person the flirtatious moves they make and they way they dress are a form of play a means of exploring their potential as they begin to grow up only amy herself shows any awareness of how older men might perceive them dancing in front of different men on two occasions in an attempt to take control of difficult situations the film does not depict any abuse of the girls though  through the reactions of one of these men and later of men in a crowd watching the troupe perform at an events  it clearly signals the danger they face theres a blackly comic aspect to the latter scene with the girls completely unaware of how horrified most of the people in their audience are with all this in mind this could actually be quite a useful film for parents to watch with daughters of a similar age so that they can highlight the dangers which kids all too often fail to recognise without such prompting there is a call here to recognise uncomfortable realities and to make girls part of the conversation around their own safety rather than simply trying to separate them from the world or deny the fact that they are growing up with the exception of one of the girls crush on a boy at school they live their lives quite separately from their male counterparts they expect similar freedoms and are all too easily turned into scapegoats for a cultural problem blamed for causing discomfort when all of the actual danger stems from the behaviour of adults doucouré has stressed that the young actresses approached their scenes very much as play and were not somehow sexually corrupted by the dance routines which simply didnt have the same associations for them as they might for adults these seems consistent with the naturalness of the performances throughout youssouf shines but she is far from the only talent on display here the complex interactions between the girls are beautifully captured with a recognition of how cruel they can be which is usually missing from such depictions we see their youth not just in their naivety about sexual matters but also in  their selfcentredness and shortsightedness about life in general made manifest in a onsexual shocking incident near the end in which amy briefly fears she may have gone too far we see them very much as people complicated and difficult without the soulless innocence that adults find it convenient to imagine a potent coming of age story with particular relevance to minority ethnic experiences cuties is a fresh look at girlhood which deserves to be commended for its bravery if for some its difficult to watch its worth reflecting that its often difficult to be a girl that age doucouré has captured something raw presenting a reality which ought not to be ignored

uses the facts of the case to gleefully puncture the myth of mafiosi dignity as buscetta favino is a terrific presence charismatic as past italian tough guys such as lino ventura if we can thank pearlclutching reactionaries for anything its for bringing this beautifully wrought comingofage film to wider attention the provocative netflix pr for mignonnes the french title ignited a firestorm of controversy  including claims of child pornography  over a thoughtful foreignlanguage art film that would otherwise have been on few viewers radar starring the wonderfully expressive fathia youssouf abdillahi as a somalifrench preteen who struggles to reconcile her muslim upbringing with the broad sexuality she sees among her peers and via social media cuties is a powerful statement about letting kids be kids it might be cheating to lump all five of steve mcqueens fulllength films into one yearend choice but the thematically linked works which are oddly designated as a miniseries on prime video really are of a piece as the british director hunger 12 years a slave explores the world of west indian immigrants in london from the late 60s to the 80s one of the standouts of the quintet is lovers rock an outlier in that it isnt based on a true story instead it lovingly documents a house party luxuriating in the details of food music and romance of a specifically black experience with a tremendous sense of joy
Nov 22 2020,positive, the tricky line between marketing and exploitation caused a ruckus in the case of cuties a wild feature debut from frenchsenegalese maïmouna doucouré it won the directing award at sundance before being snapped up by netflix then a poster happened to it this was an image cribbed from the films most openly provocative sequence  the finale  which out of context made everyone see red it showed four preteen girls striking sexy poses on a dance stage wearing shiny crop tops knee pads and booty shorts netflix soon apologised for the poster and switched to a different image of this quartet pouting to camera but the damage was done doucouré received death threats on social media and a petition to have the film banned has amassed over 340000 signatures on changeorg sight unseen  one can only presume  the originator of the latter marywhitehouseesque screed calls the film disgusting dangerous and made for the viewing pleasure of paedophiles the turkish broadcasting watchdog rtük seems to have agreed ordering the films removal from netflix in that country but enough of the moral panic no one involved in demonising this film has paused at any stage  or watched it  to consider that its very subject is the disturbing premature sexualisation of young girls in french society doucouré is hardly sly with her theme by the end she goes all out to make us squirm  elevenyearold amy fathia youssouf a senegalese muslim has recently moved to a parisian housing estate with her mother superb maïmouna gueye and two younger brothers her father who we never see is about to take a second wife and preparations for the dreaded wedding are underway at school a troupe of wannabe dancers called the mignonnes cuties catch amys attention but she feels too square and shy to fit in  at least until she pilfers a mobile phone from her uncle and begins using it to take selfies beautify herself and get tips from hiphop twerking videos doucouré is blatantly pushing buttons here  never more so than in the evermoreeyewidening dance sequences where amy quickly graduates from the rookie in this crew to the one schooling them in risqué fingerbiting choreography if the pageant finale of little miss sunshine often springs to mind she functions in the story as alan arkin to her own abigail breslin  the other girls want to pass as 14 to attract boyfriends and with amys phone they have worrying access to everything the internet can show their licentiousness starts to float free of strict plausibility amy borrows skimpy tshirts from her brother swipes cash and takes them all on shopping sprees their makeup budget starts to look enormous essentially theyre aping the gang from céline sciammas girlhood who were 16 going on 25 in letting this play out doucouré is underlining an obvious fantasy of prepubescence to fastforward towards being treated as desirable the film is more an experiment in chutzpah than a slice of social realism as the girls mess about recklessly and rehearse their moves their lack of any supervision is odd if semiexplained by the distracted chaos of amys household but they also know how their immaturity gives them a treacherous power as we see when a security guard tries to hustle them out for trespassing and they brand him as a child molester these certainly arent your neighbourhoods average polite children theyre twerking terrors of the pavement following some wellreceived shorts doucouré made this from a very personal place the keenest parts explore the pushpull of her muslim upbringing amy is acting out because of her fathers betrayal and unwilling to follow her mother  whos secretly devastated  down the path of demure submission to the patriarchy her rebellion is defiantly flaunting herself and thanks to some brazen invites from the films camerawork the routines she masterminds tend to make the male gaze curl up in horror  this is powderkeg provocation in an age so terrified of child sexuality thanks to the furore it has blown up just as much in doucourés face but the films first hour is topnotch for a debut the child performances are electric the range of emotion she gets from youssouf  not just the jawdropping cosmetic transformations  mark her out as a magician with actors gang leader angelica  quite the failure for nominative determinism there  is played with almost larry clarkesque attitude by médina el aidiazouni another brilliant find how doucouré achieved her joyous last shot i dont quite know imperfect as it is this film deserves to launch a career not end one
Oct 23 2020,positive, here director maïmouna doucouré beautifully captures the mercurial cruel and confusing terrain of 11yearold girl groups determined to show her mettle amy teaches herself how to dance by mimicking the sexuality adult women display in provocative music videos and then piques the girls interest by teaching them to twerk and pout one of the more effective ways to raise awareness about a problematic cultural norm like pornification is to baldly show it and this is the tactic doucouré takes in many cringeinducing scenes of amy and the girls practicing for and performing in a dance competition they wear booty shorts and crop tops twerk finger their lips and mimic provocative dance moves popularized in videos like the recently released single by cardi b wap this is the material that critics of cuties denounce many of whom revile the film without actually having watched it it is after all an easy sell few want to find themselves on the side of arguing for the sexualization of girls i encourage readers to reject the false dichotomy of pornification v purity and see them as one and the same pornification makes compulsory sexual selfdisplay while purity culture overvalues virginity and counsels modesty in girls and womens dress to protect men from sexual sin we can instead carve a new path like amy does in cuties the story ends with amy choosing not to attend her fathers wedding with her mothers permission and walking out of the dance competition in the middle of their oversexualized routine in the final scene we see amy dressed in jeans joining in a game of jump rope we need more feminist stories like cuties that illuminate the constraints girls and women face and help us chart a path to full gender equality  bernadette barton is professor of sociology and gender studies at morehead state university and author of the book the pornification of america how raunch culture is ruining our society and stripped more stories from exotic dancers copyright  2024 saloncom llc reproduction of material from any salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited salon  is registered in the us patent and trademark office as a trademark of saloncom llc associated press articles copyright  2016 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
Oct 10 2020,positive,cuties is serious and raises useful questions if it makes you uncomfortable its supposed to
Oct 8 2020,positive, kittens for this weeks podcast we said to hell with it and jumped into controversy feet first first we ease you into things by explaining just why ryan murphys been getting on our last gay nerve lately from feud bette and joan to scream queens to the politician to hollywood and now with the execrable ratched dropping our overtly bitchy review is here we just cant keep our gay mouths shut on the matter said matter being his genx gay obsessions and how badly he tends to explore them what can we say we appreciate the guy but he bugs then its off to the controversy races as we review the muchdiscussed french film mignonnes which dropped on netflix with the english title cuties the controversy surrounding this film exploded in the past few weeks fueled in part by netflixs poor decision to market the film with a shot of its young actors in skimpy dance costumes we review the film discuss its controversial aspects from a social political and artistic perspective outline some of the things said about it by its detractors and some of the things said in its defense by its director maïmouna doucouré before coming to a conclusion about its worth and its methods believe it or not we have things to say in agreement with both sides of the controversy and come to some conclusions about the film and where it wound up that might surprise you
Oct 8 2020,positive,cuties is not a great film but it is a sensitive and thoughtprovoking portrait
Oct 8 2020,positive,mean girls without the tina fey silliness or city of god without the violencetheres a lot to think about in this daring somewhatedgy slice of social commentary
Oct 7 2020,positive, a few years ago i watched a movie with my cousin and her family about a serial killer who had a thing for children the killings were mostly happening offscreen and a lot of it was ambiguous as the movie progressed my niece kept asking questions about the film questions like what exactly is happening with that uncle and the children or where do they go off to etc to my utter surprise my cousin was explaining everything in detail to her in an extremely patient and objective way after the movie got over i couldnt help it and ask was that necessary to that she just said of course it is she needs to understand and be aware of what is going on cuties is getting a lot of flak for how the protagonists were portrayed and objectified on screen a lot of it has to do with its unfortunately erroneous marketing campaign the uneasiness also gets amplified when you realize how young these girls are  the main character of cuties is amy a senegalese muslim living with her mother and brother in paris her family is waiting in gloom for her fathers impending second wedding while her mother is secretly crumbling trying to maintain a semblance of outward dignity about the situation fascinated by a group of schoolmates who have been practicing privately for a local dance competition she desperately longs to be part of their gang  inspired by the suggestive twerking videos they see online they misguidedly believe that they should emulate those routines to grab eyeballs and possibly go all the way in the competition as amy is slowly succumbing to peer pressure and desperation she steals a phone to secretly practice the video routines when the owner catches her with the stolen phone she takes a compromising picture of herself and posts it online believing it would get him into trouble as expected instead of having the required effect it makes her a social pariah and gets blocked by not just her friends but also her entire school all this leads to a mighty explosive climax that shouldnt be spoiled here there is a certain innocence in these children when you see them gawking at the school cuties and even with their awkward attempts at flirting with their much older schoolmates as thats what they believe they should be doing they also vaguely know what they do might get them into trouble but are so influenced by what they saw online that they think it is acceptable behavior maïmouna doucouré the director also makes it pretty clear of that fact that maybe it was the idea and we are supposed to be uncomfortable at what we are seeing not just what they do on screen but also why and what influenced them to do it  at one point the girls ostracize amy for posting that dirty picture as they fear they would be labeled sluts if they continue to hang out with her it does not even occur that somebody might judge them for all they have been doing so far already  it causes a throwback memory of all those childhood birthday parties where one kid inevitably dresses up and how many parents reacts to it the child may be living the princess dream and having the time of her life but she doesnt realize some of the adults around her have already possibly started to judge her in a stunning sequence that shows her state of mind her mother and omnipresent allknowing matriarchal aunt conducts a purge on her to quash her rebellion in an ultimate act of defiance the way her dervish dance morphs into an involuntarily twerking dance routine that she has been practicing so hard is an image that sears into your head and stays there for a very long time  médina el aidiazouni playing her sympathetic friend angelique the groups de facto leader also portrays her character with remarkable aplomb i also genuinely appreciate the bond amy shared with her mother played by maïmouna gueye when they finally come to terms with each other and their decisions it feels earned and not shoehorned for the climaxs sake the fact that the movie is making people uneasy is not that surprising some scenes in the film genuinely make your skin crawl but you realize that part of the discomfort you feel watching cuties also comes from the fact that the kids do not wholly comprehend the consequences their actions may have it is a movie that needs to be understood and watched no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for battleroyalewithcheese
Oct 7 2020,negative,i appreciate what the movie was aiming for and as a directorial debutbut i do think too much was going on and left up for interpretation it was trying to juggle too many things
Oct 7 2020,positive,i got the message behind it this is a movie about coping pain the feeling of loneliness and what it pushes us to seek outbut the dubbing was pretty bad with some of the voices not syncing up well
Oct 5 2020,positive,watch it for yourself before you judge mignonnes is not an easy watch at all but noone could mistake it for the film the protesters are trying to tell you it is
Oct 2 2020,positive, near the end of cuties its 11yearold heroines take the stage at a dance competition with a routine that wouldnt be out of place in a strip club clad in sparkly shortshorts and crop tops they hump the floor grab their crotches lick their lips and throw their heads back in a naive simulation of sex to the visible discomfort of their audience  its possibly the films most disturbing scene and for some reason its also the scene netflix chose to highlight in their early marketing sparking an outcry they shouldve seen coming from a mile away the company has since apologized what both the illconceived marketing and subsequent controversy are missing however is everything about the context  yes its upsetting and its supposed to be  because the whole point of cuties is how damn hard it can be for girls to navigate womanhood in a society thats all too eager to tell girls and women what they should be and not at all interested in what they might be or want to be  written and directed by maïma doucouré cuties is the story of amy fathia youssouf whos just immigrated to paris from senegal with her devout muslim mother and two younger brothers while the family waits for dad to join them amy becomes intrigued by a neighbor angelica médina el aidiazouni whom she and we first see from the back gyrating to music in skintight pants and a bellybaring shirt its a mild surprise when she turns around and we see shes amys age angelica and her friends the cuties come across as cool and worldly to the sheltered amy in ways amys conservative family would never approve of which of course is part of the appeal  on the cusp of adolescence amy knows what her religious community expects of her she also knows it makes her own mother miserable as seen in one heartbreaking scene when amy listens to her mom weep between fakecheery phone calls announcing that amys dad has taken a second wife amy hiding under the bed swallows this secret truth she learns from her elders that womanhood means obeying a husband being held to a higher standard of decency and cooking and cleaning to satisfy a man who isnt obligated to take her feelings into consideration these realizations fill amy with feelings that she doesnt quite understand but doucouré does theres sublimated rage in her fascination with the cuties along with simple curiosity and sincere affection to amy her new friends with their skimpy clothes showoffy dance moves and boycrazy schemes represent fun and freedom even as they present their own hazards like the headspinning politics of whos in one minute or out the next as intricate and intimate as their internal dynamics might be to everyone else  the cute boys and older girls and mall employees who have the misfortune of crossing their paths  the cuties are just a pack of undifferentiated wild girls frequently annoying and occasionally terrifying doucouré knows as any girl whos ever been part of a clique does that theres power and pleasure in belonging even if its only sometimes for all the brashness the cuties project it quickly becomes apparent that they dont know much more about the way things work than amy does all these girls are figuring out how to become women based on the cues they get from the culture around them  strippers twerking in internet videos older teen dancers taking their tops off boys checking out girls in lowcut shirts they absorb and then reflect those lessons back out into society quickly learning that revealing clothes and seductive moves bring likes and attention yet theres a fundamental innocence to their antics accentuated by the bright poppy colors that doucouré uses to frame them theyre kids messing with the dangerous forces of adult sexuality not because they understand it too well but because they dont they gyrate to explicit music and then dissolve into a pile of giggles they send vulgar messages to a boy while shrieking to each other about boobs in the scene used to market cuties in france they buy silky lingerie and then parade down the street wearing it over their clothes in act of playfulness not titillation it does get darker sometimes in one desperate moment amy starts undressing to placate an older cousin whos angry with her for stealing his stuff he stops her shocked and disgusted and were shocked too where did amy learn to do that did she even know what she was offering but in both horrific scenes and adorable ones what remains consistent is doucourés honesty she shows these moments as they are in all their silliness and ugliness without packaging them in easy moralizing or faux empowerment amys attempts to put on a more grownup sexuality may be unsettling to watch but theyre also true to a world that bombards girls with the message that whether they cover up or bare it all keep their heads down and cook or shake their asses on the dance floor womanhood is whatever men need it to be that climactic scene of her writhing on stage isnt about showing amy as a sexual being but about taking to task a culture that struggles to see young women any other way rather than deny those harsh truths cuties gives amy and her friends the space to experiment within them no matter how clumsily and misguidedly and no matter how upsetting we in the audience might find it by doing so doucouré extends to these girls a generosity that as weve seen in the film is so often denied them by the rest of the world  the freedom to figure out how they want to navigate it  angie han is the deputy entertainment editor at mashable previously she was the managing

Oct 2 2020,positive, you may have noticed a bit of heated controversy swirling around netflix over the last couple of weeks specifically a social media campaign to cancel the streaming service because of its decision to carry cuties aka mignonnes a french film about teenage girls in paris complainers fired off blistering accusations the film promoted pedophilia it sexualized underage girls and it exploited the young actresses who appeared in it many shared memes across social media encouraging others to boycott netflix for this reason no one seemed bothered by the fact that they were being asked to do this even though they knew little to nothing about the film indeed people were alltooeager to boycott cuties simply based on a strangers recommendation apparently there was no need to investigate the claims for themselves to me this signifies precisely whats wrong with america right now people are willing to jump on any bandwagon of controversy or negativity without having any information about what theyre protesting as it turns out the people pushing out the antinetflix propaganda were in many cases affiliated with the crazy qanon movement which purports to be fighting human trafficking but their aim is ideological the cult proffers a narrative that claims liberal politicians and hollywood celebrities are part of a satanic cabal that kidnaps and sexually exploits children there is absolutely no proof that any such coterie exists maybe you heard about pizzagate still qanon does seem to be growing in popularity by the day and most if not all of them also happen to be fervent trump supporters netflix responded to the controversy by admitting that their publicity campaign for the film selected promotional imagery that was inappropriate but they stood by their decision to air the film made by a french senegalese filmmaker maïmouna doucouré the filmmaker has also stood by her artistic choices including hiring actresses the same age as their characters this interview in slate explores some of the issues shes been asked to clarify the film premiered to appreciative audiences as well as critical acclaim at sundance the film draws upon doucourés personal experience she saw a dance competition featuring preteen girls and became fascinated with its attractions to the young over the course of a year she interviewed dozens of girls who were enthusiastic participants in this trend cuties is the result as much as it is a sort of exposé of this culture it is also a fine comingofage film about a young girl trying to fit in with her peers she also has to reckon with family turmoil given that her love of dance is at odds with her traditional upbringing amy fathia youssouf is introduced as an 11yearold senegalese muslim girl with two younger brothers one is eight one an infant she helps take care of her family has recently moved to paris her father has been away for some weeks in senegal and when she asks when hes coming home her mother is vague and says soon the family observes traditional customs including having the women cover their hair and wear long dresses one day amy overhears her mother on the phone telling a friend that her husband has decided to take a second wife her mother feels obligated to call everyone she knows to tell them about this when she breaks down crying in the middle of one such conversation amy becomes visibly disturbed and saddened not long after this amy sees a girl her age angelica médina el aidiazouni in the laundry room of her apartment building she is dancing to music on her smartphone  in between waiting for the dryer and ironing her long hair flat amy is fascinated and tries ironing her own hair at home a few days later amy sees a small group of girls at school and angelica is among them theyre dancing practicing a routine for an upcoming competition when the girls catch amy watching them they accuse her of spying and throw rocks hitting her in the head later angelica sees her back at the building and helps her dress the small wound the two girls slowly become friends though the other two girls in the dance group not only reject amy but are mean to her amys response to the bullying is to try her best to become part of the group she steals a smartphone left in a delivery van and watches videos so she can practice her dance moves it takes a while but when the group rejects another member yasmine for some slight involving another girls boyfriend they accept amy as a new member to their dance troupe in addition to listening to pop music on the stolen phone amy is also borrowing her little brothers shirts and turning them into formfitting tops so she can emulate the style of the girls she wants to befriend she practices taking selfies and copies the other girls efforts to appear older than they are it might seem unfathomable to adult viewers that amy should want to be friends with girls who insult and assault her but anyone whos been a teenage girl is familiar with the depths of cruelty aggression and oneupmanship that characterize many adolescent friendships amy also begins to disregard her familys strict rules in order to spend time with her friends eventually she acts out in ways that shock her mother and elderly aunt but she is far too obsessed with her newfound activity to care what her family thinks amy turns out to not only be a very good dancer but a natural leader who gets the others moves in shape for the competition but on the day of the auditions a family commitment makes her late and the other girls throw her out of the group amy having had a taste of the attention of her peers as well as the exhilarating buzz from dancing goes to desperate measures to get back into the group tensions with her family increase but amys behavior only becomes more reckless and rebellious the films portrayal of adolescent girls is spot on the young performers perfectly capture the nastiness as well as the fickle changeability of girls whose identity depends on fleeting moments of approval and praise for those who wonder if the film goes too far in its portrait of the hypersexualized world of teenage dance competitions the answer is no the cinematic gaze here simply mirrors the problematic focus of a society that encourages children to speed through their adolescence by imitating the worst of adult behavior the girls explicitly sexual moves are not precocious attempts at seduction rather they are studied imitations of what they learn in online videos they dont express an innate urge to appear sensual or sexy a fascinatingly ironic dichotomy unfolds a lack of sophistication with regard to social behavior is set against the overtly glamorous looks and poses the girls affect to win the contest which will increase their likes on social media and that seems to be one of the films more salient messages rather than easy access to porn or the threat of lurking pedophiles the real problem is the obsessive engagement with social media platforms that encourages attentionseeking behavior and rewards it cuties is a daring and sensitive portrait of a girl whose attempt to break out of her familys predestined path for her exposes her to things she doesnt yet understand it is preteen rebellion of the most ordinary sort and if we find its trappings a bit shocking maybe we need to pay closer attention peg aloi is a former film critic for the

Oct 2 2020,positive, most of the polemic involving cuties the debut feature of maimouna doucouré is unjustified its just painful to watch i dont see a bad intention from the writerdirector here rather seeing the story as an eyeopener for the perils to which susceptible youth is exposed through social media the pursuit of fame at all cost cultural differences estrangement and insertion in a new community are addressed yet the film gradually loses strength and focus as it moves forward 
Sep 22 2020,positive, family community and peers are all fundamental guides for tweens and have the power to influence their behavior both for better and worse popular images that are widely available online sexualize young girls perhaps especially young girls of color and can influence how they see themselves and behave acceptance and belonging are powerful motivators immigrant families try to maintain their traditions as they and especially their kids assimilate into a new culture friend groups can be diverse amy and angie have a supportive friendship despite being surrounded by culture of bullying and girls being mean to each other a culture they both participate in at times as she tries to fit in with a new friend group amy makes some inappropriate and potentially dangerous moves crosses ethical lines by lying and stealing amys mother relies on a very traditional auntie to help educate her daughter even as she struggles with her own problems namely her husband taking on a second wife her culture teaches her to obey her husband but she does have the option of leaving him school administrators break up fights in the recess yard one pushes middle schoolers toward her office before they become friends the girl group bullies amy pushing her around grabbing and emptying her backpack making fun of how she looks amy gets in her own fight later attacking another girl who gets amy to the ground pulls down her pants and photographs her underwear to share on social media amy later pushes a girl into a river it appears the girl doesnt know how to swim but she manages to paddle to a buoy a girl overhears a conversation about rape girls accuse a security guard of groping them calling him a pedophile to get out of trouble tween girls pose and dance in suggestive ways mimicking dances they watch online they dress in skimpy clothes and heels though amy has been told at a religious gathering that evil shows itself in scantily clad women amy overhears other girls having a conversation about sex and rape which is explicit yet shows some serious misconceptions about specifics the girls push amy into the boys bathroom to try to film a male classmate and flirt with one boy online offering to let him touch a boob coumba finds what she thinks is a balloon on the ground in a park and blows it up but it turns out to be a condom the other girls are disgusted by her contact with it try to wash her body and mouth off with soap amy starts to undress for a man when he realizes she stole his phone presumably offering her body in exchange for the phone to try to compensate for the embarrassment of having her underpants photographed and shared publicly amy posts a photo of her private parts on social media a classmate calls her a slut because of it amys friends get angry with her because other classmates later ask them to do the same amys father is about to remarry and sets up a special honeymoon suite parents need to know that cuties is a controversial french film with english subtitles in the united states that takes on the difficult topic of how young girls are influenced by societys sexualizing of women in a way that teens can learn from that said the movies unflinchingly candid treatment of its subject could turn off some viewers and leave others feeling sad or even anxious the tween girl characters suggestive dance moves are filmed up close and they dress in skimpy clothes and talk about sex and rape  albeit with some misconceptions that reveal their actual innocence as does a scene where one girl plays with a condom from the ground in a park without knowing what it is the lead character amy fathia youssouf will do just about anything to fit in shes pushed into a boys bathroom to try to film a classmate peeing and her girlfriends flirt with boys online offering to let one touch a boob to try to compensate for the embarrassment of having her underpants photographed and shared publicly after losing a fight amy posts a photo of her private parts on social media her friends tell her she went too far and a classmate calls her a slut she starts to undress for a grown man presumably in exchange for his phone which he caught her stealing the girls sometimes put themselves in potential danger but the film ends on a cautiously optimistic note it also offers a glimpse into the lives of senegalese and other immigrant communities living in housing blocks in paris language includes hell st bullst loser stupid bitches fk damn boobs and slut to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails cuties centers on amy a magnetic fathia youssouf who comes from a traditional senegalese family shes just moved into a new apartment in paris with her mom maïmouna gueye and two brothers theyre awaiting the arrival of amys father  and it turns out his soontobe second wife when amy sees a neighbor girl her age angie médina el aidiazouni dancing suggestively in the apartment building laundry room amy is intrigued by how different angies life seems to be from her own amy starts spying on angies group of friends which goes by the name the cuties as they get in trouble at school and practice a sexy dance routine in an abandoned area after school amy and angie become friends and amy slowly joins the group she learns the girls dance routine for an upcoming competition and adds new and even racier moves based on videos she finds online slowly amy begins adapting new manners and styles to fit in all of which she tries out on social media but it seems that the closer she gets with the girls the farther she feels removed from her traditional upbringing and community her fathers upcoming wedding and the dress he sent her for the occasion are symbolic reminders of how much things are changing in amys life when amy takes things a step too far she finds herself on the outside of her family her community and her new friend group and shell have to figure out what her path forward will be senegalesefrench director maïmouna doucouré has created an evocative compassionate portrait of young girls finding their identity and values in this controversial film in the hands of a less capable director cuties could easily have felt exploitative of its child actors something the film was accused of in an initial and controversial marketing campaign in the united states doucouré films the girls close up as they move their bodies in a sensual way and strike suggestive poses in halter tops shortshorts and excessive makeup but she offers these scenes precisely in order to shock because they should be shocking the publics reaction to the girls final performance in the film reveals as much the subtlety is in the way doucouré captures the young girls innocence despite their poses theyre not exactly informed about sex they regularly collapse into piles of giggles amy isnt truly trying to provoke she just wants to fit in thats where the context comes in its set in the multicultural parisian exurbs where doucouré offers intriguing glimpses into the role of women in the senegalese community amy is torn between the traditional values shes being taught at home and the draw of her new friends and culture this feels both typical and an exceptionally perceptive portrayal of the plight of adolescence and the immigrant experience bundled into one some images will stick with you long after this film amys symbolic wedding dress her fathers new bride shrouded in white the girls poses and a beautiful closing scene of amy bouncing back literally into her community and her childhood families can talk about the role of the internet and social media in cuties without these do you think the girls would have the same ideas about sexuality or the same impulses to share intimate photos of themselves why or why not what are the dangers of sexting common sense medias unbiased ratings are created by expert reviewers and arent

Sep 22 2020,positive,  take a seat better yet make a nice hot cup of tea pull up your nearest fainting couch and get ready for some information that is sure to blow your mind ready americans are really really stupid when it comes to both art and nuance an example is the kerfuffle that sprang up regarding the last temptation of christ it all began with the 1955 novel written by nikos kazantzakis that examined the life of jesus specifically it posited the concept of jesus briefly succumbing to temptation while on the cross and imagining a normal life one that involved sex love and a family as you might imagine a certain stripe of christian was very angry with the book this anger turned to incandescent rage in 1988 when martin scorsese adapted the novel into an excellent film now you would think people who were taught the gospels to live with a love for others to turn the other cheek you would think those folks would either try to see the spiritual message inherent in last temptation or love the people they disagreed with in brotherhood nope thousands of people called for the film to be banned television evangelists denounced scorsese in fact scorsese received numerous death threats which unless i missed big chunks of the bible is antithetical to the message of christianity there was even an attempted terrorist attack on a theater in paris a group of radical catholics yes seriously set off an incendiary device that wounded thirteen people so based on the preceding paragraphs i must think that conservative christians are a bunch of gullible nitwits right wellno as much as id like to take a moment to clown on the rightwing outrage machine the fact remains that both liberals and conservatives tend to live in a black and white space when it comes to artistic expression and that space is not where nuance lives dont believe me lets talk about the new film cuties and why the controversy around it is mostly nonsense amy fathia youssouf is eleven and she has just moved from senegal to a neighborhood in paris things are very different for her shes in a new place with new customs and new faces and shes expected to help care for her two younger brothers what about her parents you might ask thats where things start to become complicated her mother mariam maimouna gueye is already struggling to keep the children stable in their new home mariam tries to live as a righteous muslim woman and feels pressure from her aunt mbissine therese diop to do better the pressure gets worse when she receives a phone call from senegal and the news that her husband has taken a second wife this is all an enormous amount for amy to process she needs support and unfortunately mariam doesnt have the bandwidth to provide it so she seeks out a support system elsewhere and boy howdy does she find it a pilfered smartphone introduces her to social media and the endorphin rush that comes from likes and comments a chance encounter at school pinballs amys life in a radically new direction she meets the cuties a group of girls in her grade they are her neighbor angelica medina el aidi the snarky coumba esther gohourou and the combative jess ilanah camigoursolas the cuties move through the world with the kind of bulletproof selfconfidence that only exists within tweens and rich white men their goal is to enter and win a dance competition one that emphasizes barelythere costumes and dance moves that arewell lets go with suggestive the realization hits amy like a thunderbolt the cuties are everything she isnt and like nothing shes ever seen before at least thats what she thinks how to get in with the cool girls proving yet again that the internet was a mistake amy dives online and immerses herself in videos her plan is to imitate the moves of dancers much older and copy their routines routines that are wildly ageinappropriate they dont just push the envelope they rip through the damn thing its all in service of social medial likes realizing a vague dream and learning that actions have consequences a number of prominent individuals have accused cuties of either being child pornography or sexually exploitative senators ted cruz and josh hawley railed against the film an oped in the conservative website the national review wrote thus whatever their artistic intentions in making a social commentary about the sexualization of children the filmmakers undeniably sexualized children christine pelosi daughter of house speaker nancy pelosi tweeted cuties hypersexualizes girls my daughters age no doubt to the delight of pedophiles like the ones i prosecuted cancel this apologize work with experts to heal your harm it was all outrage but it never came from a place rooted in liberal or conservative ideology it was only reactionary by now i imagine youre probably thinking dont keep us in suspense is cuties offensive trash that comes straight from the second circle of hell no but it is designed to make viewers feel uneasy director maimouna doucoure has made a cleareyed and nuanced film about the raging desire of a child to fit in and the poor decisions they can make that blow up in their faces she knows exactly what kind of film shes making one about perspectives when the girls practice their routines we hear pulsing pop music as they emulate what they have seen elsewhere im not sure theyre fully aware of the meaning of these suggestive dance moves but they know on a subconscious level that they have raw power however watch the same routine later when adults observe youll see some skeezy guys who are into it but far more adults who are repelled and appalled in the end the gaze of the camera is entirely dependent upon context there are also tiny moments of surrealism that pop in and out such as a dress that amy is given to wear at her fathers wedding watch how the shape and color of the dress slightly changes depending on amys mood its filmmaking thats smart and subtle doucoure based her screenplay on her own experiences as a refugee as well as eighteen months of research regarding how social media influences the behavior of children and young teens more relevant is her prior experience as a girl the script is a coming of age tale in which amy bounces between the expectations of her culture and religion to be a submissive wife an onslaught of online images lacking in context and the ageold growing pains we all go through she ultimately wants to find her people and her place in the world while simultaneously wanting to rebel against the world shes growing up in the tragedy is that she makes decisions from the perspective of a child and is judged as an adult i think i was most impressed by the natural and honest performances that doucoure was able to draw out of her cast the younger actors do solid work and i was particularly impressed with fathia youssouf as amy shes asked to do some extremely heavy lifting from an emotional standpoint and whether shes about to break from pressure or giggling as she crams gummy worms into her mouth she always feels believable the stealth mvp of the cast is maimouna gueye as her mother miriam she has an astounding scene where she takes a phone call and learns of her husbands decision to take another wife gueyes tone of voice is all business on the phone we can only see her feet as she hangs up the phone for a moment theres only silence then we see her feet shaking as she sobs youve probably heard a variation of the old saying that depiction doesnt equal endorsement odds are that the vast majority of people hysterically shrieking over cuties either havent seen the film or are reading it in the most shallow manner possible cuties made me extremely uncomfortable since its a critique of societys rampant sexualization of children its supposed to maimouna doucores film is intelligent and nuanced and i fervently hope that her next project is viewed with more openmindedness odds are it wont be whether you agree with the central message of the film or not consider that the central message is that initially jesus profoundly does not want to take the suffering of the world entirely within himself he wants what everyone else wants but decides to sacrifice himself anyway thats far more inspirational and relatable than a savior entirely free of doubt while the film isnt exploitative holy hell is the advertising someone in netflixs marketing department made a series of very bad decisions you can read more here
Sep 19 2020,negative, if paedophilia wasnt a parents most dreaded fear netflix comingofage tale cuties a controversial french film that takes on the difficult subject of how young girls are impacted by societies sexualising of women in a way teens learn from would have made the audience more receptive to the movies unflinchingly candid treatment of its subject the movie which has whipped up a frenzy of fury from the public for sexualising little girls focuses on an 11yearold who is raised in a traditional senegalese muslim household later finding herself torn between traditional family values and todays internet culture which does not bat an eyelid when it comes to the hypersexualisation of young women the dollfaced preteen character is amy her growing femininity plus dysfunctional family environment exacerbates her rebellious streak as she embarks on the tumultuous journey of becoming a teen while reserved she desires to take her developing interest in pop music and dance and a deeprooted need to feel like she belongs to the next level by joining a dance crew her age called cuties a budding troupe whose leader also resides where her family lives the girls first meet in the laundry room where the longhaired spectacled dancer can be seen practising her steps while waiting for her clothes to get washed unaware of amy watching her intensely from behind the intrigue for the outwardly awkward amy is understandable when the dance crew and she come face to face their personalities clash where amy is shy they are bold where she is modest theyre brash and in your face the fickleminded affections of prepubescent girls are at play as we watch how the girls move from their extreme adoration for each other to their dreadful ability to bully amy at the drop of a hat stealing a mobile phone on a whim she uses this to wiggle her way into the group by becoming their videographer for their dancing escapades as the girls prepare to vie for a place in a dance contest it is here they meet their much older rivals who are more physically developed and needless to say sexualised in their moves amy and her crew seem oblivious to the fact that they are at the mercy of a hypersexualised culture and its pressures soon enough we see the cuties are unfurling their own fresh routine helmed by amy who while seeming to remain tuned in to what is unfolding around her has no inkling into what it actually means it is here i find the storyline becomes murky as it sexualises the girls in a manner that would pander to the desires of a paedophile the characters suggestive dance moves are filmed up close while their skimpy attire and talk about sex and rape bring more disgust to the viewer than an actual understanding of their misconceptions that reveal their innocence technically this raw unfiltered film strings together a plot that really does not make sense to begin with none of the characters names are directly given and characters are often introduced andor tossed out randomly breaking any momentum they might have formed in the audiences mind there are also moments where it is unclear what anybody is talking about to bring you to the assumption that a particular incident is about to happen putting things in perspective i feel that we reside in a world where women and children are subjected to all sorts of cruelty  rape slavery prostitution  making it all the more obvious that in no context is it permissible to watch the hypersexualisation of children all this does is give an excuse for perpetrators to feel justified to defile a child maybe say because they were aroused by watching little girls gyrate to loud music in skimpy clothes  is anyones guess
Sep 18 2020,negative,the film becomes what it tries to defeat full review in spanish
Sep 18 2020,negative, if youve heard of cuties on netflix then im sure youve heard about the cuties controversy  it sexualizes children its a pedophiles dream cancel netflix as an excps worker im sensitive to the oversexualization of children so im wondering why tiktok is still a thing but thats another discussion after watching cuties i disagree with netflixs marketing of the film because they missed the point of the film but i also have to question whether people who are mad have watched the film should kids watch cuties thats a big no from me but should adults watch it heres what parents need to know in this cuties parents guide when i first watched the trailer of cuties i could feel my blood pressure rise and my disdain grow my first impressions watching young girls twerking were that they were being exploited then i started to see reactions from people on twitter who had seen the movie at sundance and comment that this wasnt the movie they watched so i had to see for myself from director maïmouna doucouré a frenchsenegalese film director cuties is about elevenyearold amy who lives with her mom and younger brother awaiting her father to rejoin the family from senegal amy is fascinated by her wild neighbor angelicas freespirited dance clique named cuties a group that is a sharp contrast to how she was raised in dress attitude and behavior even after they bully her amy wants to be accepted and convinces them to use even more provocative dance moves for a local dance competition  those dance moves are what has caused the outrage but thats not even the worst of it cuties is rated tvma for language sexual content and truthfully its disturbing to watch is cuties ok for kids heres what parents should know before they let their children watch cuties i watched in french with english subtitles so you can either read the language or switch the audio to english but there is a lot of profanity like bit fu a bullsh slut whore etc heres where cuties is not appropriate for young children there is very suggestive and sexualized dancing where 11yearolds are twerking essentially humping the ground making provocative faces with their fingers in their mouths slapping themselves and each other on the butts and more  however in other situations one girl takes a picture down her pants to post on social media you dont see her actual body part in a music video the girls are watching on a computer a high school girl pulls down her shirt to expose her boob in another scene the girls dare a girl to record a boy in the bathroom peeing in a urinal and she does it though you dont see past the wall the girls make references to rape one girl finds what she perceives to be a balloon but its a condom and she blows it up then the girls scream and tell her she probably has aids the girls also discuss oral sex another scene shows a girl stab a boy in the hand hard with a pencil and a girl pushes another girl into water and the girl cant swim almost causing her to drown a parent slaps a girl there are situations of bullying and calling people names one character throws a rock and hits a girl in the head causing her to bleed as a parent i get the message that the director is making and i think its an important one doucouré said my one message would be that childhood is precious and we all have to protect our children she told shadow and act we all have to come together to figure out what is best for our children so that we can give a beautiful space to our children to grow up safely and peacefully so that they can have the freedom to choose who they want to become and the best version of themselves however in this film she didnt protect the actors that had to portray these scenes theyre horrible and disgusting to watch i felt sick to my stomach i dont want to have to google to try to find out if the actress who exposed herself is over 18 or if ive just been a witness to child pornography for the greater good do we need to exploit the children in the film as a critic im mad that she spoonfed these scenes to the audience maybe it was shock value or to have people pay attention but you dont have to make scenes so paintbynumber to get the point across let the audience get what they want from the images youre portraying  and they really didnt need to be so graphic to be impactful plus the movie itself is boring aside from the shock value scenes its a long slow build to the ending scene which was beautiful but not worth the wait once again the end scene left little to the imagination parents if youre outraged by the trailer then watch the film get even more outraged at whats going on in society even if you dont agree with the methods whats going on in society for these young girls is happening those same disgusting dance moves your 11yearold girls are doing them on tiktok i know because theyre friends with my kids and follow me and ive seen some of them  were allowing society and friends tell these impressional young girls that your worth is based on likes and the more sexual you are the more youll be accepted that being said no adults or even peers condoned the behavior outside of the cuties group that is one thing i appreciated about the film even some older boys were disgusted that such young girls were trying to act like they were older netflix was wrong in the way they marketed this film do i think cuties was made for pedophiles no i think it was made for parents and society but in an erroneous way that missed the mark let the cuties controversy be a wake up call to parents fix whats in front of you first pay attention to whats happening to your own kids and start with your own home and the rest of the world lets change the culture and pressures we put on these tweens
Sep 17 2020,negative, the world is a confusing place right now we believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs do you believe that too help tgc bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work one of the most disturbing things about netflixs cuties is that many ostensibly sophisticated cultured people seem bent on defending and redeeming what is in the end an irredeemably problematic film ive watched cuties reluctantly and its true the film is attempting to critique rather than to celebrate the exploitative sexualizing of young girls but by doing the very thing it critiquesrepeatedly gratuitously horrifyinglyit undermines its point and dangerously justifies in the name of thoughtful art something that cannot be justified the films defenders will respond with various what abouts what about the fact that the real villain is netflixs marketing department that might be a valid defense except that the image on the promotional poster comes from an actual scene in the filman extended scene of lewd sexualized preteen dancing far more disturbing than the poster itself what about the fact that its a wellmade personal story by a talented filmmakera sensitive portrait of female adolescence by a gifted woman of color as rolling stone put it nope sorry even if the film was a magnum opus directed by martin scorsese sofia coppola or terrence malick some of my favorite directors wed still need to draw a line and reject it an auteurs freedom of vision and claims to artistic expression should have moral limits sexualizing real imagebearing precious girls age 11 to make a point is a limit that should be uncontroversial an auteurs freedom of vision and claims to artistic expression should have moral limits sexualizing real imagebearing precious girls age 11 to make a point is a limit that should be uncontroversial what about the suggestion that this is just an electionyear pseudoevent fueled by rightwing qanon fanatics also no i think qanon is a dangerous political cult and i arrived at my assessment of cuties without reading anything written by any conspiracytheory carnival barker its quite revealing that many in the media have assumed a bizarre qanon sextrafficking theory is behind the outrage about cutiesrather than just basic moral concern over sexualizing underage girls our bubbles can be so blinding the fault lines on cuties were quick to developbafflinglyalong partisan lines i could predict what people in my socialmedia feeds would say about the film based on their politics those leaning right and certainly not just the qanon fringe signed petitions to cancelnetflix those leaning left defended the film or dismissed the boycott conversation as a silly outrage in the culture wars how disturbing just as wearing masks during a pandemic should not be a matter of partisan debate neither should condemning a film that recklessly sexualizes children this shouldnt be so hard people on every point on the political spectrum should be able to say it is wrong for a filmany film however wellintentionedto depict closeup lingering shots of scantily clad 11yearolds twerking its refreshing that some leaders on the left have recognized this as the nonpartisan issue it should be like democratic congresswoman tulsi gabbard or nancy pelosis daughter christine but they are the exception not the norm weve been so blinded by confirmation bias and negative partisanshipdriven more by owning the other side than by actual positive convictionsthat were willing to justify something heinous because we dont like the people calling it heinous it seems weve been so blinded by confirmation bias and negative partisanshipdriven more by owning the other side than by actual positive convictionsthat were willing to justify something heinous because we dont like the people calling it heinous of course this problem goes beyond the cuties controversy and plagues conservatives too who are often quick to defend their favored politicians morally dubious behavior against the unfair attacks of the other side for christians especially its crucial we call foul on what is morally depraved wherever we find iteven if in our own camp fans of maïmouna doucouré should be able to say shes talented and i get what shes trying to do but i cant condone this just as fans of president trump should be able to say i like his stance on this issue but hes absolutely wrong in the way he argues his case a right message can be delivered in a wrong way people on both sides of the political divide should be willing to admit this point there are certainly times when transgressive and shocking content in art serves a purpose movies especially with their ability to mimic realism so viscerally can pack an indelible punch in this way a movie like schindlers list is memorable in part because it refuses to soften the visual embodied atrocities of the holocaust spielbergs film makes a point cinematically that couldnt be made in exactly the same way in a book or a poem but transgressive content in a film must be handled with utmost carebecause the line between shocking to make a point and shocking for its own sake is often contested and arbitrary further when a films transgressive material is sexual in nature the ethical lines are especially blurry in order to present such material real embodied people are necessarily objectified and sexualized before cameras directors film crews and ultimately audiences its one thing to defend this when the actors are adults but after metoo the ethics of even this are being questioned but when the actors are underageagain only 11 years oldits another thing entirely if one only reflects on the amount of practice these 11yearold girls had to do in order to master dance moves simulating rough sex the wretchedness of the whole enterprise becomes apparent an actor must become proficient in martial arts before starring in a martial arts film in cuties these young actors had to become proficient in their own sexual commodification again the problem is not that doucourés pointthat the degrading and dehumanizing of womens bodies is wrong whether it happens in a restrictive muslim context or a libertine western oneis offbase or unimportant the problem is the means to this end dont watch cuties we dont need to watch young girls gyrating on the floor and twerking on staircases to be aware of how mass media conditions young women to see themselves and their bodies an article essay book consider american girls or any number of daily headlines make us aware if you live in proximity to kids in this world you are aware filming real young girls doing the very things we want to prevent young girls from doing is not the answer as my friend kevin yi observed on facebook if this was a movie about the evils of dog fighting and the filmmakers staged a bunch of real dog fights to get their point across everyone would see the wrongness of the strategy the babylon bee made a similar point  speaking of cuties director doucouré observed our girls see that the more a woman is overly sexualized on social media the more shes successful and the children just imitate what they see    its dangerous quite right the problem is many of the same feminist defenders of cutieswho would nod along with doucourés children just imitate what they see commentalso find jlos super bowl pole dancing praiseworthy not problematic you cant hold up globally televised sexualized dancing as a celebration of empowered women and latino culture and at the same time lament that 11yearold girls in paris want to imitate that behavior which is it if we praise scantily clad sexualized pop stars like beyoncé shakira or cardi b as feminist icons and empowered role models for young girls we should neither complain nor be surprised when preadolescent girls acts this way too as in cuties the metoo movement supposedly sparked a difficult soulsearching reckoning for hollywoodwhich has always been one of the chief purveyors of sexualized bodies as cheap goods for widespread consumption but the fact that cuties was made celebrated at the sundance film festival and distributed on netflix shows theres still a lot more soulsearching to do the same goes for christians new pew research sadly shows that many christians are only slightly less confused than nonchristians on sexual ethics so even as we rightly denounce a film like cuties we should also double down on fighting pornography addiction sexual abuse and other immorality within our midst the force of the sexual revolution has not left the church unscathed after all we must press in to the challenges of discipleship on matters of sexuality defending the goodness of sex in its rightful covenantal place all while protecting the vulnerableespecially childrenfrom the tragic consequences of sex outside of that sacred context brett mccracken is a senior editor and director of communications at the gospel coalition he is the author of the wisdom pyramid feeding your soul in a posttruth world uncomfortable the

Sep 17 2020,positive, the sexualisation of children has to be one of the most difficult topics to explore in cinema given the importance to neither downplay the issue nor sensationalise it in order to treat the subject matter with the sensitivity it requires given these inherent difficulties maïmouna doucours comingofage debut feature film cuties is all the more impressive for how well it navigates the experiences of 11yearold amy fathia youssouf who is drawn to a clique of girls at her new school who aspire to dance competitively torn between her the ultraconservative values of her familys religion and the hypersexualised popular culture she and her peers consume online amys sense of identity is increasingly assaulted as the result of trying to navigate the mixed and often contradictory messages she absorbs about how to behave and her value as a young woman having recently moved into a small apartment in the suburbs of paris with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and younger brothers amy is becoming aware that there is something rotten about the difference in status between men and women this manifests both in small ways  she has to wear a head scarf and attend religious instruction while her younger brother is allowed to play  and in larger ways as she witnesses the grief and turmoil her mother endures at having to accept amys father will soon return from senegal with a second wife to make matters worse the community elder la tante mbissine thérèse diop informs amy that part of her becoming a woman is learning to cook in preparation for the wedding the oppressive patriarchy of her familys adherence to a repressive religion is one of subservience for women who are reduced to commodities and expected to gladly accept their lower status there is little wonder amy yearns to rebel however at this young and impressionable age she is also being taught that her happiness will be dependent on male approval and this toxic belief hijacks her rebellion enter the cuties the dance group of similarly aged girls from school who are led by amys defiant neighbour angelica medina el aidi drawn to the hyper sexualised dance routines and costumes in music video clips the cuties aspire to channel a similar energy into their own sense of selves and adopt the provocative moves into their own routines with the goal of entering an upcoming competition amy is soon accepted into the group and she too begins to embody the highly uncomfortable blurring of boundaries between childhood and adulthood in terms of the ageinappropriate performance of sexual desire so much of cuties is uncomfortable as despite all the bravado on display there is never any doubt that the girls are just kids cuties continually creates jarring clashes between the sexualised nature of their performed adult behaviour and just how childish they are the moment they let their guard down as their routines get increasingly sexual the film draws attention to how ridiculous and contrived their moves are showing the girls awkwardly trying to replicate the moves and expressions theyve seen in video clips despite having little understanding of the loaded nature of such moves their attempts to lie about their age are ridiculously bad and fool nobody and they are completely clueless about sex and sexual health displaying a bewildering lack of awareness that would be comical if it werent so alarming the constant reinforcement of the girls childishness is what makes their dance routines so disturbing to watch frequently filmed in a series of a short shots often on a closeup of a body part this technique mimics the style of the music videos the girls have consumed and further reinforces that they are only children it is confronting to watch and it is designed to be that way any attempts to make the routines more palatable would have compromised the social critique that something has gone wrong where preteen girls such as amy angelica and her friends feel they should present themselves to the world in a way that is not so different from how amys conservative religious upbringing similarly presents women as commodities a major part of what makes maïmouna doucours film so compelling is that it asks difficult questions rather than provide a simplistic answer it would have been easy for cuties to simply declare that sexy music videos are evil and corrupting and they should therefore be banned fortunately the film doesnt go down such a moralistic and narrowminded path as it instead raises more challenging questions such as why the girls have been led to believe that they need to adopt moves and behaviour that they clearly dont fully comprehend why are these girls so ignorant about sex why are they not aware of the differences between real life and the constructed fantasy of a music video why do they feel the need to project a femininity that conforms so aggressively to the male gaze the tragedy of cuties is not that expressions of sexuality are increasingly widespread in popular culture but how badly family education religion and society have let these girls down so that they have misinterpreted and absorbed these expressions at such an inappropriate age sadly cuties is facing an aggressively misinformed backlash mostly from people who havent seen it the shockingly misguided decisions made by the streaming platform netflix on how to initially market the film triggered this backlash resulting in ongoing accusations that cuties is either deliberately promoting objectification of young girls rather than critiquing it or that its attempts at making such a critique have failed as the film has inadvertently become what it is supposed to be against such claims are baseless as there is no doubt about the intentions of the film to seriously examine the highly inappropriate sexualisation of its protagonist most alarming is the way this backlash distracts from the complexities of the film and it could well be the case that such a distraction is part of the intent behind the campaign to discredit cuties labelling a single film as dangerous and such a threat to children that it must not be streamed into peoples homes out of concerns for the safety and wellbeing of the community is a lot easier than grappling with the confronting questions a film like cuties raises about the culpability of numerous aspects of culture and society that have contributed to the premature loss of innocence among children over time maïmouna doucour and her film will be vindicated despite the terrible initial mishandling of the films promotion netflix should also be acknowledged for holding its ground against the hateful ignorance being thrown towards it it would be a very sad day when moral panic founded on baseless accusations leads to censorship all this also distracts from the fact that among so many other things cuties is a sophisticated comingofage story about a young girl torn between two cultures its a film about the immigrant experience family friendship and the relationship between a mother and a daughter its a film that ends on an incredibly beautiful final shot that confirms that at its heart is a brilliant young girl who we are allowed to hope will ultimately rise above everything thrown at her while at times very difficult viewing there is no doubting the sincerity and integrity behind cuties
Sep 16 2020,positive,cuties is complicated and at times disturbing but not for the reasons cited by its critics its an effective argument against exploitation not exploitive in itself
Sep 16 2020,positive, cuties maïmouna doucourés debut feature became a subject of intense social media ire when netflix released a poster showing four scantily clad young girls striking suggestive dance poses it was accused of promoting paedophilia and consequently petitions to ban the films release and netflix itself were signed maïmouna doucourés debut feature cuties mignonnes in french has been in the news for all the wrong reasons  last month netflix released a poster for the film showing four scantily clad young girls striking suggestive dance poses social media users instantly dialled the anger up to 11 accusations of paedophilia promotion were made petitions to ban the films release and netflix itself were signed death threats were issued against the frenchsenegalese filmmaker you know the usual stages of social medias cycle of rage watch a twominute clip or a single representative image and the chronically angry feel obliged to participate in every debate and throw in a casual death threat like it were a legitimate form of criticism of course these people have not seen the movie perhaps they never will if they did they would realise the fact that netflix chose that particular poster as a representative image of the film only seems to be proving doucourés point the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood and innocence sadly her intentions were misunderstood in decontextualisation in contrast to the us poster the french version shows the young girls gleefully swinging their shopping bags as they saunter down a street they are fully clothed although they are wearing bras and underwear over their own clothes it is far more representative of the film because it exposes their prepubescent naivety their clothes betray their understanding of what it means to be an adult moreover it doesnt take the film out of its comingofage context and reduce it to the sexualisation of young girls elevenyearold amy fathia youssouf lives with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and two little brothers in a poor parisian neighbourhood when she finds out her father intends to bring home a second wife from senegal she kickstarts a preteen rebellion by joining a twerking troupe who call themselves cuties amy is instantly attracted to their exuberance and quickly befriends the groups leader angelica médina el aidiazouni being forced into the boys bathroom to film their genitals launches her initiation winning a dance contest the end goal for amy dancing becomes a liberating outlet to escape her anxieties and detach herself from the domestic crisis it becomes a kind of refuge as she transitions from tween to teen most of all it helps her fit in so the veil soon makes way for croptops and booty shorts as they symbolise liberation in amys eyes in a scene where the women gather for a prayer session amy hides in her hijab pulls out her stolen phone and secretly watches videos of strippers twerking hoping for pointers to freshen their choreography the following morning she teaches the cuties what she learnt in an montage filled with butt shots surveying this minefield will definitely test viewers with low discomfort threshold but it compels us to question our own gaze the cuties are not oblivious to the male gaze after breaking into a game of laser tag amy twerks to keep the managers gaze transfixed on her to get them out of trouble he forgets to call the police and lets them all go it is a deeply disconcerting scene which exposes the voyeuristic gaze which has transformed a 11yearold girl into an adult woman doucouré is clearly denouncing not promoting a culture which foists adult sexuality on preteen girls these cuties who call kim kardashian their mom rely on social media for validation doped up on instagram likes amy and her cuties yield to the pressure to conform to pop cultures sexualised narratives the number of instagram likes become the sum of their selfworth their life a popularity contest and the accelerated maturation is their maladaptive response to it these are girls who have barely completed the last rites for their childhood but they are eager to skip the teenage phase and dive into adulthood they dress the part but its an imitation which reveals their ignorance they are appropriating the sexual codes of adults without adequate literacy to take stock of what they imply this is best exemplified in a scene where one of them picks up a used condom blows it up like a balloon and then they all freak out believing she has been infected with aids they then proceed to cure her by washing her tongue with hand wash in another scene when amy surveys the derrières of the women in her community its an education in the simple confluence of anatomy and dance without any awareness of the big booty fetishisation in pop culture youssoufs twerks her gestures and her pouts become a radical expression of this unsure prepubescence amys family believe these provocative dance routines to be a sign of demonic possession she grapples with the demonisation of the female body which is literally exorcised later in the film doucouré often opts for dream logic to formalise amys internal anxieties about her femininity the embroidered flowers on her blue dress begin to bleed anticipating the beginning of her puberty once amy joins the group their friendship becomes as liberating as alienating because the cuties are like any clique there is a tender friendship that unites them but also a petty cruelty that can divide them so amy finds herself torn between what her religious family want her to be and what her preteen peers want her to be in her efforts to shrink the gap between her familys expectations and her friends a new identity awkwardly asserts itself doucourés own dual cultural identity is at the heart of the film which illustrates the contradictions faced by muslim families who migrate westwards her denunciation of sexualising young girls feels all the more stronger as it is anchored against a backdrop of the culture clash between the traditions of a conservative senegalesemuslim family and the fauxliberation of western society though cuties is tethered to amys comingofage it also gives us a parallel portrait of the mother chained to the weight of traditions hiding under the bed amy hears mariam cry and then slap herself for not being happy about her husband finding himself a second wife her fathers presence is manifested only through phone calls in a film without considerable male presence but the burdens of patriarchy still weigh on its women because its enablers can often be women like the auntie who is always there to remind them on the ways of modesty mariam however gives her daughter a choice she cant allow for herself in the concluding shot there is a smile on amys face as the camera frees her from the gaze of sexualisation the weight of tradition and the pressure to fit in its a young girl experiencing joy freedom and innocence in its purest forms
Sep 16 2020,positive, adolescent struggles on film are a welltrodden path but cuties mignonnes from maïmouna doucouré feels fresh and modern that modernity often manifests in uncomfortable ways but the authenticity of this portrait is evident this personal story juggles several topics but the excellent performance of young fathia youssouf in the challenging central role provides a focal point for all of them we follow fathia youssouf as amy a young french girl in paris she is being raised fairly traditionally in the islamic faith by her mother mariam maïmouna gueye while her father is absent set to marry a second wife in senegal causing issues at home after she spies angelica médina el aidiazouni in her buildings laundry room she is intrigued by her  dancing exuberantly and straightening her hair with an iron  while fearful of the group of angelicas friends although the group bully her amy gradually ingratiates herself with her dancing skills the girls dancing routine  prepared for an upcoming competition  seem too provocative for preteens and the group are also eager to demonstrate their growing awareness of their femininity by presenting themselves as worldly and sexually aware doucourés film places a tremendous amount of responsibility on fathia youssouf who conveys the curiosity of youth as well as the confounding blend of determination and naivety one would expect of an 11yearold doucourés film places a tremendous amount of responsibility on fathia youssouf who conveys the curiosity of youth as well as the confounding blend of determination and naivety one would expect of an 11yearold doucourés selfpenned script is also the source of this in addition to some observant modern embellishments to this vignette of accelerated childhood and the clash of cultures amy experiences between her family and friends the story keenly positions the clashes presented to amy during cuties to highlight the heightened sense of importance children attach to such exploits the approaching dance competition takes on outsized importance to amy and the responsibilities to her mother and elderly aunt feel monumentally stifling doucourés direction and the actors combine to present the competing aspects of the girls actual maturity their outward projection of it and the external influences at play the girls perform dance routines which allude to sex yet will not recognise a condom in the grass amy will practice her dance routine in the bathroom and the film will hard cut to her praying with her elders youssouf projects the artificiality of what young people present on social media as a grin erupts on her face when the validation of likes from her peers salves her selfconsciousness far from being an austere affair the film manages to elicit laughs at more than a few of such incidents and balances the tone effectively in a manner cuties is also unflinching the dancing routines choreographed by the girls make use of provocative manoeuvres that draw the disapproving glances of parents and observers  they are uncomfortable to watch just as the passive encouragement of the judges is uncomfortable to see at the same time however amys burgeoning confidence perhaps overconfidence is also apparent these sequences foreground the impact that role models have on the different modes of expression and identity that children and young women in particular may pursue when amy feels stifled by her traditional upbringing her path with angelicas group is the only one seemingly open to her by the time the film concludes it feels as though amy may not be the only one who has begun to find balance and feel elevated  maïmouna doucouré maybe has also the film is generally content to observe maintaining a reasonably naturalistic approach to an authenticfeeling story although the decision to begin in media res is puzzling cuties is a personal and assured tale with a skill for identifying the essence of preteen behaviour particularly for a first feature there are some nice visual touches with amys most childlike moments being the most colourful playing with translucent green beads the varied and dramatic lighting within a laser tag arena albeit in the sort of environment already wellmined in cinema for such aesthetic qualities however the visual flourishes are generally saved for the films final movements as amys worlds collide the film making greater use of colour to convey the chaotic internal moods of its protagonist by the time the film concludes it feels as though amy may not be the only one who has begun to find balance and feel elevated  maïmouna doucouré maybe has also
Sep 16 2020,positive, the debut film by maïmouna doucouré  a thoughtful challenging and rewarding comingofager  has been targeted by an army of keyboard warriors threatening both the streaming platform that hosts it and those who champion it to take dramatic action cancel netflix cancel yourself over the films perceived explicit content cuties follows amy fathia youssouf an 11yearold girl desperately trying to wriggle free from the traditional values she has been raised on as she grows to understand herself and other girls around her through dance its not ballet or hiphop  this is no subversive billy elliot these girls thrust their hips and bite their lips in ferocious magnetic performances its provocative destabilising and electrifying doucouré explores her own roots the tug of war between senegalese muslim customs and the rise of internet culture  putting the female body front and centre the thrill of young girls coming to learn theyre allowed to be comfortable and confident in themselves theres no patronising or demeaning voice from the filmmaker  doucourés camera takes care of her girls championing their talent forcing those who try to muzzle their freedom to take a long hard look at what theyve been missing out on as amy youssouf is a force to be reckoned with always keeping the viewer glued to her perspective as her eyes freeze on the girls she wants to be the moves she wants to feel theres an immediacy that can often be lacking in the genre  although cady in mean girls and kayla in eighth grade narrate their wishes and frustrations there is still so much more distance than in cuties confidence is everything and such a slippery feeling is explored with deep intelligence here as the layers are delicate complicated amy isnt just a twodimensional jittery kid yearning after the popular girls she has an ocean of her own frustrations and talent that comes to bloom and threaten those she wants to impress at such an age every one of them is desperately lost and insecure because of course they are but doucouré understands that there is a fire a violence to them a slap on the cheek a deep sway of the hip a stream of whitehot tears cuties is not a dangerous film that oversexualises young girls its a hungry ambitious often devastating portrait of a youth that has been wrestling with this confusion  this severe whiplash between legacy and desire  forever its not always cute but the most disrespectful thing we could do to these girls would be to pretend its all they ever could be this film shows how they are how they thrive  and what a thrill it is to finally see it so colourfully by choosing to look away we only have ourselves to blame
Sep 15 2020,positive,a bold heartbreaking and fascinating mix of drama and comedy in the same ilk of thirteen and our song
Sep 15 2020,positive, its infrequent that a film comes along with as much prerelease furor as netflixs recent cuties if youve heard about it online youve likely heard one or more of the following it promotes pedophilia its a documentary theres underage nudity and theres 11year olds performing sex acts on themselves andor others none of those are the case that said its a very raw and unsettling look at what these particular young girls believe to be the path to success and popularity so lets kick off with what the film is about  it follows amy diop fathia youssouf an elevenyearold senegalese immigrant living in france with her conservativemuslim family the family is awaiting the return of her father who it turns out has gone to marry a second wife and bring her back to france amy who is already isolated by the strict cultural dogma which she is surrounded with rebels in protest for what she feels is the marginalization of her mother she sees another girl who she goes to school with practicing hiphop dancing she manages to get her way into that girls friend group and they decide that one way to become famous and popular is to emulate the kind of provocative dancing being done by the older girls they decide to enter a dance competition to further up their status and they dial their efforts up far beyond what would be remotely ageappropriate points to take away from the description is that there are no adults or even older children encouraging them to be sexy or to play up the twerking in fact in each moment of adults encountering the girls they deride them for their actions even as the film gets to its contest performance finale it doesnt go at all the way films usually do read it doesnt go well for the girls because they do go over the top by a country mile  the film absolutely is a manifesto about how young girls are overexposed to hypersexualized content and it is expressed to them as being expected of them and the path to popularity and follower counts on instagram they are fed waves of those signals and without any other input to tell them otherwise they may well run right off the rails the film does not celebrate their actions in any way if anything it leads to the girls downfalls and derision there have been other films in recent years which are excellent that speak to the mixsignals given to underage girls in particular such as eighth grade however even then when kayla elsie fisher gets herself into trouble by sexing it up its handled gently in cuties theres nothing gentle about it its like 2002s irréversible or 1986s henry portrait of a serial killer  they are intended to induce shock and revulsion yes sure there will likely be a few pedos out there who see cuties and add it to their fantasy collection of films just as there are those who take the others above as helpful guides in their own predilections however for the main body of audience the point of the film is in no way titillating  its to strive to point out that what an orthodox family of any religion which doesnt give children any guidelines or moral grounding beyond dont do anything and that child is adrift in the myriad mixed signals of the modern world especially as it relates to social media and online followersequatingtoselfworth they can latch onto the wrong things the above said netflix did itself no favors by changing its original frenchsundance release poster showcasing the main girls frolicking over a hill to one with the girls in their dance uniforms all in the hypersexual poses that was a disservice both to the film and to its underlying message they deserved to be called on the carpet for missing the moral of their own film on the topic of the film itself its not a bad film the performances are solid especially from a collection of such young girls the pacing is slow and theres a bit too much done around amys home and family first time writerdirector maïmouna doucouré wanted to showcase her own experiences growing up and it is evidenced in the nuances around the interactions between the family and their wider tribal circle you can tell the points she is drawing from her own experiences because those are the areas she imbues with the levels of reality that give the textures then the others are drawn with a more generic brush the fact that the girls never get particularly good at the dancing causing them to reach further and further across the line of ageappropriate behavior speaks to the brutal sincerity of the situation theyre in however non of the character do we ever really connect with we follow amys story but shes a very damaged little girl and hard to connect with her plight at home or at school  its hard to say who this film is best suited for ideally it would be for kids to watch with their parents who can have a conversation with them to talk about how the messages of peer groups and social media in particular can be inappropriate andor inaccurate however itll be a hard sell for many parents to have those conversations with their kids even now its interesting to watch the dichotomy between the critics ratings just shy of 90 fresh on rt and the audience ratings 11  i expect that few of the audience members have actually watched it its morality message is going to be largely lost in many cases because of how unsettling and jarring it is to see these very young girls decide that this is how the judges and the world at large wants to see them act its not comfortable to watch and thats entirely the point its not meant to be comfortable or easy its meant to be remembered and as a gauge of art it succeeds however a bit more moderation might not have hurt much either bill watters is a child of the late 70s he walked into a theater to watch star wars and emerged to become a lifelong fan of cinema and television spending nearly a decade as a projectionist he fell into the silicon valley dotcom boom and became a codemonkey for a range of game companies

Sep 15 2020,positive, i did some research regarding the area of paris known as little africa where cuties takes place cuties focuses on a community of muslim families originally from senegal a former french colony france retains a tight grip on its former colonies major french telecoms companies banks and retail giants are ubiquitous in countries such as senegal and its political influence remains significant as a result of that colonial history french is the official language of senegal as of mid2017 about 120000 senegalese lived in france according to the united nations estimates france colonized senegal in 1659 and french west africa was a federation of eight colonial territories because of frances colonial past and continuing influence in senegal special conditions allow senegalese a preferred status to immigrate to france maïmouna doucourés feature debut centers around 11yearold amy fathia youssouf she lives with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and two younger brothers they have just moved into a new apartment a crisis occurs when amys father announces that he will be returning to paris with a second wife mariam has dutifully prepared a newly decorated master bedroom for the couple mariam is shamed about the second wife but her traditionbound relative aunty mbissine thérèse diop insists on planning an elaborate wedding celebration inviting their muslim community amy shares her mothers grief about the new wife and hopes her father will not return for decades polygamy was legal in france for immigrants arriving from any of about 50 countries where it is legally recognized historically taking numerous wives was either a religious social and economic necessity in poor countries with high death rates or a sign of external wealth or male domination france banned polygamy in 1993 however the strong relationship between france and senegal makes polygamy a very sensitive subject and its continued presence poses an economic burden on frances generous social services programs while her mother must abide by the teachings of islam on multiple wives and obeying ones husband in all things amy is introduced to the cultural reality that exists outside her restrictive upbringing she watches angelica médina el aidiazouni also 11 yearsold dancing with hip hop abandon in the communal laundry room angelica is dressed in teen stripper clothes and throwing her long hair around while practicing seductive poses is this writerdirector doucourés intent to sexualize children garner controversy and promote child pornography or is it meant to  show how children are easily influenced and exposed to an excessive glut of highly sexual imagery this sexual milieu is prevalent in every aspect of western society and available in all media outlets without preaching from the pulpit cuties forces the viewer to acknowledge some  responsibility everything is presented to suggest overt sexuality is a highly coveted commodity having talent is no longer a criteria for fame in the past one had to find pops hidden playboys or moms harold robbins books now selfdistributed sex tapes are the coin of the realm without good nude shots how is a teenage girl going to get a date amy an innocent child sees how angelica and her friends are respected at school angelica is the leader of her dance group the cuties the girls  coumba esther gohourou jess ilanah camigoursolas and yasmine myriam hamma watch videos of female rappers and practice their suggestive dance moves as the new girl at school amy is bullied by the cuties but using her cousins mamadou samake cell phone that she stole offers to record the girls practicing their routine for the big danceoff competition with access to all social media amy now begins to copy the ultrasexy exaggerated bootymoves of the adult performers  amy begins to encourage the other girls to follow her lead and soon they are all twerking and sliding around the floor mimicking sexual positions  yasmine gets into a fight at school and is thrown out of the cuties since amy secretly has been studying the routines she begs to be part of the tryouts for the local public dance contest soon amy realizes her conservative clothes are not appropriate for the cuties or school she alters a tshirt into a cropped top and functional shorts become cutoffs like the sexy videos suggestive clothing holds no stigma cuties is an indictment of our cultural acceptance  actually a valuable currency  of highly provocative influences all of us are constantly exposed to  after winning a place in the contest amys ambition versus her mothers pending humiliation of the wedding collide amy has tasted freedom and makes some unwise selfish choices it is only the redeeming friendships and the joy of children laughing and playing together that anchors the film and to the directors credit no one sees any of the cuties as sexual objects but as silly little girls i pay 1599 per month for netflix i watch international films and series i watched a turkish series about a surgeon who took ayahuasca and it turned him into istanbuls mr hyde i watched the india matchmaker series there is enough content on netflix that i am not hoodwinked into watching cuties i had a choice the cancel culture is a big brother ruse announcing that a petition has the power to make netflix change its acquisition model the need to make ones voice heard has become the new fascism if cuties is dangerous to the wholesome image of america why is youtube allowed to play cardi bs video for wap the lyrics a few posted here are

Sep 14 2020,positive, stop it thats right im talking to you oh so righteous netflix subscriberinternet pundit pouncing on cuties dont play coy with me i read what you wrote when you thought only a select few were paying attention scantily clad 11yearold girls seen writhing their bodies to hiphop and reggaetón beats naw thats obscene this is an outrage there ought to be a law against such depravity you whined  thing is you didnt watch the movie did you youve convinced yourself you have in your possession all the information you need to know before you play judge jury and executioner on   pay attention now this part is important   a modest sassy and thoroughly engaging portrait of growing up black female and poor of being caught between two cultures each with their own set of challenges and complications  but admit it you didnt make it that far you stopped at tween pelvic thrusts and suggestive gyrations then you put this genial sundance winner in your crosshairs you are not in good company others clutching their pearls have reportedly made death threats against the director and in the case of a texas legislator calls to investigate it for possible violations of child exploitation and pornography laws  next time you want to go after a frenchsenegalese filmmaker telling a story about being an african immigrant in paris do your research before you grab the pitchforks now go take your puritanical superiority somewhere else okay reader now that weve hopefully rid ourselves of the toxic snobs and internet trolls who have swarmed around cuties aka mignonnes with the intent of giving a bad name to a good movie we can go ahead and delve into writerdirector maïmouna doucourés winning refreshingly cleareyed underdog tale  yes its unblinking depiction of ageinappropriate behavior is not always easy to watch but what it most definitely is not is gratuitous titillation it amounts to part of a larger conversation about generational resentment internet peer pressure and that exhilarating and terrifying moment when a girl discovers that shes not powerless the girl in question is aminata diop fathia youssouf though she mostly goes by amy as the movie opens shes just moved into a cramped apartment in one of paris poorest neighborhoods with her hardworking mom mariam maïmouna gueye and two younger brothers only to learn shell have to share a bedroom with her mischievous baby bro ismaël demba diaw  living in a devout muslim household amy takes her place next to mariam her matriarchal aunt mbissine thérèse diop and the rest of the women at the mosque veiled in vibrant colors the tween is shy withdrawn content to be left alone she also wants what more privileged girls have and shes not above stealing a relatives cellphone to get her foot in the door either it certainly beats getting picked on by a quartet of standoffish girls at school that revel in disruption and mayhem the scene where she first meets these troublemakers at the schoolyard makes you flinch taunting shoves lacerating name calling and a book bags contents being spilled onto the ground doucouré makes no attempt to softpedal the girls cruelty toward the new arrival and the movie is stronger because of it its also clear even at this early stage that the filmmaker is dipping her toe in the underdog template  amy you see is undeterred to be part of this bad girl gang comprised of angelica medina el aidi coumba esther gohourou jess ilana camigoursolas and yasmine myriam hamma despite the demeaning treatment but why would she subject herself to that this is where the dancing comes in her multicultural tormentors are keen on entering a talent competition and in their minds mastering a sexy routine is their ticket to victory this is where doucourés skills as a storyteller come into play amy is looking to belong and her quest for acceptance in her adopted new home takes her from the social media exposure she craves to making her case to join these wouldbe bullies clique as a possible asset to qualify for the contest cuties could have settled for going through the dance movie story beats at once familiar and comforting but doucouré wants to dig deeper she weaves in amys relationship with the other girls which is never sentimentalized with a litany of domestic woes and rites of passage back home something most of the girls share is absent or neglectful parents but in amys case its taken a step further the elephant in the room is amys dad reduced here to a voice on the phone promising to join his loved ones real soon   when the movie reveals the reason behind the holdup it shines a spotlight on the pitfalls that senegalese women face it also provides an explanation for amys escalating acts of defiance without letting her off the hook thus amys escape down the rabbit hole of music videos showing grown women wielding their sexuality like a weapon does not occur in a vacuum rather than merely depicting the way girls are objectified as a trendy narrative hook as its illadvised us marketing materials suggest cuties unpacks a complex set of sociocultural circumstances that converge to place the prepubescent characters in a position where they would think these risqué exotic dancer moves are not just achievable but desirable ask yourself would there be such an uproar if cuties told the story of five boys getting into trouble and falling into a life of crime amy wants to assert her womanhood even though shes only on the cusp of adolescence in order to thumb her nose at a stifling culture that would literally keep her covered and also in a rebellious rebuke of a father whose selfish actions have taken away the stability she yearns for her discontent has a dangerous beat and she can dance to it as cuties hurdles toward its climactic showdown on stage this reviewer was torn between cheering on the characters and their gradually improving dancing skills and being dismayed over their lapses in judgment and then i realized thats what makes doucourés writing so effective in opting against passing judgment on these girls or on their imperfect elders she refuses to take the easy way out she takes amy on a journey of selfdiscovery where the stumbles are not cushioned but the hardearned lessons yield genuine growth the movie might not reinvent the wheel thematically but it moves to its own syncopated rhythms ignore the online discourse and give it a chance cuties had its world premiere at the 2020 sundance film festival where maïmouna doucouré picked up a directing award in the world cinema dramatic competition its now available to stream on netflix theater the actor nominated for a tony award for his portrayal as mrs doubtfire in the broadway musical comes to fort lauderdale in the national tour michelle f solomon has the review
Sep 14 2020,positive, adolescence is a time few want to relive but its inherent dichotomies are inexhaustible fodder for cinema cuties maïmouna doucourés debut evokes céline sciammas vision of youth in water lilies and girlhood in its first moments as quiet outsider amy youssouf becomes enthralled with a dance troupe  specifically the one girl who lives in her building  that exudes confidence popularity and the certain type of cool that comes from mimicking adulthood the adolescent awkwardness then swings into its own unique commentary on young womanhood as amy earns a spot in the crew confronting her identity as the team works towards their next dance competition this clash between the girls lived experience and knowledge with the image they exude on stage is brilliantly captured by yann maritauds cinematography and some unselfconscious performances from the brilliant young leads the cuties take inspiration from an older troupe including moves far too sexualised for 11 and 12yearolds their ignorance of their choreographys connotations  bumping butts is a source of amusement  comes across in the dancers wide smiles and the cameras pans to uneasy spectators these moments contrast against amys frenchsenegalese familys expectations whose complicated internal judgements are conveyed through each changing perspective the films tone is not always consistent leaning just enough into visual comedy that one wishes it probed further into the absurdism of a world that sexualised girls without educating them on their own comfort but throughout amys young perspective is given precedence  and sometimes that values the fleeting glimpse of a boy over decisions that rock her family unit cuties is rough around the edges and slightly undercuts itself in an incongruous denouement but it respects the silliness and sadness of amys comingofage journey the films visual confidence and unaffected performances from its young cast speak of bright futures for all involved  orwav features editor more words at the skinny screen queens bright walldark room and flipscreen mamma mia here we go again is a cinematic masterpiece
Sep 14 2020,positive,director maïmouna doucouré posits forward a film that proposes a highly nuanced debate that was tainted by a glaring error on netflixs part full review in spanish
Sep 14 2020,positive, fear hangs heavy over cuties the sundancewinning comingofage debut from maïmouna doucouré in the film the fear of god is taught to amy fathia youssouf from a young age evil dwells in the bodies of uncovered women warns the preacher at her womens service fear has also shrouded the release of cuties itself after a misguided poster choice from distributor netflix sent bleak messages about sexualised girls into a triggerhappy twittersphere the poster image of amy and her crew backlit and provocatively positioned in skintight uniforms does feature in cuties here are some other images that feature mariams maïmouna gueye bare feet seen from under a bed as amy listens to her crying at the news that amys father is taking a second wife a parisian sky punctured by glitter and rainbowcoloured hair extensions that the girls have thrown giddily into the air a prism of emerald light as amy and her brother peer through a beaded necklace the world that doucouré has written for her lost girl is so gorgeously crafted and considerately framed that when the supposedly raunchy dance moves arrive they translate at worst into clumsy mimicry at best the catalyst for selfrealisation the moves that the girls have picked up from music videos and social media are both a form of cultural commentary but also an extension of their chaotic energy which doucouré takes care to show manifest in other ways like fake shootouts at laser tag and scrappy fights with locals the girls unpolished but harmonious performances  especially between youssouf and médina el aidiazouni who plays gang leader angelica  are dampened slightly by netflixs decision to dub the film another misfire especially given its recent push for bilingual content the world may be weighing against this frenchlanguage indie about a child whose family is falling apart push aside the headlines however and youll be rewarded with a vibrant morally intelligent film that ironically reserves judgement
Sep 14 2020,positive, should this film be cancelled or to raise a secondary point should one see this film before taking a view on such things its still surprising to me even having lived through so many controversies like this how many people cant quite bring themselves to answer yes to the second question or they say that watching the film simply plays into the filthmerchants hands a sorrowing paradox i remember first encountering during the national theatre run of the romans in britain mignonnes or cuties  an interesting flawed debut feature for netflix from francosenegalese director maïmouna doucouré  finds itself at the centre of the nastiest obscenity row since david cronenbergs crash in 1996 this is because of sequences showing a group of naive excitable 11yearold girls in a dance group twerking and pouting their way through a grotesquely sexualised adult routine there has been an ugly and abusive social media storm dominated by vicious trolls who havent seen the film and by mischiefmakers jumping at the chance to embarrass those with netflix connections such as the obamas yet the film and its accusers turn out to be on the same side mignonnes attacks the pornification of girls and young women by social media and society in general it is about the false promise of liberation in this kind of sexualised display the offending scenes are gruesomely unwatchable  deliberately so a final scene in which the girls present their routine at a dance competition shows people in the audience becoming baffled and disgusted with one apparently complaining to the judges it is about a lonely 11yearold french girl of senegalese origin amy fathia youssouf who has learned that to be female is to be a secondclass citizen she has witnessed the wretched humiliation of her mother because amys father just got engaged to a second woman back in senegal and wants to bring this woman over to france to live in their small flat at religious meetings amy and all the other women are told they must obey their husbands a dogma fiercely enforced by a community elder known as auntie or la tante in which role doucouré has got out of retirement the veteran senegalese actor mbissine thérèse diop who was the star in ousmane sembènes black girl in 1966 and so quietly desperate at her oppression amy becomes fascinated by an outrageous girlgang in her year at school the cuties who dont give a damn about anything and are bumping and grinding through a dance routine theyre working on for a local competition at first they pick on amy but she makes friends with them steals a smartphone so she too can participate in the endless instagram narcissism festival and then insinuates herself into the cuties dance troupe by inventing even more outrageous moves for them in a way its a classic mean girls storyline provocatively backdated to the tween years weirdly the film seems to predict and preempt all the language of debate when a harassed teacher tells them to stop dressing inappropriately the cuties defiantly raise a cry for freedom as they are dragged off and when a security guard tries ejecting them from a lasertag hall theyve sneaked into they shout stop groping me you child molester at some level they have a precocious sense of whats at stake but they are as naive as children  the children they actually are  about whats happening the film doesnt entirely work there are untied plot strands the film hits its ideas a bit squarely on the nose and i wasnt sure about the supernatural moments in which the frumpy dress that amy is given to wear by her mum seems haunted by the woman that amy is destined to be but it all hangs together and the good faith with which it is presented to the audience is clear enough a lot more good faith than twitter and its pitchfork mob
Sep 14 2020,positive, for this critic there are two telling scenes among many that stand out in migonnes now better known as cuties that typify its challenge and its caution they are not among the headlining firebranded clips of its maligned netflix marketing nevertheless the jarring tension is everpresent in a scene in the first half of the awardwinning french film one of the central 11yearold girls finds an open and very likely used condom in a public park she doesnt know what it is and inflates it to create a pretend boob to impress her friends for laughs one of her peers immediately stops her and explains in quick fashion the disgustingness of what shes touching the puffedup confidence in the initial girl is quickly erased with mortification in a reply of shock and embarrassment all she could muster to say was how was i supposed to know that its not my fault i didnt know what it was no young lady it sure wasnt your fault scenes like that one and many others completely devoid of adult supervision positive influences and honest comingofage education typify in a dramatized fashion the challenges and dangers of gender definitions selfimage sexual freedom and dozens more that often engulf teenagers cuties is a movie that displays those tangible negatives the second scene comes later moving like a moth to deadly fire all movie long our main character amy a senegalese muslim immigrant to france played with bracing emotion by fathia youssouf has fully embraced the devilmaycare lifestyle of a local clique of fellow girls that call themselves the cuties in trying to earn attention and prove her presumed worth for their shared dance competition goals amy has lashed out and committed acts that even the hardcore original cuties define as wrong and too far they kick amy out of the group and it enrages her further that was a telling turning point for the wildest girls that throw caution to the wind even they had their limits and lines in the sand it is very likely that their collective limits will exceed those of the domestic audiences watching this film at far earlier moments than this late collapse if even reading those two scenes is too much welcome again to challenge and caution that is the honest reality examined by maïmouna doucourés film  to rewind amy comes from a transitioning household of poverty and tradition her mother mariam maïmouna gueye is raising three children alone while hurt internally by the move of her childrens father to take another wife and exit the parental picture mariams anger creates a wavering seesaw between despondency and strictness where the differing religious and cultural implications loom large in cuties  lesson 1 how to become a woman amys familial elders insist on teaching her how to be a woman which on some level entails preparing food remaining clothed and pius from external evils and maintaining a demure personality of complete obedience who deems that to be the right or wrong way to that adulthood is that fair and free femininity how often does that forced ideal create oppression and objectification instead of true freedom and most of all choice where is that correct benchmark welcome again to challenge and caution lesson 2 the wrong friends are the wrong influence compared to the rigidity at home the cuties led by an accommodating apartment neighbor named angelica médina el aidiazouni look attractive and fascinating to amy the truth is they are plastic bullies who are ruthless and ruleless with little to no social boundaries initial silliness quickly turns more deviant their peer pressure first against amy and then to later include her is sexualized with taboo mischief and attentionseeking thirst for male crushes those arent good friend choices but a lonely and jaded newcomer like amy doesnt see that or know better lesson 3 the act of emulation what these girls are superficially pretending to be with their fashion choices body image language and behavior is a warped theory of what their unguided and uninformed selves think a superior woman needs to be the ease of digital access to adult content shows these youths that the more a woman is sexualized the more successful they are the rest is emulation not all that far removed from girls in the 1980s channeling an attitude and practicing madonnas bold dance moves as a chance for selfexpression content choices and ratings notwithstanding dancing counts as engagement and skillbuilding practice with choreographic detail could dancers use that skill for better things of course but in cuties who or what is there to offer alternatives lesson 4 the invasive dangers of social media back then the audience for your little mtv concert was yourself in a mirror or at most a slumber party group of your besties today its the wideopen and unfiltered outlets of social media like tiktok or instagram on an internet crawling with privacyinvading eyes and predatory presences the risks are exponentially worse you are watching but who else is how secure is your privacy and for that matter your dignity or innocence welcome again to challenge and caution  the film does not discount such dangers in the slightest quite the opposite in fact for a film that rarely leaves the shellshocked and worldabsorbing face of youssouf the increasing and desperate failures from her difficult situations and culture clash confusion flesh out a valuable and compelling tale of staunch social warnings there are lines between provocation and expression cuties is far more the latter than the former if your ruffled feathers ask what kind of monster could make what the rumors say this movie is pause that fearmongering to watch and listen to the filmmaker herself maïmouna doucouré winner of the directing award for world cinema at the 2020 sundance film festival researched this for a yearandahalf she is your essential perspective and necessary context this is not my lifestyle to judge nor yours projecting your ideal here of what is explicit or exploitative is out of place in allowing her to tell her story its pure and rank bias when you do that lesson 5 what are you really going to do about it when it comes to cuties if you dont like what you see of these errant kids left to their own wiles and devices your gut is accurate and working if its imagery bothers you its supposed to check your gaze and your privilege now look past the fictional take and target the very valid and present potential problem in our own settings and lives off the netflix couch if you dont want that prevent it with education if you dont want those sexualized elements to be goals dont make them so appealing and desirable to the uninformed adjust those expectations or create better ones shake your head change your stance to empathy and honesty and act accordingly to our daughters and children get there and you have made it precisely to the point that is being hammered home
Sep 14 2020,neutral, whatever gifts french writerdirector maïmouna doucouré brings to the table subtlety isnt included her challenging provocative hotbutton tween girls gone somewhat wild drama cuties mignonnes in french slaps you in the facehard  and not just once but repeatedly doucouré mamans is her bestknown credit grabs growing up too fast in the west and rides that message with a vengeance eschewing smooth natural transitions in favor of shocks to the system its as jarring as it is unsettling crosses lines she doesnt need her to cross to make her points and abandons religious hot buttons she seems too timid to wholly engage when we meet her amy fathia youssouf is a wideeyed innocent shes 11 dutifully looking after two younger brothers one in diapers she is on the cusp of womanhood within her emigre community listening in on the muslim womens ministries entreaties to obey your husbands and fear allah but her mother maïmouna gueye keeping the family together by herself has gotten troubling news her husband has found a second wife and is bringing her back to france to marry and move into their apartment mother mariam had no say and doesnt have to articulate the betrayal this feels like amy has just absorbed this news when she spies a classmate shaking her groove thing and ironing her long hair in the apartment complexs laundry room amy is transfixed she watches admires and envies she would love to be in with angelicas médina el aidiazouni crowd theyre a brash brusque and tightnit quartet that wants to compete in the big danceoff coming up amy is entirely too square too unskilled too socially awkward and plainlydressed to crack in with blonde bully jessica ilanah camigoursolas pushy coumba esther gohourou angelica and yasmine myriam hamma besides theyre already a quartet sure she can video them rehearsing but i can learn to dance wont mean a thing if they dont alter their lineup at home amy starts acting out her mother understands why she wont talk to her father on the phone but is totally unaware shes stolen an uncles phone and her moms money and has utterly immersed herself in the hypersexualized western culture that the cuties represent adults are totally out of the loop with this crowd amy neglects her babysitting duties hides her new makeupandcoochiecuttershalter top look and makes it her business to imitate her more mature peers in every way  flirting with boys imitating the vulgar displays of underclad music video dancers and backing up her sisters in her new gang doucouré jerks amy and us through every stage of this transition one scene shes still the demure but curious immigrant the next shes nicki minaj and sherri moon zombie a bumping grinding poutymouthed sex object totally tartedup if not quite aware of exactly what it is shes impersonating youssouf plays amy as an openbook wonder eager to fit in  numb or just stunningly naive when it comes to recognizing how out of line her behavior is in the culture shes been raised in at several points in the films third act her weneedtoactolderthan11 peers recoil and say youve gone too far to our heroine its not out of line to think our director has committed the same sin if a guy had filmed this as if hed have to hide out in the polanski pedophile precincts of switzerland but its not really messaging or doucouré hitting her points too hard that took me out of cuties its the many abrupt transitions the toosudden conversion amy undergoes the avoidance of showing stark repercussions within her islamic community and the unbelievable way amy comes to understand what she has become and its personal sexual and moral consequences doucouré brings a muchneeded new perspective and new voice to the cinema but this doesnt have the depth or grim impact of a kids 1995 or thirteen 2003 and signing on with netflix where milf and an easy girl are just the french entries in the streaming services race to find a youngyoungeryoungest sexual edge is no way to pick up one thing her storytelling desperately lacks
Sep 13 2020,positive,the audience may have some growing up to do
Sep 12 2020,positive, there is an urgent need in our world for the development of empathy and critical thinking especially when it comes to social media our information now comes to us in tweetsized skimmable headlines often without requiring us to think too deeply about the greater issues at hand before we click the share or like button and move on clickbait abounds conspiracy theories thrive and cancel culture has become commonplace what this internetbased culture of immediacy tends to promote is kneejerk reactions often exacerbated by ideological alliances which generate simplistic eitheror dichotomies to some degree this makes senseits much easier and quicker to place something or someone into an alreadyknown categorygoodbad liberalconservative etcin order to celebrate or condemn it than it is to actually readlistenreceive the artideaperson in question and attempt to understand itthem patient contemplation and careful reading are difficult practices not often granted public rewards this is partially why i find cinema so important to our presentday discourse it allows us to empathetically enter into anothers world to imaginatively occupy various subjective positions to have a sense of temporary immersion or participation in someone elses value system and experience to feel how they feel and thus perhaps to have our own imaginations alliances and praxis be reoriented for the better we are made to slow down take a break from the everyday world and at least when theaters were open turn off our electronic devices in order to truly pay attention the cinematic world before us and as both philosopher simone weil and sister sarah joan from lady bird rightly attest love and attention can be the same thing how we pay attention may be indicative of whether and how we love maïmouna doucourés attentive empathetic and daring featurelength debut cuties mignonnes directly engages with these cultural concerns of social media and getting attention both within its diegetic world as well as in the extradiegetic backlash to the films deeply problematic marketing from its distributor netflix the comingofage film follows amy fathia youssouf an 11yearold senegalese immigrant living in the banlieues of paris with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and her little siblings as the family holds to very traditional religious beliefs amy finds herself caught between numerous worlds between senegal and france between conservative religion and liberal secularism between being a child and an adult as she quietly observes the complex world around her amy longs for a sense of belonging and identity she tries to find it in a group of fellow tween girls led by angelica medina el aidi a fiery queen bee who lives in amys housing project the spunky clique spends much of their time practicing dances and posting them to social media all in preparation for a local amateur dance contest the girls are immature and mean bullying one girl out of the group as they try to act more grown up than they really are by wearing tight and revealing clothing or using crass language to make themselves sound older as amy becomes more aware of her own body and burgeoning sexuality she finds herself less sure of her familys traditions and drawn further into both the cutiess orbit and the influential online world doucouré employs a distinctly cinematic language to address the concerns of growing up in the age of social media the camera often follows amy closely while respecting her interiority unlike many comingofage films about teen girls there are conspicuously no voiceovers granting her a sense of autonomy even as it remains nearby like a watchful guardian the distinctive and vivid miseenscene in conjunction with the cinematography blurs the lines between social realism and expressionism but all of it is imbued with a sense of empathy from the way cuties is structured its clear that doucouré wants us to care deeply about these characters especially about the ways they are treated by society and how they in turn treat others in many respects cuties is a wellcrafted ambitious debut from a clearly talented director and im eager to see what doucouré creates in the future this is not to say that cuties is beyond criticism the story is so primarily concerned with amy that the fellow cuties are not really given distinctive personalities beyond being the brazen girls amy desires to emulate also there are numerous sequences which are discomforting precisely because they walk the line between condemnation and representation two montage sequences in particularone where amy teaches the girls how to twerk after learning about it online another where the girls film themselves provocatively dancing on a staircase in order to later post it on social mediaare often troubling in the cameras lingering on the girls bodies it makes us aware of our complicity as we watch the girls dance and that should unnerve us and the various disturbing behaviors amy finds herself enacting such as attempting to film a boy in the school bathroom or posting a picture of her genitalia online to be clear nothing explicit is ever shown should disturb us as viewers the film never endorses such behaviors but it does make us aware that these behaviors happen and they doall the time in this sense cuties is a universal story as there are amys currently all over the world young people trying to navigate what is right and wrong while mainly being guided by what they find online what is set in a parisian immigrant neighborhood is not so different from the local american elementary or middle school i say this as an observation not as some sort of prudish reproof nor as an endorsementit simply is the world we live in today and cuties portrays that world with a sense of raw authenticity and thoughtful care ultimately cuties sharply critiques both conservative religious patriarchal systems which tend to emphasize womens modesty and submission and the liberal whatever goes sexualization of women in general and young girls in particular in this regard one of the films faults may be its didacticism from the start it is absolutely clear on what the film is critiquingie the unhealthy and exploitative sexualization of preadolescent girlswhich is ironically also what its loudest detractors are decrying in their own blinkered way and so the films finale at a dance contest is not altogether surprising and even feels a bit unearned still the final shot is one of empowerment and hope imbued with a bit of the fantastical not unlike a similar film and one of my personal favorites anna rose holmers masterpiece the fits what becomes strikingly obvious both within cutiess diegetic conflicts and in the realworld backlash is the need for wise mentors in the film the adults who are supposed to be guiding amy into adulthood are often completely oblivious to her whereabouts and actions and totally out of touch with the presentday issues she faces mariam in particular seems too overwhelmed by her own personal struggles with her husbands new wife a complicated situation to be sure to offer any real assistance thus leaving amy to basically fend for herself but mariam is not alone this phenomenon is happening outside of the film too many adults who are supposed to model virtuous character are the same adults so busy posting grammaticallyincorrect trollish outrage on social media in order to boycott a netflixdistributed movie that they arent able to see the sophomoric example they are setting for others tragically as weve seen evidenced all too frequently growing in chronological age does not correlate to growing in maturity good reasoning and research skills logical acuity and empathetic listeningin short practical wisdom phronesisare in short supply so should you watch the film i cant answer that for you use wisdom and discernment to decide for yourself what i can say is that cuties like all good movies may generate empathy for a person or community beyond our own limited reallife experience precisely through the immersive audiovisual form and in our present era of endless divisions we need all the empathy we can get
Sep 12 2020,positive, cuties became the subject of controversy because of promotional materials netflix released the streaming services suggestive artwork misrepresented the film by taking a provocative scene out of context if the hubbub is what drives people to see cuties for themselves hopefully they will recognize it is a lot more complex and nuanced  amy diop fathia youssouf abdilahi lives with single mother mariam maïmouna gueye and helps watch her brother ismael demba diaw when mariam works amy sees angelica medina el aidi dancing and ironing her hair in the laundry room they become friends while amy also watches a quartet of girls at her school the cuties practicing for a dance competition  the girls in cuties are 11 there is a sweetness and innocence to their friendship but their activities border mature territory its sweet when amy and angelica jump on the bed and gorge on gummy bears amy helps the cuties record their routines and practices their moves herself in private they also chase older boys in the park and find a used condom which they dont exactly know how to deal with that foreshadows amys journey with the cuties writerdirector maïmouna doucouré portrays amys point of view in the movie she often overhears adults when they are trying to shelter her from their discussions amys father is getting married again and amy avoids both the relationship with her father and the cultural traditions associated with it  the cuties are an escape for amy theyre a conflict too as she has to balance her familial responsibilities with this activity and her new friends amy has a lot of freedom when shes unsupervised but there are harsh reminders that her parents still control her it will still be a few years before shes truly independent but there are moments of agency she can claim at 11  sexuality enters the picture when amy starts becoming more provocative than the cuties choreography the point is that theyre too young to go that far amy gets too provocative in the way a naive child would be confused she does not know the full ramifications of what shes exploring its tasteful and its a poignant point about the line between fun empowering dancing and going too far too young the suggestive image that caused all the fuss with cuties comes from the final performance of the movie at that point there is something uncomfortable about watching 11yearold girls copying the sorts of movies that cardi b and megan thee stallion might perform that too is the point  the cuties just think thats how theyre supposed to dance theyre emulating what they see but they dont think of it as sexual to just show that image without the buildup let alone the aftermath of amys realization robs it of its poignancy  the world is a confusing place for adults let alone children children will see whats going on in the world and theyll process it their own way adults can help with supervision but theres still only so much you can control cuties is about that journey of selfdiscovery every child and in this case especially women go through it is ultimately innocent but amy may experiment with corruption before she decides who shes going to be  i live in the heart of film and television and go wherever the story is to talk to the people who perform and create them if you see a typo thats my cats trying to help me write
Sep 11 2020,positive, on wednesday netflix releases cuties mignonnes the remarkable first feature from the french filmmaker maïmouna doucouré unfortunately the platforms misleading advertising has given rise to a scurrilous campaign against the film itself the promotional image showing young girls in bikinilike clothing dancing in provocative ways matched with an inaccurate description has been taken to suggest that the film celebrates childrens sexualized behavior in fact the subject of the film is exactly the opposite it dramatizes the difficulties of growing up female in a sexualized and commercialized media culture i doubt that the scandalmongers who include some wellknown figures of the far right have actually seen cuties but some elements of the film that werent presented in the advertising would surely prove irritating to them its the story of a girls outrage at and defiance of a patriarchal order the girl is amy diop fathia youssouf an elevenyearold of senegalese descent who lives in france with her observant muslim family at the films beginning she moves with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and her two younger brothers into a new apartment in a parisian housing project the apartment has a secret a room kept locked that amy is ordered to avoid amy short for aminata and pronounced with a short a like the french word ami is a dutiful child kept in line lovingly but sternly by mariam and by auntie her greataunt mbissine thérèse diop whos steeped in traditions that she passes along to her niece amy whos quiet and shy is also socially isolatedshe has no cell phone knows no one at school and isnt inclined to express herself or introduce herself as for her father hes away visiting the familys homeland much is being made of the festive plans for his returnbut amy learns accidentally that the point of his trip is to take a second wife and that hell soon be returning to paris with her the sealed room in the familys apartment will be the new wifes bridal chamber amy takes this news as a betrayal of her motherespecially after she discovers that mariam who is made miserable by the news is being coerced by auntie and by the entire social structure of their community into celebrating her husbands polygamy and welcoming the new bride into her home at an allfemale prayer meeting that amy and mariam attend in the buildings common room the preacher a woman decrees we must remain modest we must obey our husbands auntie tells amy do everything you can to please your mother now that order of modesty strikes amy as part of a system that subjugates women and pleasing her mother means deferring to that system instantly amy enters a state of revolt which is all the more emotionally wrenching for her lack of a vocabulary to discuss her feelings and her lack of friends to discuss them with she associates modesty with misogyny and obedience with oppression and so she acts out overthrowing both in a series of increasingly reckless actions soon after moving in amy sees a neighbor and classmate angelica médina el aidiazouni doing a hiphop dance while doing laundry in the buildings basement soon thereafter amy sees angelica similarly dancing with three other girls near an abandoned train yard at first they insult her and throw rocks at her when she approaches them at school they tell her that theyre preparing for a dance competition the groups name is the cuties les mignonnes amy knows that the girls are troubleshe sees them defying teachers and getting disciplined in the schoolyard and running wild in a supermarketbut she resolves to join them she soon finds that their dancing is inseparable from their sexual curiosity and brazen provocations which are matched by their ignorance about sex angelica in particular is a gleeful troublemaker at times seeming nearly sociopathic as when she steals her older brothers work shirt slams another girls computer to the floor and assaults another member of the group as a sort of virtual hazing at school the cuties push amy into the boys bathroom to videorecord a boys genitals her membership in the group involves her selfaware misconduct transgressions that she undertakes quickly and coldly stealing a cell phone from a cousin stealing money from her mother fighting with another girl making herself an object of socialmedia scandal even several acts of potentially grave violence for amy belonging to the cuties means more than a new activity or a new set of friendsit means forging for herself a new selfchosen identity which she clings to desperately at great risk and great cost before becoming a filmmaker doucouré was in the sciences she has a degree in biology and theres something admirably analytical about her cinematic methods though cuties is a sharply dramatic film that sticks closely to amy throughout and observes her actions in detail doucouré brings background ideas to the foreground inviting sociological and abstract considerations alongside the sharp delineation of character she shows amy undergoing the many tribulations of maturingand in each of these anecdotally depicted events extracts from them an element of cultural context for instance when amy gets her period auntie says that at amys age she was engaged and was married a few years latera fortune that she wishes on amy too the subject of cuties isnt twerking its children especially poor and nonwhite children who are deprived of the resourcesthe education the emotional support the open family discussionto put sexualized media and pop culture into perspective left on their ownangelica for instance is virtually unsupervised by parents who are working very hard to keep their restaurant afloattheyre unable to find or even to seek the line between liberation and exploitation between independence and imitation cuties is about the absence of knowledge and absence of reasonable discourse about sex and sexuality power and desire that help young people to avow and confront these drives constructivelyor at least not too destructively lacking those things amy latches on to a mode of revolt that is itself a trope of a misogynistic order cuties is a film of the center and its aesthetically of the centerit depicts the unconsidered without advancing to the realm of the subjective and it doesnt allow its young protagonists much discourse outer or inner its not a movie of introspection and selfconsideration its more a story of the rule than of the exception of whats unduly extraordinary about the effort to live an ordinary life as such its a story of french society at largeits exclusions and the exertions demanded to overcome them though many of amys actions are dubious her spirit of revolt is nonetheless sublime and heroic cuties dramatizes what people of color and immigrants endure as a result of isolation and ghettoization of not being represented culturally and politicallyand of not being represented in french national mythology its underlying subject is the connection of personal identity to public identityand the urgency of transforming the very notion of french identity of changing the idea of whos considered the representative face of france that idea is brought to the fore in an extraordinary brief symbolic ending its enough to give a rightwinger a conniption by signing up you agree to our user agreement and privacy policy  cookie

Sep 11 2020,positive,doucouré who moves the camera without judging intelligently avoids demonization and easy solutions to arrive at understanding full review in spanish
Sep 10 2020,positive,cuties is the kind of movie that is actually a very impressive piece of filmmaking and storytelling but its subject matter and depictions make it impossible to recommend
Sep 10 2020,positive, the hysteria surrounding maïmouna doucourés cuties mignonnes is like many such controversies in the era of qanon conspiracy theories much ado about nothing to be fair netflixs tonedeaf marketing campaign is mostly to blame for early reports that the film featured the inappropriate sexualization of preteen girls but that marketing campaign was not only deeply inappropriate it was also completely incongruous to the film it was attempting to promote in fact its quite the opposite  cuties is a sobering often deeply moving portrayal of the lengths to which young girls will go to find acceptance in a hypersexualized world that places primary importance on the desirability of womens bodies netflixs embarrassing marketing campaign seemed more as if they were promoting the latest season of dance moms complete with scantily clad young girls looking as though theyre having the time of their lives  a bit like the climax of little miss sunshine played completely straight yet the tone of cuties couldnt be further from the sparkly brightlycolored promotional materials that caused such stir in the darkest corners of the conservative internet just a few weeks ago the damage has been done of course doucouré was forced off twitter after receiving an onslaught of death threats and there were calls to ban the film altogether its unlikely those who attacked it sightunseen will ever give it the chance it so richly deserves but its their loss because cuties is an altogether remarkable film it centers on amy fathia youssouf abdillahi an 11yearold girl of senegalese descent living in france with her mother and younger brother who desperately wants to fit in with a school clique known as the cuties aloof popular and aspiring hip hop dancers the cuties welcome amy into their circle and she quickly becomes immersed in their world as they train for an upcoming dance competition but the further she descends into their hypersexualized world the further she drifts from her family and her culture as they deeply confuse amys attempts to grow up in a world that wants her to become an adult far too quickly cuties is something of a comingofage nightmare grappling not only with societys sexualization of young girls but also the general treatment of women as little more than sex objects amys unseen father is in the process of bringing in a second wife from senegal leaving her mother depressed and adrift amy also suffers much harsher consequences for her behavior than her fellow cuties reinforcing longheld stereotypes of black girls as being more adult and sexually aggressive its within this ideological cloud that cuties navigates some tricky emotional waters and its often difficult to watch but there is something incredibly cathartic about the way that it allows amy to reclaim agency over her own life and grow up on her own terms apart from cultural and social expectations doucourés direction has a haunting often otherworldly quality its occasional hints of magical realism recalls mati diops intoxicating work in atlantics there are few more striking examples of the intellectual dishonesty and misplaced outrage of qanons mindless conspiracymongering than cuties a broken conservative ideology that eschews nuance and takes very real problems like pedophilia and human trafficking and turns them into cartoon villainy in an online culture war for which there can be no victor but much like hillary clintons pizza parlor sex ring the pedophilic themes of cuties simply do not exist its a disturbing and complex critique of the very thing its accused of celebrating anchored by a strong central performance and a deep sense of empathy for victims that the online discourse surrounding it noticeably lacks its an elegy for lost innocence but ultimately a hopeful one as it seeks to reclaim childhood from a society that is all too content to dismantle it
Sep 10 2020,neutral, the french film which i saw this past january at sundance will be available to stream on netflix next month and follows an 11yearold senegalese muslim girl who joins a provocative dance group of twerkers i remember as i was walking to the eccles at sundance bumping into cuties producer sylvain de zangroniz and being asked what i thought of the movie  i tried to change the conversation to another topic but he didnt relent i finally plainly stated to him that it just wasnt my cup of tea  i didnt care for cuties one bit in fact i thought it was a repulsive film that sexualized an elevenyearold girls innocence for the sake of female empowerment we see outrageous musical montages involving closeup crotch shots and sweaty preteens feeling themselves while soaking up the music onstage its a clearcut attempt at provocation from doucoure but it fails miserably it doesnt help that the film a clicheridden comingofagetale is dull beyond belief  theres nothing interesting about its wehavetowinthedancecontest plottings  maïmouna doucouré the films director claims the movie is in fact a critique of the sexualization of children specifically the internets role in it thats not what i saw its all part of the damage control being created to justify streaming this film to a massively large netflix audience
Sep 10 2020,positive, theres a saying in criticism that depiction does not equal endorsement art should be able to address taboos without necessarily advocating for them but some surfacelevel readings miss what the work digs into because its not obvious at first glance in the wake of conservative outrage over an early poster of debut writerdirector maïmouna doucourés cuties this is a sentiment that bears repeating the film actively critiques the very thing pearlclutchers were mad aboutthe sexualization of childrenbut doucouré received death threats netflix the movies distributor issued an apology  controversy aside cuties is a difficult and challenging film pushing the idea of depiction does not equal endorsement to its limit it will not surprise me to read responses still accusing the movie of what it condemns however doucouré uses these uncomfortable images to provoke a serious conversation about the sexualization of girlsespecially regarding girls of color the policing of a girls sexuality double standards the effect of social media on kids and how children learn these behaviors to do this the director shows what it looks like for young girls to emulate what they see in music videos and grownup dance routines a few times in the film we see the confused or even disgusted faces of adults watching the younger generation gyrate and twerk biting their lips or their nail in a suggestive way its likely that these girls dont fully understand what those gestures mean but they see it in pop culture and they imitate it like several other generations of girls before them doucouré also explores some of the emotional tangles that come with wanting to fit in and to be taken seriously as well as the repercussions that come with acting youthfully impulsive many of these experiences were rooted in the directors own childhood or in the stories of girls she interviewed when working on the cuties script  cuties is a comingofage story of a girl caught between cultures and age 11yearold amy fathia youssouf abdillahi the eldest daughter of a senegalese family living in paris must help her mother miriam maïmouna gueye around the apartment with mundane tasks like watching her younger siblings going out for supplies and cleaning messes then miriam learns that her husband has taken a new wife and amy is reluctantly swept up in the preparation for their impending nuptials although her family is devoutly muslim amy begins to admire a dance group at school who call themselves cutiesangelica medina el aidi coumba esther gohourou jess ilanah camigoursolas and yasmine myriam hammaand tries to join their ranks she starts dressing more like them and doing what they dare her to do finally she figures out a way to get the cool girls to accept her by learning provocative moves that will help them win a dance competition against a rival group of older girls amy gets caught up in the whirlwind of her emotions and runs afoul of her mothers expectations  under doucourés direction the film walks a fine line between its controversial imagery and taking a step back to reveal the emotional impulses that drive amy and her friends to seek attention and affirmation there are echos of films like eves bayou girlhood and the fits but given amys age and the directness with which cuties addresses the issue of sexualizing young girls the film feels uniquely its own with the help of cinematographer yann maritaud doucouré adds little surrealistic elements and uses color to make her images pop off the screen for instance theres a recurring motif of amy transfixed by the dress shes supposed to wear for her fathers wedding and different things happen to it that correspond to what shes going through its likely not a mistake that the turquoise color of the dress echoes some of the colors around the apartment tying together the threads of culture and home into one for every dance scene that may make you want to avert your eyes there are other uncomplicated moments of childhood playtime like amy and angelica talking with their mouths full of gummy bears or four of the girls running with shopping bags throwing confetti like theyre leading a parade for themselves as if following the beat of niko nokis music for the film cuties moves at a quick riveting pace the two parts of amys world are seamlessly connected together by editors stéphane mazalaigue and mathilde van de moortel  the movie is so much more nuanced and bold than the first wave of outrage charged with cuties doucouré announces herself as a director with a keen visual style whos unafraid to explore these cultural and social tensions after all these are issues facing many young girls growing up today in various corners of the world youd just never know it because their comingofage horror stories arent always told in film  perhaps the most important message of cuties is that no matter what amy says or does shes still just an 11yearold girl people are quick to judge her for trying to act like an adult but really all she wants is to feel cool and fit in she wants to be liked and what person who survived middle school couldnt identify with that she thought the way to do that was to emulate others instead she becomes a cautionary tale in the process  monica castillo is a critic journalist programmer and curator based in new york city she is the senior film

Sep 9 2020,positive, the reputation of the netflix original film cuties precedes itself unfortunately director maimouna doucoures movie earned accolades at the sundance film festival for its critical observations about societys oversexualization of youth  and then netflix hyped the movie with a provocative poster featuring a decontextualized shot of its 11yearoldgirl characters in provocative poses in direct opposition to the films themes you might note the marketing bungle resulted in internet mobs calling to ban the movie before the vast majority of people had even seen it because why would anyone want to make an informed decision before voicing their outrage and now that everyone can finally watch it will its preemptive critics actually do so and share a more enlightened response  the gist amy fathia youssouf is 11 years old hiding under the bed as her mother sits on it sobbing in between phone calls mariam maimouna gueye is telling people the joyous news that her husband amys father is taking a second wife they and amys two younger brothers are new to a paris housing project and the apartment has a stillempty room to accommodate her dad and his new bride when they arrive from senegal mariam takes amy to their muslim prayer group where an elder woman preaches the evils of scantily clad women and how all women are obligated to obey their husbands mariams elderly auntie sternly upholds such traditions as their solemn duty amy doesnt seem impressed with the sermon on her way back to the apartment she sees angelica medina el aidi in the laundry room dancing in tight pants and pressing her hair straight on the ironing board she sees angelica in school too with three other girls in booty shorts navelbearing shirts and heels taking selfies and obnoxiously enjoying the type of freedom thats shockingly foreign to amy after school the girls practice their provocative hiphop dance moves hoping to audition for a competition they dub their squad the cuties amy soon squeezes into her younger brothers shirt and integrates herself into the clique she proves her mettle by studying bootyshaking videos  with earbuds hiding under her hijab during prayer meetings  and participating in the type of overbearing delinquent behavior they find endearing meanwhile the dress shell wear to her fathers wedding hangs in the closet like a bad omen his arrival looms as does the dance audition and amys behavior grows increasingly extreme what kind of person will she become what movies will it remind you of girlhood explores similar comingofage themes by telling the story of a black girl growing up in paris catherine hardwickes thirteen may be an even closer comparison when you consider its discomfiting level of toomuchtoosoonness memorable dialogue an islamic clergyman tells miriam god has never imposed on women more than they could bear if your burden is too heavy you have the right to leave this marriage our take doucoure emphasizes the social claustrophobia of amys existence  her apartments narrow hallways hem her into the demeaning subjugation of her religious upbringing one that her mother may not wish upon her compare that to the wideopen airy shots of the cuties strutting through school or practicing their dance routines a space so liberating they veer toward an altogether different kind of tragedy suffice to say cuties is a challenging film more so for its moral centrism than its depiction of twerking 11yearolds  11yearolds who clearly havent the foggiest idea as to the physical mechanics of sex inspired by her own upbringing doucoure doesnt aim to demonize secularism or religious ideology but rather to ponder how a modern womantobe like amy will define herself among such extremes if the filmmaker takes aim at anything its the male gaze the film forces the perspective on us until we squirm not in disbelief but in despair doucoure carefully nurtures character and setting to create a tangibly realistic tone nothing amy does no matter how extreme seems out of step with the realities of social media or peer pressure notably amys father is never seen his presence more fearsome as an invisible force for oppression wisely doucoure never really passes judgment on any of these characters allowing our own emotions to emerge unmanipulated although she does end with one remarkable and encouraging final shot suggesting theres hope for young women who make one mistake or another theyre fragile and susceptible sure but theyre also strong and enduring
Sep 9 2020,positive, thankfully were getting a slower week this week after the past few weeks of absolute insanity with so many new releases this week we also get a nice string of movies about women that are mostly made by women directors so hopefully these wont get lost in the shuffle of theaters reopening to be perfectly honest i went into unjoo moons i am woman quiver distribution  this weeks featured flick  thinking it was a doc about 70s pop sensation helen reddy imagine my surprise to discover that it actually was a narrative film with tilda cobhamhervey playing the australian singer who moved to new york in 1966 after winning a contest expecting a record deal but only winding up with disappointment  once there shed meet journalist lilian roxon danielle macdonald being able to use her real australian accent for once and jeff weld evan peters the man who would become her manager and then husband once the couple move to la with helens daughter traci from her previous marriage things began to pick up at the same time as reddy starts dealing with issues in her marriage and friendship with roxon there were many takeaways from watching moons film but one of the bigger ones is how amazing cobhamhervey is at portraying a woman that few of us may have actually seen perform even on television im not sure if cobhamhervey did any of her own singing or is lipsyncing the whole time but it doesnt matter because she instills so much joy into the performances especially the two times she sings the highlyinspirational title song live although there isnt a ton of major drama in reddys life most that does exist revolves around her relationship with wald who is depicted by peters as an outofcontrol cokesniffing monster those in hollywood may have dealt with wald as a movie producer or during his stint as sylvester stallones manager and only they will know how exaggerated this performance is far more interesting is helens friendship with macdonalds roxon which would inspire her to perform the song you and me against the world  seriously if you want a good cry throw that song on after watching i am woman moon does a great job with the material whether its recreating new york in the 60s  often using music to set the tone of the period  or by framing reddys story with phyllis schlafflys fight against the era as depicted in fxs miniseries mrs america  still it never loses track of reddys journey and her role as a mother to traci and slightly less to walds son jordan the movie ends with a wonderful and tearful epilogue and i will not lie that i was tearing up more than once while watching this movie i am woman may be relatively uncomplicated but its still a compelling relaying of reddys amazing story bolstered by an incredible knockemdead performance by tilda cobhamhervey its also one of the most femaleempowering film ive seen since the ruth bader ginsburg movie on the basis of sex starring felicity jones this weeks primary theatrical release is natalie krinskys the broken hearts gallery stage 6sony starring geraldine viswanathan as lucy a young woman who works at a gallery who is still obsessed with her excoworkerboyfriend max on the night of her  disastrous breakup lucy meetscute nick dacre montgomery from stranger things who later inspires her to rid of her hoarding issues by creating the broken hearts gallery this is a place where people who have broken up can bring the remnants of said relationship by donating the mementos theyve maintained from their partners as sentimental value im a big fan of viswanathan from her appearance in blockers and tbs miracle workers series as shes clearly very talented as a comic actress but i couldnt help but go into this with more than a little cynicism because it does follow a very wellworn romcom formula that can be traced right back to when harry met sally yup another one  much of this movie comes across like a bigger budget version of a movie that might play tribeca film festival and i wish i could say that was a compliment because ive seen a lot of good movies at tribeca but also just as many bad ones the problem is that the broken hearts gallery isnt very original and its roots are especially obvious when it starts interspersing the recentlyheartbroken giving testimonials its also a little pretentious because rather than the real new york city that would be recognizable to anyone who lives there its more of a millennial woke fantasy where everyone is a 20something lgbtq of color  even so the main trio of lucy nick and nicks business partner marcos arturo castro from broad city do keep things fun even when things are getting predictable to be honest ill be perfectly happy to see viswanathan become the next meg ryan because part of the reason why i warmed up to the movie is because i thought she was quite great in it i hate to say it but shell definitely need a simple name to remember to make that happen id like to suggest gvis as in gvis shes awesome theres no question shes the best part of the movie but it also thrives from some of the other women cast around her including molly gordon phillipa soo and surprise surprise bernadette peters at times i was worried lucys friends would get particularly annoying but youll warm up to them as well krinskys movie is cute and while it certainly gets a little overly sentimental at times there are also moments that are quite heartfelt so basically its a tolerable addition to the romcom genre the fact that the characters are so likeable kept me from outright hating the movie especially once it gets to its corny and somewhat predictable ending another thing i like about broken hearts gallery is that at least its making an effort to have some sort of theatrical presence including drivein theaters next up is jon stevensons rentapal ifc midnight a rather strange and very dark horrorcomedy it stars brian landis folkins as david a lonely 40yearold living with his elderly mother suffering from dementia who has been using the services of a dating service called video rendezvous this is the 80s after all so it involves getting vhs testimonials from various women one day david finds a tape labelled rent a pal and he decides to check it out it turns out to be a video of a guy named andy wil wheaton aka wesley crusher from star trek the next generation who david begins having conversations with but once david gets his chance to have a real relationship with a nice woman named lisa amy rutledge hes been dragged too far down the rabbit hole with andys evil urgings this was recommended to me by my own personal rentapal erick weber of awards ace who saw it weeks ago i totally could understand why he would have liked it because its pretty good in terms of coming up with an original idea using elements that at least us older guys can relate to especially the living with your mom part which i had to do a few years ago  i wasnt sure but i generally thought i knew where it was going because davids trajectory always seemed to be heading towards my friend dahmer or maniac territory what i liked about folkins performance is that you generally feel for him right up until he gets to that point i also really liked his innocent relationship with lisa and was hoping things that wouldnt get as dark as where they eventually end up i also have to draw attention to wheatons performance because as one might expect if you only know him from the star trek show he did as a kid this is a very different role for him similar to seann michael scott in last years bloodline either way stevenson is a decent writer and director who really pushes the boundaries with where andy takes his new friend and its especially great for its synthheavy soundtrack that reminds me of some of john carpenters best scores as we watch davids inevitable descent into madness youll frequently wonder where its going but for me it just got too dark so i only really could enjoy it up to a point a little cheerier is unpregnant hbo max the new film from rachel lee goldberg who directed the recent valley girl remake although this time shes adapting a book written by jenni hendricks it stars haley lu richardson from split and support the girls as 17yearold veronica who discovers that her dopey boyfriend kevin has gotten her pregnant since women under 18 cant get an abortion in missouri without a parents consent she goes on a road trip with her estranged childhood friend bailey barbie ferreira to new mexico to get the job done its more than  little weird seeing this movie come out in the same year as a much more serious version of the same movie in elyza hittmans never rarely sometime always that aside goldberg and her cast do their best to make this something more in the vein of last years book smart although thats also a fairly high watermark for any movie because this is a road trip comedy it tends to follow a fairly similar path as other movies where they meet a lot of strange characters along the way as they try to get a ride after being busted cause bailey stole her mothers boyfriends car for the trip for instance they meet a friendly couple who tend to be prolifers who want to change veronicas mind and the best side character is giancarlo esposito as a conspiracy theorist named bob  i guess my biggest problem with the movie is that it just isnt that funny and feels fairly standard but at least it has a decent ending to make up for the predictability of the rest of the movie  now streaming on netflix is maimouna doucourés french comingofage film mignonnes aka cuties a film that premiered at sundance and then stirred up quite a bit of controversy last month due to its marketing campaign but is actually not the pervy male gaze movie which it may have been sold as its about an 11yearold sengalese girl named amy diop fathia youssouf who wants to join the schools cool girl dance group known as the cuties even though it goes against her familys muslim beliefs  amy learns to dance so she can be part of the dance team and take part in a dance competition but you know that this decision will led to troubles cuties got a lot of backlash from for the trailer and netflixs decision to release doucourés movie which is about a young girl discovering her sexuality although it isnt really something lurid or gross but actually a very strong comingofage film i havent seen the trailer but i can only imagine what scene it focused on that got people so riled up since there are dance scenes that felt a little creepy to me other than that aspect of the film cuties is as innocent as a judy blume book i mean how else do you expect kids to learn about real life than movies like this unfortunately the movie is tvma so young teens wont be able to watch it the big problem with the cuties is that theyre actually kind of bratty and bullies almost like a younger mean girls girl gang so its very hard to like any of them theyre also trying to act way older than they really are and you can only imagine what dark places that might led as you worry about amy getting dragged down with them just because she wants to have friends and feel popular despite my issues with cuties maimouna doucouré is a fantastic filmmaker and this is a pretty amazing debut especially notable for how shes able to work with the young cast but also make a movie that looks amazing that said cuties is a decent comingofage film although i feel like ive seen better versions of this movie in films like mustang and the fits  also from france comes justine triets sybil music box films starring virgine efira who appeared in triets earlier film in bed with victoria as the title character a jaded psychotherapist who decides to return to her passion of writing getting her inspiration from an actress patient named margot adèle exarchopoulos who she becomes obsessed with i dont have a lot to say about this movie other than it wasnt really for me as far as french films go a movie really has to stand out from the usual talkie drama filled with exposition and though i thought the performances by the two women were great i didnt really care for the script or the pacing on this one after playing at last years cannes toronto and the new york film festival sybil will be available via virtual cinema through film at lincoln center and the laemmle in la as well as other cities you can watch the trailer and find out how to watch it through your local arthouse at the official site  liz garbus and lisa cortés doc allin the fight for democracy amazon follows stacey abrams through her run for atlanta governor in 2018 but it also deals with the laws that had been put in place to try to keep black voters from taking part in their right as americans to be able to vote im not sure whats going on with me right now but i generally just dont have much interest in political docs right now maybe because theres so much politics on tv and in the news i also have very little interest in abrams or even having the racist history of the american south drilled into my head by another movie i was born in 1965 my family didnt even live in this country until 1960 and ive spent my life trying to treat everyone equally so watching a movie like this and being preached to about how awful africanamericans have been treated in parts of the south for hundreds of years im just not really sure what im supposed to do about it here in new york i guess my biggest problem with allin which is a perfectly fine and wellmade doc  as would be expected from garbus  is that it lacks focus and it seems to be all over the place in terms of what its trying to say and im not even sure what it is trying to say nor did i have the patience to find out i thought slay the dragon handled the issues with gerrymandering far better and i think i would have preferred a movie that only focused on abrams and her life and political career than trying to make a bigger statement allin will open at a few driveins tonight and then will be on amazon prime on september 18 i was similarly mixed on jeff orlwoskys doc the social dilemma which debuted on netflix this week this one looks at the addiction people have for social media apps like facebook and twitter and how the information of what people watch and click on is collected into a database thats sold to the highest bidder basically its your worst fears about social media come to life but my issue with this one is that the filmmaker decided to hire actors to dramatize parts of the movie showing one family dealing with social media and phone addiction which seemed like an odd but probably necessary decision other than the fact that the topic is so nerdy and so over my head that maybe it was necessary to illustrate whats being explained by programmers again not a terrible doc just not something i had very little interest in even if it is an important subject and im probably spending too much on social media and essentially more of the problem than the solution i saw s leo chiang and yang suns doc our time machine at tribeca last year and i quite liked it it follows influential chinese artist ma liang maleonn who collaborates with his peking opera director father ma ke who is suffering from alzheimers on an elaborate and ambitious project called papas time machine using lifesized mechanical puppets i dont have a ton to say about the movie but its a nice look into the chinese culture and traditions and how the country and art itself has changed between two generations one doc i missed last week but will be available digitally this week is michael paszts nail in the coffin the fall and rise of vampiro about semiretired professional wrestler ian hodgkinson aka vampiro who is a lucha libre legend  theres a lot of other stuff on netflix this week including the babysitter killer queen the sequel to the samara weavingstarring horrorthriller again cowritten and directed by mcg charlies angels full throttle this one stars bella thorne leslie bibb and ken marino as it follows judah lewis cole after surviving the satanic blood cult from the first movie i dont know nearly as much about the british comedy series the duchess other than it stars comedian katherine ryan as a single mother juggling a bunch of things julie and the phantoms is netflixs latest attempt to be the disney channel with a movie about a young girl named julie madison reyes who decides to start a band with a group of ghosts hence the title its even from kenny laguna who is best known for the disney channels biggest hits high school musical and the descendants  other stuff to look out for this week include kevin del principes thriller up on the glass gravitas ventures which is now available on demand digital and

Sep 9 2020,positive, proving there is such a thing as bad press netflixs cuties might never recover from its disastrous marketing despite it being a touching personal comingofage drama the furore whipped up around maïmouna doucourés sundance darling cuties was something to behold where to begin in unpacking it is anyones guess on the one hand you have a deeply personal and obviously considered comingofage drama from a frenchsenegalese director about an 11yearold muslim girl who joins a dance group in large part as rebellion against the conservatism of her religion and the ostracization she experiences as an immigrant on the other hand you have netflix who chose to market that story with a promotional image of preteen girls in skimpy outfits and suggestive poses it was such a phenomenally stupid and shortsighted decision that you cant help but feel it deserved the immediate frenzied backlash which insisted that netflix was actively sexualizing young girls and that anyone who supported the film was a paedophile the problem with that response is that the film itself is pretty good and wellworth seeing most of the time its pointless trying to argue with anyone on the internet much less trolls and conspiracy theorists and the other standard types who immediately gravitated towards the controversy as though it was an arrow in the allseeing eye of heathen hollywood but cuties isnt a hollywood film its an observant and wellobserved foreignlanguage curio from a minority filmmaker about a lived minority experience none of this is to say that cuties is inured from criticism just that it requires a more nuanced perspective since it is itself built on nuance and not the glossy exploitation that netflix perplexingly chose to sell it as its important to understand that the films protagonist amy fathia youssouf abdillahi a senegalese immigrant living in paris with her mother and two younger siblings is in a constant state of suffocating emotional constraint she is hemmed in not just by her dingy apartment the master bedroom of which is in the process of being done up for amys fathers second wife but by the cultural expectations and traditions that lead amys mother to blame herself for her husbands infidelity amy then is a prisoner of her mind her culture her status and all prisoners are inclined to look for the shortest path to freedom for amy that path does indeed wind through an energetic but inappropriately dressed and styled preteen troupe who shes introduced to by her upstairs neighbour angelica médina el aidiazouni the cuties as they call themselves look their age but try not to act it an obvious and deliberate artistic choice to emphasize that their behaviour is largely petty rebellion the film never wants you to forget that these are children it doesnt ask you to admire or even necessarily root for them but to understand theyre looking for somewhere to belong and something to belong to after spending their short lives being told theyre lesser this is not some kind of sophisticated subtextual reading  its made explicit again and again in how the girls are utterly ignorant of the adult lifestyle theyre pretending to emulate the cuties are an idea to amy they represent the possibility of being unshackled from traditionalism and conservatism to social media they of course represent something illicit and salacious ripe for exploitation  its a coincidence that cuties debuts on the same day as jeff orlowskis docudrama the social dilemma but not an altogether unhappy one since they peddle similar ideas about the inherently harmful consumption of personallytailored debauchery that the internet serves up to those young and naïve enough to swallow it of course for amy the internet is a gateway to a realm of experience she cant properly comprehend but intuits is vastly different from her own the great tragedy of cuties is in how profoundly she misinterprets the behaviours she perceives as freeing theres also a crushing irony here that makes this film so resistant to the simplistic notion that its endorsing one behaviour or condemning another the fact is that amys experience as a muslim and as an immigrant is no more or less patriarchal and exploitative than the world of dancing and twerking that she sees as a kind of escapist fantasy one cant be traded for the other but thered be little point in doing so anyway its a bleak conclusion with a stinging truth to it and it reinforces the notion that for amy growing up whether its too fast or right on schedule might not ever be enough jonathon is one of the cofounders of ready steady cut and has been an instrumental part of the team since its inception in 2017 jonathon has remained involved in all aspects of the sites operation mainly dedicated to its content output remaining one of its primary entertainment writers while also functioning as our dedicated commissioning editor publishing over 6500 articles
Sep 9 2020,positive, early on in cuties amy fathia youssouf an 11yearold senegalese immigrant living in paris hides under a bed and eavesdrops while her mother mariam maïmouna gueye makes a few difficult phone calls her husband has decided to marry a second wife she tells her friends yes isnt that wonderful news amy from her partially obscured vantage cant see her moms tears though she can hear the barely disguised anguish in her voice at the same time she has perhaps never seen mariam more clearly a woman whose longsuffering heart and tough exterior are finally on the verge of breaking so much of this sharp and cleareyed debut feature written and directed by the french filmmaker maïmouna doucouré is about the power the danger and the limitations of a childs gaze  everything it can discover absorb and misinterpret its also become an unfortunate case study in the adult capacity for misinterpretation but more on that in a bit in a tiny publichousing apartment thats about to get even smaller amy observes the heartbreaking toll of a patriarchal order that has long governed her muslim family but which now holds ever less sway and relevance in her life in another scene while walking home with her two younger brothers she catches a captivating glimpse of freedom four girls her age rehearsing a routine for an upcoming dance competition the girls who call themselves the cuties dont take too kindly to amy spying on them and begin chucking rocks at her that assault much like their suggestive dance moves is part of their toughgirl act and an act it very much turns out to be the cuties project a lot more confidence ferocity and realworld savvy than they actually possess and amy despite or perhaps because of her more conservative upbringing embraces their style their attitude and most of all their dance moves with an ardor that surprises them and even herself not long after she makes her way into the girls good graces and their dance crew amys the one giving them twerking tips and shooting their instagram content inspired by provocative online videos that all of them are a bit young to be watching let alone emulating the dangers that lie in wait on the internet are an important subject in cuties but the movie to its credit never becomes a reductive cautionary tale for one thing amys decisions feel spontaneous and surprising rather than programmed youssouf darts through the picture with a vigor unpredictability and emotional openness that reminded me of nothing so much as one of the dardenne brothers cautiondefying young protagonists for another no one in amys life  not even her absentee father and least of all her newfound friends  can be reduced to a cardboard antagonist or even a negative influence thats especially true of her closest pal angelica a sympathetic ringleader type played by the irrepressible médina el aidiazouni in a story thats all about looking and seeing doucourés own gaze reflects a principled ambivalence she regards the pushpull of amys existence  her rigid upbringing on one hand and her incipient liberation on the other  with equal parts affection and skepticism doucouré who won a directing prize at this years sundance film festival has a knack for finding the perfect image again and again in perhaps the movies funniest moment amy pulls her hijab over her head during a group prayer meeting and secretly watches a dance video underneath but while cuties is full of such inspired contrasts between the sacred and the secular its also attuned to the similarities amys elders notably a strict auntie mbissine thérèse diop tasked with her education are bent on molding her into an attractive marital prospect her dance routines arent that much more enlightened insofar as they too cater explicitly to mens desires clothing can be both beautiful and burdensome whether its the traditional blue dress that amy is expected to wear to her fathers wedding or the tight tank tops and other midriffbaring shirts she and her friends favor at school and on the stage thats about as good a segue as i can muster to an unpleasant subject that i wish could be passed over without mention but which nonetheless illustrates why cuties deserves a more thoughtful intelligent audience than its own distributor seems to expect weeks ago netflix released a promotional image that sexualized the storys young protagonists in a way that the movie itself scrupulously avoids doing selfstyled internet moralists immediately jumped on the film sight unseen of course and called for its removal essentially likening cuties to child pornography and spurring netflix to yank the image and apologize for its mistake societys rampant sexualization of preadolescent girls is one topic that doucouré subjects to tough critical scrutiny shes made an empathetic and analytical movie not an exploitative one both her film and the unfortunate contretemps surrounding it make at least two things perfectly clear a young girl can look at herself really look at herself and learn something truthful and powerful from the experience some putative grownups by contrast can never be bothered to do the hard work of looking at something let alone learning from it justin chang was a film critic for the los angeles times from 2016 to 2024 he is the author of the book filmcraft editing and serves as chair of the

Sep 9 2020,positive, its dispiriting and misleading american movie trailer aside the new french film cuties from firsttime feature director maïmouna doucouré provides a fascinating complex and disturbing portrait of tween girlhood the film showcases the genuine unease and identity confusion generated by a society that simultaneously sexualizes children and reacts in horror when those same children embrace their burgeoning sexuality a civilization that wants to have it both ways on such a fraught issue divests itself of the right to feel outrage yet the morality police never examine their own sins thanks to someone like doucouré however the untenable nature of such a position is made evident and thats only part of the story as cuties is also about female agency cultural adaptation and the role that patriarchy plays in all of the above though not always a perfectly assured cinematic discussion of its central themes this vibrant drama filled with majestic performances from its young stars succeeds enough as both entertainment and polemic to be well worth watching fathia youssouf plays 11yearold amy whose parents are from senegal though she and her mother now live in paris early on she discovers that her absent father is soon to return with a second younger wife a bit of news that she does not digest well nor does her mom especially since her older aunt has decided that the upcoming nuptials are an opportunity to train the girl in the ways of being a traditional senegalese woman its no wonder then that when she discovers that female classmates at her new school are practicing dance moves for an upcoming competition she gravitates to that activity as an escape twerking beats cooking any day it seems closest to her is angelica médina el aidiazouni a neighbor in her apartment complex whose wildness attracts the initially more restrained amy though the other girls are reluctant to let amy in her tenacious spirit and knack for choreography eventually wins them over though there will be many emotional ups and downs as well as dramatic reversals along the way the stakes are so small  its but a tiny regional contest coming up  yet they loom enormous in our protagonists blossoming gaze these kids so desperate to matter in this world that they seize hungrily on the readily available images on youtube and elsewhere where likes equal value for affirmation when you have no real power you take what you can though doucouré occasionally stumbles in the obviousness of her points she is always perfectly in charge of her actors and her cinematography presenting scene after scene of genuine emotional charge framed in striking composition and vivid color youssouf is a genuine revelation the yearning to be something more than what she thinks life has planned for her palpable in every glance and gesture perhaps once this particular misadventure is over with its lessons learned her amy will now be ready to take on the next step of becoming her own woman and breaking the chains imposed on her by both her cultures the obstacles are large but at least the film ends on a subtle note that they may be surmountable heres hoping christopher llewellyn reed is a film critic filmmaker and educator as well as film festival todays editor a member of both the online film critics society ofcs and the washington dc area film critics association wafca and a rotten tomatoesapproved film critic chris is in addition lead film critic at hammer to nail and the author of film editing theory and practice
Sep 8 2020,positive, you probably didnt hear much about cuties when maïmouna doucouré won best director in the world cinema dramatic competition at this past januarys sundance film festival i didnt and i was there despite recent diversity initiatives the festivals attention remains mostly focused on american indies in the main competition with foreign language films still exiled to sidebar categories too bad because its quite an accomplished debut inspired by the directors own experiences growing up poor in paris as the daughter of senegalese immigrants the film follows an 11yearold muslim girl who falls in with a fast crowd acting out and pushing back against her strict religious upbringing its a thoughtful exploration of adolescent pressures in a hypersexualized society but chances are if youve read anything about cuties lately its been for entirely different reasons the film  which starts streaming on netflix sept 9  takes its title from a troupe of tween dancers who confound their elders with queasy routines full of twerking hairflips and other suggestive stuff thats these days only socially acceptable during a super bowl halftime show their climactic performance is deliberately disconcerting and spoiler ends in tears like if the finale of little miss sunshine had been played for horror instead of laughs a couple of weeks ago netflix rather stupidly used a still from this scene  with the scantily clad girls striking sultry poses  as the basis of a promotional poster bringing down a rain of hellfire from all corners of the internet that resulted in death threats for the director and targeted harassment campaigns against defenders of the film the streaming service quickly apologized and modified their marketing to little avail once outrage goes viral like this you cant put the toothpaste back in the tube top the only motivation of those who would produce such a film as cuties is to sexualize children and to fuel the appetites of those who would feed on the sexualization of children says a statement from something called the parents television council a changeorg petition originally demanding that the movie be removed from the streaming service on which it had not yet premiered the text has since been amended garnered over 600000 signatures sight unseen cuties has become the bête noire of countless qanon types and likeminded keyboard crusaders in our current satanic panic 20 of lunatic conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking rings with its black female french senegalese director frequently referred to as another hollywood pedo its getting pretty crazy out there folks last month a lovely acquaintance id always assumed was sane started insisting on facebook that tom hanks became a greek citizen to escape prosecution for his role in pizzagate im reasonably sure that most of these folks who are so angry about a movie they havent even watched would never willingly sit through a subtitled film in the first place  especially one featuring so many cast members of color and thats an awful shame because despite some slight missteps well get to later cuties is a serious film that inspires conversations we really should be having right now about the world in which our young girls are growing up its refreshingly frank about class religion and burgeoning sexuality in ways mainstream american movies would never dare and who can blame them given all thats happened to this one over the past couple weeks it probably goes without saying that cuties opened in france last month to wide acclaim and zero controversy fathia youssouf abdillahi stars as young amy diop who recently moved to a parisian housing project with her mother and two baby brothers the master bedroom has been locked off because her father has taken a second wife in senegal who will soon be arriving for a lavish marriage ceremony banishing amys mom to one of the childrens rooms life is stifling in this tiny apartment doucouré shoots in widescreen cinemascope but cramps the characters into frameswithinframes always walled off by obstructed views through doorways and windows then one day downstairs in the laundry room amy discovers freedom well actually its just angelica medina el aidi a bespectacled dynamo dancing up a storm while ironing her hair its the first shot in the movie in which theres any room to breathe and angelica spins and flings her way around every inch of it most of the movie chronicles amys attempts to curry favor with angelica and her gang of socalled cuties  backsassing bad girls who strike freezeframe flash mobs in the schoolyard to drive their teachers crazy and shake their groove things around the projects all afternoon they talk dirty without really knowing what theyre talking about  one of the less worldly gals mistakes a condom for a balloon and blows it up  pretending to be precocious according to whatever theyve seen most recently on social media amy knows this is all raunchy and wrong yet it feels so invigorating and alive compared to the dutiful drudgery in which her mother and miserable aunt toil subserviently every choice already made for them by men we never meet when i was your age i was already engaged scolds amys oldworld auntie who in a sly bit of casting is played by mbissine thérèse diop star of ousmane sembènes seminal 1966 black girl our heroine swipes her older male cousins cell phone and before long shes taking duckface selfies in the moonlight intoxicated by the attention of strangers online its here that doucouré begins to tread on tricky ground with i think extraordinary sensitivity amy starts wearing one of her little brothers tshirts as a croptop and the movie quite delicately toggles between her newfound empowerment at finally being looked at by boys and the shame she feels after being objectified sexuality can be a scary complicated thing when youre young and its only gotten a thousand times messier thanks to the internet cuties could easily have become either a cautionary afterschool special or an irreverent antireligious screed but instead its a rare movie that understands the profound ambivalence of adolescence liberation brings its own discontents and power balances are always in flux sometimes it stumbles doucouré includes a strange magic realist tangent in which the traditional formal dress amys supposed to wear at her fathers wedding seems to be endowed with supernatural powers occasionally knocking on the closet door to interrupt conversations and its fabric appears to start menstruating when she does nope no idea the final shot is a great way to end a movie but im not sure its a great way to end this movie considering all thats come before yet for every such slip theres a wonderful scene like one in which amy  having recently been ridiculed by her friends for having a flat butt  hides under her hijab during a prayer service surreptitiously watching a tawdry twerking video on her phone afterward she studies the wellrounded rear ends of her mother and the other women at the mosque a knowing smile spreading wide across her face the film actually has a lot in common with last summers uproarious good boys a sort of superbad junior about three naive sixthgraders bluffing their way through assorted adult situations the rrated comedy was a modest hit without inspiring much in the way of condemnation probably in part because theyre boys and it feels like theres less at stake than there is in cuties doucouré is asking us to think long and hard about the kind of behavior our young girls are being taught to emulate and who theyre really performing for but these are tough conversations i worry a lot of people wont want to have right now especially when its so much easier to just judge a film by its poster
Sep 3 2020,positive, the direct treatment of childhood sexualityespecially girls sexualityon film is an ethical minefield the moving image and desire are so closely associated the relation between cinema and the voyeuristic male gaze so firmly entrenched and the assault of young girls such a persistent threat that even a hint of a sexualized preteen body is apt to provoke reaction despite whatever outrage was stirred or drummed up before its release though writerdirector maïmouna doucourés cuties navigates a path through a middleschool girls selfawakening that feels neither artificially safe nor exploitative amy fathia youssouf is the daughter of senegalese immigrants living in paris and her teenage angst kicks in hard when she overhears her mother mariam maïmouna gueye tearfully discussing with her aunt mbissine thérèse diop that the girls father will be returning from senegal with a second wife already fascinated by the stylish and insolent fourgirl dance troupe that dominates the social life of her school amy begins rebelling against her familys conservative islamic traditions by hiding crop tops and short skirts under her modest hoodies and jeans stealing a cousins cellphone to engage with her peers social mediaheavy lifestyle and practicing hiphop dance moves in the bathroom mirror amy also insistently integrates herself into the multiethnic dance troupe which calls itself the cuties she lurks around them in the schoolyard spies on the dance practices that they hold under a grimy highway overpass and continues to quietly elbow her way into the group even after jess ilanah camigrousolas pelts her with a stone the shy socially awkward amy is an odd match for the brash group of girls who appear to have modeled themselves after bratz dolls and they bully her over her initial attempts to merely stand in their proximity one of the cuties angelica medina el aidiazouni lives in the same apartment complex as amy and she secures for her neighbor a formal entrée to the clique as their videographer after angelica has a beef with yasmine myriam hamma amy demonstrates that shes learned the dance routine and secures a spot as yasmines replacement in advance of a tryout for a local competition its a slot that spells conflict with her mother and aunt who expect her to help with the conventional womens duties in preparation for her fathers wedding doucouré has a remarkable grasp of the irrationality and volatility of middleschool social dynamics scenes like the one in which angelica and amy bond over how many gummy bears they can stuff into their mouths or one in which the five girls collectively fumble and titter nervously through a video chat with the boy who angelica has a crush on capture the odd mental and emotional space preteens occupy between childhood and adolescence the films subject matter puts one on guard that it might oversell capitalist consumption and sexualization of the female body as liberation amys newfound love of tight eyecatching skirts and secondhand crop tops recalls the grotesque scene in sex and the city 2 in which women from the uae doff their burkas to reveal the latest couture clothing underneath one early scene in cuties even sees amy hiding within her burka during prayer at her mosque in order to watch hiphop videos featuring dancers wearing gstrings on her stolen phone the difference between cuties and the conservative fantasy of the liberated womanconsumer though is that the former is actually told from the perspective of an immature subaltern woman trying to figure out which pieces of which culture suit her its a critique both of the senegalese patriarchy that tells amy to be a docile and modest future wife and of the western patriarchal ideology that tells her that the primary avenue of a womans selfexpression is through her sexuality a rushed and undersold conclusion to this culture clash notwithstanding cuties is an admirable and empathetic portrait of girlhood in a world defined by postcolonialism digitized social practices and not least the imperative to twerk pat brown teaches film studies and american studies in germany his writing on film and media has appeared in various scholarly journals and critical anthologies
Sep 1 2020,positive, they say theres no such thing as bad publicity they lie consider the case of frenchsenegalese director maïmouna doucourés touching observant comingofage drama cuties about an 11yearold muslim girl who joins an allgirl dance group the film which won an award at sundance earlier this year and was picked up for distribution by netflix recently found itself at the center of controversy when a poster seemed to sexualize its very young characters featuring them in tight clothes and weirdly suggestive poses the ad was a new one apparently created by netflix who promptly removed the image  albeit after the damage was done the movie was condemned sight unseen by many online even as those whod actually viewed the film insisted that it was in no way exploitative since then perhaps unsurprisingly the anticuties cause has also been embraced by various trolls and conspiracy nuts ive heard from a couple of defenders of the film that theyve been targeted for harassment even so on the surface youd think that this controversy might prove to the pictures ultimate benefit turning it from a foreignlanguage obscurity the kind of movie that tends to get lost on netflix to a mustsee flash point and cuties certainly deserves to be seen but its also a delicate work that strikes a very careful balance in its portrait of the world and that balance is upset if a viewer is more worried about social propriety than the truth of lived experience our hero amy fathia youssouf abdillahi is a senegalese immigrant who resides with her mother and two younger siblings in a small parisian apartment where the main bedroom has now been declared offlimits  amys father we learn has taken on a second wife and the room is being prepared and decorated for them by amys poor overworked mother in one of the films most agonizing moments amy hides under a bed while she eavesdrops on her mother talking on the phone informing friends and family of her husbands new wife mom speaks bemusedly and casually about the matter with others but whimpers inconsolably in between calls the bed shaking as she beats herself taught that an unhappy or straying husband is the measure of a wifes failure she blames herself all we see during this scene are moms feet doucouré often frames amys home life in tight constrained spaces  blocked off by walls corridors and doors the imagery embodying the sense of emotional suffocation it is in this context  a devout constrained and impoverished world where women are told there are more of them than men in hell and that their duties are first and foremost to their spouses  that amy discovers her upstairs neighbor angelica médina el aidiazouni whom she first sees energetically dancing in their apartment buildings laundry room we dont see angelicas face at first and the reveal when she finally turns that this girl in tight leather jeans and brightred tank top is basically a child the same age as amy comes as a jolt angelica belongs to a quartet of popular girls at school who calling themselves the cuties strut through the corridors in ageinappropriate clothing try to act like grownups and practice their dance moves for an upcoming competition which will pit them against the sweetyswaggs a group of older though still noticeably young girls the cuties are terrific dancers but their act is ridiculous given their age and they dont actually know anything about the ways of adults  their childish banter reveals they have no idea how sex works and a scene where one of them finds a used condom blows it up and pretends its a breast implant results in chaotic cringeworthy hijinks like something out of a highconcept hollywood comedy such as good boys to the submerged infinitely curious amy however the cuties represent liberation and belonging that most of these girls appear to be like her the children of immigrants is unremarked upon but perhaps worth noting she embraces her newfound friends with the fervor of a fresh convert  commandeering her young brothers tshirt to use as a tank top and stealing her older cousins cell phone to shoot the cuties routines and post videos on social media where the cruder the dance moves the more likes one gets the internet and its salacious images fascinate amy at one point during a prayer session she takes the hijab covering her head and pulls it completely over herself then watches a halfnaked twerking music video in her newfound privacy right after the prayers she sits in the corner and observes the ample bottoms of the women around her as they go about their business as if shes just discovered something strange and secret about the world cuties is filled with honest moments like this its also filled with horror during a fight with her older male cousin amy suddenly starts to undress the cousin is instantly mortified and pushes her away but the tragedy isnt so much in the action as in the thought amy now believes this is how she can get out of a tough situation it would have been easy for doucouré to use a broad brush to paint the different extremes of amys experience stifling tradition bad dancing good but shes not exactly making footloose here cuties is not a blunt screed or a fingerwagging cautionary tale in either direction  which is one reason why anyone watching the film looking for clear messages about right and wrong is bound to be disappointed maybe even outraged doucouré appears to be a far too sensitive director for that kind of polemic instead she subtly juxtaposes amys two worlds to show us that they have certain things in common all that awkward gyrating and twerking itself exists in a universe as much dominated by male expectation as the strict milieu the girl is ostensibly fleeing  amy is simply trading in one form of subsumed patriarchy for another that doesnt mean however that the dancing isnt fun or freeing or that the cuties dont help amy gain a sense of herself nor does it mean that there is no love or warmth for her at home or in her senegalese community when a lovely blue traditional dress arrives for amy she looks at it admiringly until she realizes that she is supposed to wear it to her fathers wedding after that the dress looms in her closet both alluring and terrifying  a warning that the future contains both beauty and heartbreak and very few correct answers
Aug 25 2020,positive, rightwingers are accusing maïmouna doucourés cuties of sexualizing young girls thanks to a bad netflix gaffe but the film itself provides a nuanced examination of girlhood maïmouna doucourés cuties available on netflix from september 9 has been met with the ire of the religious right as well as a wider online public that believes that the film sexualizes children to be fair the poster netflix initially chose to promote the french film which won the world cinema directing award at sundance in 2019 was a grossly inappropriate choiceone that decontextualized a scene from the film in order to promote a movie about the complexities of growing up in both modest and modern cultures at once netflix has taken the image down but despite outcry is continuing with the release of the film  people across the political spectrum have expressed rightful concern about the streaming giants choice of a photo of twerking preteen girls in revealing outfits as a way to garner interest in the film and netflix has accepted responsibility for the misstep but calls for the films release to be canceled altogether are deeply misguided and reactionary cuties is precisely about the tooeasy ways we choose to condemn and isolate children as they take risks and make mistakes growing up no matter their cultural backgrounds and the film has a major lesson for religious conservatives and moral panickers about what fear condemnation and emotional neglect can do to the young people who turn to us for guidance in the midst of turbulent personal awakenings in cuties aminata or amy is a 14yearold frenchsenegalese girl of muslim faith her family has just moved to paris but her father still in senegal has decided to take on a new wife amy sees her mother visibly shaken by the development and secretly witnesses her hit herself in response to her pain about the marriage and her obligation to pretend she welcomes it as the family prepares for the wedding amy begins to cross over from a period of childhood innocence within her muslim community to the demands of becoming a woman both in the religious context in which teens marry as well as in modern paris where teens post flirtatiously on social media and wear crop tops and shortshorts  at her new school amy sees a group of audacious girls stage a flash mob during which all the kids in the schoolyard suddenly freeze into various poses the principal is visibly shaken by the benign action as well as the girls coquettish outfits including formfitting dresses and flashy purses as she drags them to class they scream at her what about freedom of expression indeed  amy for her part boldly seeks acceptance into the group after she sees them practicing a dance routine at an abandoned railway track the cuties as they call their dance group reject and bully amy before embracing her dance skills theyre not the kindest or most tolerant bunch but they offer amy a dose of an imaginative risktaking life one that does not shirk from curiosity and connection but runs after it no matter the price the most emotionally caring of the girls angelica lives in amys building and they bond over the isolation they feel in their families as well as their growing estrangement from their parents who seem too busy and too disapproving to engage their interests instead these girls must navigate their love of expression alone of course in a world marked by the exploitation of women of all ages and within all cultures they stumble  doucourés film rigorously examines the ways teen girls mimic the images they see on social media the ones that tell them their bodies are all wrong their presentation too childish their lives unremarkable but instead of preaching to children on the basis of fear doucouré is willing to look frankly at what is so appealing about lascivious dancing to girls too young to understand sex even on a very fundamental level the cuties find a kind of power in their movement and have very little insight into the wider context of their selfsexualization yet instead of listening and speaking to these young girls asking them about their interests and figuring out how to support them in ways that dont threaten their ability to be children the adults around them mostly respond with shame and rejection  only one elder within amys community is able to see through her transgressions initiallynot only the sexualized dancing and dressing but also a violent act she commits at school against a student who harasses herand addresses the root of the rebellion this elder connects amys pain to her mothers pain her lashing out to her mothers inability to continue to shoulder the burden of what seems to be a deeply onesided marriage he looks at amy spends time with her and concludes that there is no evil or devil within the child but perhaps a need for amys mother to know that she can liberate herself from a marriage that does not offer her love or freedom  this desire for social purity to protect oneself from the corruption of the outside is not confined to the right or to the religious anyone who has been on the left long enough can tell stories of joining or encountering a highly insular group that refused to work with anyone who did not subscribe to all of their tenets it is all too easy to convince ourselves that if only our group can be kept pure and committed we can become strong enough to go out and change the world this is where i think the christian doctrine of original sin has something to teach the left we can never externalize evil we cant simply gather the right group of people because we ourselves are not right doucourés cuties takes this doctrine to heart criticizing the multiple layers of societal exploitation and coercion that impose surveillance on girls rather than meet them with the compassion and openness that could actually extinguish such exploitation to refuse the opportunity to hear this message is only to perpetuate the problems all the outrage around the film claims to reject 
Apr 24 2020,neutral, the internet can be a scary place access to information doesnt just mean a democratized digital space  it also means more access to danger and harm when raising young children in the internet age who and what can influence them has expanded more than ever before its jarring to come to terms with this but maïmouna doucourés film cuties challenges the audience to do so earnest performances from the assemble cast and doucourés deliberately voyeuristic direction showcases the perils and plights of coming of age in the digital era amy fathia youssouf is an 11yearold french sengalese girl struggling to grow into who she is her mother is hit with news of her father taking a second wife throwing the family into preparation for their wedding celebration downtrodden she looks to find friendship with a group of popular tween dancers who call themselves cuties while she and the cuties practice to compete in a dance competition she begins to grow increasingly rebellious going against her religious values amy continues to spiral in a volatile way  amy finds herself warring with her conservative muslim upbringing while seeking the freedom the cuties represent typically in a hoodie and tshirts she starts wearing her younger brothers shirt and fashions it into a crop top eventually she steals money to buy more fashionable crop tops heeled clogs liquid leggings and other limited tooesque outfits this escalates into buying lingerie for her and her new friends desperate to kick the baby image  despite the cuties wanting you to think theyre mature doucouré reminds you constantly in the screenplay their age the interactions they have between other people in the film  like older classmates  serve as a heat check that no matter their insistence these are children so act accordingly doucouré pairs this reminder with close tracking shots while the girls practice dancing the closeness of the camera while these children attempt to dance sensually is very uncomfortable to witness but thats the objective it reinforces how oversexualized girls like them have been in particular black girls who have commonly been told theyre hot in the pants or too grown starting at this age the onus is put on the audience the adults in the room literally to look away while these girls are trying to figure themselves out  eventually amys mother finds out whats going on and confronts her who are you amy she screams in an explosive scene that ends in tears and holy water the actions were certainly excessive but ultimately a hard lesson in trying to find a place in amys world with access to a phone she now had adult dancers to inspire her dance moves friends to inspire her looks and photos to inspire her bad decisionmaking cuties ends as heartbreaking as it does hopeful amy has plenty of life left to live to reverse the mistakes shes made but in an age of influence society is not doing a good job protecting these girls and influencing them for the better joi childs is a brand marketer freelance writer and sarcasm enthusiast born and raised in nyc she loves writing and talking about the intersection of marketing and nerd life her work has appeared at the hollywood reporter the verge okayplayer and many other outlets follow her on social media to keep up with her great adventures in cinema and more
Feb 3 2020,positive, maïmouna doucouré has a lot on her mind in the french film cuties but her own beliefs are more opaque about the topics which clearly fascinate her she certainly gives her 11yearold protagonist amy fathia youssouf abdillahi quite a bit to deal with with the exact nature of her fears only revealed at the very end where it finally becomes clear just who will be amys saving grace in the labyrinth of contrasting expectations which awaits her rapidly approaching womanhood the more immediate nature of what awaits amy is revealed to her only through happenstance as she and her mother mariam maïmouna gueye await her fathers return from senegal by eavesdropping on a series of adult conversations amy learns the true nature of her fathers absence which involves taking a second wife who will soon be residing with them in their apartment  such developments would send the best of us into an emotional tailspin but amy also has to witness mariams pain and humiliation from what the other women see as her duty which involves calling others in the community to cheerily announce the news and preparing the food for the wedding which will occur at their own home all the while her local mosque preaches modesty and obedience while warning of the hell which awaits those who disobey such a repressive environment tends to birth extremes and sure enough amy is drawn to a dance group at her school which not only offers escape but an outlet to express the emotions her stoic culture forbids her from voicing with all the zeal of a convert amy is soon leading the other girls into increasingly provocative dance routines and taking actions that soon appall even her new friends who are already eager to sexualize themselves  in another movie theyd be symbolic of a generations oversexualization and victimization but cuties would rather explore the preteen dynamics doucouré has a keen eye for with an interesting addition of some magical realism its not without some discomfort though as the camera zooms right in on the girls in a fashion far more suited to adult women which couldnt be anything other than cringy at least the film doesnt pretend that any of the various cultures amy is struggling to navigate will ever do right by her although it does offer another way between extremes where perhaps true freedom can be found cuties competed in the world cinema dramatic competition at the 2020 sundance film festival and is currently seeking distribution doucouré was awarded the directing award world cinema dramatic award for cuties cordcutting once carried the promise of reducing live tv costs but with most services nearing a 100 per month that statement checks less every day that said there is a handful of cordcutting services with reasonable monthly prices below we list them maybe youve just seen oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathonor more fun yet rankall of christopher nolans films or maybe youre one of the few who havent seen interstellar yet if you are then you should change that immediately the dystopian epic is one of nolans best and with that incredible twist in   which netflix country has interstellar for whatever reason the hunger games series isnt available in the same countries around the world youll find the first and second aka the best installments in hong kong for instance but not the third and fourth its a frustrating dilemma especially if you dont even have a single entry in your region which is   which netflix country has each movie of the hunger games
Feb 3 2020,positive, puberty especially for many preteen and teenage girls is often full of contradictions theyre objectified and handled with gloves theyre expected to act older and younger than they are theyre prodded and shamed and pushed in conflicting directionsoften at a whimwhen seemingly every decision they make is chastised societal pressure whether its through their family their friends their classmates the media they consume or even the instant gratification of social media is allconsuming and for amy fathia youssoufthe 11yearold at the center of cutiesall of that is laid bare as it starts to deconstruct those contradictions an 11yearold girl attending a new school in paris befriends a group of girlswho are trying to win a local dance competitionas puberty  and a clash of ideals between her friends and family emerge like many girls around her age amy dons a different persona both with her outfits and her demeanor depending on who shes with after she and her family move into an apartment in a poor paris neighborhood shes expected to look after her younger siblings and help her mother mariam dutifully prepare for her husbands wedding to his second wife when they arrive from senegal their tightknit muslim community largely sees the wedding as a blessing and expects them to welcome the new family with open arms at school she becomes fascinated by the cuties a group of girls who act out and wear revealing clothing under the train tracks the cuties practice dance moves in hopes of winning a local competition and while those girls are as close as friends can be that friendship can be picked up or dropped on a whim they each have the capacity to wield that cruelty like a sharpened knife and jam it where it hurts most amy is a constant witness whether shes processing her rage in silence as she glimpses the mask her mother wears slip for the briefest of moments or watching the cuties practice their dance routine from afar shes expected to fit in a certain box and shes punished if she strays outside of it its not until amy starts utilizing a smartphone she obtains and keeps a secret from her family that she starts paving her own way she even contributes more moves to the dance routine to make their dance even more provocative but she also finds out the hard way the hypocrisy that is being a girl on the cusp of discovering who she is shes continually haunted by the dress shes supposed to wear to her fathers wedding and everything that represents and as she heads on that downward spiral shes unrecognizable to just about everyone who knows her at times the melodramatics of the situation lean into the absurd and border on implausible written and directed by maïmouna doucouré whose script won a sundance institute global filmmaking award in 2017 cuties nails down just how isolating and uncomfortable being a young girl in the world can be elevated largely by youssoufs performance amyand so many girls out there reallyare judged and shamed for wearing too much clothing wearing too little clothing wearing the wrong type of clothing for the way they dance for not accepting everything at face value or with a smile for chasing that high on social media and for what they post theyre expected to act like adults and children all at once but when faced with one reality of children acting like adults its downright uncomfortable at one point amy lays two very different outfits on a bed the two sides of her double life that almost look like they couldve been made from the same cloth the metaphor is hamfisted and it takes some clunky maneuvering to get there but the messagewhile muddiedgets across just the same still not sure what to watch tonight here are our guides for the absolute best movies on netflix mustsee netflix original series documentaries docuseries and movies  looking for something more specific here are our netflix guides for the best war movies documentaries anime indie flicks true crime food shows romcoms lgbt movies alien movies gangster movies westerns film noir and movies based on true stories streaming right now there are also sad movies guaranteed to make you cry weird movies to melt your brain old movies when you need something classic and standup specials when you really need to laugh or check out flixable a search engine for netflix michelle jaworski is a staff writer and tvfilm critic at the daily dot she covers entertainment geek culture and pop culture and has covered everything from the sundance film festival nyff and tribeca to new york comic con and con of thrones she is based in brooklyn
Jan 30 2020,positive, it could be argued that amy fathia youssouf and her friends spend the entirety of cuties in a place they should not be but at one point somewhat late in the film a male security guard catches them in a moment of physical trespass kicking them out of the club theyve snuck into and the girls no more than 11 or 12 are savvy enough to call his authority into question by screaming pedophile at the top of their lungs bringing his boss into the mix to calm the situation down even at their precocious age the quartet are wellaware of how the world works but struggle with their place in it a contradiction which may have been explored in countless comingofage tales but rarely as boldly as in maïmouna doucourés startling feature debut while catherine hardwickes thirteen comes to mind doucouré eschews a gritty aesthetic in favor of a subtly surreal one for the story of the young amy who has recently resettled in a new flat with her mother mariam and two younger siblings waiting for their father to join them with mariam rarely at home presumably working to keep a roof over their head amy looks to find friends at school and for better or worse locates coumba jess and angelica who stand out on the schoolyard for the brawls theyre inclined to start and as she grows a rebellious streak upon learning inadvertently that her fathers absence is due to bringing home a second wife from senegal she fights her way into the group quite literally becoming a crucial part of their aspirations to win a dance crew competition although their routines are fierce cuties suggests the young women are moving far too fast clad in skintight outfits and gyrating in highlysexualized choreography that they couldnt even begin to fully comprehend its origin from seeing it on youtube though the influence of the kardashians namechecked at one point has clearly reached all the way to france the much more pernicious cultural root of this however is largely left offscreen as you realize that while men can do as they please whether its amys father running around in senegal or her young brother ismael who floods the apartment thinking it would be fun to turn it into a pool no such avenues exist for women expected only to serve as sexual objects or to care for any resulting children and doucouré brilliantly articulates amys search for direction into an painful binary choice either staying the religious path her mother has taken which has left her bound to a husband that doesnt return her care and consideration or leaning into sexual objectification where it seems like theres some liberation in bold outfits and attitude of course each can quickly become their own prison and by the time cuties reaches a climatic dance scene which is right up there with the shower scene in psycho in skillfully avoiding anything specifically obscene but sure to fuel some nightmares doucouré has locked up the audience up in it turning into truly transfixing cinema worrying that its central characters are acting beyond their years you marvel at how the filmmaker directs beyond what should be expected of a debut feature eliciting remarkable performances from her young cast and carefully establishing the slightly heightened world cuties exists in offering a powerful plea for society to step up its game as well cuties will screen at the sundance film festival on january 24th at 9 am at the library center theatre in park city and 9 pm at the salt lake city library theatre january 25th at 6 pm at the sundance mountain resort screening room in park city january 29th at 6 pm at the temple theatre in park city and january 31st at 1 pm at the redstone cinema 2 in park city
Jan 29 2020,positive, sure to be a crowdpleaser for its joyous scenes of a group of elevenyearold girls dancing cuties is an often compelling if somewhat underbaked look at how girls end up becoming oversexualized at a young age cuties follows amy a senegalese immigrant new to paris who is caught between her devoutly religious family in upheaval  her father has just taken a second wife and has yet to join them in france  and her desire to be part of a group of french girls at school who love to dance  maïmouna doucourés feature debut often feels inspired by céline sciammas girlhood which follows a teenage girl marieme seeking community both use shotreverseshot techniques to show us the desirable group that the protagonist wants to belong to  often glimpsed dancing  and the lonely protagonist staring at them in awe while sciamma explored mariemes struggle with performing femininity and masculinity while seeking freedom from oppression doucourés cuties explores how young girls are sexualized often by choice but without understanding the consequences of this sexualization in cuties doucouré constantly highlights the disconnect between the girls awareness of their own sexuality and how theyre perceived when we meet amys first friend shes in tight pleather pants a tiny top her hips swaying to the music and her long hair covering her face it comes as a shock that shes so young when her face is revealed in a key scene a member of the group picks up a condom off the street and starts blowing into it like a balloon unaware of what shes touching at the same time the girls wear tight clothing often with low necks and bare midriffs and perform increasingly sexually suggestive choreography despite many closeups of the girls bottoms as they dance doucouré avoids any kind of leering gaze instead celebrating the girls rhythmic athleticism with a weary eye to how problematic this could be unfortunately doucourés exploration of whats driving the girls to want to present as sexualized adults so young is undercooked certainly its partly curiosity and theres a great scene in which amy watches the rear ends of a group of women in her building shot from her height after being made fun of by her friends for having a nonexistent derriere we also sense that amys father may have taken a second wife to satisfy sexual desires but since this is never made explicit its unlikely amy understands this  despite its flaws cuties proves that doucouré has a keen eye for keeping us in the childrens perspective and that leads to some wonderfully nuanced moments amy first discovers her father is taking a second wife when hiding under her mothers bed her grandmother is bullying her mother into making this news known and we watch that power play occur through amys eyes in the way the grandmothers feet push towards the mother and invade her space when amys mother cries amy cries understanding her life is changing but perhaps not what all the implications of that are
Jan 27 2020,positive,doucourés film will surely draw conversations as more people see it those who even disagree with some of her decisions will find it hard to get these timely themes and ideas out of their heads thus proving it to be an effective film
Jan 27 2020,positive, throughout the world the pain suffering and voices of little girls are often ignored and silenced french filmmaker maïmouna doucourés debut film cuties mignonnes is an arresting assessment of the hypersexualization of young girls and grapples with the juxtaposition of this issue in a society where women are becoming increasingly sexually liberated the bold and disquieting film follows amy an 11year old girl who moves with her mother and young brothers from senegal to a jampacked paris housing project while her mother mariam maïmouna gueye has become preoccupied with the devastating news that her husband has taken a second wife amy is left to parent her younger siblings this includes everything from watching them feeding them and doing the grocery shopping for the household similar to films like beasts of the southern wild crooklyn and eves bayou doucouré shines a light on how quickly black girls are expected to stand in and complete tasks typically ascribed to adults in contrast little black boys often basque in the attentions of their mothers free of such expectations though her mother has raised her as a devout conservative muslim amy soon gets her hands on an iphone and begins to emulate the more provocative images of women she sees online and in music videos an outcast in her plain clothing and large afro puff amy soon finds herself fascinated with her classmate angelica a latinx girl who wears her slick straight hair and quick temper as armor angelica is fearless and volatilethe queen bee of her friend group thats dubbed themselves the cuties eager to garner angelicas attention and earn her place on the cuties crew amy begins wearing her brothers tshirts as croptops while intensely studying the cuties mannerisms and behaviors what starts as an innocent desire to fit in and have a place in her new environment becomes a cautionary tale for not just young girls but for the rest of the world that has decided that young girls especially young girls of color arent worthy of protection when the cuties sign up for a community dance competition where they are set to compete against a group of older girls amy seizes the opportunity she meticulously practices the cuties dance choreography strategically placing herself in angelicas good graces before winning her spot in the group even at the expense of another girl cuties is difficult to watch as amy and her friends shake grind and gyrate in the camera wearing belly tops and booty shorts doucouré forces her audience to sit in a paralyzing state of fear it is deeply uncomfortable to watch prepubescent girls behave in this manner  shot in one of paris most impoverished neighborhoods which is rarely seen on the big screen doucouré shoots amy and her crew in bold bright colors under the beaming paris sun the cuties are vibrant and vivacious its the predatory men who sexualize them who are terrifying cuties quickly shifts to a tone of breathless terror whenever any man appears in the frame as it is unclear how their presence will impact the girls and women this nervousness is most acute when observing mariams willingness to bend to her husbands commands and how this helps to shape amys understanding of a womans place in society through her mothers actions she is socialized on how to contain and confine her own wishes becoming someone she doesnt recognize during one powerful scene amy hides under the bed listening to her distraught mother weep over her fathers betrayal by taking a new wife in the next breath amy witnesses mariam gleefully chat about the marriage as if her gutwrenching sobs never happened in that pretending and emotional constraint amy learns that her feelings and needs are invalid

Jan 26 2020,positive, after putting the finishing touches on handcut homemade arts and crafts project for her mother 11yearold amy fathia youssouf and her younger brother start arguing over who gets the bigger bedroom of their new apartment they are told that the room is not for either of them it is never explained why at least not directly to the children maïmouna doucourés cuties which was acquired by netflix ahead of its sundance debut is a vibrant portrait of self discovery a realist exercise in expressive empathy that doubles as a cautionary tale on the dangers of vanity its a radically different spin on a comingofage narrative like amazons troop zero only from the kidswhowanttobecools perspectives rather than the pickedon outcasts which might be less interesting were it not for the extreme difference in social economy ethnic upbringing and doucourés raw and intricate eye as a filmmaker  amy is the kind of girl who tries so hard to fit in she sometimes ends up alienating herself further by extension her family has recently arrived in paris from senegal and she lives a fairly conversative life praying to allah and partaking in group prayer with the rest of her community repeatedly reminded of her pious duties and lectured on taboo behavior one day amy spots one of her neighbors angelica twerking her heart out in the laundry room sporting a crop top and leather pants while ironing her hair amys eyes go wide angelica is the head of a schoolyard dance clique who have dubbed themselves the cuties after witnessing a frozen flash mob amy instantly becomes enamored with their behavior enviously following the girls to watch them practice by the train tracks shooting videos on their phones to upload for instagram views but amy is too poor to afford a cell phone and her family would never allow one anyway when an opportunity presents itself amy swipes a phone from a local day laborer working on the vacant apartment room practicing her moves in front of her mirror amy inserts herself as a cutie member after earning some likes but the young ladys addiction to social media grows obsessive as the group prepares for a dance competition cuties is bursting at the seams with strong ideas through a sharply made vision thought it chooses not to address some of its most deliberately discomforting aspects with any kind of direct discussion in an effort to represent all the important conversations so many parents never actually sit down to have with their children perhaps most kids live in their own world too blissfully innocent to grasp the concept of long term repercussions doucourés film appears more concerned with exploring the consequences a bunch of selfie practice sessions might have as opposed to sitting down for an actual talk about the potentially vainglorious pitfallsseveral of the most standout sequences are euphorically cathartic liberating and celebratory basking in the glory of feminine empowerment in the same way that movies like the bling ring or hustlers have but the fallout of the cuties consumerist actions dont have direct legal repercussions so much as psychological ones kids can be mean really mean and cuties isnt afraid to show ignorant preteens uncanny ability to traumatize each other as giggly gummy bear eating contests turn into life or death playground shoving matches but it also never stops to say to the kids at its center hey life doesnt really work that way the aesthetic craft is subtly resonant but structurally too elliptical for its own good the screenplay telegraphing conflicts some viewers will see coming from a mile away while withholding vital info the purposeful refusal to have any kind of conversation to craft an insular narrative  to show rather than tell  is a bold one though not entirely successful the domestic stakes are a good example the first 5 to 10 minutes establishes the oppressive side of amys religious life but then never really returns to what is prohibited until the climax outside one scene which finds her stealth watching sensual videos of women twerking in sexually lurid poses on youtube from underneath her hijab which cuties plays for a laugh  everything doucourés script seeds goes wrong all at once the heaviest aspects of the drama not being dispersed throughout the film at regular intervals and it doesnt go anywhere unexpected only exactly where you feared it might watching these girls increasingly inappropriate and bullying behavior simply grows more upsetting until it gets to the point where you want to rewind the movie have a talk with amy and stop her from ever stealing that phone in the first place
Jan 24 2020,positive, when we speak in platitudes about the hardships and the bullying faced by tweenaged kids in school we might speak about encouraging selfconfidence or goal achievement but in maïmouna doucourés sharply observed cuties about an elevenyearold girl steering full bore into a new version of herselfa version apart from the idea of womanhood offered by her familywe are reminded that kids goals are often not in their own best interest the bullies are mean but the bullied would give anything to become them the most potent example of power and outward confidence they have to look up to still cuties reminds us this misguided ambition is difficultand potentially damagingto try and discourage its amys fathia youssouf abdillahi first day at her new parisian elementary school when she encounters the mignonnes or cuties a quartet of outgoing popular girls who have started their own dance troupe with the aim of taking on an older instagramfamous team of dancers the cuties brand of budding femininity is instantly more appealing to amy than the life planned for her by her senegalese family and community where learning to be a woman involves preparing the meal for her fathers upcoming wedding to his second wife polygamy not divorce the news of which has made amy feel even more disconnected from her home life cuties most outrageous but most indispensable element is the highly sexualized behavior of its core cast of children at first all the pouts and gyrations and bare midriffs seem like pure comedy but even though it continues to be funny the humor gains a darker edge as we come to understand how this particular brand of precociousness represents a dualedged freedom the girls move toward more assured selfexpression is a positive but one worries about the healthiness of understanding sexiness before understanding sex  doucouré is as ambivalent about her characters maturation as she is about their friendship when amy and head mignonne angelica medina el aidi lounge in bed talking about their families their bond is so tight that theyre even twirling their hair together female friendships of any age tend to be stronger and more intimate than those of boys and men but at an age when insecurity is at its max the slightest betrayal or rough patch can tear these girls apart devastatingly in its nonjudgmental empathy and its comedy of discomfort cuties is a tad reminiscent of bo burnhams eighth grade though with an even younger lead but doucouré distinguishes her film with touches of magical realisma dress that seems to change and swell in anticipation of amys puberty possibly sentient confetti an airborne game of jump ropethat make cuties thrillingly unique that is exactly why it is a thing our so called betters are pushing the  sexualization of children as normal because of the very large number of pedos among the so called elite by the time people who have been asleep to such things wake up to this these elites  80 of hollywood as well hope to have desensitized americans to pedophilia to such an extent regular folks wont be revolted to much and call for all of their scalps i dont think it has been the elites who watched cable tv shows such as dance moms with 10 to 12 year old girls in skimpy outfits performing risque dance routines week after week  or the 12 to 14 year old girls paraded on stage by their own mothers on the murray povich show on network tv in the morning hours they would be attired in the scantiest of outfits and then  queried about their sexual activity while mr povich their moms and the audience feigned shock and outrage go and watch the jr high  cheerleaders at many high schools especially in texas florida and california if you want to see tiny outfits and sexualized dance routines there is a major problem alright but it is widespread and right in your own backyard
Jan 24 2020,positive, french writerdirector maïmouna doucouré strikes a mostly affable balance between familiar comingofage tropes and culturally specific intersections with her debut cuties a striking portrait of contemporary adolescence filmed in paris the films focus is an awkward transition for its lead protagonist a secondgeneration senegalese girl increasingly estranged from her familys culture whilst embracing all the toxic rites of passage of modern teen angst doucourés 2015 short mamans navigated similar autobiographical territory from a culture which allows for polygamy on the husbands side and its one of several eyeopening realities which assist in triggering the escapist slanted teen rebellion here throw into the mix the usual hypersexualization of young girls and the obliviousness of the adults guiding them and doucouré portrays a perfect tempest faced by young women in the crafting of their personas defined by a swift loss of innocence and the oftimpossible feat of discovering what one really desires elevenyearold amy fathia youssouf abdillahi finds herself in a suddenly tenuous position at home her mother mariam maïmouna gueye is in anguish and amy accidentally learns her father who has been away from the family on a trip to senegal has taken a second wife who he has married and will be bringing home to join their household while mariam is preoccupied with her own emotional turmoil amy strikes a friendship with the rebellious angelique her neighbor in the same apartment complex who is the unofficial head of a dance troupe who call themselves the cuties and rehearse for a potential dance competition with the hope to outtwerk an older rival gang of girl dancers angeliques cohorts initially reject amy but eventually she wheedles her way into their graces following the tumultuous and unexpected expulsion of one of their posse a young girl who unwittingly angers angelique its not long before amy has enhanced the troops sultriness by introducing more titillating dance moves shes gleaned from music videos but the shifting stability at home and the mercurial angelique force amy to the point of desperation doucouré who penned the script crafted her story with director alice winocour disorder 2015 proxima 2019 valentine milville and nathalie surgeon my revolution 2016 and cuties does feel as if its a spiritual cousin to something like 2016s mustang which winocour wrote another narrative focused on archaic cultural traditions which repress women and prove to be detrimental in the development of their young contemporary female characters narratives revolving around the arrival of a second wife are rife for contemporary dramatic possibilities but are usually from the perspective of the first wife such as kuma 2012 by umat dag and brillante mendozas thy womb 2012 so its a unique perspective to use it as the foreground for a child simultaneously attempting to assimilate into the culture of another country to a significant degree much of cuties feels familiar specifically a troubled journey we can predict for amy with the dance competition but doucouré focuses so tightly on the perspective of amy whose adolescent behaviors are wholly familiar she concocts a compelling slippery slope of how quickly angst mutates into dysfunction and eventually to points of no return for instance cuties is not meant to examine how young women are influenced to seek their worth through desirability and were never privy to how the adults in their realm feel about their troubling sexually charged dancing sans some concerned parents in the dance competition audience or amys relatives announcing shes dressed like a whore social media plays into amys new conception of herself though access to the platform is tenuous as her avatar depends on holding onto a stolen phone from a relative the cultural intersections of cuties are in essence barely touched upon and yet theres a richness to doucourés comingofage narrative which eludes many of her contemporary counterparts as amy abdillahi is a graceful mournful screen presence despite the awkwardness of the age in question and as she begins to embrace her newfound confidence she is reminiscent of a leggy teen version of american singer ciara despite the connections made or lost with various characters and a commitment to sincerity which sometimes lends itself to grating moments most often when amy and her new friends are goofing around and acting their age in public amy is an insulated character and doucouré wisely depends on the performance of abidllahi to convey the roiling emotions which cant be fashioned into words reuniting with her mamans cinematographer yann maritaud clothing becomes a major focus of cuties to convey how wardrobe choices represent cultural markers and meanings finishing on a note of perfection when amy decides upon an ensemble and activities befitting herself and her ageconcluding with a note of magical metaphor recalling the final moments of maren ades debut the forest for the trees 2003 los angeles based nicholas bell is ioncinemacoms chief film critic and covers film festivals such as

Jan 24 2020,positive, the desire to rebel is a natural instinct for many children to be told what not to do tends to fuel an inherent urge to push back against authority set in france maïmouna doucourés cuties demonstrates the universality of these themes transcending language and culture amy fathia youssouf is a fairly rebellious elevenyearold discontent with the strict rules in her household the circumstances make it hard to blame her her mother miriam maïmouna gueye is a hardworking parent struggling to raise three children while her husband pursues a second marriage in senegal miriam is a compassionate woman who played by the rules of tradition with seemingly little to show for it a group of girls who dub themselves the cuties attract amys interest with their elaborate dance routines eager to join their clique amy starts to deviate from the guidelines set before her a stolen cellphone provides amy with valuable cultural capital as well as a glimpse of the broader world shed been sheltered from doucouré is quite skilled at conveying emotion capturing the highs and lows of adolescence in a way that speaks to the universality of growing up cuties is often hilarious the young talent are superb at drawing laughs from subtle moments that are easy to relate to though many have not had to experience the idea of having a second wife move into ones alreadycramped apartment cuties touches on themes that are quite popular in american cinema amys father is not shown to be a great guy and the adults in her life struggle to help amy copes with this harsh reality earlier eras put up with that stuff in a way that simply isnt appealing to a younger demographic thats experienced a world outside the strict confines of religion which isnt to say that amy is some misunderstood angel like many elevenyearolds shes prone to behaving like a brat doucouré captures this trajectory in a powerful way largely through amys relationship with her mother american family sitcoms are filled with predictable teaching moments at the end of their episodes cuties follows similar arcs but shakes things up in a refreshing manner dealing with reality rather than a mom knows best outcome cuties captures adolescence life in a deeply moving manner the film is very wellcrafted with a keen sense of pacing packing quite a lot into a ninetyminute runtime doucouré fully understands what its like to be a kid and an adult delivering a compassionate family narrative that respects both sides of the equation five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up 
Jan 24 2020,negative, a preteen steps away from her traditional senegalese family background and attempts to fit in by joining a posse of precociously sexualized dancers in maïmouna doucourés feature debut cuties the awkward transition from childhood into sexually selfaware adolescence is navigated at reckless speed by the young protagonist of cuties writerdirector maïmouna doucourés captivating but structurally shaky first feature is stronger on setup than development or payoff becoming less controlled as its opposing forces of tradition and rebellion collide but as 11yearold amy fathia youssouf provides a disarmingly tender center to this drama about the child of a senegalese family anxious to escape troubles at home and find peer acceptance by joining a meangirl dance clique at her french middle school following its sundance premiere the french production will be released in spring by netflix where it might benefit from proximity to mati diops beguiling fusion of social realism with the supernatural atlantics however the film cuties most recalls is american director anna rose holmers the fits which told a similar though far more abstract story of a tween girl awakening into young womanhood via the alluring power of physical movement amy has just moved with her mother mariam maïmouna gueye and two younger brothers into a new apartment her questions about when their father will return to them from senegal receive only vague answers she gradually learns however that he will be bringing a second wife to occupy the lavishly appointed master bedroom kept under lock and key pressured by the familys oldschool aunty mbissine thérèse diop mariam has agreed to share their home and celebrate the wedding putting on a brave face while literally beating herself up for a marital demotion she sees as her own personal failing her mothers desolation  at odds with the teachings of muslim community prayer meetings where wives vow to obey their husbands  does nothing to help amy map her own path to womanhood instead shes mesmerized as she watches her spirited neighbor angelica médina el aidiazouni dancing with sultry selfpossession in the buildings laundry dressed in a skimpy crop top and skintight leatherette pants amy is drawn to angelica and her posse of fellow dance enthusiasts from school coumba esther gohourou jess ilanah camigoursolas and yasmine myriam hamma collectively known as the cuties the outsider is visibly delighted by their exuberant fashion sense sassy attitudes and dynamic moves at first they treat her with bullying scorn but amy wont be deterred gaining tentative admission to their circle through angelica in the meantime she steals the cell phone of her cousin mamadou samake and gets an addictive first taste of social media and youtube studying videos of older womens provocative twerking moves and then practicing her own version of them alone in the bathroom when an altercation leads to yasmine being shut out of the group amy is ready to step in spicing up their routine as they prepare for tryouts in a local dance contest doucouré establishes intriguing juxtapositions as she deftly sets the wheels of inevitable conflict in motion the brightly colored but matronly gown sent from senegal for amy to wear to her fathers second wedding stands as a rebuke to her as she amusingly repurposes her kid brothers undersized tshirt as a crop top and trades her soccermom jeans for cutoffs theres also real poignancy in mariams sorrow that plays in counterpoint to amys secret emancipation but as amy gets closer to the dance contest falling in and out of favor with the other girls the storytelling becomes less fluid even the frequent shots of energy injected via dance montages start to feel like padding as the plot momentum falters the director is working mostly in a naturalistic vein and her occasional stylistic flourishes of magic realism dont always feel organic the bigger issue is that once the film establishes its critical view of a culture that steers impressionable young girls toward the hypersexualization of their bodies it sets up a clash against traditional values that should provide a sturdy third act  particularly given the rich contextual potential to explore african identity in a western european country the elements are put in place from amys defiance dishonesty and ruthless determination to participate in the contest at any price to auntys glowering condemnation and mariams emotional crossroads as the wedding approaches but doucouré doesnt quite thread those strands into a satisfying conclusion there nonetheless are plenty of reasons to keep watching from the vibrancy of the visuals to the youthful vitality of the preteen actors and the feverish excitability with which the movie captures young female friendship theres especially engaging work from the magnetic youssouf as amy and from el aidiazouni who gives bespectacled angelica a spiky authority softened by an occasional touch of sweetness but although the closing shots of amy in more modest western clothing jumping rope with other girls from her fathers wedding party are lovely they largely bypass the real drama and go directly to an unearned and disappointingly facile image of empowered resilience
Jan 24 2020,positive, for her feature debut writerdirector maimouna doucoure the sundancewinning short mamans sets the sexual awakening and desperate need for acceptance of an 11 yearold girl against a clash of cultures in the internet age the sight of twerking preteen bodies is explicitly designed to shock mature audiences into a contemplation of todays destruction of innocence but some missteps hold cuties at a distance for that demographic a film to respect for its audacity admire for its lead female performance perhaps but also view as a dramatically contrived premiering at sundance after which it travels to berlins generation section in advance of a french theatrical release and netflix global outing cuties will certainly garner mainstream media attention but its the streaming service and its giant young audience which should propel doucoures debut into the ya hit zone of 13 reasons why or the end of the fing world underscoring that this is her target audience doucoure moves the film along furiously and brightly painting the scenario in broad teenfriendly neonaccented brushstrokes its also scored with an eye to the zeitgeist  heavy on ygress and with tracks including my bitches are comin adult supervision is conveniently negligible at home or at school this is a film for and about kids and senegalese immigrant amy or aminata played impressively by fathia youssouf abdillahi throughout is chief amongst them amys home life is troubled her family is deeply religious and she is consistently admonished to be pious and cover her head when outside the familys new home which is a giant public housing block in paris mostly inhabited by her fellow countrymen she awaits the return of her father from senegal but when he does come back it will be with his new second wife  a fact which amys depressed and mostlyabsent mother mariam maïmouna gueye initially hides amy must go to school while looking after her two younger brothers which she often does by locking one in the bathroom there she is drawn to a bitchy girl gang who have a dance group called the cuties and as it turns out she will stop at nothing to gain their acceptance doucoures screenplay requires amys behaviour to escalate radically and often hysterically in the absence of any realworld consequence she steals a phone from a family friend and money from her distracted mother her brother floods the bathroom she goes to school wearing a tank top and pvc trousers and has screeching fights with rival gangs yet nobody in this closeknit community raises an alarm in short shes acting out in some style and pretty soon she wins a place in the cuties troop despite her flat ass we then move to outrageous musical montages involving closeup crotch shots of pouting preteens doucoure seems to want to provoke censure but fails precisely because shes trying so hard ultimately thats the fate that also befalls amy as she learns the perils of the internet and the limits of the selfie all four cuties members give excellent performances both in their routines and as convincing members of a fairly oppressive demographic  the preteen girl gang its abdillahi who is outstanding however moving between child and young adult with an ease that mirrors the reallife confusion of that age doucoure captures her and preadolescence at a moment in time which young audiences will recognise and respond to most viewers  and parents in particular  will find some truth in at least parts of cuties ultimately though doucoure has chosen her own girl gang and theyre the ones who will most benefit from this cautionary tale when it moves to streaming screen international is the essential resource for the international film industry subscribe now for monthly editions awards season weeklies access to the screen international archive and supplements including stars of tomorrow and world of locations

protected by recaptcha enterprise and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply elevenyearold amy a revelatory fathia youssouf abdillah already has an eye for petty misdeeds before falling in with the titular cuties of maimouna doucourés feature debut the sweet gangly tween is no stranger to tiny acts of rebellion that both mystify and thrill her as if even she cant believe what shes getting up to in the liminal space between childhood and adulthood stickyfingered a set of prayer beads here a muchneeded cell phone there and hyperobservant amy doesnt miss a trick characteristics that not only set her apart from her family but also make her something of a curiosity at her local school recently moved into a bustling french apartment building and a dizzyingly busy middle school amy is in state of massive transition and thats before the physical demands of puberty start to infiltrate every inch of her body and mind doucourés evenhanded approach to the films grounded first half is what makes it so moving and relatable and despite the specificity of amys story  her family culture background and the contemporary obsessions that enthrall her  there is a heartening universality to her troubles cuties may have plenty on its mind but its also the kind of comingofage story that will make any adult viewer think back to their own tween years you couldnt pay most people to relive all that watching amy endure it on screen is hard enough despite the drama of her storyline doucouré has a real eye for visual humor amy sitting quietly during a prayer service tucked inside her headscarves as she watches a twerking video while appearing to pray and a sight gag centered on the outrageous number of onions shes tasked with chopping in preparation for a feast originally from senegal amys traditional lifestyle requires that she honor her parents  and eventually her husband  by being meek and reserved faithful and timid and yet amys familial unit has already started to break down propelling them into uncharted space in the absence of her father resolved in the films first act through one hell of a heartbreaking revelation amy must honor her mother a haunting maïmouna gueye above all once that part of her life changes the diversions pile up theres her growing femininity her needy younger brother and a new interest in pop music and dancing and there of course are the cuties the cuties are a budding dance crew whose leader happens to live in amys building the intrigue is understandable where amy is shy they are bold where she is modest theyre brash doucouré and her young cast believably chart the girls fickle affections as amy orbits their world from their intense adoration to their terrible ability to bully each other amy eventually wiggles her way into the group by way of her stolen cell phone offering her services as a videographer for their dancing exploits the girls are preparing to enter a dance contest and an appearance by their great rivals the sweetyswaggs lays out whats the come the swaggs are older more developed more sexualized and their moves reflect that the cuties certainly dont understand that even the elder swaggs are at the mercy of a hypersexualized culture and its demands and that theres something deeply wrong with a teenager taking her top off in the middle of dance video soon enough the cuties are unfurling their own new routine led by amy who remains tuned in to whats happening around her but not what it actually means the foursome does realize that there is something here beyond their reach  new best pal angelica balks at a move that involves lasciviously sucking on her fingers and they all seem to think their buttbumping is silly more than anything the audience must endure their sexualization as increasingly horrified spectators the girls vacillate between being hyperinterested in the opposite sex the girls push amy to videotape a cute boy in the bathroom and being freaked out by its actual mechanics as in a scene in which they discover a used condom a group of initially interested teenage boys soon recoil in disgust and fear when they realize how young the cuties are theyre little girls one of them scoffs as the tweens jostle and preen desperate to prove otherwise as amy more fully enters the world of womanhood cuties takes on a more mystical aspect one thats not always earned and never fits inside the very real space doucouré carved out for her characters its an uneasy merging of the grounded and the outthere thats never fully realized and always distracting that doucouré ends her film with a onetwo punch of tooobvious symbolism and the films most fantastic sequence is without spoiling the details a tremendous letdown the eventual consequences amy must face are believable built around a comingofage trope of suddenly being forced to reckon with her two lives on the same day however doucouré muddies them with magical realism that does little to advance the storyline or amys evolving character although doucouré steeps cuties in emotion and experience she abandons its grace to make crazier gestures cuties doesnt need sudden splotches of blood or a twist that turns amy into at best a young criminal growing up is hard enough and cuties knows that  until it doesnt by providing your information you agree to our terms of use

Jan 24 2020,negative, elevenyearold senegalese immigrant amy fathia youssouf reckons there are two ways to be a woman amy could mimic her mom maïmouna gueye a dutiful drudge with three kids and a husband whos just announced hes bringing home a second wife or she could copy the cuties a quartet of brazen girls who wear tube tops to class screech freedom in the hallways and rehearse their dance crew after school either way the newintown 6th grader is ready to select a lane and speed toward maturity to writerdirector maïmouna doucouré the choice is simple her comingofage drama starts with amy doodling stick figures and climaxes with the kid bootyshaking in hot pants the choice is also false but doucouré believes that todays girls see their options in black and white cuties job is to coil the contrasting messages and spin them until her lead falls down dizzy which can make the film feel as subtle as a headache two paragraphs into this review and you dear reader can guess that the big wedding and the big dance competition happen on the same day cuties is an extension of doucourés 2016 césar and sundancewinning short mamans about an 8yearold child furious when her polygamous dad invites his new bride into their parisian apartment the two movies share the same powerful shot of the mother weeping when she thinks shes alone not realizing her daughter is hidden under the bed and staring at her ankles the betrayal  a word amy and her mother never use but the emotion doucouré clearly feels  happened to doucouré herself shes still tapped into her youthful resentment shame and protofeminist fury amy never explains the root of why shes acting out not even when her domineering aunty attempts to disinfect her soul with a muslim spiritual ritual but doucouré remembers aging her lead character three years allows the firsttime feature director to explore the contradictions of being 11 an age just old enough that you want to be older yet so young that older means pretending to be 14 amys worldly new friends dont yet know how much they dont know not only does coumba esther gohourou the loudest flirt mistake a condom for a balloon after she blows it up the other girls panic that shes probably going to die in the movies funniest gag they frantically scrub coumbas mouth with soap to be 11 means attempting to simultaneously prove youre a kid and a grownup and failing at both when the gang sneaks into a lasertag playroom they try to intimidate the security guard by accusing him of pedophilia and cap off their attack with the dizzying threat were children well call our lawyers ironically the movie could use more consequences amy tiptoes around her home like her auntys temper is made of lava yet when she screws up say by letting angelica the cuties ringleader kick open her second mothers bedroom door and jump on the tacky rosette blanket amy cowers in fear  and nothing bad ever happens theres a few too many fakeouts to invest in the films stakes even as amys antics get increasingly egregious the problem might be that doucouré is too aware that an 11yearold has no sense of perspective a bungled video chat with a cute boy is given more emotional weight than nearmanslaughter still amys most corrosive influence isnt angelica who irons her hair in the laundry room and rules over the girls with a glittered fist its a smartphone amy steals that allows her to watch stripper videos underneath her headscarf during afternoon prayers shes too naive to know that slapping asses isnt just adult its adult later she poaches the moves for the cuties big show setting up a performance that outdoes little miss sunshine in sexualized awkward audacity doucouré would rather get gasps than laughs newcomer youssouf has an anchoring presence occasionally doucouré lets her light up the screen with a smile and at the directors most expressionistic the girl floats yann maritauds cinematography is rich with jewel tones especially in a blue and red beaded dress made for amy to wear to her fathers wedding in cuties most poetic shot a gust of wind blows into the closet and the gowns chest heaves as though its been aching for an obedient little girl to give it life its in those moments that doucouré offers a glimpse of the director she might become when she trusts audiences to understand her themes without heavy underlining till then the image that lingers is amy gyrating as her aunty exorcises her with splashes of cold water the flailing girl looks like shes suffering  and she also looks like shes twerking shes acting the sinner and shes practicing her sin her two frauds have converged
Jan 24 2020,positive, a perfect illustration of growing up today french director maïmouna doucourés spirited debut cuties assesses the transition from childhood to adolescence by pointing its lens at an 11yearold girl at the crossroads of tradition and personal discovery its the type of first feature that heralds an indelible directorial voice echoes of céline sciammas girlhood mati diops atlantics or nijla mumins jinn are strident but the age gap separating the teens in those efforts and the young lead here strongly distinguishes this new film from its forebears although not breaking untraveled ground cuties is a necessary new entry among these idiosyncratic narratives centered on black girlhood going against the grain of the status quo and no less noteworthy for that exposed to loads of instantly reachable information both detrimental and advantageous kids raised on online gratification inevitably mature at a faster rate or so at first glance seems to be the case of aminata diop fathia youssouf  amy for short  the daughter of senegalese immigrants in the marginalized suburbs of modernday paris her traditional muslim upbringing imposes genderbased restrictions which amy begins to reject when the allure of rebelliousness and camaraderie presents itself in the form of four ethnically diverse schoolmates who call themselves cuties and are also a competitive dance crew maïmouna emboldens these tweens with a rowdiness and even raunchiness that has too often been reserved for boys on screen theres a refreshing impetus to not only their choreography but also their authoritydefying attitude and amy accustomed to strict boundaries becomes obsessively enthralled to get a taste of that unknown freedom in angelica a vivacious médina el aidiazouni the daughter of latin american immigrants  at this tender age she has already internalized that shes failed to satisfy her parents expectations  amy finds her closest friend and an entry point into the cuties at that age one cant fathom parting with the valuable lifeline of a contemporarys validation of ones personality but in amys case her search for acceptance comes in reaction to the powerlessness to which shes witnessed her mother mariam maïmouna gueye be subjected as their belief system permits her father has taken a second wife leaving her mother to save face and partake in the wedding preparations while drowning in humiliation and hurt to manifest amys understanding of womanhood in the context of her familys background maïmouna employs heartrending poignancy and nuanced humor a tragically beautiful early scene sees amy hiding under a bed hearing her mother wail and sharing in her pain and a later one dealing with insecurity about her appearance shows her observing womens voluptuous bodies  comparing herself but also reassured that maybe she will one day look like them other beats like her first period are expected but irreproachably honest bombarded with hypersexualized imagery in audiovisual content amy envisions a dance routine featuring grinding and twerking thats sure to be deemed inappropriate but that in her mind will put to rest the notion that she and her friends are children such desire to attain the agency that comes with adulthood is not new but it has inevitably been precipitated more dangerously because of the internet no other subgenre has been more wildly revolutionized through the proliferation of social media and the digital alter egos weve all built for ourselves than the comingofage film cellphone access the director knows has forever transformed human development and milestones which no longer transpire as they did just a few years ago amy longs to be liked and is unfortunately aware of how visual objectification generates popularity maïmounas confident writing and directing straddle that delicate subject and ensure that cinematographer yann maritaud never shoots the cuties presentations or selfrecorded videos with anything resembling seduction instead highlighting the girls learned exaggeration and their juvenile understanding of what being sexy should look like playfulness and saturated colors defuse the provocative pop songs without judging amy and her girlfriends for being influenced by the digitallydriven world into which they were born youssouf gives a highvoltage performance bursting with quiet angst and volatile dynamism throughout amys desperate plight to fit in and to disconnect from whats occurring at home maïmouna refrains from having the character verbally explode instead her physicality and concrete actions relay her internal unrest similar to what royalty hightower does in anna rose holmers the fits no facile moralist choices are made in cuties as amys risky choices range from theft to considering letting someone die to stay cool theres great merit in maïmounas command of a tonally treacherous story and a principal cast of mostly firsttimers playing true to life gen z girls with complexity not suitable for their counterparts on the disney channel bolstered by an infectiously reckless joie de vivre and artfully handled hardhitting truths cuties diffuses the impulse to dismiss it as just one more example of a trend its final shot is a cinematic chefs kiss that wraps amys innocence in a safe embrace letting us know that thankfully her ability for wonderment hasnt been entirely destroyed
