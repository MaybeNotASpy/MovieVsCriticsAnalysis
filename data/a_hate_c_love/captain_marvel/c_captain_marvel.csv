Apr 4 2024,positive, hello to all of our great insession film fans over the next couple of days i will be giving my daily recaps to my adventures here at film festival part of south by southwest located in the beautiful vibrant and always weird austin tx this is the first time ive ever been to a film festival and the first time covering it for the website to represent insession film before i get into the films i have to thank the great jd duran for recommending me and applying for me to be a part of sxsw and i am forever grateful to him for helping me cross this opportunity off my bucket list now one would think that the first film you would see at sxsw would be something that was on the schedule but the first screenings werent until around 5 pm cst so i had some time to kill so i went to one of the many alamo drafthouses in town and caught the newest film in the marvel cinematic universe captain marvel while i will not give a full review on the film i will say that i had a lot of fun with the film thought brie larson and samuel l jackson were fantastic and had great chemistry plus the film did a solid job of setting up what is to come this summer with avengers endgame so once the screening ended i headed down the paramount theater located in the heart of downtown austin and is the location for most of the big premiers throughout the festival there i got in line for the festival opener and one of the biggest films of the year jordan peeles us after waiting three and a half hours in line i can confirm that mr peele is a new master filmmaker and not just for the horror genre i dont want to get too much into spoilers or talk too much about the plot since the film comes out this week and i want everyone to go into the movie as fresh as possible but i must say that he came to play hard with this film us is a film that has a lot to say and once it was done i knew i needed to see it again the writing and direction that peel presents us in this film is so much more nuanced and unique its like you are watching a director fully come into his own the cast are extraordinary led by a powerhouse performance from lupita nyongo who gives a performance that lives up and dare i say is better then her oscar winning performance for 12 years a slave but the number one this i will never forget about this film was the crowds reaction during and after this film which was ecstatic and eating ever part of this movie up when you are watching a jordan peele movie from now on you will know you are in good hands and thus he has turned into an event director which mean that whatever he does in the future it will be an event that all film lovers must see once us was over i went to the stateside theater next do and caught a film called yes god yes from first time director karen maine whose short story was the inspiration to the 2014 film obvious child yes god yes follows a high school girl named alice natalia dyer is discovering herself sexually while going to a strict catholic high school while the film can play like a conventional high school coming of age story it is elevated by hilarious humor and a lead performance from dyer that is truly special the movie plays like a rift between eight grade and the miseducation of cameron post but done in such a lighter tone this was a great discovery and i hope you all get to check it out soon because i think this could be a real fun discovery for anyone that gives it a shot and with that my day one was complete stay tuned for more coverage here on the website and some full reviews once the festival is done follow me on twitter also to get my instant reactions and more from sxsw
Jul 24 2023,positive, synopsis the story follows carol danvers brie larson as she becomes one of the universes most powerful heroes when earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races set in the 1990s captain marvel is an allnew adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the marvel cinematic universe mcu it was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like carol danvers into the end of phase three not only she comes from nowhere as far as i remember she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before infinity war but its the last movie before the climactic eraending avengers endgame she is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against thanos the bad guy who i dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment so while i was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action i was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from phase one unfortunately thats exactly what i got everything is fine just okay theres no exceptional fight scene but most of it is decent theres no visual wonder but it doesnt look bad the characters potential feels wasted but they work for the plot everything is frustratingly balanced which is something i would praise in a bunch of other movies but this isnt 2008 anymore marvel isnt starting its cinematic universe it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments im going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about goose  sorry captain marvel  jokes aside this is one of the issues i was worried about going into the film theater i escaped 99 of the marketing for this movie as i do with every other flick i didnt watch a single cliptrailer i know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and i kept my expectations realistic having in mind what i truly know about the film and only the film itself the one thing i was not able to hide from was the headlines giving tremendous praise to a cat  now follow me on this im going to watch a superhero origin movie a whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen im excited to know more about her where does she come from what her powers are and so much more some headlines show up on my social media feed and i find that a cat steals the show deserves a spinoff and i dont even know what more granted the cat is indeed funny it provides some chuckles here and there thats it i love cats but i honestly cant figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things maybe its because the rest of the film isnt that entertaining or perhaps just because people really really love cats like the movie itself i think its a mixture of both options back to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about brie larson marvel rarely misses its casting choices and being larson an academyaward winner her talent is undeniable she has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance so im surprised that she couldnt stand out from the films overall blandness i repeat the movie isnt bad at all however i was expecting an actress of brie larsons caliber to elevate at least her own character but shes like everyone else just good enough i dont know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions but the potential is there and im sure the russo brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in endgame the two best attributes of the entire film are without a single doubt the buddycop relationship that carol and nick fury samuel l jackson develop and the groundbreaking deaging cgi storywise the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear carols past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition so its a breath of fresh air to have slj and larson play off of each other nevertheless the deaging technology used is absolutely astounding my fellow readers welcome to the future of filmmaking where any actoractress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing i completely forgot slj is 70yearsold the best visual effectscgi are the ones you dont even know theyre there and captain marvel succeeds in delivering mindblowing realistic younger versions of wellknown actors characterwise anna boden ryan fleck and geneva robertsondworet should have done way better so much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the mcu carol danvers has a great backstory but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact still as captain marvel she is indeed a badass woman there are some cool action sequences especially in the beginning but as the movie slowly progresses on its story the fight scenes got more sloppy choppy and way too dark jude law yonrogg is amazing as he always is and ben mendelsohn is brilliant as talos both characters have interesting subplots that come together well which is not something that can be said for the rest of the marvel villains technically  you guessed it its okay taking away the jawdropping deaging cgi the visuals seem to lack some sort of style looking back at black panther captain america or guardians of the galaxy each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to its own stories captain marvel doesnt really feel like it has its own style i truly feel that with other directors this film could have been way better boden and fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster that said the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movies period there are a couple of moments where the vfx regarding carol danvers powers are spectacular but everything ultimately feels like this is a phase one film instead of the 21st mcu installment all in all captain marvel achieves the minimum requirements introduce the fans to a new superhero who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of thanos carol danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory but the screenplay isnt structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible brie larson delivers a strong performance pushing aside her haters even if i feel that under other directors she would have reached her characters full potential her scenes with samuel l jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie as well as the groundbreaking deaging cgi which is absolutely mindblowing the action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography this is mcus phase three and 2019 so i want to be able to actually see whats happening but the most prominent issue is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin films formula this isnt exactly a flaw or a problem its just that i was expecting more a lot more  in the end theres not a memorable fight scene an emotionally overwhelming moment or even a genuinely bonechilling epic scene it doesnt leave you salivating for avengers endgame but it also doesnt leave you less excited everything is just fine and theres nothing wrong with that but theres also nothing extraordinary
Mar 31 2023,positive, it might not be labeled a vintage year but 2019 delivered some of the biggest and best movies ever made we got emotional about booksmart and marriage story but the year also saw a little film called avengers endgame steamroll the box office and nab the title of highestgrossing movie of all time it was also one of the most expensive movies ever made this christmas star wars the rise of skywalker caps off the space sequel trilogy that began with the force awakens followed by the last jedi also known as the one adam driver forgot the name of the irishman saw unprecedented viewing figures on netflix according to netflix and the brilliant korean comedy parasite reminded us to watch movies outside hollywood if i had to pick the essential movie of the year id probably go for the scathing the report a piece of reallife bigscreen reportage that radiates rage but i can pick what i like and i pick beats i saw brian welshs scotlandset comingofage rave movie at a parent and baby screening it was the first time my wife and i left our house with our 5dayold newborn daughter beats is a heartwarming and hilarious film about friendship and belonging and music which are exactly the kind of values i want to instil in my kid so even in a year when i visited the set of shaun the sheep and bumped into martin scorsese in a bathroom  these were separate events obvs  seeing beats with my beautiful baby daughter remains my favorite movie memory of 2019 hereditary ari asters debut was a movie dialed in to the subconscious horrors of the nuclear family midsommar is disguised as a slasher film set among swedish cultists but its essentially a slowburn drama about the terrors of florence pughs slowly decaying relationship its visceral inventive and  most importantly  savagely honest anyone whos been in a bad relationship or even argued with their partner will recognize the aching realness of midsommars human interactions that combined with the literal acid trip of its final act which delves into horrifying and surprisingly funny lynchian nightmare territory has stayed with me ever since i doubt itll ever leave that final shot of that one character just smiling after sitting through roughly 59 hours of marvel movies over the past decade im exhausted by samesame sequels and popcorn blockbusters tired arcs cliched beats  ive been grinding through a cinematic universe that no longer delights me so looking for something different i took a punt on the farewell and found my film of the year the film follows chineseamerican billi wang awkwafina who is living in new york when she learns her aging grandmother nai nai has been diagnosed with cancer back in china but the diagnosis comes with another blow  the family is hiding the cancer from nai nai in a bid to shield her from grief the movie effortlessly jumps between worlds america and china english slang and mandarin snortoutloud humor and pure pathos it paints such a vivid picture of the interplay and friction between cultures that comes with the immigrant experience thats not an experience i know but as an australian living in america at the time it spoke to me i left the cinema with an exploding heart  i missed my own grandmother i was longing for family my cheeks were sore from laughing and i felt lifted by a story i never expected to find thats the joy of the perfect film the second installment in    disney s frozen juggernaut proves that animated movies  and sequels  can still make bestof lists frozen 2 felt like the story disney actually wanted to tell with anna and elsa it was so strong and compelling that it made the first frozen feel like a prequel that existed to set up the second movie frozen 2 has a seriously talented cast the infamous samantha joke was even an improv by josh gad who voices olaf with the voices of kristen bell as anna idina menzel as elsa jonathan groff as kristoff and evan rachel wood as queen iduna we also get amazing songs like into the unknown some things never change show yourself and of course lost in the woods theyre easily on par with let it go do you want to build a snowman and for the first time in forever to me booksmart is the definitive comingofage movie its hilarious charming and real kaitlyn dever and beanie feldstein are absolute powerhouses and you can just feel their love and friendship through the screen and it makes your heart feel warm every cringey moment and situation is relatable without feeling forced billie lourd ascends to legendary levels with her bewildering gigi director olivia wilde allows each superawesome cast member to shine in their own weird way and it just works i think letterboxd member jay said it perfectly olivia didnt have to wilde out this hard but she did she did that for us and i am thankful parasite will move you like nothing else the latest feature from korean filmmaker bong joon ho snowpiercer okja starts almost as a con movie allows you some laughs portrays an unconventional family you want to spend more time with takes a quick detour toward horror and ends up being a drama that delivers barbed commentary on class it gives us a glimpse of how privilege and background can shape who we are or what were capable of this is a film thats best enjoyed if you dont know much about its plot its a story that will stay with you for days and days and its pretty much a given that parasite will win the oscar for best foreign language film if only it could win the biggest prize of the night too there arent many movies that can inspire me to get off the couch and train for a 5kilometer run but brittany runs a marathon isnt a typical movie its the story of a 28yearold woman who parties hard makes bad choices with men has bad eating habits and pretty much drifts through her life in new york without a game plan until one day amid an attempt to score a prescription for adderall she gets a wakeup call about her health after reluctantly trying running for the first time she eventually grows in confidence that leads to a better outlook on life a better job and better fitting clothes but this isnt a romcom about losing weight and falling in love with the first guy who notices you brittany finds that dropping pounds is a lot easier than dropping her insecurities and selfloathing for anyone who has suffered through endless fad diets with zero results  this movie will change your life for the better theres a lot to like about a superhero flick that features a powerful selfsufficient smart courageous woman  especially since until recently thank you wonder woman there were too few of them to even talk about captain marvel does its part to showcase the challenges that carol danvers a fearless selfsufficient courageous navy pilot has to deal with as a woman she shares those challenges with her best friend and fellow pilot maria rambeau which means the movie handily passes the bechdel test but captain marvel isnt one of my 2019 favorite films just because it gets girls and women right showing you can be strong and emotional and still kick butt its because captain marvel is a great story we get wellthoughtout characters played by an engaging cast fun action scenes set to a cool 90s soundtrack and a sense of humor captain marvel is a fearless selfsufficient and courageous fighting for whats right thats the stuff that superheroes are made of and how great that in 2019 shes a woman ready or not isnt the best movie of the year but its the most enjoyable horror of the year midsommar is stunning but definitely not enjoyable thats because its a perfect 95minute bundle of black comedy and thriller contained in a big stooping manor the setup is simple grace marries into a family thats rich and privileged and naturally superweird they have a ritual for newbies you have to play a game and in this case its hide and seek with hunting weapons its the literal wedding from hell a vein of social commentary on class and marriage runs through the catandmouse hunt before building to a cathartic ending extreme coolness exudes from grace in her ripped dress converse shoes and big rude sash of bullets just dont watch this if youre about to get married the lighthouse is an absurd comedy its a slow anguished descent into madness its the result of andrew wyeth dropping acid reading lovecraft and spending too much time on a maine coastline its a film that lingers in the corner of your mind as you find yourself wondering how the hell they shot certain parts replaying monologues and drunken arguments in your head resurfacing shots that perfectly pair the repulsive and beautiful it doesnt invite you to its world or ask to accurately reflect ours it reaches out from the depths grabs you by the neck and drags you down to its lair whether you enjoyed the film or not youll always remember it fart fart fart the lighthouse was filmed in a square aspect ratio its the perfect prison for two men as they watch over a new england lighthouse fart when you confine two people in a small space theres not a lot of room for secrets lust fights hallucinations kinship or farts and even though the film is blackandwhite the men are hundreds of shades of gray and salt over time such confinement can make any sane man question reality yeah you could go outside but youll be cold and wet and before you go up top just remember that the light is mine hang on am i going mad watching the movie are the characters and why is there so much farting ill just have another sip of this turpentine wine and relax fart i didnt see a lot of movies in 2019 too much great tv dammit but im so glad i managed to catch this in a theater danny boyles little slice of fantasy is the kind of movie that rarely gets made anymore yesterday is wholly original and utterly charming bolstered by music thats woven into our collective dna its funny romantic thoughtprovoking and ultimately just one of the most satisfying movies in years and without spoiling anything ill just say theres a late moment that caught me totally off guard and left me wrecked note to superherosoaked hollywood more like this please quentin tarantinos journey from directing fasttalking crime flicks to subversive genre pics to historyrewriting revenge porn has had its ups and downs but once upon a time represents the apotheosis of the filmmakers late phase rather than simply rewriting history for the sake of some pseudocathartic climax shooting hitler or killing a plantationowner tarantino stays with the central characters after the bad guys have been offed and shows the very real people  full of dreams hope and love  that might have been spared had history taken an alternative route the end feels mournful but it also shows the power of film not just to enact bloody justice but also to save if only for a moment those who have been lost to great injustice it was the first movie ever from the director to move me to tears clare a young irish convict chases a british officer through the rugged tasmanian wilderness she is bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence the man committed against her family to aid her search clare enlists the services of an aboriginal tracker named billy who is marked by trauma from his own violencefilled past at the hands of british colonialism there are moments of loss and redemption of anger and anguish i found myself yelling at the screen crying with the characters and smiling during their rare moments of joy the nightingale beautifully illustrates the spectrum of humanity and what human beings are truly capable of  the atrocities we commit as well as the indefinite well of strength we never knew we could muster the cinematography the dialogue and the performances of the actors highlight those innumerable events in history which should never be forgotten nor forgiven from the opening frame the last black man in san francisco drops you right into its world and keeps you there simply because you want to watch the characters whose rich inner lives unfold with a gentle and masterful ease the drama touches on serious themes ranging from gentrification to environmental racism interspersed with absurdist comedy  every frame is beautiful the music is beautiful the acting is beautiful the camerawork is beautiful its perfectly crafted top to bottom inside and out  i cant recommend it enough when a bestselling author of detective novels is found dead the morning after his birthday youre left wondering if a tale is too onthenose for its own good knives out flips the whodunnit tropes of whimsical murder mysteries fans of clue and murder on the orient express please raise your hands by giving you more details up front than you might expect it subsequently leaves you guessing for the remainder of the film just how all the pieces fit together and possibly resemble a coherent picture pair that with the fantastic jamie lee curtis don johnson and chris evans trying desperately to hang on to their family fortune and youre in for an intense and hilarious series of events youll be hooked from the moment the accused tries to awkwardly cover their tracks but youll stay for daniel craig leaning so far into his incredible southern accent that youre not sure whether youre watching a movie or are in fact inside the hole that is this mysterys donut within a donut within a donut i havent been through a divorce myself but im even more motivated to be a better husband after watching marriage story noah baumbach has made some excellent films squid and the whale the meyerowitz stories but marriage story might be my new favorite of his its clearly an actors film as adam driver and scarlett johansson deliver oscarworthy performances in a film with almost no plot what i like most about marriage story is how grounded the story feels unlike other films tackling the subject of divorce both characters in marriage story are equally likable not only that the characters clearly like each other making the process theyre struggling through even harder to watch i couldnt find myself rooting for one over the other as both characters are as flawed as they are charming marriage story feels like the most honest insight into the divorce process ive ever seen on film but its also one of the most realistic portrayals of two characters falling out of love if the return of the king can receive all the praise as a culmination of an epic trilogy then so should avengers endgame the feat alone of taking 22 films and piecing them together in a perfectly produced climatic event is simply staggering to think of endgame came up with an ingenious plot to revisit past movies and show how far the    mcu  has come while also creating this oceans eleventype heist to save earth for all the criticism some give to comic book movies for not taking risk just think of the risk that was taken in 2008 with iron man  a movie about a barely known superhero starring a supposedly washedup actor to see marvels cinematic universe start there and last for more than a decade is mindboggling
Mar 8 2023,positive, synopsis carol danvers becomes one of the universes most powerful heroes when earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races captain marvel is the origin story of carol danvers brie larson or vers pronounced veers a member of the kree starforce with no memory of her past and some interesting super powers her team of warriorheroes is tasked with ridding the galaxy of the terrorist shapeshifting skrulls and their leader talos ben mendelsohn during one of their missions she is separated from her team ends up on earth and begins to learn more about herself and her powers the film also reintroduces us to known mcu characters like ronin the destroyer lee pace and one of his future henchmen korath djimon hounsou from the first guardians of the galaxy movie we also get to see a younger nick fury samuel l jackson and newish shield i am so happy with the casting of brie larson she met all my expectations sadly im not too familiar with her prior work so i wasnt entirely sure what to expect i will remedy that shorty larson expertly portrayed the carol danvers im familiar with from the comics she was snarky and tough and a perfect counterpart to nick fury they had some awesome buddy cop  men in black vibes going on her characters growth throughout the film was relatable and fun to watch i loved all the little details brie larson put into the character the film has a message of embracing who you are and perseverance get back up dont give up even if everyone is telling you to i think its an excellent girl power movie while also being a good superhero movie its not an inyourface feminism just for girls film i think anyone can enjoy it the supporting cast was also great especially samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn ive decided im a ben mendelsohn fan for life and have to go out and watch everything hes ever been in or will be in i also liked jude law as kree commander yonrogg and lashana lynch as awesome pilot and danvers bff maria rambeau i think everyone will agree that the true star of this film is goose an adorable orange cat she yes goose is female in the movie and in the comics manages to share the screen with brie larson and samuel l jackson and still stand out the movie also has lots of fun things to try and spot its filled with 90s nostalgia and takes place sometime between the release of true lies and the smashing pumpkins mellon collie and the infinite sadness there are also comic book references sprinkled throughout the movie there are two huge but subtle hints at another awesome female character potentially making an appearance in future mcu films another positive for me was the music the score was appropriately epic and the use of cleverly timed 90s tracks was fun and also added something extra to the film especially the action sequences it made me think of all my favorite action movies from the 90s but with much better special effects im a fan of the mcu and the comics so i did not want to be disappointed by marvels first female led film i had a few questions and expectations going into this movie is this going to be a good standalone film or will the viewer need 10 years of mcu backstory to understand whats going on will captain marvel give us hope or any clue into what is going to happen in avengers endgame does it live up to the comics thankfully it answered most of my questions and fulfilled my expectations first the film 100 stands on its own you dont really need any prior mcu knowledge to enjoy it it obviously helps and there are inside jokes and things to look for but its not required it doesnt give us any clues as to whats going to happen in avengers endgame but seeing captain marvels powers onscreen definitely has me excited and even more impatient to see how things with the avengers pan out i did have a few complaints there are some continuity issues this film creates within the mcu one in particular a certain valuable object makes an appearance is perhaps unnecessary and im not sure why they did it other than to bring in an element fans were familiar with the kree were also confusing and i dont think they explained their lifestyle or society very well the beginning of the film is jumpy and its hard to follow whats going on and whos who it does get better when fury shows up none of these things were bad enough to make me dislike the movie i also saw this at an alamo drafthouse theater they show short relevant clips and movies in the 20 minutes before a movie starts for this film they used that time to explain the history and many variations of marvell ms marvel captain marvel and shazam i think that was beneficial especially if you havent read any comics to wrap up i loved captain marvel it gave me almost everything i wanted and introduced us to an amazing new character it was fun and inspiring and gave me lots of fuzzy 90s nostalgic feelings i cant wait to see her in avengers endgame later this year if you do see this in the theater make sure to stay until the very end of the credits
Jan 21 2023,positive, one of the most prominent gifs from the captain marvel trailer features carol getting up over and over again through the years fist clenched knocked down but not staying there pushing up against the weight of everything and everyone trying to keep her down  captain marvel had a lot stacked up against it before its release and honestly the character of carol danvers has had a lot stacked up against it since she took on the mantle in 2012 just like with wonder woman captain marvel is expected to be the pinnacle of feminism and appeal to every woman or she is not doing her job right the movie is expected to wildly succeed because performing on par with other origin movies will be deemed a failure its expected to prove that 10 years into disneys marvel cinematic universe a female superhero deserves to star in her own movie to be progressive despite being late to be diverse and inclusive but not too in your face about the messaging to change the minds of those who go in looking for reasons to hate the movie on principle odds are stacked up designed to make sure everyone is extra conscious of every reaction dont want to be seen as hyping up too much just because its a woman front and center dont want to criticize too hard and give ammo to those who see inclusion as a threat with all of that going on it can be hard to let go and evaluate captain marvel on its own merit to remember that its ok to both want something to succeed and be critical of it theres no mistaking it captain marvel is very much an origin story set deep into the layers of movies that make up the mcu writer and director duo anna boden and ryan fleck reportedly had a lot of free reign to introduce carol brie larson but her story is inextricably linked to setting up her appearance in avengers endgame by nature origin stories tend to be formulaic and a little messy the best ones happen when the character has already been introduced elsewhere so theres less to establish in the limited time given to introduce the character have them struggle experience a betrayal learn who they are without their powers and ultimately triumph its a story all genre fans know and captain marvel doesnt deviate far from it in this case we see our hero the alien planet hala home of the kree she doesnt know who she is and would rather fight than dwell on that part of an elite team starforce under the command of yonrogg jude law and known only as vers all she wants to do is kick some skrull butt as the kreeskrull war wages on captured on a mission and learning that in her memories lies something the skrull want vers ends up on earth circa 1995 on a journey to the past anastasiastyle she meets new and old friends and learns who she can trust and remembers that at her core powers or no she gets up again as always the key to getting through origin stories is the characters and captain marvel has no problems there brie larson is an absolute force her carol is messy emotional fierce and determined she connects with just about every character unfortunately gemma chans underutilized minnerva isnt a fan of carols but she cant win them all she is very much the total disaster she is in the comics come to life  too often womenled movies mean one woman surrounded by a bunch of men but here lashana lynch slays as carols fellow pilot and childhood best friend maria rambeau she is her equal in every way that doesnt involve firing photon blasts from her hands rambeau stands strong with the not quite yet legendary captain marvel and nick fury for whom this is also a sort of origin story for the computerized deaging of samuel l jackson sure is something and the banter between the young fury and the amnesiac carol is delightful the two real scene stealers though are akira akbar as monica rambeau carols longtime friend in the comics and marias daughter in the movie and goose the sort of cat  the back and forth between space and 1995 earth invokes a lot of 90s scifi nostalgia and the soundtrack is another star on its own it is as integral to the movie as that of guardians of the galaxy soundtrack to its own movie there are a lot of moving parts to the plot that dont quite all slot together seamlessly and the amnesia storyline hampers some emotional moments luckily the fun and charm of the characters and excitement of the setting make it so thats not as big a deal as it would be with a less engaging cast at least while watching the movie itself because that moment in all origin stories that makes it all worth it the one where the hero has their big realization and fully embraces themselves that moment where we see captain marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly that moment captain marvel absolutely delivers there are a lot of moving parts to the plot that dont quite all slot together seamlessly and the amnesia storyline hampers some emotional moments luckily the fun and charm of the characters

Dec 7 2022,positive, based on the international bestseller by neil gaiman american gods is an epic battle between the old gods and the new gods led by odin traveling incognito as mr wednesday and played by the rakish ian mcshane the old gods have migrated to america from around the world led by mr world a chilling crispin glover the new gods reflect modern societys obsession with money technology and mass media  when season one of american gods premiered on starz last year lgbt viewers were delightfully surprised to find an intimate and tender gay love story in the middle of episode three newcomers can find it on youtube the hapless salesman salim omid abtahi gets in a cab driven by the jinn mousa kraish and the two are instantly attracted to each other the sizzling sex scene

season one will be pleased to know that the second season maintains the high production standards and rather trippy sensibility of the first season the colorsaturated cinematography and design are dazzling and sometimes wonderfully lurid the pacing is rather deliberate the show is still only partway through gaimans book but gaiman has been closely involved in the adaptation and alterations of his original story and the dialogue is frequently loopy but the actors and directors all know how to make the most of every moment captain marvel ranked as the most highly anticipated release of 2019 zooms into theaters today its the 21st film in the marvel cinematic universe mcu but only the first to star a female character even though it doesnt get everything right the movie is a fun and fresh take on the superhero genre its amazing what happens when women and people of color take center stage set in 1995 and loaded with wonderful pop culture references the movie is both an origin story and a mystery written and directed by anna boden and ryan fleck with geneva robinsondworet also receiving screenplay credit the movie opens with vers the excellent brie larson training to be a kree warrior shes haunted by dreams of her past but is fully committed to helping the highly regimented kree in their galactic battle against the shapeshifting skrull vers ends up on planet c23 aka earth and slowly starts gathering clues about her real identity air force pilot carol danvers and learning how to harness her superpowers to become captain marvel in a neat twist she becomes a true superhero by embracing her human emotions the movie is strongest freshest and most interesting when it focuses on the mystery of vers identity and her evolving relationships with the other characters those moments look great and crackle with both humor and emotion unfortunately some of the outer space sequences look and feel like theyve been phoned in brie larson who won an oscar for her powerful performance in room is a wonderful addition to the superhero pantheon she brings a fierce determination aching vulnerability and sly sense of humor to the character and its great fun to cheer her on larson is surrounded by a great supporting cast she has a lively rapport samuel l jackson agent nick fury and their banter is wonderful to maintain continuity with presentday marvel outings both jackson and clark gregg are digitally deaged by twentyfive years and the results are incredible their digital transformation is seamless annette bening finally gets a role worthy of her stellar talents the supreme intelligence like frank morgan in the wizard of oz she plays several characters and appears in different guises to different people shes stunning and badass and the key to unraveling the fascinating twists and turns and shifting alliances of the unfolding story  there are also fine performances by lashana lynch as danvers best friend maria rambeau rambo  get it jude law as kree commander yonrogg and ben mendelsohn as skrull warrior talos and various humans but they are all upstaged by a captivating cat named goose one of many top gun references both american gods and captain marvel are fun reconsiderations of ancient myths and modern mythologies they raise interesting questions about power belief gender and sexuality and history and the power of storytelling but both take themselves lightly theyre great popcorn fodder but theyll leave you with something to think about after the credits roll by the way make sure you stay for the credits of captain marvel the fun doesnt stop until after the last digital technician is acknowledged  it might come as a shock to some comic book fans but the idea of super heroes and super villains has always been very queer think about it the dramatic skintight costumes the dual identities and secret lives the inability to fit in or connect because you are distanced from the normal world by your powers   all the standard tropes that define this genre of pop culture mythmaking are so rich with obviously queercoded subtext that it seems ludicrous to think anyone could miss it this is not to claim that all superhero stories are really parables about being queer but if were being honest some of them feel more like it than others an obvious example is batman whose domestic life with a teenage boy as his ward and close companion has been raising eyebrows since 1940 the campy 1960s tv series did nothing to distance the character from such associations  probably the opposite in fact  and warner brothers popular 80s90s series of film adaptations with gay filmmaker joel schumachers muchmaligned batman and robin starring george clooney and chris odonnell in costumes that highlighted their nipples which is arguably still the queerest superhero movie ever made or at least it was that title might now have to be transferred to the peoples joker which  as it emphatically and repeatedly reminds us  is a parody in no way affiliated with dcs iconic batman franchise or any of its characters even though writer director and star vera drew begins it with a dedication to mom and joel schumacher parody it may be but that doesnt keep it from also serving up lots of food for serious thought to chew on between the laughs set in a sort of comicsinspired dystopian metaamerica where unsanctioned comedy is illegal its the story of a young closeted transgender comic drew who leaves her small town home to travel to gotham city and audition for gcb  the official governmentproduced sketch comedy show unfortunately shes not a very good comic and after a rocky start she decides to leave to form a new comedy troupe labeled anticomedy to skirt legality issues along with penguinish new friend oswald cobblepot nathan faustyn they collect an assortment of misfit wouldbe comedians to join them and after branding herself as joker the harlequin our protagonist starts to find her groove  but it will take negotiating a relationship with trans bad boy mr j kane distler a confrontation with her selfabsorbed and transphobic mother lynn downey and making a choice between playing by the rules or breaking them before she can fully transition into the militant comic activist she was always meant to be told as a wildly whimsical mixed media narrative that combines live action with a quirky cgi production design and  multiple styles of animation with different animators for each sequence peoples joker is by no means the kind of bigbudget blockbuster we expect from a superhero  or in this case supervillain  film but it should be obvious from the synopsis above thats not what drew was going for anyway instead the emmynominated former editor uses her loopy vision of an alternative batman universe as the medium for a kind of mythologized autobiography expressing her own reallife journey both toward embracing her trans identity and forging a maverick career path in an industry discourages nonconformity while also spoofing the absurdities of modern culture subverting familiar tropes yet skillfully weaving together multiple threads from the real dc universe shes appropriated with the detailed savvy of a diehard fangirl its an accomplishment likely to impress her fellow comic book fans  even if they cant quite get behind the gender politics or her presentation ot batman himself or rather an animated version voiced by phil braun as a closeted gay rightwing demagogue and serial sexual abuser these elements of course are meant to be deliberately provocative drew like her screen alter ego is a confrontation comedian at heart bent on shaking up the dominant paradigm at every opportunity yet although she takes aim at the expected targets  the patriarchy toxic masculinity corporate hypocrisy etc  she is equally adept at scoring hits against things like draconian ideals of political correctness and weaponized cancel culture which are deployed with no quarter from idealogues on both sides of the political divide this means she might be risking the alienation of an audience which might otherwise be fully in her corner  but it also provides the ring of unbiased personal truth that keeps the movie from sliding into propaganda and elevates it like barbie to the level of absurdist allegory because ultimately of course the point of peoples joker has little to do with the politics and social constructs it skewers along the way at its core its all about the real human things that resonate with all of us regardless of gender sexuality ideology or even political parties the need to feel loved to feel supported and most of all to be fully actualized that means the real heart of the film beats in the central thread of her troubled connection between mother and daughter superbly rendered in both drew and downeys performances and its there that joker is finally able to break free of her own selfimposed restrictions and simply be who she is other performances deserve mention too such as faustyns weirdly lovable penguin standin and outsider multihyphenate david leibe hart as ras al ghul  a seminal batman villain here reimagined as a veteran comic that serves as a kind of obiwan kenobi figure in jokers quest in the end though its drews show from top to bottom a showcase for not only her acting skills which are enhanced by the obvious intelligence including the emotional kind she brings to the table but her considerable talents as a writer director and editor for some viewers admittedly the lowbudget vibe of this crowdfunded film might create an obstacle to appreciating the cleverness and artistic vision behind it though drew leans into the limitations to find remarkably creative ways to convey what she wants with the means she has at her disposal others obviously will have bigger problems with it than that indeed the film which debuted at the 2022 toronto international film festival was withdrawn from competition there and pulled from additional festival screenings after alleged corporate bullying presumably from warner brothers which owns the film rights to the batman franchise pressured drew into pulling it back clearly concern over blowback from conservative fans  who would likely never see the film anyway  was enough to warrant strong arm techniques from nervous execs nevertheless the peoples joker made its first american appearance at las outfest in 2023 and is now receiving a rollout theatrical release that started on april 5 in new york and continues this week in los angeles with washington dc and other cities to follow on april 12 and beyond if youre in one of the places where it plays we say its more than worth making the effort if youre not never fear a vodstreaming release is sure to come soon  theres something about an antihero that appeals to us all why else would so many of our greatest stories revolve around a character whose behavior goes against everything weve been raised to believe is right actually that question probably answers itself for many of us the things we are raised to accept about life in the human world often feel less acceptable once weve gone through a few years of adult experience which tends to put us at odds with the socalled norms of conformity naturally this can be frustrating from time to time  and while that might not be enough to make us go rogue without regard law or ethics its certainly sufficient to fuel our guilty fantasies that along with the literary skills of patricia highsmith the queer novelist who created him is why the character of tom ripley has been engrossing us in various forms for nearly 75 years the eponymous antihero of the talented mr ripley originally published in 1955 went on to feature in three additional books by highsmith and was subsequently brought to life in multiple smallandbigscreen incarnations perhaps most prominently by matt damon in anthony minghellas 1999 film adaptation these versions managed to skirt the books obvious queer subtext but queer audiences recognized it anyway now thanks to creator writer and director steve zaillian highsmiths starryeyed sociopath has returned in an eightepisode series  which pares the title down to the shortbutevocative ripley  that debuts on netflix april 4 and portrays his adventures with an eye toward honoring highsmiths intent while delivering the kind of upfront queerness that the author could never have dreamed of accomplishing in her heyday not that this ripley is exactly out and proud though the actor who plays him  andrew scott all of us strangers  certainly is the acclaimed irish thespian brings his own queerness to the table in illuminating a character whose survival depends on never calling attention to himself  and though the series moves the action ahead a few years to1960 its still a world where any hint of deviance is likely to draw suspicion thats the last thing tom ripley needs hes a con artist the mid20thcentury equivalent of modernday phishing scammers grifting gullible marks from his squalid oneroom new york city apartment hes good at what he does an anonymous figure hiding in a sea of strangers  but when a wealthy shipping magnate tracks him down with a request for help and the offer of an allexpensespaid excursion to italy he sees it as an opportunity to change his life for the better that opportunity as it turns out involves a barely remembered college acquaintance named dickie johnny flynn whose postgraduation trip to europe has become a yearslong vacation on the mediterranean coast from which his father  ripleys surprise benefactor  would like him to return sent on a mission to convince his old schoolmate to go home he is instead spellbound by the idyllic seaside setting and opulent lifestyle that surrounds him  and also by dickie himself he ingratiates himself into the young mans life winning his sympathies despite some initial awkwardness not so easily persuaded is dickies girlfriend marge dakota fanning whose lingering distrust must be overcome if ripley is to enact his new master plan to claim dickies life of expatriate luxury as his own thanks to its sources relative familiarity ripley makes no effort to hide the fact that its antihero is a shady guy we see from the start that hes a liar and an opportunist what zaillian manages to do unlike others who have adapted the novel is move past a clinical focus on ripleys psychology to give us a less prosaic  and therefore more complex  interpretation of the character much of this comes from a script that echoes highsmiths hardboiled style by framing the story and its protagonist in a shadowy amoral universe enhanced by the stylish blackandwhite treatment delivered by robert elswits cinematography which leans into both the paradigmchallenging euro art cinema from the period of its setting and the gritty chiaroscuro contrasts of film noir setting up an instinctual understanding that this narrative like its visuals is composed entirely in shades of gray in the shows engrossing first episode this is a particularly effective hook style coupling with context to underscore the bleakness of ripleys daily routine in new york which is no less soulcrushing perhaps than the more lawful ones into which most of us are locked though we see that hes a predator its hard not to relate to his struggle and by the time we get to the next chapter and meet dickie and marge weve already entered a mindset in which easy ethical judgments become unconvincing and shallow our sympathies are effectively split were either on nobodys side or on everyones and maybe its a little bit of both needless to say perhaps this tricky transference would not be possible without the presence of a consummate actor in the title role and scott fits the bill beyond expectation though at first he reads as a bit old for the character that notion quickly disperses  indeed his weathered features bespeak the effects of a hardknock life the kind that makes a person willing to do anything to break free more crucially the unmistakable authenticity of his inner life is communicated with exquisite precision engaging our empathy even as we recoil from the machiavellian logic that guides him and the clear conflict between his notsohidden feelings for dickie and the agenda to which he has committed is made all the more stark by the ring of queer truth that underpins the performance its a tourdeforce turn by an actor whose skills become more breathtaking with each subsequent role fanning whose equally adept performance provides a powerful counterpoint to scotts is a strong contender for our sympathies by virtue as much of the intelligence she brings as the peril into which it will eventually put her and flynns dickie wears the weight and damage of his upper class status like a chain he can never quite break making us dread the seemingly inevitable fate that awaits him even as we subliminally sign on to ripleys endgame with a sense of guilty but unapologetic satisfaction also notable is nonbinary actor eliot summers child of former police frontman sting who brings another level of queer identity into the narrative as another old acquaintance of dickies that throws an unwelcome wrench into the works of ripleys plan based on its first two episodes ripley certainly lives up to the anticipation that naturally awaits any adaptation of a highprofile story and reasserts the queerness of an author who boldly pushed boundaries as far as censors of her time would allow thats more than enough to warrant staying with it until the end  and if audience numbers warrant a renewal through additional installments that might chronicle the less wellknown escapades spun in highsmiths sequels what cinches the deal though is the masterful performance that takes centerstage which represents yet another escalation  and welldeserved triumph  in the rise of the talented mr scott not only that but a surprising number of these movies  more accurately described as neonoir to distinguish them from the formative blackandwhite classics in this murkiest of all genres  are also very queer weve seen ethan coens tarantinoesque darkly comic lesbian road trip driveaway dolls and the uk drag queen revenge drama femme now from sophomore director rose glass saint maud comes love lies bleeding which might be queerest of the bunch so far it might be the noirest too though there are a lot of vagaries around the characteristics that are required for applying that label one of the most essential qualities is surely a morally ambiguous story and morality cant get much more ambiguous than it is in this retronostalgic throwback tale set on the fringes of the albuquerque underworld of 1989 thats where lou kristen stewart has been for her entire life and where she continues to stay  working as the manager of a rundown gym  out of protective loyalty to her sister beth jena malone despite a longtime estrangement from her father ed harris and a desire to distance herself from the shadowy family business that he runs  reclusive and guarded she mostly avoids social interaction  until an aspiring bodybuilder named jackie katy obrian hitchhikes into town on her way to a championship competition in las vegas and in need of a place to crash theres an instant spark between them which quickly leads to flaming passion unfortunately it also leads to an incident of explosive violence which puts both of them not only into the crosshairs of lous ruthless and powerful dad but those of the law as well theres no need to say more than that in terms of synopsis in fact it would be unfair to the film which unfolds with an exquisitely slow burn before igniting into a climactic powder keg as satisfying as it is gripping because so much of the thrill comes from the feeling of uneasy expectation it delivers through its gradual revelation of details even without knowing more however its clear that theres a lot going on in love lies bleeding that doesnt quite line up with the comforting ethics of a blackandwhite worldview  and that of course is what gives it the kind of unpredictable edge that makes it both a tautly engrossing thriller and a deliciously subversive saga of queer and feminine empowerment this latter quality is something it shares with movies like bound  the 1996 debut feature by the wachowskis which pushed mainstream acceptance by presenting its lesbian protagonists in a realistic manner and refusing to frame them in the thenusual trope of queer victimhood  and elevates to a refreshingly contemporary tone while still reveling in homage to the stylistic flourishes of their era  indeed glass peppers her film with echoes from dozens from the past that so clearly provided inspiration in both its visuals and its themes from the twisted duplicity of clouzots les diaboliques to the chaotic irony of the coens blood simple from the slickbutgritty nihilism of william friedkin to the disquieting body horror of david cronenberg and the transcendental surrealism of david lynch love lies bleeding borrows liberally and unapologetically from an array of cinematic touchstones almost as exhaustive as the one employed by greta gerwig in barbie  and like gerwig manages to incorporate them all in a sort of metasphere that allows our recognition of them to enhance and inform her own piece far from coming off as derivative the effect is something akin to a mashup of iconic eighties and nineties films and genres that uses their easy familiarity to both pay open tribute and tickle our nostalgic fancy even as they are deployed as the building blocks for something with a singular identity of its own if you think that all sounds a little campy youre not wrong theres a definite element of tongueincheek self awareness that permeates it and a deliberate will toward underscoring the grimness of its outward scenario with the sly satire of its subtext that after all is something else it shares in common with many of the older films it draws upon in which coded characters and plotlines often served as subtle lampoons of the absurdly conventional messaging being conveyed on the surface camp is one of the oldest weapons in the queer artists arsenal and glass wields it like a pro yet while she might use it to undermine cliches and upend expectations the director never lets it distract  for long at any rate  from the deadly stakes of her story with a tight terse screenplay penned by glass alongside weronika tofilska that patiently sets up the dominoes for us until were quivering in anticipation of their fall bleeding takes time to relish in the details  the quirks of its characters the unspoken dynamics between them the secrets they keep and the moments they choose to reveal them  while making sure every one of them serves to wind the tension tighter the effort pays off in a series of escalating climaxes that we know are coming yet still manage to surprise shock and ultimately thrill us gorgeous cinematography from ben fordesman helps as does a periodperfect tangerine dreamesque score by clint mansell but in such a characterdriven film as this one its always the actors who are most crucial to selling the directors vision in this case stewart and obrian are the linchpins delivering a pair of deeply realized performances and a sultryyetsweet chemistry that wins us over almost before it does their characters both shine with stewarts growth as an actor continuing to stretch her beyond her twilight years and obrians earthy femininity bringing a welcome  and provocative  layer of gender ambiguity to the mix backing them up are fine supporting turns from malone and anna baryshnikov whose hypnotically oddball performance as a clingy admirer who complicates lous newfound romance is a highlight  as is dave francos simultaneously hilarious and repellant performance in a role its best we let you discover for yourself finally though its veteran screen baddie harris who dominates filling us with the kind of irrepressible dread that the most memorable movie villains always inspire  all while sporting a set of overthetop hair extensions that immediately and intentionally wed like to think call to mind richard obriens riffraff in the rocky horror picture show because of its skillful blend of such campy bold strokes and a genuine spirit of righteous rebellion that makes even its most broadly ridiculous moments cut with both sides of their satirical blade we find bleeding to be a new addition to an evergrowing canon of essential queer movies  with the disclaimer that some of its weirder moments might leave some viewers a bit perplexed and those with a low tolerance to gratuitous violence and uninhibited sex scenes will likely want to skip it
Aug 19 2022,positive, as tempting as it may be im not wading into the controversies that have swarmed captain marvel since well before its release the bulk of criticisms have been silly pointless and some of it downright bizarre yet through all of the fanboy backlash and insecure outrage marvel studios has another big screen cash cow on its hands captain marvel is already pushing 1 billion not too shabby let me start by laying out my credentials im a comic book guy and ive followed the carol danvers character for a while i became a genuine fan in 2006 when her second solo series launched much of its 50issue run was fantastic and it did a good job opening up the character not to mention giving us 19 stunning covers from artist greg horn so im more than open to a carol danvers ms marvel binarycaptain marvel entry into the mcu in fact i love the idea of carol being the first female to have her own movie and it didnt hurt when marvel studios announced she would be played by oscarwinner brie larson an actress i really enjoy turns out the movie is a good one it doesnt necessarily break the mcu mold but it does an amazing job considering the massive challenges it faced think about it captain marvel is asked to show that a femaleled mcu picture can be a big moneymaker it has to tell a fresh origin story of a character not exactly among marvels upper tier it must connect itself to the already immense mcu timeline and it has to put certain pieces in place that lead up to next months avengers endgame talk about a full plate there are moments where you can sense the filmmakers working hard to meet the many demands at the same time the writerdirector duo of anna boden and ryan fleck deserve a ton of credit they may be unlikely choices to make a blockbuster marvel picture but they turn out to be solid fits who have a good sense of how the movie should land their balancing act is pretty amazing at its core this is a story of a woman larson in search of her true identity practically the entire film is a slow drip of information and revelation about who this clearly gifted person truly is its a cool way of telling an origin story as the character is learning alongside of the audience think along the lines of jason bourne at the same time it doesnt allow you the chance to get close enough to her past call it conventional but i felt her backstory could have used a tad more attention we first know her as vers pronounced veers a member of the alien kree empires elite starforce she clearly has untapped power but shes taught to contain it by her mentor and starforce commander yonrogg jude law this is also where we get our first handful of memory flashes which she dismisses as nothing more than dreams when a rescue operation goes bad vers is abducted by skrulls the krees shapeshifting enemies the skrull commander talos a really good ben mendelsohn probes her mind giving us yet another batch of memories to parse vers escapes to nearby earth where countless gags and a barrage of musical cues lets us know its 1995 she quickly draws the attention of the fledgling shield organization and agent nick fury samuel l jackson but his investigation is quickly sidetracked when the skrulls attack vers and fury set out on the most unusual of buddycop adventures to find out what the skrulls are after along the way she learns more about her true self namely that she was a former air force fight pilot named carol danvers the quest for identity hops from los angeles to louisiana and even back to earths orbit throughout we watch verscarol wrestle with her otherworldly powers and her humanity larson is good a bit dry but by design her character has been trained to suppress her emotions and shes even told humor is a sign of weakness as carol slowly breaks lose from that mindset larson is given more room to examine the pentup emotions that not only come with the character but that ultimately unleashes her true power the supporting cast is just as strong out of the nine mcu films jackson has appeared it this may be his beefiest role yet he and larson have a good chemistry and he has no problem leading a scene or falling into the background whenever needed mendelsohn is excellent giving us as performance a shifty as the slippery skrull he portrays and lashana lynch brings a timely warmth playing carols old friend oh and there is a cat named goose who is an absolute scenestealer cant forget the cat while i wouldnt put captain marvel in the upper echelon of marvel movies it does really well at introducing its character and setting her up to be a major player in the mcu it does some peculiar things with the marvel lore and it ends in an interesting but weird place in terms of a sequel but once again kevin feige and his marvel masterminds have shown an incredible knack for expanding their already mammoth cinematic universe captain marvel feels right at home and finally fills a sizable hole in mcu as for its relevance as the first femaleled mcu movie im not sure how much more audiences have to prove i realize the cultural significance of black panther and captain marvel but audiences have already shown they will not only go see these films but fully embrace them as they do all mcu pictures sure a smattering of internet infants will make an online scene but clearly their impact has been nonexistent if the story is good the characters compelling and the respect for the source material reasonable any potential outrage is all but meaningless people will come to the theaters so perhaps its time for the fingers to point solely at the studio and not the audience i didnt like this as much as you the overall message is fantastic and one i agree with and want to see more of but i really didnt think the story was anywhere near as strong as it needed to be and unlike the best superhero films never felt she was in enough peril but youre right about the cat and her scenes with samuel l jackson ive seen them interviewed on chat shows and they have this amazing warmth and chemistry i agree the peril wasnt as global or even universal as so many of these films but i honestly appreciated that to me it was a bit refreshing to see the stakes as more personal ultimately i enjoyed it as yet another fresh installment into the mcu i gotta admit im pretty amazed at just how strong this collective universe is despite how big it is and i keep waiting for the wheels to fall off but they keep adding quality installments i get that just wish she had more backstory i really preferred wonder woman but there will be plenty that prefer captain marvel and just think how many will be inspired to be a pilot or even just inspired in general one of the reason i love movies is to hear stories i wouldnt otherwise hear another is to be inspired  oh i agree that was my biggest gripe and im with you i too prefer wonder woman and by a pretty big margin while the ww vs ares fight wasnt great i adored everything leading up to it i felt jenkins did a great job letting us know where she came from captain marvel doesnt venture that deep as i wrote it may be a little conventional but im like you i kinda wanted more in terms of backstory for sure and it lacked that big moment when ww walks admires the battlefield but hey at least it was set in the 90s see previous discussion and samuel l jackson is a riot i would watch that movie of them on a road trip  im a comics guy and i admit to wanting some time of respect for the source material especially when it gives us great stories to tell the internet goofs arent true fanboys their whining goofs who are impossible to take serious pitiful people i really enjoyed it too and im genuinely excited to see it again like i said it does some weird stuff with the lore especially with the skrulls but lets see where they take it from here its interesting that you mention the no doubt background music i didnt care for that to me it was so on the nose worth a laugh at first but then a little silly and it was during the first part of her big leash off fight i would have went for something more dramatic but not that big of a deal i understand the film criticisms though the butthurt meninist backlash can fuck right off the film is mysteriously dim enough to make one sleepy i too wanted to see carols backstory flushed out more and i didnt quite understand why it needed to be set in the 90s but the more i watch captain marvel the less these things bother me the dimness i realized on a 2nd viewing makes her photon energy stand out phenomenally i enjoyed the clipped flashbacks because her stepbystep upbringing isnt nearly as important as knowing that she falls and gets back up again and as a 90s baby i cant help but adore the references to the time period however throwaway i would never have pegged just a girl as a pivotal climax number and it rules among its accomplishments captain marvel introduced current generations to vintage no doubt amazing ha ha my wife and i had a fun debate over the no doubt song she liked it while i felt it was ridiculously on the nose to me it made a meaningful fight into more of a goofy joke definitely not a deal breaker though being set in the 90s was a weird one and you could probably pick apart the timeline if you tried really hard personally i dont care to im fine with the setting and i agree we get the gist of her backstory but i do think danvers is a rich enough character to warrant a touch more attention without it being a stepbystep history but as you said we do get the things that shaped and challenged her along the way i can tell you enjoyed writing this review keith and i appreciate it i doubt i will go watch it  ive long been tired of the genre but im the minority obviously a billion dollar take in illustrates that thanks for the thoughtprovoking review thanks so much cindy i did indeed enjoy writing it i completely respect those who are burnt out on superhero films i understand that im still onboard and can definitely recommend this one i will say if youre tired of the genre this one doesnt do anything especially fresh to change your mind i thought that the movie was good as well it wasnt super fantastic like some of the other more recent ones from marvel but it was definitely another solid feature film youre a stronger person then i am my review might as well have started with lol fuck you incels either way i enjoyed this its not perfect by any means but im looking forward to her in endgame im kind of expectinghoping that its a bit like doctor strange he was fine in his solo movie but he really came to life bouncing off the other avengers i hope carol will too i can completely see her having a doctor strangelike vibrancy when paired with the other avengers but im like you i did enjoy this one and id be up for a second carol danvers movie fury was a lot of fun this was definitely his meatiest role and jackson was great he and brie have some killer chemistry anxious to see how they do in unicorn store been going back and forth about checking this out i will likely wait for dvd to check it out glad to see that you enjoyed it i did enjoy it maybe a bit more than i expected to the biggest treat was larson and jacksons buddy cop relationship it worked really well i know several people with similar experiences they werent marvel fans but since have been pulled into the mcu thanks to some really good movies and the cap movies are my very favorites especially winter soldier 
Aug 17 2022,positive, the mcus captain marvel is wellpaced with a handful of moments of strategicallyplaced humor is solidly acted from start to finish and now has a crowning character to replace captain america in the future phases a few months back brie larson spoke out against film criticism being dominated by white males which you cant object to for every female critic you average 35 male ones its a good point one would think she would also point out the lack of minorities starring in bigbudget films today if you delve deeper you will find 82 of the reviews performed by the top100 rotten tomatoesapproved critics are white in which i would like to point out maybe the cool kids gathering spot for film critics needs to reevaluate who should be added to their own top100 as a white male critic judging a unique feminist comic book film on international womens day should i feel the pressure of the herding mentality while reviewing captain marvel no thats just being honest ultimately you have no other choice than to give any film your honest opinion no matter the heat that may be around the corner im here to say this the film is a stellar addition to the marvel universe ill also add that brie larson is auspicious in it in her origin story as the kree warrior vers the film opens with captain marvel training with her leader yonrogg jude law she is his prized student of sorts yonrogg mansplains to her how to use her head instead of her power to keep them hidden youd be hardpressed to find a subtler way of portraying an overwhelming statement of antifeminist machismo trying to keep feminist ambition at bay the team gathers to take on a battle between the kree and the evershapeshifting skrulls they have captured one of their comrades who infiltrated them they then travel to get him back but are led into a trap vers is taken to their ship for answers the enemy extraterrestrial race thinks she has something they are searching for they then start to flip the pages of her memories to find it memories that are new to her she escapes and lands on planet earth sometime in the early 1990s nick fury samuel l jackson and now rookie agent paul coulson clark gregg with hair and looking like he is playing dennis quaid in the dennis quaid story find vers by a payphone next to a radio shack and a blockbuster not the last one in bend ore captain marvelvers is played with a cocky almost brazen ambition by brie larson this is not out of sorts from any action film starring a youthful male lead think back to tom cruise in top gun the hollywood landscape is littered with them the team behind the latest installment is smart enough to know this is an age thing it has nothing to do with gender jackson has a lot of fun as a younger nick fury he surely doesnt move like a junior nick fury though the chemistry between the leads is apparent though from a friendlyplatonic standpoint the film has one too many feel you out and get to know you moments for my taste jude law and ben mendelson as skrull commander tolas are far from thin supporting characters with mendelson in particular owning the scenes he is in in reptile makeup or not lets face it that is nothing new the weaker moments of the film come from the flashback sequences particularly those that involved annette benning as dr wendy lawson and needed more time to flesh out the backstory to sell the ending of the film i wish they also made better use of the often underused djimon hounsou amistad in america and the outstanding gemma chan crazy rich asians so much hence i almost wish the film added more running time even though a marvel film under 25hours is welcomed the mcu has never had trouble with an overall satisfying characterdriven origin story i mean even edward nortons version of the hulk had its moments captain marvel lands somewhere in the topthird of avenger films however it falls just short of guardians of the galaxy and captain america first avenger though just ahead of films like thor this latest outing is wellpaced the addition of a handful of moments of strategicallyplaced humor is welcomed overall this is solidly acted from start to finish from its stellar cast the mcu now has a crowning character to replace captain america to lead its franchise into phase four the film is not only a shining moment of actiongenre feminism but maybe even most importantly an excellent genre picture it just happens to be a lot of fun and has an overall positive message about female empowerment behind it having a film produced by the hollywood machine that is not just another genre picture but another good genre picture with a female lead along with wonder woman seems like progress in the right direction we hopefully wont have to distinguish between the two in the

Mar 3 2022,negative, about midway through captain marvel the titular hero carol danvers played with energy and charm by brie larson speaks to a member of the skrull an alien race making its first appearance on earth the scene takes place in a country house where the skrull makes references to jazz hands and annoying neighbors who come over to borrow sugar somehow the lizardfaced alien is familiar with such earthspecific references but when someone threatens to put their foot where it doesnt belong the skrull is confused by the saying where will they put their foot he wonders its baffling that a humanoid from another planet knows the concept of jazz hands or the outmoded practice of borrowing sugar from ones neighbor yet he cannot decipher a threat of bodily harm seemingly inconsequential incongruous details and huh moments like this accumulate in the script and threaten to unravel the first femalecentric entry in the marvel cinematic universe with a story credited to five writers and a screenplay credited to three the film feels underwritten in areas and scattershot in others and in general it doesnt have the usual surface polish one anticipates from a marvel production to be sure though captain marvel arrives with high expectations for what it represents both on and off the screen it underwhelms in its sheer averageness  similar to many marvel superheroes captain marvel borrows from an established dc comics icon green lantern in that both characters were us pilots who after a crash join a group of intergalactic space cops although the captain marvel character was created in 1968 the film borrows many of her traits from a recent iteration in the comics penned by kelly sue deconnick including the characters starladen costume to her rebellious attitude when the film opens its on the technologically advanced kree planet hala where our hero vers larson suffers from amnesia yet she trains under yonrogg jude law to become a bona fide member of the krees starforce fragmented images flood her mysterious dreams suggesting that vers had a past on another planetone vaguely reminiscent of top gun yonrogg warns her that emotions and dwelling on the past are signs of weakness and to gain approval from the kree overseer known as the supreme intelligence she must control herself but rather than submit to the notion that emotions prevent women from doing the same quality of work as men vers eventually proves that her emotions are her strength things accelerate when vers is separated from her other comrades during a mission to stop the skrulls a shapeshifting species known to infiltrate and take over other planets  soon enough captain marvel turns into a kitschy 90sera comedy more interested in nostalgia than developing its hero in her pursuit of the skrulls she ends up on earth here dubbed planet c53 which is described as a real shithole by the kreea remark reminiscent of donald trumps view of other countries she finds herself in los angeles in the mid1990s and teams with shield agent nick fury samuel l jackson to stop the skrull leader talos ben mendelsohn from a worldwide takeover the plot has an invasion of the body snatchers quality given the skrulls ability to mimic the appearance and dna of anyone they see her amnesia combined with the throwback setting makes for a predictable amount of both fishoutofwater and flashbacktothe90s humor the screenplay relies on countless references from the era including humor about the slowness of aol internet and cdrom load times a nod to blockbuster video and countless alternative rockers garbage hole nirvana etc on the soundtrack one of the big fight sequences near the climax is set to no doubts just a girla choice that emphasizes the films rousing feminist intentions albeit in the most unsubtle way imaginable  over the course of the film vers learns that she was originally an earthling named carol danvers and shes been imbued with untold powers that even by the final scenes never become clear or welldefined the same goes for the character carol danvers is an uncertain personality full of pluck and quips but she remains caught between the flashes of her former self in her dreams and the hero she has the potential to become shes a hero that not unlike this film within the greater mcu continuum feels out of place and in need of situating amid offscreen contexts to fully appreciate her past is vague at best captured in a series of alltoobrief snippets of her memory and her future will play a crucial role in the next entry avengers endgame she spends the duration of captain marvel in a state of uncertainty serving up a shallow relief rather than the strong personality that so many marvel characters are and though her former earth friends maria rambeau lashana lynch and dr wendy lawson annette bening help bring some dimension to the character shes never an indepth personalityshes someone defined by what other characters say about her as opposed to what she does only by the final scenes does it seem as though carol danvers understands herself but before we learn more the film has ended many have claimed that captain marvel is a film more interested in what it represents than what it is admittedly the film wears its politics on its sleevea quality thats not inherently a bad thing for instance spike lee is unabashedly political in last years blackkklansman but lee also knows that a political statement in a film means little without threedimensional characters to engage our emotions and invest us in the drama there are scenes in captain marvel that do not occur naturally in the story so they feel like forced statements such as the no doubt songwhereas others have been handled with a measure of elegance an effective twist during the second act resituates our perspective to see perceived criminals and terrorists as living beings that do not deserve to be discarded in a fascinating and unexpected turn the skrull become sympathetic and displaced immigrants while the kree fanatic ronan the accuser lee pace would prefer to wipe them out of existence elsewhere the final bout between carol and the real enemy is also a perfect demonstration of a woman who refuses to play by the rules established by men even so its not difficult to see that wonder woman 2017 made more of a feminist impact by simply telling a compelling story and not overemphasizing the point  whether captain marvel is successful in its attempts to assert carol danvers as a strong female character demands some consideration if by strong you mean physically powerful as well as capable of flying and shooting energy beams out of her hands then sure carol danvers is a strong character however shes not strong in the sense that shes welldefined or follows a personal code shes not a dynamic charactershes brave sometimes even a rebel shes curious about her past and she trusts her instincts even if she sometimes makes mistakes shes admirable but not engaging that characterization doesnt amount to much nor does it give her much room to grow besides filling in informational gaps in her past that she spends much of the film in a state of flux caught between her past and future is not very commanding or inspiring thus the issue might be one of structure had we followed carol from pilot to space cop to captain marvel the journey might have been more involving unfortunately the lackluster writing and serviceable production diminish the basic thrills we expect from the mcu making captain marvel a letdown if only because of its vast potential it remains diverting and thats all at the very least the film boasts a touching tribute to the late marvel comics legend stan lee including his best cameo yet 
Sep 30 2021,positive,theres some great visual humor once you get on earth things start picking up
Sep 3 2021,neutral,despite many redeeming qualities about captain marvel i found it to be a very safe film with slightly heavyhanded elements which wasnt very exciting
Aug 17 2021,positive, if youve seen the ads for captain marvel you might be curious exactly what type of movie its going to be is it a candycolored space opera like guardians of the galaxy a mystery about a soldier caught between allegiances like the captain america trilogy or a comedy about a highflying hot shot who doesnt plays by her own rules like iron man its actually all those things and more because like its hero the film has no identity of its own make no mistake captain marvel is a ton of fun especially after the grim pillars of infinity war and the upcoming endgame at times its like many films you probably enjoyed in the 90s including the fugitive and forever young as well as older hits like alien nation top gun and superman but for being such a big piece of the mcu puzzle  shes a major factor in endgame as teased in a midcredits scene  this is a movie that feels completely disposable brie larson is a great addition to the future avengers roster but here it often feels like shes being held back a bit theres a great moment when shes trying to escape a skrull ship and snarls back at a henchman thats the character right there but she gets too few moments of outright silliness she has some sarcastic quips but that about it as if theres a fear we wont buy her as a badass noble warrior hero if shes allowed to be goofy shes also got serious trust issues made all the more believable by the supporting cast its absolutely perfect to have jude law play her kree commander with ben mendelsohn as the leader of the shapeshifting skrulls both men have made careers out of playing untrustworthy scumbags but the real heavy hitters are annette bening whose identity is practically a spoiler in itself and samuel l jackson reprising his role as nick fury the deaging effect that marvel has toyed with for years finally works and its pretty spectacular although its less effective on clark gregg playing agent coulson as a freshfaced recruit jackson who already looks much younger than his 70 years looks like he just wrapped shooting on die hard with a vengeance much has been made of the fact that this is not only marvels first film with a female lead but also one with its first female codirector as a fan of anna boden and ryan flecks very human dramas about feeling lost theres nothing here that would lead you to seek out their earlier tiny indies whatever your varying opinions on doctor strange thor ragnarok and black panther at least theres an authorial stamp there this feels like a very bycommittee mcu entry at least they actually shoot in daylight at some honesttogod recognizable locations in this one captain marvel is a longoverdue chance for its star to shine and to focus on a female superhero had this happened four years ago i might be more impressed in 2019 theres nothing to make it stand out
Aug 16 2021,positive, as the first womanled film from the marvel cinematic universe despite it being the twentyfirst instalment of the franchise  but whos counting captain marvel lands in cinemas already burdened with glorious purpose meanwhile rotten tomatoes had to update its terms to ban the hordes of trolls and incels intent on reviewbombing the film before it even released what an age we live in  carol danvers a perfectlycast brie larson or vers as she is known on hala is part of an elite team of kree warriors tasked with extracting a kree undercover operative before the skrulls get to him it is not long until the mission goes awry and vers is taken prisoner under interrogation by talos ben mendelsohn vers recovers fragments of her past life on earth a life she had no memory of  there are glimpses of a rebellious child and an unsupportive father military training alongside her best friend alcoholfuelled karaoke nights and an enigmatic mentor annette bening all are puzzle pieces to figuring out who she was and who she is now on her way to becoming the hero she is destined to be  as she escapes and chases her shapeshifting captors to 1995 los angeles eventually teaming up with a young nick fury samuel l jackson she begins to realise that everything she thought she knew may have been a lie what ensues is a witty uplifting badass and deeply moving superhero epic  a wonderful and unexpected aspect to captain marvel is carols relationship with fellow pilot maria rambeau played splendidly by lashana lynch who has since left the air force to take care of her daughter akira akbar the tender and uplifting female friendship is what lends heart to the film its also in those scenes that larson really shines not just in her girlboss warrior badass way but equally in her characters more vulnerable understated moments  it might be a little corny the pacing might start off a little slow the fight sequences might be a little murky but none of this does anything to detract from what is a truly great film and critics or viewers reading this may think thats contradictory or that its wilful blindness to captain marvels flaws the fact is its pointless and closedminded to rate this film based solely on its cinematic merits when its importance exists in its message 
Jul 22 2021,positive, captain marvel arrived with serious controversy among fanboys who felt horrified when their comic book icon transformed into a woman in turn star brie larson noticed a disproportionate number of male versus female film critics inspiring questions about how gender influences reviews gender obviously affects reactions to stories hence the term chick flicks and their counterparts from the male end overall i remain open to casting choices that switch the source material tall or short human or alien male or female some roles work regardless of physical appearance captain marvel falls in that category and actress larson plays the role with energetic physicality and an engaging partial smile not quite a snicker a snick in any case she plays a woman who enjoys bantering and friendly competition but willing to throw in every bit of force when jousting turns into war had captain marvel served as audience introduction to larson few would foresee a career that includes winning a best actress oscar for the movie room captain marvel provides the challenges of getting into terrific shape and looking good in a tight costume but it requires little in the way of emotional range the same goes for other top performers in the film anette benning jude law and samuel l jackson all provide their usual skillful screen presence without generating any thoughts of future awards attention for their work in this film jackson especially keeps the tone light frequently raising his voice and eyebrows for comic emphasis wellregarded acting talent follows the marvel studios program of topnotch production values though oddly captain marvels sets and special effects look cheesier than most dim lighting and gray tones undermine the sharp and colorful visual qualities found in both comic books and such standout marvel productions as black panther captain marvels numerous writers and directors focus more on story than appearances crosscutting time periods and locations as their amnesiac lead character pieces together her past audiences may share her confusion at times but events eventually pull together for a cohesive finale that in true marvel studios fashion leaves room for sequels after all it turns out a female captain handles duties and defeats gender stereotypes by repeatedly emphasizing resilience captain marvel makes an effective role model for girls and boys alike
Jul 13 2021,positive, even after 20 installments of wildly successful movies that have turned the marvel cinematic universe into a boxoffice blockbuster factory captain marvel arrives in theaters as one of the studios most controversial seemingly risky projects not only is captain marvel the studios first femaleled superhero movie but it relies on a hero off mainstream audiences radar to tell a story set in the shadow of two of the mcus most hypedup projects so far last years avengers infinity war and its upcoming conclusion avengers endgame it isnt entirely apparent from the previews but captain marvel also happens to be the studios most selfaware movie to date  a quality that can either work in a movies favor or against it depending on how its handled fortunately captain marvel is a winner on all fronts offering an exciting thoroughly engrossing chapter of the mcu that manages to tell a compelling standalone story while also putting its stamp on the overarching mcu saga that it does all of that while also managing to blend in some powerfully relevant social themes makes its achievement that much more impressive directed by anna boden and ryan fleck from a script they penned along with geneva robertsondworet captain marvel casts academy award winner brie larson as carol danvers a us air force pilot whose explosive encounter with an alien race results in her gaining powerful superhuman abilities the film is a prequel story set in the 1990s with carol recruited by the aliens known as the kree to fight in their war with the shapeshifting skrulls when a mission goes awry and she ends up back on earth carols mysterious past is revealed and she teams up with a young nick fury samuel jackson to stop the skrulls from acquiring powerful technology hidden on the planet along with larson and jackson the films cast also includes ben mendelsohn as the skrull officer talos jude law as carols kree mentor yonrogg and annette bening in multiple roles throughout the film mcu veteran and agents of shield actor clark gregg also reprises his role as shield agent phil coulson it becomes clear early on in captain marvel that larson was the right choice for the films titular hero  which is no small feat given that theres been nearconstant debate over her suitability to play the character since her casting was first announced three years ago unlike typical superhero origin stories carol isnt a hero who finds her swagger and confidence once she gains superhuman abilities or learns a lesson about responsibility in captain marvel carol has always had to fight to be what she wants to be  often against men telling her what her limits should be  and larsons portrayal of the character exudes a confidence and charisma that comes from a life of defying expectations everything from carols dialogue to her posture reflects a certainty of purpose that makes her stand out from her marvel peers who typically have to overcome crippling selfdoubt or moral uncertainty before they can become the hero they need to be theres never a point in the film when carol is not a hero though  she just becomes a different kind of hero as circumstances and her awareness of them change the subtleties of her characters arc could easily be lost amid all of the action and spectacle of captain marvel but larson handles carols evolution with an impressive level of nuance the end result is a character that stands out from the rest of the marvel pack in ways that have more to do with carols personal journey and larsons compelling performance than simply her gender reprising his role as nick fury jackson manages to present a version of nick thats appropriately familiar but still different in all the ways that his young age and lack of experience reflect this version of nick fury is a bit more trusting and idealistic than the grizzled operative of the avengers and subsequent films and jackson is clearly enjoying the chance to show off some new sides to the character although larsons portrayal of carol is the films defining element mendelsohn also delivers a standout performance as talos despite his characters shapechanging attributes mendelsohns part in the film could have easily slipped into the realm of onedimensional foils but the rogue one actor injects so much flair into the character that you dont want to see him dispatched too soon captain marvel also offers up some impressive visual effects to go along with its intriguing characters and a story that doesnt shy away from toying with its audiences expectations given the intense detailoriented coverage each marvel movie gets in the leadup to its release its a welcome surprise that many of the storys most rewarding twists and turns werent spoiled during the promotional press circuit or even worse in the trailers and clips released by the studio on the visual side carols energyblasting powers never look silly or poorly envisioned for the action and when she finally takes full control of her abilities for a stirring outerspace battle against a fleet of warships the sequence feels appropriately triumphant in fact its difficult not to cheer right along with carol as she revels in her ability to dispatch one ship after another as she twists dives and rolls through the cosmic field of battle also cheerworthy is the ease with which captain marvel handles certain elements associated with the sort of toxic fandom that targeted the film in the weeks leading up to its release captain marvel simply persists in telling the great story its talented cast and creative team know they can tell and lets the final product speak for itself the film does indeed feature carol dealing with the sort of misogyny  casual or otherwise  that sadly remains part of the female experience today but the message the movie hammers home and the real heros journey that carol makes in the film is one of realizing your own selfworth and potential carols battle in captain marvel might ostensibly be against alien villains but its really against the elements in her life that would hold her back from being the hero shes capable of being this is new ground for marvel studios heroes as thus far the mcu has featured protagonists who overcome physical or moral dilemmas in order to use their powers for good for carol to reach her full heroic potential however all she needs to do is stop listening to everyone telling her what she should be or can be put in the unenviable place of having to establish a new character in the midst of one of the most climactic moments in the mcus history captain marvel succeeds as a film because it approaches its realworld situation in much the same way its hero does with the predicament she finds herself in instead of trying to prove its value in the mcu captain marvel simply persists in telling the great story its talented cast and creative team know they can tell and lets the final product speak for itself at a time when the cultural divide in hollywood and the nation at large has never felt greater captain marvel dives into the fray and emerges with a truly memorable bigscreen adventure that stands toetotoe with the best

Apr 29 2021,positive, there are two types of marvel movies there are the ones that follow the classic superhero arc like iron man captain america thor in which a good smart strong protagonist battles evil and usually public suspicion in a way thats been familiar to audiences since 1978s superman not marvel we know dont write in then there are the weirdo ones like guardians of the galaxy or antman which tend to be pretty cavalier with plot more interested in character eccentricities and gags so you might reach the end somewhat unsure of what just happened but certain you had a nice time captain marvel has a foot in both camps which makes it surprising silly and refreshing if also a tad messy if you havent already read up on captain marvel you may spend the first hour fairly confused when we meet our hero played by brie larson she is already a superpowered being known as vers she lives on an alien planet as part of the kree a race under permanent threat from shapeshifting aliens called the skrulls led by the ever brilliant ben mendehlson as talos shes a skilled member of a military group with superstrength and the ability to shoot energy blasts from her fists yet vers is troubled by weird halfmemories of a different life on a different planet a near miss with the skrulls finds her stranded on earth which she starts to realise is oddly familiar its an origin story told in a jumble with vers finding out how she gained her powers then becoming a superhero directors and cowriters anna boden and ryan fleck mississippi grind have opted for a 1990s setting for the film the reason why becomes clear later in keeping with the setting theyre shooting for a 90s scifi tone  a little bit men in black and a smidge independence day  with vers as the nononsense alien come to earth baffled by its primitiveness samuel l jackson made 30 years younger by some flawless cg is her startled guide the rookie shield agent who will eventually become the avengers boss nick fury theres so much fun stuff in this approach that its a shame the film doesnt embrace it more last years bumblebee nailed the nostalgia of 80s scifi without overloading the references and this is aiming for a 90s equivalent but its grip is less sure as the movie progresses the 90s element becomes less about tone and style than soundtrack and visual reminders nirvana and garbage on the soundtrack remind us when we are what starts out weird and individual slips into marvel formula good marvel formula with some genuinely surprising twists and strong action but a familiar groove nonetheless larson is tremendous throughout the fact this is the mcus first movie with a woman in the lead puts a lot of weight on her and she carries it easily shes got starpower swagger and charisma to burn the movie becomes the most fun in the last halfhour when shes really allowed to enjoy herself living the superhero dream the movie has promised would eventually come the two parts the traditional and the weird coalesce into something nutty and exciting if captain marvel is going to be one of the driving forces of the mcu after avengers endgame then the universe is in good hands
Mar 12 2021,positive,the chemistry between larson and lynch propels the last half of the movie lynch brings depth love and believability to maria
Mar 8 2021,negative, love them or hate them marvel films have become as culturally ubiquitous as cocacola or the color red yet with the immense critical and commercial success of last years black panther the studios first film with a predominantly black cast it seemed that marvel tapped into something genuinely fresh far from the flat soda rebrands of years past unfortunately captain marvel doesnt bring the same creativity to the table instead folding back into familiar overplayed territory to tell the first womanled story in its cinematic universe brie larson stars as the titular hero originally known as carol danvers and later vers a trained pilot and fighter who must navigate her own memories to learn how she got her powers who she can trust and who she really is this nonlinear narrative adds interest beyond your typical origin story but its quickly overwhelmed by the same shtick thats in all these moviesuncompelling action sequences recycled villains and flat direction in many ways a spiritual successor to guardians of the galaxy the film is heavy on 90s nostalgia carol rocks a nine inch nails tshirt and leather jacket for a good portion of the runtime and the decades girlpower feminism larson also gets some decent oneliners but lacks a sparring partner to keep up the energy because samuel l jacksons nick fury is too busy being reverseaged with cgi to care young girls deserve to see themselves represented in mediocre superhero movies toothey just might have more fun with alita battle angel watch it at assembly row boston common fenway seaport south bay and the suburbs

Feb 18 2021,positive,  the storytelling  business model that marvel studios has developed over the past 10plus years is both genius and puzzling because each subsequent film is connected to those that came before it they have created a world in which filmgoers feel the need to see each and every movie that comes out at the same time not allowing a new film to stand on its own two legs sometimes prevents new characters from establishing their own identity  before a second of captain marvel comes on screen there are already huge expectations on the title character played by brie larson as her symbol was famously seen in the final moments of avengers infinity war when nick fury samuel l jackson desperately sent her a message as he crumbled into dust so instead of this movie being a true origin story about the first lead female superhero in the marvel cinematic universe it serves as a retconning of events to fit that certain cataclysmic event  still its a heck of a lot of fun to see her story play out even with that extra weight attached to it writerdirectors anna boden and ryan fleck moving up to the big time after four acclaimed but underseen independent movies structure the film in an unexpected order starting off with vers larson in space helping yonrogg jude law and her fellow race of kree warriors protect their way of life from the menacing skrulls led by talos ben mendelsohn  that battle results in vers crashlanding on earth in 1995 where she with the help of a much younger version of shield agent fury discovers that her past consists of more than just her time with the kree she used to be known as carol danvers an air force pilot who along with her best friend maria rambeau lashana lynch helped test out new planes for her boss annette bening  to say much more would be delving into spoiler territory but suffice it to say that the discoveries danversvers makes on her way to becoming captain marvel change her perspective a great deal as with most of the marvel movies the film is most successful when it stays small and focuses on the personal aspects of its characters the interplay between danvers and fury and later danvers and rambeau evolve the characters much more than any action scene could ever do  another marvel staple is to keep the story light and entertaining and captain marvel is on par with guardians of the galaxy and antman in that respect part of it is the 90s setting which boden fleck and cowriter geneva robertsondworet use to their full advantage clever references abound including everything from blockbuster video to mallrats to the slowness of dialup internet they also load up the film with 90sera music perhaps a bit too much among others the cue of no doubts just a girl is enjoyable but obvious  in fact predictability is where the film falters the most its not just the general story arc which given the prior knowledge about captain marvel can only go in one direction several twists are telegraphed from early on in the movie lessening the impact of their ultimate reveals however because the filmmakers play with the form of the story the film never succumbs to its failures  oscar winner larson makes for an ideal hero tough but vulnerable with the acting chops to sell both the big and small scenes equally well jackson as well as clark gregg as agent coulson is digitally deaged by 25 years highly effectively something that has been done before but not to this extent his performance represents either a bold new era in filmmaking or the death knell for actors as we know them time will tell  as engaging a film as captain marvel is its a tad disappointing that it mostly serves as an appetizer for the main course of avengers endgame in april captain marvel may wind up being the one to save the galaxy but shell have to wait for a film where she can shine on her own if you go by the movies life in small towns can either be quaint and neighborly or drudgery where even the smallest change to the daily routine can be cause for excitement the latter is certainly the case in laroy texas where a case of mistaken identity leads to the small texas town having more crime than its seen in its entire existence ray john magaro is a sadsack character seen as a pushover by the most important people in his life his former beauty queen wife stacylynn megan stevenson and his brother junior matthew del negro who manages the hardware store where they both work early in the film ray is shown evidence that stacylynn might be cheating on him by wannabe private detective skip steve zahn bringing even more misery into his life while sitting in a parking lot lamenting his horrible life one night ray is approached by a man with an envelope full of money and a request to kill a man although initially taken aback ray decides to take the job if only to bring something different and exciting into his life the real hitman dylan baker doesnt take kindly to someone stealing work from him and ray soon finds himself in several situations that upend his world completely written and directed by shane atkinson the film is a lightweight but still enjoyable take on a fargoesque story the fact that ray has three separate elements with which to deal  his cheating wife the seemingly everpresent skip and his inadvertent entry into the world of crime  gives atkinson different avenues into which to channel the story which keeps the film from becoming repetitive he also upends expectations at multiple points in the film from the excellent opening scene to the climactic sequence while some of the characters adhere to storytelling conventions several take detours that keep the film from relying too much on texas stereotypes ray especially keeps viewers on their toes as just when it seems hes becoming predictable he makes an unanticipated choice the film does get bogged down a bit in the middle section after an initial jolt of energy that comes with the setup of the story stacylynn and junior are both mostly onenote characters whose importance to the plot doesnt help them much the real hitman after making a great first impression recedes into the background too often the few times he does pop up make you wish his role called for him to be in more scenes magaro is good casting for this role as  much like he did in past lives  he plays the wellmeaning guy who is overshadowed by others in a way that makes you root for him and hate him at the same time zahn has the type of face that allows him to easily play the comic relief but hes also good in more earnest moments baker makes the most of his relatively limited screentime if only had had more laroy texas doesnt do enough to be a completely absorbing crime thriller but with a few good performances and a story thats familiar but still surprising it has more highs than lows with a deadly crime spree the most interesting thing to happen in this small town it might be worth visiting again laroy texas is now playing at galaxy grandscape in the colony it is also available on demand at home it will screen as part of the usa film festival on april 19
Feb 10 2021,negative, the production and release of captain marvel the new science fiction superhero adventure from marvel and disney has a number of remarkable features but none of them involve the films drama action or characters briefly captain marvel in convoluted fashion follows us air force pilot carol danvers brie larson who absorbs an awesome energy source making her potentially one of the universes most powerful heroes ever known according to the films publicity however six years later she is suffering from amnesia doesnt know who or what she is and has become a member of the repressive starforce military under her mentor yonrogg jude law the shapeshifting skrulls the apparent enemy force danvers to crashland in the us in the mid1990s but all is not what it appears danvers discovers secrets about herself and about a galactic war between two alien races not much of this is interesting although it is noisy and actionpacked captain marvel as a film is predictable empty and tedious the more sensitive scenes on earth focusing on danvers and her african american friend maria rambeau lashana lynch and daughter akira akbar are possibly the most contrived and least convincing disney the films distributor is the worlds largest media company with some 100 billion in assets with a market value of 152 billion it ranks as the 53rd largest company of any kind in the world just behind total oil and gas merck pharmaceuticals the bank of china one of the four leading stateowned commercial banks in china unilever dowdupont and bp media reports place captain marvels combined net production and global marketing costs at 300 million to date the films global box office stands at 774 million captain marvel is truly corporate entertainmentie the very process by which it came into being prevents it from being entertaining or enlightening in any meaningful fashion this type of largescale officially sponsored filmmaking whose success is avidly promoted and tracked by the media and business publications in particular inevitably intersects and overlaps with other aspects of american establishment culture in the case of captain marvel this means militarism and feminism specifically in fact task  purpose reported that marvel studios launched the official start of production with a photo of larson and air force brig gen jeannie m leavitt thencommander of the 57th wing and the services first female fighter pilot atop an f15 at nellis air force base in nevada to prepare for her role larson according to the wrap visited the air force base to join simulated dogfights the films redcarpet premiere included testimonials from air force men and women and a flyover by the air forces nellisbased thunderbirds task  purpose a website that follows the american military also cited the emailed comments of todd fleming chief of the community and public outreach division at secretary of the air force public affairs the air force partners on any number of entertainment projects to ensure the depiction of airmen and the air force mission is accurate and authentic our partnership with capt marvel sic helped ensure the characters time in the air force and backstory was presented accurately it also highlighted the importance of the air force to our national defense captain marvel is not part of a recruiting strategy but we would expect that audiences seeing a strong air force heroine whose story is in line with the story of many of our airmen would be positively received fleming said the issue of female recruitment is no small matter american imperialism recklessly gearing up for war against russia china and other rivals needs vast new supplies of human fodder task  purpose explains the spotlight on airmen in captain marvel comes at a time when the air force like the other services is hunting for the next generation of pilots the air force navy and marine corps are all short 25 percent of their pilot billets according to a gao government accountability office report published this summer the air force in particular has doled out cash incentives like candy in a vain effort to prevent pilots from defecting to the private sector indeed the branchs plan to increase its number of squadrons by 76 to cold war levels will require an additional 40000 personnel further straining the services recruitment capabilities at the air force academy female cadets are increasingly encouraged to vie for pilot spots to help bridge that gap larson who has made all sorts of useless or worse comments about metoo alleged sexual abuse and her own social activism like most of affluent hollywood is entirely oblivious to the criminal role of the us military the greatest source of terror and abuse on the planet by an order of magnitude of 100 times or more the female heroism in captain marvel of course has been greeted with plaudits entertainment weekly noted excitedly that the film would mark the first time a woman will be headlining her own solo superhero movie in the marvel cinematic universe it also marks the first time a woman will direct a superhero film for marvel studios anna boden will codirect with her mississippi grind partner ryan fleck the hope is that captain marvel will do for women what black panther did for african americanswhich is of course nothing whatsoever except for a small layer of prominent studio executives writers performers etc this comment from deadline is typical one film finance source believes that its pretty much certain that captain marvel  will see 1 billion around the world and break the glass ceiling for femaleled pics at the global bo box office dashing past wonder womans final global of 8218m as is this vox headline why captain marvels milestone status creates so much pressure for it to succeedwhy captain marvel represents more than just a superhero movie the article proposes to answer these important questions what does a woman superhero mean for marvel studios and the mcu marvel cinematic universe what are the takeaways from captain marvels already overwhelming box office success what does the film have to say about feminism what might have happened if it had flopped and who gets to shape the conversation and narrative surrounding it the final and perhaps most remarkable feature of captain marvel involves its writerdirectors and secondarily its performers what are larson jude law and the talented australian actor ben mendelsohn whose acting in the land of steady habits we recently praised doing in this rubbish we have made the point previously on more than one occasion about the objective significance of the long march of numerous socalled independent or art filmmakers toward emptyheaded blockbuster moviemaking we noted the examples of steven soderbergh oceans eleven etc alan taylor terminator genisys the russo brothers the captain america and avengers franchises kenneth branagh thor christopher nolan batman begins etc john singleton a fast and furious installment lee tamahori die another day one of the james bond fantasies marc forster another of the bond films quantum of solace sam mendes yet another bond film skyfall and patty jenkins wonder woman to that list one can add the more recent examples of jon watts two spiderman films taika waititi thor ragnarok ava duvernay a wrinkle in time and ryan coogler black panther in a number of these cases the filmmakers had earlier indicated vaguely oppositional political views or a certain concern at least for the fate of broader layers of the population the lure of large amounts of money is obviously an issue but perhaps the more pertinent question is what are the social and ideological conditions that make writers directors and performers susceptible to this lure it is not inevitable artists including in the us have been known to repudiate such offers with contempt almost inevitably however such resistance has been rooted in political and social conceptions and opposition of a leftwing character sustained by a confidence in the better instincts of the population and its willingness to struggle those conceptions and that confidence are sorely lacking today the directors of the dreadful captain marvel ryan fleck and anna boden should not be entirely unfamiliar to readers of the wsws although the contextbigbudget hollywoodmay be unexpected we have reviewed two of their films in the past half nelson 2006 and sugar 2008 the atlantic notes with surprise that fleck and boden until now have worked in the realm of quiet sensitive indie films more than simply quiet and sensitive half nelson centers on an obviously leftwing high school teacher working at an innercity school in brooklyn a 2006 new york times article about the making of half nelson is worth citing the fleckboden film wrote dennis lim is a political allegory a film about a wouldbe visionary who wants to change the world but cant get his act together and is often his own worst enemy its not a stretch to read it as a comment on the sorry state of the american left that was more or less conscious the films director ryan fleck said of the political subtext fleck and boden started writing half nelson  four years ago as the bush administration was preparing to invade iraq and the antiwar movement was gaining momentum it felt like we were going to protests every other week mr fleck said recently but ultimately you dont have the energy to do it all and you feel like youre doing very little a big part of the frustration was the inability to make meaningful change the activist spirit comes naturally to mr fleck who was born to socialist parents on a commune in berkeley calif as a child he was taken to rallies and protests as a teenager he read noam chomsky and howard zinn fleck and bodens sugar about a dominican baseball player playing in the minor leagues in the us the wsws commented was about immigration and acculturation capitalism and exploitation hospitality and loneliness mr fleck said he hoped that their future projects would remain however obliquely rooted in a sense of social justice filmmaking is kind of a vain hobby when maybe we should all be taking to the streets he said but it seems irresponsible not to be informed by politics in some way ms bodens idealism is more tempered i dont have an inflated sense of what a movie can do she said but you can at least try not to put something out there that you dont believe in
Feb 9 2021,positive, studios used to open their major blockbusters after memorial day over time that release date crept earlier and earlier and now we have captain marvel which just had one of the greatest box office openings ever and its not even spring yet it makes sensemarvels putting out a couple movies a year and theyve got to spread them out but it does seem like a bit much thankfully while captain marvel is definitely a super hero movie it does sidestep some of the usual bythenumbers plot points and finds a pretty novel way to tell its story captain marvel is carol danvers whos fighting alongside an alien race called the kree theyre locked in an interstellar battle with another race called the skrull who have the ability to shapeshift into anyone they see the kree have given danvers many of their powers so shes a sharp fighting machine although she has absolutely no memory of her time before the kree not even that her name is carol danvers she ends up on earth in the 1990s where she meets nick fury the eventual mastermind behind the avengers and where she learns about her own past and that not everyone is what they seem to be  even beyond the skrulls shapeshifting this is marvels most narratively ambitious movie cutting through time and memory and its occasionally a little hard to follow but ill take that trade given that its showing us something new the movie stands just fine on its own itll work even if this is your first marvel movie but it will be more meaningful if youve got a basic idea of what weve seen before and its a major part of the setup for whats to come brie larson plays captain marvel fantastically with determination vulnerability and an emotionally resonant resilience and in the end captain marvel isnt just a worthy hero shes maybe the most powerful one weve ever seen
Jan 29 2021,positive, captain marvel is a film that bears the burden of several responsibilities as the last entry of the marvel cinematic universes phase three before avengers endgame a launchpad for a new avenger and the first femaleled movie of the entire franchise the film wears a myriad of important hats in addition as a followup to the aweinspiring hat trick of thor ragnarok the now oscarwinning black panther and avengers infinity war captain marvel has the unenviable task of living up to a string of significant critical and commercial successes so does the newest member of the avengers deliver in her solo debut yes and no the marvel cinematic universe has an unprecedented track record of quality a streak of 20 films that range from solid to fantastic with few outliers sorry thor the dark world captain marvel isnt a film to tarnish that reputation but at the same time it is also a film that harkens back to the nascent mcu of the late 2000s with much of the esteemed studios worst tendencies back on full display directed by anna boden and ryan fleck half nelson sugar mississippi grind the film buckles under the enormous weight of its responsibilities with messy and uneven storytelling an overreliance on vague cgi and a severely underdeveloped heroine however that isnt to say that captain marvel isnt fun  buoyed by an excellent supporting cast and brie larsons breezy chemistry with samuel l jacksons nick fury the film is a delight when its not taking itself too seriously captain marvel wastes no time introducing us to our protagonist throwing us right in the middle of an alien conflict vers a clever play on carol danvers burnt up dogtag as shes known is an amnesiac member of starforce an elite squad of noble warrior heroes from the kree home planet of hala led by yonrogg jude law cranking up his smarm and charm starforce is on the covert back lines of a conflict with the skrulls a race of greenskinned shapeshifters that are allegedly an invasive and belligerent threat to the entire galaxy when a mission goes awry and vers is captured by the skrulls they set their sights on earth after probing her buried memories the storys setup is problematic right out of the gate  by introducing tidbits of our heroines earthbound history and making her an amnesiac it takes the wind out of its sails almost immediately being privy to important information that our protagonist isnt even aware of the audience is forced to watch vers play catchup for over an hour draining a significant amount of dramatic tension from the film with no memory of who she really is vers is also a literal cipher an unrelatable blank slate that comes into her own way too late as our headlining hero it also doesnt help that the first act is muddled and uninspired  the kreeskrull war just isnt that interesting and a frustratingly dark filter over the picture really confuses the visuals  once danvers crash lands on earth however the film peps up dramatically with the introduction of a deaged samuel l jacksons nick fury the mood lightens and captain marvel really finds its footing brie larson is a tremendously gifted actress coming off a welldeserved best actress win for 2015s room  and even though the occasionally sleepy script doesnt live up to larsons caliber carol danvers shines particularly brightly opposite the films excellent supporting cast whether its an oftentimes hilarious buddycop vibe with nick fury or a deeper exploration of female friendship with maria rambeau a resonant lashana lynch captain marvel is elevated by the characters in danvers orbit  when larson is given the slack to play fast and loose with the cast the pace and energy feels right at home alongside marvels best and while the film suffers from the lack of a real impactful villain there are some refreshingly interesting surprises and swerves in store that give talos the skrull ben mendelsohn more to do than just twirl his mustache unfortunately however with all the things its trying to accomplish captain marvel lets many of its inspired ideas slip through the cracks the films 1990s setting while charming at times feels extremely reductive and haphazard an effective throwback allows its time period and nostalgia to seep into every frame and every corner of the film where it floats in the background as a gentle reminder by no means am i expecting zodiaclevels of fidelity in a marvel superhero film but it needs to be more than just nine inch nails tees blockbuster stores and the occasional no doubt riff  captain marvels 90s references unfortunately are just jarring when they should be seamless the film also suffers from many of the worst attributes of the mcu with tedious cgi sequences and a mostly uninspired third act one only needs to look at danvers encounter with the kree supreme intelligence annette bening pulling double duty in two mostly thankless roles to diagnose many of the marvel universes biggest problems the last act of the film a slapdash clash of cgi beams and explosions has high physical impact but almost zero visceral or emotional heft thanks to captain marvels illdefined superpowers when danvers is finally allowed to cut loose she becomes nigh invincible able to fly through the air and obliterate anything in her path including any stakes the film once had  it seems that ive complained a lot about captain marvel but the truth remains that it isnt a bad film not even close the movie knows how to have its fun even with some glaring flaws brie larson remains a captivating screen presence and even though the film isnt breaking ground like many of marvels other phase three films we did finally get our femaleled superhero film even though it aims to be a biggun headliner captain marvel ends up resembling more of a supporting player and thats just fine there are fates much more dire than fitting right in with marvels library of films for better or worse 
Jan 29 2021,positive, i want to preface this by saying that i may reveal more spoilers than i would otherwise for the sake of the argument i seek to make read ahead with this caution or return here once youve seen the film despite my love of film hollywood makes me groan i understand why its a point of contention for a majority of the general public the shut up and entertain us argument has a leg or two less than it once did now that our president is a former reality star but i understand where the case sits on the list of nauseainducing selfaggrandizement in spite of all this hollywood is finally getting one thing right the expansion of its inclusivity initiative behind my eye rolls and faux gags i think this is incredibly important based on a study released last year i am in the stark minority  somewhere around 18 percent  as a female film critic i dont think about it often but as i sat in captain marvel watching the first female superhero to lead a feature in the marvel universe it struck me just how for lack of a more precise word cool it felt wonder woman made history as the first female headlining super hero but that was a warner brothers film in the dc universe its a fierce movie in its own right directed by a woman to boot while it pains me to even bring the lassowielding hero up  in no article written about batman would i feel obligated to mention superman  thats just where were at still but watching carol danvers aka captain marvel did something to me that wonder woman didnt a note hit higher and truer and stirred something in me maybe its the fact that she doesnt don a sexy outfit revealing her thighs or boobs or both maybe its because she isnt some goddess from a mythical land but an american woman who overcame adversity to work in a mans job both are excellent reasons i could have gravitated to her but its something more than just those things if you dont know captain marvel tells the story of carol danvers played in this iteration by brie larson danvers is a united states air force pilot who has lost all memory of her past and gained supernatural powers that allow her to shoot beams of fire from her palms shes fighting for the kree civilization an alien society from a galaxy far away that seeks to bring peace everywhere by eradicating the rebels skrulls a greenskinned shapeshifting alien race when a mission goes awry danvers is expelled back to earth its 1995 and the soundtrack wont let you forget it with the help of shield agent nick fury samuel l jackson she must choose complete her mission or uncover her past i wont sugarcoat it for you captain marvel is a clunky imperfect origin story there isnt a high enough prescription for your rosy glasses that can prevent you from overlooking some glaring deficiencies some character motivations feel underdeveloped theres a lack of exploring her origin something we traditionally expect in the first film of a franchise larson as the kree warrior is purposefully robotic in her delivery to create an obvious contrast to when she unravels back into carol an artistic choice that while understandable impedes any sort of emotional connection we have with her at first watch this seems to hold the character back a lot taking her for what you see and nothing more carol danvers is as close to onedimensional as weve seen in this genre an uncomplicated superhero whose tribulations growing up play more like a nike ad highlighting snapshots of danvers as a young girl falling and getting back up again without deep diving into anything of substance but carol danvers isnt cold shes doing her job and doing it well she is constantly reprimanded by her mentor played by jude law for succumbing to her emotions instead of allowing logic to guide her fight she is told to suppress her instincts when something rubs her funny she is told not to think for herself not to act unless commanded not to shine like the light that flows through her veins it is only when she releases these invisible bonds  the expectations placed on her the decorum dictated by others et cetera  that she regains her humanity and has full control of her indomitable powers that is her enemy here not aliens and their fight for power but her imprisonment by the rules society places upon her it is the only real struggle we see and i say that quite literally once carol becomes captain marvel in all her flying blazing glory there isnt a battle to fight she  and here are those pesky spoilers  literally takes out dozens of nuclear alien bombs and scares away the aggressors in under a minute maybe two  written and directed by longtime collaborators anna boden and ryan fleck the film doesnt follow the formula typically there is a defining moment in their childhood a turning point often a death of someone close an enemy emerges there is no epic showdown like were used to seeing in these kinds of movies you know where the hero almost dies but somehow regains the strength to defeat the bad guy onehanded in the middle of a snow storm or on top of a moving train thats not what we get here and that can be kind of a bummer we like seeing the underdog fight to survive and come out victorious we want to see them work to show off just how powerful they are so while i also felt let down by the lack of action i left the theater with far more to chew on i felt vindicated too here is a female superhero who once she let herself be the powerful vigilante she was meant to be was more everything than all the male superheroes of the past she personifies strength and courage and shes a character our daughters should see represented on the big screen

Dec 7 2020,positive, vicious war rages between the kree nation and the shapeshifting skrull race after obtaining new intel indicating the skrulls are attempting to acquire a lightspeed engine kree starforce command sends an elite squad of soldiers led by yonrogg jude law to retrieve a spy hidden on a besieged border planet but when the team arrive they are quickly ambushed by skrulls allowing yonroggs brash impulsive recruit vers brie larson to be captured by the enemy probing the girls mind for clues the skrulls discover that a dr wendy lawson annette bening has the technology theyre looking for  and she resides on earth unaware of her own connection to the scientist but determined to stop the skrulls at any cost vers escapes and heads to the human homeworld to find lawson first once there she convinces the leader of a counterterrorism agency nick fury samuel l jackson to aid in her quest to eliminate the skrull menace but as the resolute warrior inches closer to her target memories from her past return threatening to destroy both the mission and her life from the very first scene vers has vaporous orange energy billowing from her fists and shes on another planet much like the alien worlds of star wars serving as a soldier of starforce this introduction instantly generates a difficulty for the cohesiveness of marvels other entities especially since most of those are at the outset earthbound gently easing the extraterrestrial elements into the frame  rather than beginning with outlandishness outright nevertheless the plot itself is actually largely independent from the last few marvel chapters which have been so steeped in storylines and subplots from other pictures that the previous entries were essential prerequisites for understanding the current characters and motives lose control again and youll have to commune with the supreme intelligence despite the standalone nature of captain marvel the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design structuring and visuals not only is vers suffering from amnesia a concept so hackneyed that it initially appears irredeemable but she also hasnt harnessed her superpowers and she doesnt know how she came to be superhuman the eventual revelation offers only further questions during some introductory training and combat missions audiences are treated to a succession of rousing speeches valiant endeavors and physical formidability  all peppered with witty yet unconvincing banter as if the writers were forced to copy the language of guardians of the galaxy whose successes with levity ultimately changed the direction for a lot of the franchises scripting  along with action sequences that are so poorly choreographed that its impossible to know with certainty who is getting the upper hand at any given moment perhaps the filmmakers are using their easy cg accessibility to hide the lack of real fighting skills mustered by the cast as one obligatory set piece follows another a train chase in daylight fairs better allowing viewers to clearly follow the freneticism a prominent 90s soundtrack accompanies each significant transition once again stealing a move from the guardians of the galaxy playbook fortunately its effective especially during climactic showdowns toward the end a blithe buddycop vibe also crops up as vers partners with fury to highlight the inefficiency of deprecated technology and to decipher the colossal advantages of their shapeshifting adversaries curiously the story grows more interesting as the film progresses aiding in mitigating the disappointment of the start the mystery of vers earthly ties paired with the task of discovering her purpose like in the matrix boosts her appeal as she uncovers her past the picture itself begins to find its identity its beneficial too that a glimpse of pathos works its way in comparable to the original iron man through one of its most influential supporting characters you struggle with your emotions despite the storytelling stumbles a number of trite lines and the routine nature of the meteorsized plot holes or standard superhero deficiencies such as a failure to give boundaries to vers abilities or limitations to anyones intermittent invincibility its notable that vers doesnt have a romantic counterpart shes never once driven by cinematic love nor does she need to protect or worse be saved by a lover somehow the film has excluded all scenes of light flirting which are staples of many space operas plus theres not a bared midriff exposed calf or hint of cleavage in sight captain marvel has expunged virtually all sexuality from its premise  and it doesnt hurt it a bit the movie is airy and entertaining with an uncommonly resolute finale all without vers needing any sort of romantic entanglements to connect with or titillate viewers designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Oct 1 2020,positive,captain marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor but regardless its still a satisfying entry in the mcu carried by an effortless star turn from brie larson
Sep 4 2020,positive, if youre expecting captain marvel to inspire the same kind of awe that black panther did you may find yourself a touch disappointed by this anna boden  ryan fleck half nelson directed entry into the marvel comics universe  while black panther carried the weight of an entire culture on its shoulders captain marvel quietly breaks its ground while telling a good story well enough that youll likely find yourself eagerly anticipating the next captain marvel adventure  captain marvel is a good film that does great things for the marvel comics universe the first marvel film to be codirected by a female and second to be centered around a female superhero brie larsons carol danversverscaptain marvel  captain marvel doesnt truly marvel until late in the game choosing to immerse itself in the vastness of larsons depth of talent an academy awardwinner for 2015s room larson brings to captain marvel something ive often found woefully lacking in the marvel comics universe  depth of feeling and emotional expression its not particularly surprising given the indie cred of codirectors boden  fleck but its almost shocking and jarring within the marvel comics universe a universe that has often emphasized razzle dazzle and emotional frazzle  in captain marvel larson plays a kree warrior known as vers who brings a kickass sort of bravura to her usual marvel mix of martial arts meets photon blasts larson not only brings emotional depth to the marvel comics universe she restores the kind of fun and frivolity we used to experience from the universe before avengers started avenging and it seemed like the entire universe became ultra selfaware of its ultra selfimportance  part of that one could suppose is that captain marvel is set in 1995 a time period that allows for more than its share of fun and a time period years before recent events in the marvel comics universe as most vividly indicated by samuel l jacksons rather fresh fulleyed appearance as nick fury theres a freshness to captain marvel that is refreshingly unburdened by coexisting with other storylines at least for the most part within this increasingly layered and complex universe  larsons vers lands on planet earth known as planet c53 within the film and its a place that feels familiar to her with memories good ones of her days as an air force top gunstyle flygirl hardflying and hardpartying and a genuine badass all the way around these scenes serve up hints of bawdiness though were never quite sure just how authentic these memories existing in her mind really are captain marvel is in many ways a film that emphasizes verss search for her place within her powers and her place within the universe  she believes herself to be a kree mentored by kree leader yonrogg jude law a good guy with an aura of being something else that we cant quite define the skrulls are the bad guys led by slimy bad guy taros ben mendelsohn  yet we know that this is a marvel comics universe film and we know that within the universe things are not always as they seem the same may very well be true here but its how larson brings this searching to life even when the script disappoints and it does that makes captain marvel such an infinitely enjoyable film  the way that verss search for her own identity is played out in the usual marvel paintbynumbers way the obvious patriarchal references with the fumbling dogooder spirit of an elmer fudd cartoon yet whats not even remotely paintbynumbers is how larson spiritedly brings it all too life larson is simply far too gifted of an actress to do anything paintbynumbers and she rather magnificently finds every nuance of vers carol danvers and captain marvel  does captain marvel have hints of sexism and stereotype within its storys framework i learned long ago that just as i a film critic with a disability dont tend to listen to those without disabilities when it comes to ableism neither is it my place to speak to a level of sexism ive never experienced i rather look forward to hearing from the nations female critic voices and from audience members as to their own experiences in watching captain marvel  what i will say is that as much as i enjoyed wonder woman i had a deeper appreciation and a fuller understanding of captain marvel captain marvel perhaps owing to its being a true origin story feels more fully alive and vibrant and complex and real while feeling real isnt necessarily a marvel comics universe requirement it works rather nicely here  boden  fleck were seemingly unusual choices to direct within the marvel comics universe their lowbudget indie cred possibly even more indie than a filmmaker like taika watiti and their signature style so pronounced that it was hard to imagine how they could possibly get out of their own ways and really pull this off  the good news they do theyre filmmakers after all while they undeniably have a signature style their work here is in service to the story and the motion picture and while the story itself gets a bit mumbled and jumbled captain marvel works on a far greater level than a good majority of us ever expected captain marvel is both stylish and substantial a film that emphasizes meaning as much as mayhem and a film as much emotional badassery as kickass action sequences will it necessarily please every marvel comics universe fan not a chance is it the best mcu film to come out of the gate nope its not  set in 1995 shield is a fledging agency and jacksons nick fury digitally deaged here is lighter and funnier and doesnt yet have the weight of the universe on his shoulders boden and fleck clearly have fun digging within the blockbuster videodotted landscape of 1995 america and captain marvel feels like a throwback that really isnt that much of a throwback captain marvel gives us the accident in which vers and her superior lawson annette bening crashlanded into a desert and how this crash landing ends up planting within vers and if you dont see the relationship with carol danvers youre not paying attention and ends up giving her the powers that she will have to learn how to harness there is of course a connection to other mcu films if youre watching the details and paying attention to everything that unfolds  on earth larsons carol begins to find her community within the likes of maria rambeau lashana lynch a former flybuddy and her daughter akira akbar while a new group of alien compatriots will enter the picture and add depth and meaning and soul to the entire scenario  captain marvel is the film that it needed to be perhaps just a tad less than we hoped it would be yet if were being honest its also just a tad better than we expected it to be much of this credit goes to larson who embodies the fullness of verscarol danverscaptain marvel with emotional depth action badassery intelligence and an abundance of humor that gives you an identifiable relatable superhero who is more badass than you will ever be boden and fleck rise to the occasion of creating something far outside their usual cinematic universe yet they do so with intelligence wisdom occasional chaos a little too much playing it safe but ultimately more funk than clunk while captain marvel may lack the cultureshifting force of black panther its a force unto itself and a mighty entertaining one at that 
Aug 27 2020,positive, theres a long overdue essence within marvel cinematic universe  ten years of interconnected and episodic storytelling of a maledriven diaspora we finally get to see marvels first femaleled adventure story  captain marvel if there is something weve learnt recently from the cinematic world wonder woman black panther and even crazy rich asians have all represented the incremental changes that highlight the world we see  captain marvel flies into the fold as another step forward in that enriched development theres no escaping the magnitude  its a huge deal and as the cinematic universe gears up for its literal endgame the role she will play will be pivotal in reshaping its future  the disgusting troll behaviour can have their meltdowns attack brie larson for the relevant comments about the lack of diversity amongst press critics and proceed with an attempted derailment in its financial prospects  but as captain marvel soars at the box office its another indicator at how inclusion speaks volumes in captivating and inspiring the audience  in other words you cant stop progression but as the quality of the film goes captain marvel continues the trend of solid additions as part of the mcu lineup  its far from perfect but does enough to provide the escapist fun and entertainment needed to roll into its anticipated main event if avengers infinity war was the emotional and consequential reckoning of thanos finger snap captain marvel is the lighthearted joyful pickmeup  straight out of the phase one manifesto  captain marvels introduction attempts to balance character story a connect the dots mysteryarc with the lingering question that everyone had on their minds since the end of infinity war immediately for directors anna boden and ryan fleck the rush of juggling the exposition and pressure to tell carol danvers brie larson story struggles in its opening act  thrust into the bigbudget hollywood machine and occasionally their lack of experience shows its an understandable slow start  similar to wonder womans transition from the comics to her cinematic debut the carol danvers story has evolved undergoing a transforming cultural shift from the sexualised damsel in distress characterisation that was laced with controversy into a feminist icon  when there has been a lack of exposure for female superheroes on the big screen resorting to comparisons is a pointless exercise  the carol danvers story is another female example where her uniqueness doesnt conform to a standardise agenda or stereotype as a single definition of a female superhero  shes not called marvels mightiest avenger for no reason and her quick introduction covers her struggling grasp of reality and physical training in an offworld environment known as hala that is preparing her for an upcoming mission against the skrulls  however rough around the edges its better than an empty void its also understandable when our central character is starting from an unconventional position already possessing her powers from the getgo having no prior introduction besides the pager reveal in infinity war and informing noncomic audiences with the basic information about her character thats a lot to take in especially when we are used to a conventional template structure where character arcs are defined by the growth from their powers  captain marvels beginnings are psychological rather than physical not driven by ego or arrogance tony stark or a physical disadvantage steve rogers  its not weighed down by a burdening love interest nor is it overly sexualised  again the transitions are not perfect choosing to rush to its endpoint but as i said before its better than an empty void thankfully captain marvel finds its feet once it escapes the space drama  crash landing on earth circa 1995 through a blockbuster video store aka the biggest statement of its cultural environment it adopts the classic fish out of water scenario that weve seen previously in the first two captain america films it grounds its narrative into something tangible warming in a 90s glaze with cultural milestones to independence day pulp fiction and the long kiss goodnight thanks to carols partnership with nick fury a deaged samuel l jackson and even the xfiles with a classic alien autopsy scene just reading that sentence i can already envision the outrage  what  are you mad  dont you dislike that director  girl bye  my response would be like the emperor from star wars  good release your anger if michael bay had directed captain marvel it would have been atrociously incoherent  if you take a look at the transformers films for example collectively they tick all of the tropebased boxes he has defined himself by fast editing cuts headacheinducing action spectacles sexual objectification horribly misguided societal stereotypes and juvenile lampooning  youll be glad to know thats not where my head was thinking  but at least i got your attention regardless but think back to the decade in which captain marvel is set  in that repertoire you had films like bad boys the rock and armageddon  arguably peak bay  or let me lead this with better examples from directors that helped shape the decade  tony scott with the last boy scout crimson tide and enemy of the state or james cameron with terminator 2 judgment day and true lies which got an explosive nod in the film  yes these examples are hypermasculine adventures that subject their lead characters to heroic statuses sadly femaleled actionadventure films were far and few in between  yes those examples were maledriven by male directors with a male gaze  but from a visual aesthetic which is important to note those films embodied a larger than life quality where it was bombastically over the top  specifically with michael bay and tony scott their commercial backgrounds opened the doors to oversaturated shots low camera angles and dramatic lighting that embraced a dynamic colour palette and composition  take away the flaws in its narration and maybe watch it with the sound off but when the magnetism is done right it creates a recognisable excitement within its direction that perfectly captures a mood  whenever i think of the 90s amongst all the treasures and cultures that captain marvel managed to revisit the visual stylisation didnt go far enough to put this in a broader context as to why i think this is important think back to the impact of ryan cooglers black panther  when it was nominated for best picture at the 2019 oscars the typical backlash appeared  it was good but was it oscarworthy  in a rarity amongst the mcu films black panther felt different on a cultural basis it positively showcases an african civilisation escaping the damaging yet reinforced stereotypes often perpetuated in the media as criminals gangsters jivetalkers mammy figures povertystricken citizens generic tribal figures comic sidekicks or angry black women  were introduced to a black superhero in the mcu who is allowed to be the hero with female characters empowered by their confidence and contributing voice  that essence is cultivated within wakanda an integral part of its evaluation with afrofuturism and beauty running through its veins  its an aspect you rarely question and because coogler establishes an identity behind its multilayered concept its presentation made the fictionalisation of wakanda believable  whether you agreed it was oscarworthy or not its still unlike any other mcu film to date with the degradation of the visual effects in the third act its only fault  also its just a great bleeping movie  end of story honestly this is just a personal preference  summing up the 90s with every factoid is an impossible mission for a twohour movie  this was not going to be the conair of the mcu although visually that would have been cool and youre not going to get brie larson and samuel l jackson singing aerosmiths i dont want to miss a thing as its end credits  your enjoyment of captain marvel is not hinged on this point  who knows the decision could have been intentional avoiding alienation from unfamiliar fans who may not have lived through that culture  but i feel like it missed a trick in not indulging that atmosphere if you look at the impact of netflixs stranger things and how the 80s is tightly interwoven within its plot structure it acknowledges the subtle balance of reinforced nostalgia and an engaging mystery told through that familiarity even captain america the first avenger sold 40s america with soft visual palettes and patriotic jingoism from star spangled man therefore captain marvel acknowledges blockbuster video acknowledges the cdrom joke which was brilliant and even acknowledges the jukebox collection of garbage no doubt tlc and nirvana but because of its lack of interest in absorbing its atmosphere its exploration of the decade could have been a richer experience in the end captain marvel played it safe it was the 90s but dealt with a modern lens the mcu shouldnt be afraid of making their films stand out visually  instead some scenes have a washedout palette  baring in mind this commentary is not directed solely at captain marvel as if it is the only victim of this trait  other mcu films have suffered the same visual characteristics  but the suggestive visual throwbacks could have been a small gesture without brazenly going over the top  could marvel have placed a twist in that convention  it wouldnt have impacted the heart and soul of its overall narrative especially when brie larson carries the film with assurance and confidence its unfair to label bries characterisation of carol danvers as robotic weak or stiff  i mean lets not forget the smile more commentary directed towards her in which she had a brilliant response on instagram thanks to jane ritts poster memes  as detrimental as they are these societal elements neatly feed into captain marvels response and its goalachieving message the film utilises female stigmatisation as its driving motivator exposed through carols fractured memories where shes criticised for being a woman  theres no escaping the subtlety  carol is told shes told he wont make it as a pilot because its named a cockpit for a reason  yonrogg jude law is the embodiment of misogyny and patriarch control  the exploration is basic but the referential aspects illustrate the daily subjugation women face  whether its labels disparaging language or double standards they are gestures which rob a voice and identity which thematically sums up captain marvel for carol danvers identity is defined by others around her  supreme intelligence annette bening and yonrogg are examples of fear and control curtailing her natural curiosity for emotional repression  you cant be a good soldier if youre doing the in my feelings challenge  her brainwashed indoctrination into the kree lifestyle is a mission of blind faith which goes unquestioned and unchallenged until carol arrives on earth  she wears a chip on her neck which limits her powers for 34 of the film you cant get more on the nose than that it says a lot about its messaging where trying to find your place in the world can have a relatable outcome  its a weak argument to suggest that carol lacks personality when her personality is wrapped up in the conflicts surrounding her  showcasing her allegiance as a noble warrior hero its a reinforced ideology which is no different from warlords recruiting child soldiers or individuals groomed into extreme factions for terrorist causes  they are timely conversations about rhetoric agendas and its consequential damages especially in regards to refugees and the nature of war in which ben mendelsohns talos is the one to watch out for  a pleasant reversal from characters he has played in the past  where it starts to fall into resemblance is carols growing sense of humanity finding her wit in her partnership with nick fury with some terrific samuel l jackson reactions and vulnerability in her friendship with maria rambeau lashana lynch  the power of change resides within her however despite its implied context the marvel cinematic universe is still limited by design  it wants to be brave and challenging yet its concepts are given a brush stroke treatment remembering that it needs to be in certain places to make sure its overall arc aligns with the rest of the franchise  given the longevity of its storytelling its something that we probably take for granted accepting the flaws as a natural given  but as a sacrifice we also lose out on further character definition to make this film more complete how cool would it have been if the formula was broken for a split second to allow the fullweight of carols revelation to sink in  show anger or a rage knowing that six years of her life went missing where she was used as a weapon for an unjust war  how cool would it have been to delve more into her struggling insecurities between her reality and her memories or play up the dividing paranoia of anyone could be a skrull  again it doesnt dismiss the enjoyment but it provides brie larson and her counterparts with more ample material to play with that adds more flavour to the pot it leaves you with a feeling of wanting more  it could have utilised more of the buddy cop partnership between carol danvers and a softer catloving nick fury  it could have featured more scenes with maria utilising the breadth of emotional history they share  gemma chans minnerva was underused and should have gotten more screen time  it ventures to certain points but teases a threshold thats never crossed  it doesnt make it a bad movie just a missed opportunity to further embrace its hearts and motives despite the notable limitations captain marvel delightfully serves its purpose both as a final cornerstone in this epiclong saga but the inspiration gained from seeing a female superhero on screen  its not quite the revolutionary or pioneering film that we expected it to be but it introduces scope for growth and scale that hopefully is not lost amongst all the loosethreads posed for avengers endgame great writeup i really enjoyed this movie and the addition of carol danvers to the mcu but it felt like it was missing just a little something that would have taken it from good to great agreed and i think a lot of that has sadly come from the limitations of the universe building from the mcu playing safe in making sure everything lines up in the bigger picture nevertheless its a good start but it easily could have been more than what was delivered yeah i am hoping that going forward the mcu will be less interconnected so they can tell some standalone stories that feel a little more unique ill be curious to see what happens after endgame and if that really does serve as a reset for the mcu 
Aug 16 2020,positive,the stakes are far too small for what should be a momentous marvel movie and larson doesnt get to kick anywhere near enough shapeshifting butt
Aug 15 2020,positive,if the emotion falls a little short though the movie soars with its comedy and action elements
Jul 27 2020,negative,the movie doesnt go far enough in any direction grounding itself in a mildly entertaining but surprisingly passé center
Jul 24 2020,positive, its hard to believe it took 21 installments before marvel introduced a female lead especially with scarlett johanssons black widow jennifer lawrences mystique and halle berrys storm ironically its the one area where the dc extended universe actually beat marvel to punch thanks to the blockbuster success of gal gadot in patty jenkins wonder woman 2017 be that as it may the time has finally arrived with captain marvel a film that plays it safe with familiar formula but is so entertainingly empowering that it will inspire girls everywhere the story opens with former us air force pilot carol danvers brie larson as a member of the intergalactic fleet starforce fighting alongside kree to battle the rival alien skrulls along the way shes haunted by visions of her human past forcing a return to planet c53 earth where she overcomes her amnesia to discover the source and extent of her super powers oscar winner brie larson is a compelling choice for the lead having appeared in the quasisuperhero flick scott pilgrim vs the world 2010 her breakthrough came in the south by southwest champion short term 12 2013 followed by the spectacular now 2013 trainwreck 2015 and her best actress win for room 2015 which remains one of the best films of this century since then shes stumbled a bit from the overblown kong skull island 2017 to the lackluster adaptation of the bestselling book the glass castle 2017 now captain marvel is the blockbuster rebound she needed thrusting her into the spotlight for a whole new generation of young moviegoers to admire ironically shes an enigmatic icon whose personality remains uncertain due to the amnesic premise of carol piecing together her backstory alongside the audience we never feel like we get to know her until the final act at least she holds her own in the action sequences starting the film in a training bout of handtohand combat the scene opens with her already on the ground joking that she was just punched in the face by her male counterpart at first we think this is a calculated attempt by marvel to avoid manonwomen violence but the scene ends with such a punch on screen its a fascinating cultural bellwether showing the erratic evolution of hollywood ethics from a acceptability with james cagney grapefruits in the public enemy and cary grant face palms in the philadelphia story to b a taboo subject only reserved for villains ie michael slapping kay in the godfather part ii to c now equal footing in men vs women slugfests jude law and annette bening memorably play flip sides of the coin respectively playing her alien mentor yonrogg and her human mentor marvell rounding out the cast are ben mendelsohn as the shapeshifting skrull leader and lashana lynch as the wise veteran friend maria raising her precocious daughter monica akira akbar young beth from this is us best of all we get the glue to the entire marvel cinematic universe mr samuel l jackson who was digitally deaged 25 years in order to play a young nick fury the technology has increasingly improved over the past decade including arnold schwarzenegger as the t800 in terminator genisys 2015 and carrie fisher as princess leia in rogue one 2016 its also fun to see fury before the eye patch as we learn exactly how he lost his eye its hilarious beyond the deep roster the most memorable roles are actually cameos first by an adorable cat named goose ie top gun and second a touching tribute to the late stan lee in both the opening credits and his final cameo my vote if they can digitally deage jackson they should keep digitally putting stan lee in every marvel film surely hed want it that way filmmakers anna boden and ryan fleck half nelson carry on lees legacy of lighthearted popcorn fare despite a slow start in outer space bogged down by a gloomy cluttered act 1 like aquaman its disorienting to fracture the narrative of an origin story rolling out the source of her powers in jarring flashbacks rather than active highstakes moments its too cute by half and the one place where a more linear approach would prove more accessible there are other more formulaic moments as larson spares the villain for another sequel we wont spoil why or how but its consistently odd how superheroes have no qualms killing a million henchmen then feel guilty about harming the evil mastermind in the final showdown do supervillains pay superheroes under the table to ensure that theres another prize fight while this reveals flaws of the larger franchise model theres no denying the nostalgic joy of the fun and games in act 2 the script takes off when larson lands on earth for a distinctly men in black vibe genuinely surprising plot twists and plenty of 90s pop culture references youll delight at cdrom gags nine inch nails tshirts and blockbuster video settings where larson zaps a cardboard cutout of true lies and inspects a vhs copy of the right stuff hailed by the washington post for his savantlike ability to name every best picture winner in history jason fraley began at wtop as morning drive writer in 2008 film critic in 2011 and entertainment editor in 2014 providing daily arts coverage onair and online
Jul 20 2020,positive,at a positively brisk two hours the film has an oldschool action movie vibe that is a longoverdue introduction to a character who holds great promise in years to come
Jul 20 2020,positive, late into captain marvel the firstever femalefronted superhero film from the marvel cinematic universe mcu a series of sequences shows carol danvers physically falling and rising at different junctures in her life every small act that she completes of getting up on her feet after hitting the ground is a sort of replay of the mishap that put her the alien kree capital of hala as much as it is a pointer to the big flight that she is will take once she is able to figure out how and why she is meant to be an invincible superhero her fallandrise montage is at the same time a measure of the magnitude of the struggle that her ascent has been  and her battles will be going forward captain marvel mcus 21st movie and the first codirected by a woman anna boden plays largely by the rules of the genre but it juggles with its narrative sequencing to mirror the unsteady state of the protagonists mind which assailed by selfdoubt and amnesia this is therefore a solid characterdriven arc not surprising because the lead brie larson and boden and her directing partner ryan fleck have come this far in their respective careers on the back of subtly affecting human stories crafted in the independent space both the actress and the two directors newcomers to this scale and nature of moviemaking are able to infuse the story of the creation of a new avenging angel with a degree of freshness both in terms of substance and narrative approach the film might appear a touch lowkey but that could well be the principal factor that sets it apart from most of the others that have gone before captain marvel set in the mid1990s is an origin story but it works also as a selfcontained tale of a girl who discovers that she can fly and shoot photon blasts from her supercharged hand larson is terrific as verscarol danverscaptain marvel she is infinitely better at etching out a believable figure than gal wonder woman gadot who had to fall back on more conventional means the room actress brings the skills that she displayed in her oscarwinning performance in the hostage drama to bear emphatically upon the fleshing out of a largerthanlife alienhuman hybrid warrior who has to reckon with many hurdles on the way to claiming her place as one of the most powerful superheroes among the avengers larson is impressive as she moves smoothly from the discovery of her superhuman qualities to the understanding of her purpose in the universe to the emotional tugs and pulls of friendship  with her flying companion and best friend maria rambeau lashana lynch with whom she is reunited which ignites in her mind flashes of the past as does the incursions into her memory by skrull leader talos ben mandelsohn  and fractured remembrances footage from the next marvel outing the avengers endgame is revealed half way through the films end credits it is set for release in april with five more captain marvel entries up ahead larson seems rather well suited for the job but she does in ways that are markedly different from the ones that conventional screen superheroes are known to favour the lead actress receives great support from a cast of charismatic actors  annette bening in a dual role samuel l jackson as nick fury digitally deaged minus the eyepatch and with a full mop of hair and jude law as yonrogg the mentor of vers supposedly the best version of carol danvers that the film introduces at the outset surprisingly one of the most consummate scenestealers in captain marvel is a cat you sit up and expect a surprise every time the feline actor is on the screen other enjoyable moments are delivered by the game of verbal oneupmanship that carol and fury play in one sequence the two banter over whether marvel or marvell rings better fury mentions the 60s africanamerican girl group the marvelettes and insists that marvel scores higher on the phonetic front it is an injoke of course but does it contribute anything to the narrative besides a bit of mild diversion the rushed first quarter of captain marvel is strewn with moments and characters that come and go without causing a ripple so you may not marvel at some of the films jabs at revisionism yet owing to a lively pivotal performance captain marvel generally flies well clear of the turbulences in its path when she is just vers  an abbreviation of danvers  a warrior in the elite kree military unit starforce yonrogg advises her to control her impulses because there is nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion there isnt much point in the advice she unaware why she has wound up in hala the audience does know vers is a former us air force pilot who now has super strength but does not quite know how to channel it she is a crucial cog in the kree wheel in the fight against the skrulls a race of shapeshifting aliens threatening to overrun the universe there is too much crammed in the initial stages the twohour film for all of it to make sense captain marvel hits its strides once carol danvers at the end of a botched mission returns to earth crashing through the roof of a blockbuster store it is the 90s and six years have elapsed since the aircraft crash that separated carol from her best friend maria rambeau lashana lynch the reunion is inevitably emotional if not always convincing and it imparts a strongly human touch to the tale carol teams up with fury who is still figuring out the ropes of being a shield agent they form an unlikely pair  not that captain marvel warms up to him immediately  but they complement each other as they go about defying expectations and seeking to pull off the impossible of course captain marvel is a superhero movie and nothing is impossible here apart from the slew of de rigueur action sequences the films sense of humanity and dollops of wry humour  this despite the fact that yonrogg asserts early on in unambiguous terms that humour is a distraction for a warrior  keep it flowing pretty nicely if not an outright marvel this script has more warmth than and just as much power as wonder woman
Jul 13 2020,positive, finally the mcu has followed warner bros dc lead with delivering its first female lead superhero film despite the dummy throwing of certain fanboys for this particular comic book adaptation leading the charge with our own reallife feminist hero in brie larson a woman who has been compared to hitler simple for stating she wanted a more diverse roster of press on the recent tour for the film like the character she has had to fight off some pretty toxic attitudes and she has done it with style set during the 90s and pre avengers larson plays carol danvers aka vers aka captain marvel a fierce fighting machine on an elite kree military team with no recollection of her past under the guidance of jude laws yonrogg vers tries to control her powers which spiral into a superhuman strength once her emotions take hold if there are any comparisons to be made with an emotional woman at this point i for one dont mind being compared to a scary mean fighting machine when my emotions take over the origin story gives birth to our new saviour  if rumours are too believed in regards to avengers endgame  as vers takes root on earth while on a mission to stop an intergalactic war between two alien forces we arent just here to see a fierce woman save worlds we are here to witness her journey of selfdiscovery a journey that opens up her mind to a new world of possibilities with a subtle hint of unspoken feminism a token raising of the eyebrow or a damning look with an allknowing smirk screaming to the fellas i am just as good as you are in fact watch this im better comedy has always been a staple of this universe and its still here in abundance why not pair that with the internets most cherished thing a cat by the name of goose once belonging to annette benings marvell goose plays a pivotal part in the second half of the film pairing the cat with a deaged and eyepatch less nick fury samuel l jackson hit a few moments of comedy gold oh if youre still asking the question of how fury came to lose his eye all is explained here directors anna boden and ryan fleck have come from an indie background with films such as ryan goslings half nelson and mississippi grind atheistically their grainy raw stamp gives the picture an edge we dont usually experience in the genre its a perfect pairing for its 90s nostalgia setting heavily featuring a mixtape soundtrack of iconic tracks to a crash landing scene in which a blockbuster store breaks vers fall youve got that top gun vibe with the switched genderflip and most importantly it speaks to all those little girls always pigeonholed as tomboys screaming the message no matter how many times youre knocked down get back up and try again even captain marvels ascent into space has an animated cgi vision you would expect from any good 90s kids series larson brings an understated cheekiness to captain marvel sometimes vying on the corny in her superhero stance she gives meaning to an unusually nuanced character fury can almost be considered jacksons second skin but here 90s fury is still wet behind the ears full of naivety and optimism before the cynicism creeps in ben mendelsohn as the shapeshifting skrull talos is nothing short of deceptive drama and tickling funny full of knowing nods to the universe including agents of shield its bound to push a few buttons when fury stumbles on the name for his team of superheroes  avengers like any of these films its always worth waiting until the very end credit has left the screen
Jul 8 2020,positive, after ten years and twenty films the marvel cinematic universe has finally provided us with a femalelead entry captain marvel 2019 contains much of what weve come to expect from a superhero origin  both positively and negatively there are some peaks and valleys all throughout the narrative resulting in a story that has some showstopping moments but is also hindered by the limitations of having to fit into a larger overall canvas this isnt as great as wonder woman 2017 was but thats ok captain marvel brie larson has some of the cooler powers weve seen on screen she has the ability to fly shoot flames from her hands has elevated strength and when she really cuts loose can ignite an energy explosion from her body that resembles an atom bomb needless to say you dont want to get on her bad side on a more personal level she goes by the name of vers member of an alien race known as the kree who have been engaged in a long war against the skrulls a greenskinned species that has the ability to transform into other forms of life under the guidance of her mentor yonrogg jude law vers has to learn to control her powers so that she can effectively protect her people or does she codirectors anna boden and ryan fleck who helped write the screenplay with geneva roberstondworet gives us a glimpse into another side of captain marvel that she is not fully aware of we get flashbacks to a human life on earth as a fighter pilot known as carol danvers working on a hush hush project under a mysterious boss annette bening the flashbacks come fast and often filling up much of the plot the editing jumbles these bits tossing them around so frequently that much of the mystery behind captain marvel is revealed by the time we get to the aha moment the setting is in the 1990s this allows us to see the birth of shield the government agency that will become a force once the instory timeline arrives to the avengers 2012 thanks to the magic of cgi deaging we get introduced to a younger agent coulson clark gregg and nick fury samuel l jackson  still with both eyes  who joins captain marvels adventure the setting the question of captain marvels past the twists and turns in alliances and betrayals contributes to a cluttered overall whole theres a lot going on here and not much time to sit back and iron out all the wrinkles  from carol danvers past vers responsibility to the kree and battle against the skrulls the vagueness of benings character and to nick fury birthing the idea of a superhero team all of these pieces are mushed together barely holding on to coherency luckily brie larson sits as the anchor providing a performance in which all other elements revolve around while the plotting is a little messy larsons commanding presence helps us feel like were never lost her work as captain marvelversdanvers is a combination of strength confusion and determination and never at any point does she feel like shes reaching for a reaction ive read in other reviews that her character arc is like mavericks tom cruise in top gun 1986 but that is only partially true where maverick had to learn to control his emotions captain marvel has to learn to let go and ride her instincts to their fullest potential there is a poignant moment in which we see her at different ages stand to her feet after taking a fall while the execution is clunky the theming behind it is all too clear  this is a person who wont give up i really wanted to like captain marvel more than i did but i couldnt help the passive feeling i got walking out of it it suffers much of the same issues that plague other mcu titles especially when it comes to the depiction of action once again we have set pieces in which the framing and editing hinders us from seeing what the hell is going on an early battle scene set on a remote alien planet is so under lit and covered in smokefog that we cant tell who is doing what all we get are dark silhouettes firing energy blasts against other silhouettes and when captain marvel attempts to escape an enemy spaceship the camera shoots the hand to hand combat so up close that we cant see whats happening its just arms and legs flailing around edited together to give the impression of action fortunately the production sticks the landing with a highoctane climactic battle but at that point its almost too late of a recovery an even bigger issue is the abundant pop culture references that are splattered throughout i get that this takes place during a certain time and thus the filmmakers were obligated to provide symbols representative of the era but the film is so stuffed with them that it became a distraction do we really need captain marvel crash landing into a blockbuster video store the soundtrack  consisting of 90s grungepoprock songs is questionable at best hearing nirvana no doubt salt n pepa and hole ring out while watching the movie may work for some but for me came off as shoehorned theres a lot to like with captain marvel but theres a lot to forget as well its perfectly fine it doesnt bring the superhero genre to new heights but its not a train wreck either at this point the mcu has solidified their blueprint on giving the audience what they want but holding back just enough to keep them coming back for more in that regard captain marvel  warts and all  works according to plan
Jul 5 2020,neutral,the direction is boring the acting is boring the writing is boringthis is pretty boring
Jul 2 2020,positive,in a marvel cinematic universe that has grown increasingly complex and interwoven captain marvel succeeds by sticking to the basics
Jun 30 2020,positive,  b really this movie makes the mediocre marvel movies look extraordinary by comparison this movie was literally shoehorned into the schedule as a direct response to the success of dcs wonder woman the plot if you really want to call it that is weak almost every reference to a previous marvel film is completely contradictory and lets be honest character is by far and away the weakest link in this particular chain perhaps you were given a different cut of the movie to critique i would suggest watching say the first ironman movie then watching captain marvel again id be surprised if you didnt have a change of perspective afterwards 
Jun 30 2020,positive, vers brie larson a warrior of the kree empire who can fire photon blasts from her hands is having recurring nightmares about her mysterious past when she talks about it to her mentor yonrogg jude law he urges her to control her emotions and take control of her powers she along with a team of other kree warriors was sent on a mission to rescue one of their operatives lost in a nearby planet overrun by krees rival race the skrulls during this mission their team was ambushed and vers was captured by their leader talos ben mendelsohn the skrulls used a memory probe on her to extract information causing her to remember parts about her past including her relationship with a dr wendy lawson annette bening she escapes from the skrulls and crashlands on earth with the aliens still in pursuit she contacts yonrogg for backup and he urges her to stay put on earth the crash attracted shield agents nick fury samuel l jackson and phil coulson clark gregg they talk to vers who told them about a possible skrull infiltration unless she first finds who theyre looking for nick offers to assist her in finding lawson first as they search vers starts to piece together her past and meet with her best friend before the events that led her to kree talos and the other skrulls inevitably catch up with vers talos shows her proof about her true identity and how she ended up with the kree they locate lawsons laboratory and find what the skrulls were really after yonrogg and his team eventually find vers and a big confrontation between kree and skrulls happen vers a trained warrior finds out about her lost past and rethinks her allegiances its an origin story for captain marvel as well as other key figures and plot points in the larger marvel cinematic universe like nick fury agent coulson and the tesseract brie larson rose to fame in 2016 after winning an oscar for her work in the film room but before her big win she has been working for over 15 years appearing in shortlived tv shows as well as supporting roles in films like scott pilgrim vs the world the spectacular now and trainwreck her last big film prior to captain marvel was kong skull island in 2017 when hes not playing nick fury in the mcu samuel l jackson is a prolific actor appearing in iconic movies such as pulp fiction and frequently works with director quentin tarantino he was also in the star wars prequels as the jedi mace windu and is the voice of craig t nelson in the incredibles movies you may have also seen him in the cult thriller snakes on a plane no stranger to big film franchises jude law was last seen playing the young professor albus dumbledore in fantastic beasts the crimes of grindelwald he was also dr john watson to fellow mcu pal robert downey jrs sherlock holmes in the sherlock holmes film franchise 90s kids would also remember him as haley joel osments fellow robot friend in ai artificial intelligence he may be heavily madeup as a skrull leader in the film but you may have already seen him in big blockbusters like the dark knight rises ready player one and rogue one a star wars story as orson krennic he also stars in the netflix show bloodline with linda cardinelli who is also part of the mcu as hawkeyes wife annette bening is a wellknown dramatic actress having earned four oscar nominations for the grifters american beauty being julia and the kids are alright you might have seen her in movies like the film adaptation of anton chekhovs the seagull starring saoirse ronan or the 2016 drama 20th century women costarring elle fanning and greta gerwig 1 actors clark gregg reprising his role as agent coulson and samuel l jackson were digitally deaged in the movie the mcu has used this technology before in captain america civil war guardians of the galaxy vol 2 and the antman movies 2 aside from nick fury and agent coulson other previous mcu characters that appear in this prequel are ronan the accuser lee pace and korath djimon hounsou who both originally appeared in guardians of the galaxy 3 brie larson is allergic to cats and performed opposite a puppet or video effects for her scenes with goose the cat the cat was also renamed after a character from top gun in the film in the comics he was called chewie after the wookie from the star wars franchise 4 this is the first mcu film released after stan lees death he makes a cameo in two scenes in this film and has reportedly filmed his cameos for avengers endgame and spiderman far from home captain marvel on the surface feels like your typical superhero origin story where an unsuspecting person finds out theyre meant for bigger things there are chase sequences and fight sequences aliens and tech centuries away from being realistic in this regard this film is no different from others in the genre it even takes a while before we get a sense of carol danvers or vers as a character its somewhat of a nostalgia trip not just for the 90s but with its little callbacks to other parts of the mcu mcus usual tricks like stan lees cameo now poignant because of his passing slow reveals to how exactly carol fits into the larger world is satisfying and exciting but if this is your first ever mcu movie they might be easy to miss all of the things that may make the film seem limited such as its reliance on exposition and its quick pace is due to it needing to serve the larger narrative remember that each mcu movie isnt a stand alone an origin movie isnt just an origin movie but a sequel to whichever film came before it as well as a chapter of something larger thats a lot of things to pack into one film where you have to introduce a completely new character and her world it really shines when it isnt working too hard to tie itself to the larger universe it serves vers and furys partnership is highly enjoyable with their characters being a perfect fit for each other they trust each other pretty quickly and you dont really question it either brie larson and samuel l jacksons dynamic is really the core of this film jude laws character yonrogg is one of mcus more interesting spoiler villains jude always so amiable on screen is not hard to trust which makes the movies second act twist even more exciting the films exemplary strength is how it explored its themes that address the feminist pursuit and even the refugee crisis when the plot turns itself on his head with the fight between the skrulls and the kree the allegory to the plight of refugees is not at all subtle which works in the films favor its an important point the movie was trying to make and they made it very clearly this call for empathy is such a moving moment and that emotion was carried through the fight scenes we see carol fight singlehandedly like a badass and as a woman its so empowering to watch her final confrontation with yonrogg was also particularly cathartic we see her break away literally and figuratively from him and his control disguised as care and mentorship captain marvel is of course necessary viewing for marvel fans who just want to know everything about the cinematic universe it is full of satisfying callbacks and backstories for fanfavorite characters like agent coulson and nick fury this is the kind of film everyone should watch if only to understand and gain empathy for the plight and struggles of other people it teaches audiences to look closer at their personal relationships and assess whether the people closest to us are helping or actually harming our growth i recommend it to females everywhere especially young girls who should be taught that each and every one of them are forces to be reckoned with i recommend it to males too captain marvel is an exploration of complex female strength and while she is different from

Jun 28 2020,positive, its time once again to revisit the marvel cinematic universe enough time has passed to temper the emotions felt at the conclusion of avengers infinity war as well as during the midcredits scene of antman and the wasp in fact its time to go back in time to meet one of the greatest superheroes in the entire universe its time for captain marvel the year 1995 the place hala home planet of the kree a race of warriors previously seen in guardians of the galaxy as the race of ronan the accuser their elite team is known as starforce led by yonrogg jude law for several years now he has been helping one of their members vers brie larson learn how to control her special powers vers has no idea how she acquired these powers nor anything about her past hala is ruled by the supreme intelligence an ai that appears to everyone as the person they most admire to vers it appears as a woman annette bening who of course vers has no recollection of ever knowing though after being captured by the krees mortal enemies the skrulls and interrogated vers learns where this woman might be a planet that its inhabitants call earth while on earth she meets a rookie shield agent named phil coulson clark gregg and his superior nick fury samuel l jackson who currently still has the use of both eyes fury gets pulled into vers mission to stop the skrulls that have followed her a difficult task since they can alter their appearance to mimic anyone theyve seen during their search vers learns that she may have come from earth her real name may be carol danvers and she discovers the origin of her powers captain marvel hits all the right buttons for an mcu origin story while also pushing a few that make it stand out from the others writingdirecting team anna boden and ryan fleck along with cowriter geneva robertsondworet have significantly changed the characters story from the comics but in a way that not only updates her for a modern audience it also meshes her into the creation of the mcu of course its difficult to view captain marvel without the inevitable comparisons to wonder woman both are significantly groundbreaking in depicting strong female leads in very positive ways with doses of similarity and difference the backward time jump both films take is the obvious similarity this allows both characters their own moments in the sun setting them apart from their male superhero counterparts yet while wonder woman is allowed to carry the full weight of her plot captain marvel has to share you see this film isnt just the origin of captain marvel in a way its the origin of shields current incarnation where they now realize that there are worlds beyond our limited understanding of the universe and both threats and allies can be found out there while it is a bit disappointing that marvel decided to do this with their plot its also understandable wonder woman wasnt just trying to stand out from the malecentric entries it was also trying to stand out from what up to that point many viewed as a disappointing franchise in contrast the mcu is not only a decade strong now its also all about connectivity so while a small part of me wishes that captain marvel could have been allowed to hold the entire plot on her own the rest of my brain gets why shield has to play a role its here that we really have to credit the filmmakers even though they had to give part of the plot away captain marvel doesnt suffer when it comes to character development we follow along with carol as she fits the pieces of her missing memory together thus we get to know her well and we get to grow with her too this brings in another major difference between captain marvel and wonder woman diana had to rely on then fall in love with steve trevor in order to give her final act purpose and gravity carol has no romantic lead to play off and is all on her own despite having fury along for the ride whos really only there to help her navigate this unfamiliar world in fact captain marvels real emotional connection to earth ends up being maria rambeau lashana lynch her best friend from her life as carol as well as marias daughter monica another fun bit boden and fleck add to the mix is music taking a cue from james gunn they pepper the film with hits from the 1990s giving the soundtrack a very now thats what i call music feel it works in the fun way that the songs in the guardians films and the 1980s music used in bumblebee did even adding that certain something to a couple key scenes speaking of music i have to mention the fantastic score by pinar toprak like mark motherbaughs score to thor ragnarok she has produced incidental music that is both playfully fun and sweepingly grand with tiny bits of synthwave periodically sprinkled in for good measure captain marvel is a familiar origin story that terrifically stands on its own merits coming at the right time for both the mcu and the real world hearst television participates in various affiliate

May 29 2020,positive, by dan tabor film critic captain marvel  arrives at an interesting inflection point in the marvel comics universe preceding the apocalyptic events of infinity war by decades while introducing what could possibly be their most powerful superhero yet the film is directed by the husbandwife team of anna boden and ryan fleck who have a demonstrable knack for complex character building which is surely why they were chosen to bring marvels first female led superhero film to theaters brie larson was recruited for the title role fresh off her oscar winning turn in room which only amplified the feeling that this film was going to be something a bit different than the testosteronesoaked popcorn fodder weve come to expect from marvel taking place in 1995 the film begins on the kree planet of hala where vers brie larson as she has come to be known has been training with the warrior race ever since they found and assimilated her six years ago she doesnt remember how she came to their planet or how she was imbued with her fearsome cosmic powers but we meet her right before her first mission under her mentorcommander yonrogg jude law their mission to rescue a kree informant goes south when they fall into a skrull trap aimed at kidnapping vers who is thought to have information on a light speed engine that was being developed on earth the problem is like a lot of things in her back story vers has forgotten it it helps if you know that the kree have been at war with the shapeshifting skrulls a race that can copy a being down to their dna for thousands of years and what vers forgot could bring an end to the war eventually vers escapes from her captors and ends up stranded on earth where she meets a much younger agent fury samuel l jackson who helps her track down the skrulls responsible for her kidnapping and find a way back to hala the best compliment i can give captain marvel is it doesnt feel like a marvel film over the years we have been conditioned to the assemblyline plotting and exacting narrative mcu films tend to deliver and every new character is introduced spouting pop culture references while firing off an endless string of deadpan oneliners with roguish charm thats not what we get here when we first meet vers aka carol danvers she is a shell of a woman whos been broken and brainwashed with kree propaganda struggling to recover her past and her identity its a transition she makes over the course of the film as she slowly evolves into captain marvel this is not your typical origin story and all the better for it and thankfully it doesnt go overboard with the tieins and call backs to other films in the franchise which given how endlessly selfreferential last few marvel films are is a welcome breath of fresh air filled with an empowering message and sharpelbowed clapbacks at the toxic male naysayers of the marvel fanboy universe captain marvel is just what the mcu and fandom in general needs right now while the nonstop nostalgia blamblam of 80s90s needle drops blockbuster top gun elastica can be a bit much at times they are a welcome reminder that anna boden and ryan fleck were originally slated to tackle guardians of the galaxy vol 1 making them marvels logical goto choice for vol 3 brie larson has given us a different and more complex hero than we have seen from the mcu stable thus far and a great way to transition from the old to the new guard which will no doubt be a result of infinity war end game captain marvel feels less like the last film of phase 3 and more like the fresh first chapter of what will be phase 4
Jan 29 2020,positive, last year after the veritable trauma created by watching avengers infinity war marvel used their followup film antman and the wasp as a metaphorical sorbet a palate cleanser of sorts the film was lighthearted  favouring the entertainment factor after the intensity of its predecessor and it worked quietly amping us up for april 24th 2019 and the release of avengers endgame now captain marvel is here to build that tension backup again but just enough to get us excited whilst leaving us craving for more and what a film they give us in the form of marvels first femaleled superhero movie brie larson does an excellent job in the lead role as carol danvers aka captain marvel who is probably best described as being in possession of the wisecracking of star lord the impulsivity of thor the deadpan of ironman the goodness of captain american and the general kickassery of black widow shes yet to have a a fully rounded and unique personality yet theres definitely room for it to grow and as can be seen with the developing characterisation of thor look at 2011s thor then compare to 2017s ragnarock and 2018s infinity war often it feels like we are told more about her than shown many characters inform both us and carol how greatnoblebrilliant she is we just dont see it all that often yet we first meet her when she is a member of an elite kree army being mentored by yonrogg an extremely excellent jude law whose prevailing advice to her is to not let your emotions override your judgement things happen during which we find out how she got there in the first place the film initially takes a different approach to telling her origin story its unique but theres a strong chance younger viewers may get a bit confused as the storytelling at this point is slightly convoluted after this section the film then transitions to a bynumbers action movie all of these aspects are soldily good and very enjoyable but the film has flickers of greatness most of which are when the film takes on the form of buddy comedy with larson paired with samuel l jacksons nick fury jackson and brie have a hilarious rapport its during these moments the film really feels fresh and its own movie to quote any of these scenes would be giving the game away ben mendelsohn is also reliably brilliant he too has some cracking standout moments another key aspect of the film are the friendship scenes between carol and her best friend maria a charismatic lashana lynch their friendship is a lovely one and something that would be enjoyable to watch explored further
Jan 19 2020,positive, ill be totally honest with you i had never even heard of captain marvel before im not nor have i ever been a comic book person but at least i had heard of characters such as captain america thor the hulk and spider man but this captain marvel was a complete unknown to me and even though i enjoyed the heck out of black panther the whole avengers saga has been totally lost on me i watched avengers infinity war just because i wanted to be in on the conversation but i found it to be another cookiecutter piece of cgi brain noise with the exception of black panther and the first guardians of the galaxy movie i can truly take or leave the avengers and all their iterations but when it was announced that marvel studios was casting a woman to play the originally male titular superhero and avenger captain marvel i was intrigued and when it was then announced that the woman who would play her would be brie larson i was in see thats what marvel keeps getting right they keep finding ways to attract new audiences while maintaining their loyal ones brie larsons casting was yet another step in this studios march to industry dominance prior to her casting the entire marvel universe had only two oscar winners in their midst gwyneth paltrow and lupita nyongo neither of whom have starring roles in any marvel movie brie larson however is a best actress oscar winner carrying a marvel superhero moviethere are so many things in that sentence that are groundbreaking and i love every one of them so not only did marvel change it up by making captain marvel a woman they changed it up by casting an actress who had critical success but not too much mainstream recognition larson won her oscar for a littleseen independent movie room and her first attempt at a big hollywood blockbuster kong skull island fell a bit short of expectations so i cant imagine the disney marvel studios parent company big shots were thrilled at the idea of this possible flashinthepan being the one to carry a franchise on her shoulders but kevin feige the head of marvel studios has been given the keys to the kingdom so whatever he wants he gets and as always feige has done it exactly right larson may have been the reason i went to see captain marvel but surprisingly shes not the sole reason i liked the movie shes great i want to make that absolutely clear but i always knew she would be it was absolutely no surprise to me that she could handle this role and all its challenges but what did surprise me was how affable and unassuming this whole movie was directors anna boden and ryan fleck and screenwriters boden fleck and geneva robertsondworet take the time to build a world here and they make it intimate and relatable there is the perfect amount of 90s nostalgia the perfect amount of modern girlpower resonance and the perfect blend of superhero mythology and organic earthbound humanism there is humor and charm everywhere and theres even a cat who literally steals the movie speaking of the cat i loved the intentional or unintentional callbacks to science fiction classics that are scattered throughout the movie from star trek to alien to star wars i love so many things about captain marvel i just wish that i had been able to follow it a bit better even though it is the ultimate marvel comics universe origin story i still felt like i was lost without knowing all the mythology there are so many references to characters and plot points that i felt like i was not in on the secret and some of the twists lost their effectiveness what wonder woman achieved through familiarity captain marvel achieves through sheer will while the movie is squarely a superhero movie cut from the same cloth as captain america and thor the hero of this movie is completely different her powers may come from the outside but her strength is all from within in relatable tropes of kickass womanhood fighter pilot tomboy athlete friend she is neither a lover nor a mother she is a woman identified not as an attachment to anyone or anything else but singularly dependent on herself for survival and identity it feels odd to me to point this out because this sort of feminist ideal is such a nobrainer in my life but when i think about how rare it is to see in movies like this it really is extraordinary there are some oddities about captain marvel that contribute to its unevenness like the digital reverse aging process they use to make samuel l jackson 30 years younger and the weird fight sequences that make me wonder why alien life forms are fighting each other with guns and handtohand combat but these really are quibbles its made up for by so many great things including jackson reminding us that he really is funny and jude law and annette bening shining in roles that highlight their strengths overall captain marvel is an enjoyable escapist movie that happens to check all the boxes for a modern progressive audience and delivers humor and action in an easy to watch slicklymade package that maybe even the fanboys might like if superhero movies arent your thing i certainly understand trust me but if you want to go out on a limb and give one a try well that one still should be black panther but captain marvel wont disappoint you either at the very least youll know that you are supporting a sea change in what a movie superhero can look like and its about time
Dec 20 2019,positive,  when we first meet captain marvel larson shes working at her presuperhero job high up in space as part of an intergalactic military unit called starforce after a new mission calls her back to earth she runs into young government agent nick fury samuel l jackson and discovers truths about a past that shes long forgotten teaming up with furyand getting into entertaining verbal sparring matches with himshe defends the planet from a mysterious alien force   set in the 1990s well before audiences have met any of the other avengers and before fury lost his eye captain marvel has a spry playful tone and oscar winner larson room ably carries such a colossal superproduction   while the feminist message is sometimes muddledwhy should a woman be told to control her emotions instead of using her strengthmarvels first standalone female hero is definitely formidable and very likely a key component in the next movie 
Dec 15 2019,negative, welcome to road to endgame where we revisit the first 22 movies of the marvel cinematic universe and ask how did we get here in part one of our twopart look at captain marvel how the movie tries and fails to frame memory and perspectivebetween the two halves of its massive finale  the apocalyptic avengers infinity war and the upcoming avengers endgame  the marvel cinematic universe feels like its being stripped for partsantman and the wasp a smaller more intimate entry did away with the trappings of the marvel formula though it failed to supply a working substitute its leads no longer provided quipladen momentum a task that fell to supporting players independent of the plot but the lead characters had no internal conflict either despite pasts that so clearly called for some the film sidestepped the usual previsualized mayhem divorced from story though its climax might as well have had no stakes at all and rather than marvels halfhearted expression of meaning  often a character arc culminating in punching harder  the film had no real theme to dramatize  captain marvel on the other hand is a swing in the opposite direction amping up the wellworn marvel template to the point of inducing whiplash its fun in parts and it magnifies the series strongsuits though in doing so it exposes just how low the bar was set to begin with the film cant help but magnify the series weaknesses too since theyre often one and the sameeverything that was missing from antman and the wasp comes rushing back with the studios very name stamped across the title as if to parody the common throughlines of twenty prior films without the selfawareness to do so and while its filled to the brim with metaphor and ostensibly political outlook the film is both haphazardly assembled and shackled by the same constraints as fellow militaryfunded entries iron man iron man 2 and captain america the winter soldier only this time the effects of the films mandated propaganda are significantly strongercaptain marvel is a marvel movie throughandthrough and thats a problem after a tumultuous comic book history carol danvers then ms marvel rejoined the marvel alist in 2006 before graduating to the captain mantle six years later brie larson brings a combination of wit and gravitas to the character and a selfassured demeanour that captures danvers recent incarnations the problem however is that the danvers of the comics  a headstrong leader with agreeable charm  builds on decades of stories absorbing the ones that work while subverting those that dont whereas the danvers of the movie the amnesiac vers is an awkward fit for a story about someone still trying to find her placewit and charm arent just this danvers affectations theyre her equilibrium from start to finish despite the film being about her losing and subsequent rediscovering her identity on earthin an early training scene on hala the kree home world and the only place danvers fully remembers star force commander yonrogg jude law learns of the disjointed dreams and memories danvers cant seem to piece together in response to this and to danvers aggression as they spar yonrogg tells her to keep her emotions in check a loaded statement no doubt and one particularly gendered though from this point on the film seldom positions this mandate as something for danvers to overcomeeven the supreme intelligence annette bening the kree ai which takes the form a mystery woman from danvers past frames these flashes of lost memory as torrid intrusive impulses you struggle with your emotions the supreme intelligence tells her with your past that fuels them though danvers emotions and fractured memories never manifest as struggle nor do they compel her to go against the grain of authority to embrace her apparent fervour she seems to have already done so before the movie begins being told shes too emotional is a problem on paper but it rarely manifests in practice  danvers is incredibly personable and her dynamic with a younger nick fury samuel l jackson offers delightful momentum but scarce are the moments when larson is allowed to express something more nuanced than cheer danvers journey on earth involves both gathering intelligence and in the process solving the mystery of who she is yet this lack of identity never feels urgent beyond once yelling you dont know who i am even i dont know who i am when confronted with new information shortly thereafter danvers resumes her natural seemingly unfettered state the films visual framing falls victim to a similar indifference except for a single moment when the camera holds on danvers  a key beat where a filed photograph confirms her human past  nothing about the way shes shot or the way her perspective is framed sees any kind of shift despite change in perspective being key to the plot of captain marvel its as if the film is on autopilot with actors tasked with linereadings that rarely if ever unearth the potentially riveting subtext of a woman having her identity stolen and remolded by hostile masculine forcesdanvers relationship to authority is key to her persona she rebels against yonroggs orders though she does so from the getgo resulting in her later betrayal of the kree feeling all too easy when confronted with evidence that all she knows is a lie theres little struggle involved in actually changing her perspective in one moment she believes one thing in the next she believes another if anything she comes off as instantly perhaps naively trusting even though its likely unintended the film rarely clarifies when gaps in her memory have been filled so what drives her decisions in a given moment feels uncertain  this wishywashy pov goes hand in hand with danvers starting out rebellious this is who she already was on earth rather than having to grow into this rash persona or grow back into it when she rediscovers herself her disentanglement from brainwashed militarism feels almost insignificant starting out so defiant means her embrace of emotion is fairly acceptable too its only a mild issue for her commanders  despite what yonrogg says he seems to delight in their banter and there are no consequences when she lashes out at him with lasers  and it even seems like a nonissue for danvers herself rather than something shes forced to suppress and subsequently embrace or reclaimmany of these problems are rooted in the films expression of memory the film opens with a potent abstract depiction of danvers dilemma having been fed misinformation her mind contorts her memory to include an evil skrull where the devious yonrogg now her friendly commander should bedanvers initial discovery of her life on earth is shot with verve these flashes exist in her external vicinity like a tangible history waiting to be touched or danced with but after the first time danvers experiences this upon entering her old bar this vivid sensation of recalling the past never returns the film then ceases to depict memory in a manner visually befitting its story  or any visual manner at all the result is dramatic confusion  when danvers does regain her memories or parts of them how much she actually recalls is unclear the film only ever communicates these rediscoveries through dialogue danvers tells her friend maria rambeau lashana lynch that she needs to piece things together but rare are the moments when she acts like it her renewed understanding what she sees of herself and more importantly how she sees it is never the focus when rambeau tells danvers who she is or was the emotional resonance is limited to the two friends embracing a sweet moment no doubt  female friendships are largely lacking in the mcu  but its a moment that if excised would subtract little from danvers arcflashbacks of danvers falling and being taunted by male authority figures help colour her earthbound past but while she alludes to these memories in conversation they dont seem to pound against the walls of her subconscious let alone bother her nor do they impede her actions or decisions in the slightest her own memories feel like mere curiosities to her theyre neither vital parts of herself that she needs to chase nor do they stir something within her when she finally finds them theres no desperation no hunger at the heart of carol danvers that drives her journey and thus no real dramatic change for larson to externalizethe tidbits danvers discovers about herself are just that pieces of factual information with little emotional payoff they alter neither how she interacts with people even those she once knew nor how she fights or moves or speaks or approaches conflict even once that conflict is radically changed thanks to what she now believes theres nothing delineating vers from carol danvers aspects to her identity separated by fundamental outlook in a story about new information changing ones core or at the very least ones perspective this is a significant failingdespite the films stellar introduction to memory it occupies physical space at first making it feel both lived and within reach how much of danvers memory returns and what impact this has on her is left entirely vague until talos ben mendelsohn reveals the truth about yonrogg nothing danvers learns of her past informs her emotions or helps her overcome obstacles her search merely takes her from place to place the mystery of her old life could have been solved by someone else entirelydanvers breezy dynamic with fury is delightful but how her story is told begs several questions who are these people what do they learn from one another who is carol danvers outside of another marvel hero for whom change is far too easy and yet nonexistent and for whom levity is a more important function than her own vital rediscovery  captain marvel hinges on change in perspective while this change is never prompted by danvers arc  the krees actual ideology is barely touched upon

Dec 6 2019,positive, to say that captain marvel is overdue in joining the ranks of the mcu is a bit of an understatement  but now that shes here and here to stay well let it slide it took marvel over 10 years to get a headlining female hero in their lineup which would be maddening if marvel wasnt also a part of hollywood for all its progressivism hollywood is slow why because old white men have all the power tale as old as time captain marvel and black panther was only possible because marvel studios managed to break free from its oldest whitest most conservative keeper of the status quo thank goodness for that anyone with a brain will tell you movies starring women and people of color make heaps of money add superheroes to that equation and well theres a reason disney owns marvel studios and marvel isnt going anywhere any time soon  this all gets pretty meta when one considers captain marvel itself on the production side it has more women involved in creative and executive positions than any other marvel film including codirector anna boden and composer pinar toprak both the first in those roles in the mcu it stars brie larson who won my heart forever when she presented casey affleck with the academy award for best actor in 2017 but refrained from clapping for him its story is one of a woman overcoming psychological abuse and finding her strength  and herself  amid the muck of lies a man told her to keep her under his control for years on every level captain marvel is about a woman refusing to give up when men tell her she is not enough because of this and because of larsons layered performance and excellent supporting cast samuel l jackson ben mendelsohn lashana lynch annette bening jude law it also stands as one of the most rewarding rewatches in recent marvel memory it takes a second viewing or even a third to really see how sinister jude laws villainy is and to appreciate how well he weaponizes his handsomeness to trick everyone into thinking hes not just a hero but a mentor and a friend  this is just one example that shows just how well crafted captain marvel is the execution is easy to miss in a first viewing  i left the theater that first time feeling a bit mixed about it  but repeat viewings really make captain marvel shine the directors and writers managed to create a story that from a womans perspective feels universal in spite of the comicky spectacle of warring alien races and a cat who turns into a tentacle monster so many things that only women experience are seeded throughout the movie  dont let your emotions control you if im wrong then prove it got a smile for me honey  and never in a way that feels pandering like say dark phoenix we have a majority of female writers to thank for that as a new parent i appreciate that most of the special features on the bluray of captain marvel are four minutes or less the short featurettes highlight standout aspects of the film like the feline actors larsons experiences flying with real air force pilots and the comics inspiration for the films carol danvers shoutout to kelly sue deconnick the longest features clock in at eight minutes and are also the most worth watching the first is the films deleted scenes which shed some more light on jude laws villain and the second is a longer featurette emphasizing visual effects producer victoria alonsos longtime contribution to the mcu  while part of me wishes the special features were longer and more akin to those found on the black panther bluray captain marvel is also a film with less worldbuilding and thus less need to explain itself at this point you cant really go wrong with adding the latest marvel movie to your dvd collection and captain marvel is no exception 
Nov 22 2019,positive,brie larson packs a punch as one of marvels great new heroes
Nov 6 2019,positive, more than anything captain marvel suffers from the constraints of existing in a cinematic universe maybe its the placement a month and a half out from avengers endgame that makes it seem like the most shoehorned marvel movie there are numerous good things about this film but the parts that would make it great are lost in service of connecting the dots to the 19 films before it and more specifically to endgame but first lets talk about the good things brie larson is of course perfect whether its as the amnesiac vers or the badass air force pilot carol danvers larson imbues humor wit and vulnerability into the role her chemistry with nick fury samuel l jackson digitally aged down to fit the 90s setting is on par with the best of buddycop comedies jackson gets to do more with nick fury here than hes been able to do for a while as we get to see the birth of shield we now know it as theres a significant amount of time dedicated to an entire alien race and for a cinematic universe that first introduced space seven years ago its refreshing to learn more about the races of the mcu besides the humans or the asgardians the skrulls are a shapeshifting species that start out as the enemy but turn out to be a misunderstood species who are just trying to find a home ben mendelsohns talos is one of the funniest characters in the mcu giving him a family turns him into something more than just comic relief the aesthetic of the 90s is also on point with great music cues from nirvanas come as you are no doubts just a girl and tlcs waterfall however certain parts of the film feel underwhelming within the scope of the mcu the narrative structure is odd while this take on an origin story feels refreshing in that carol already has her powers the amnesiac beginning feels like a tough place to start for a character we need to get to know quickly if shes going to be the saving grace in endgame not to mention the more time larson spends as vers the less time we get to know her as carol danvers and the friendship she has with fellow air force pilot maria rambeau lashana lynch theres a lovely story of lost friends and a lasting friendship somewhere in here but very little time is spent really getting to know these characters before aliens come knocking on their door because this film is set in the 90s and since its the 20th film in the mcu there are certain issues it runs into with mcu history as far as the audience knows the kree has always been the villain with ronan the destroyer lee pace reprising his role headlining the villainy in guardians of the galaxy here larsons character starts off as part of the kree team notably jude law as yonrogg gemma chan as minnerva and djimon hounsou as korath also reprising his role from guardians of the galaxy the issue is that we already know the kree are the bad guys so when talos reveals hes actually the good guy the moment gets lost under the weight of the history before it
Oct 21 2019,positive, expectations are skyhigh for marvel studios latest superhero film captain marvel its not only the movie studios first bigscreen adventure with a female lead in academyaward winning brie larson from room but it also stands as a critical bridge between the twopart epic of avengers infinity war and avengers endgame shes the one that nick fury paged as he disintegrated in that first parts postcredit sequence marvel can rest easy that theyve got another fun movie on their hands and yet its greatest strengths are those moments more human than hero and in some instances more feline as a supporting orange tabby almost steals the entire picture married filmmakers anna boden and ryan fleck do a decent job of delivering the requisite action here but their strengths lie in creating quirky characters and the loosygoosy interactions between them in movies like half nelson 2006 and its kind of a funny story 2010 they showcased quirky characters that drove simple stories much of the same comes through in captain marvel when heroine carol danvers isnt acting like an avenger she is far more interesting when shes downtoearth literally and figuratively in fact boden and fleck seem far less interested in a lot of the typical beats of a marvel origins stories as evidenced by their minimalizing of the time they spent on such tropes their script written with geneva roberstondworet truncates danvers youthful flashbacks that would normally take up a ton of screen time in other marvel movies the script moves things along so swiftly that the backstory of danvers strained relationship with her father gets covered in a breathless blinkandyoullmissit moment boden and fleck dont seem all that interested in the excessive backstory about the kree warring with the skrulls either they gloss over a lot of the alien hooey and dont even bother to give most of the kree brotherhood any personality the formidable djimon hounsou is one of them but hes given virtually no character to play the directors seem almost apathetic about the lore of this galactic conflict preferring to get past the makeup fest so they can turn their attention to the silly stuff indeed danvers fishoutofwater story that occurs when she lands back on earth is where this movie starts to hit its stride because danvers origin story takes place in the 90s it gives boden and fleck all the more opportunity to make hay out of 90s pastiche in addition to making fun of a younger nick fury samuel l jackson it becomes an outandout comedy at times especially with fury fretting about and interacting with a wayward cat more on that later it all allows larson to play something shes more comfortable with specifically wry banter and pingponging off of the game jackson watching her act stoic and pose dramatically in her heroic postures doesnt quite suit her any more than the clearly padded costume to make her more buff her strengths despite all the chopping and kicking shes asked to do genuinely lie in her droll wit and dismissive sideeyes the filmmakers have a field day with the schtick as they take the piss out of antiquated 90s relics like blockbuster stores the painfully slow downloads on early computers and a lot of the music from that period that hasnt aged particularly well sorry gwen stefani the most fun comes from seeing fury 25 years younger with a full pate and both eyes jackson doesnt get that many chances to be comedic onscreen and he relishes playing a version of his character when he was less stoic he also plays well off of larson and they enjoy a breezy chemistry together soon danvers and fury are running all over hill and dale trying to figure out what the skrulls are up to as well as figure out her mysterious history since her memories were lost after she crashed on the kree planet that past of hers as well as the true motivations of the skrulls hold the key to her powers that include the ability to harness energy be immune to bullets and fly as the two schlep all over los angeles danvers gets to apply her skills on earth often in front of bewildered bystanders the scene on the la subway where she throws down with a skrull disguised as an old lady is one of the films comedic highlights still the funniest moments involve that cat previously mentioned the orange tabby is named goose and it keeps popping up while danvers and fury are sleuthing cutaways to the orange tabby account for some of the choicest comic punchlines in the film and when the feline and fury become buds its adorable and pretty cheeky the cat even manages to stow away aboard danvers jet earning the films biggest laugh when the kitty is shown reacting badly to zero gravity adding to the burlesque is the fact that the skrulls fear the little creature thinking that its a tentacled alien out to eat them it seems every critter in this movie is dealing with identities in question from danvers not knowing her backstory to the skrull abilities to morph into others the kree are not all they seem to be including hunky mentor yonrogg a game jude law let alone skrull leader talos an insinuating ben mendelsohn its even hard to get a bead on just who dr lawson annette bening is in the overly complicated plotting she looks dynamite in her green contacts and fitted leather jacket but is she friend or foe one of the most surprising things about this film is that there is no extraneous love interest given to danvers something almost miraculous for material like this instead the relationship that is given time outside of her professional connection with fury is with fellow pilot maria lashana lynch single mom maria fought hard to make it in the macho world of the military alongside her bestie and daughter monica akira akbar isnt missing a father figure to that end the film is a bit too onthenose with the girl power machinations but at least neither female adult in the story requires a man for fulfillment how refreshing is that in the heman superhero universe less fresh is the somewhat typical final battle in space as danvers takes full ownership of her powers a third act that echoes the finale of 2017s wonder woman far too closely fully embracing her captain marvel persona danvers throws all the alien baddies into a lot of scenery but is careful not to kill anyone its all a little too safe and too dull and the excessive cgi doesnt help matters it would be nice if larson were genuinely participating in most of the action but she seems to have been replaced by a digital version of the character as expensive as all of the effects are here the greatest ones remain the ability to shave 25 years off of jackson as well as fellow agent coulson clark gregg reprising his earlier avengers film role for all of marvels success in 20 some movies their third acts too often play anticlimactically the superiority of the mcu look it up over the films from dc remain with their more memorable characters and the humor swirling around them  such attributes get lost when these endings trot out the inevitable whambam smackdowns wouldnt it be great to have a climax in one of these films where fighting didnt solve the galaxys problems and smarts did instead the purpose of danvers powers is to end all wars but it seems like its really there to keep her one helluva war machine so much for marvelous jeff york has been writing film

Oct 14 2019,positive, the marvel cinematic universe finally gets a headlining female superhero as brie larson plays a super soldier with a mysterious past alongside samuel l jackson jude law and ben mendelsohn its uneven but worthy writes critic craig mathieson captain marvel begins briskly omitting a villainous prologue and a genial introduction in presenting the unsettled vers brie larson a gifted rookie in the starforce an intergalactic military unit in the service of the kree an advanced alien race a rebel without applause vers has fractured memories starting with trauma and no history a situation that requires a sparring session and stern advice from her commanding officer and mentor yonrogg jude law marvels belated introduction of a lead female superhero works to keep you entertained and yet off balance  codirectors anna boden and ryan flecks film is a surreptitious dismantling of the genre theyre successors to sometimes awkward but ultimately uplifting vers murky past includes time on earth a situation revisited when she plunges from the sky above california one day in 1995 after an unsettling encounter with the krees shapeshifting enemy the skrulls and their leader talos ben mendelsohn and his australian accent firing photon blasts from her hands is enough to convince us government agent nick fury a digitally deaged samuel l jackson of her bona fides and the manipulative spymaster of previous marvel movies is a jaunty sidekick here offering banter amidst the cultural gags of video stores and dialup internet connections this is the most genx friendly movie the studio has ever produced a year ago with black panther director ryan coogler and his collaborators were able to offer an alternate afrocentric history of strength and resilience captain marvel doesnt have that exterior strength instead working to distinguish itself through interior selfrealisation too many marvel films have been about the responsibility of greatness and carrying a mantle but vers  or carol danvers as she previously was on earth  doesnt know who she is only who shes been told she can be amidst the sleuthing by mismatched pair of vers and fury complete with grunge gags and tasty musical cues theres a thorough dismissal of authority figures and allegiance to the state while refugees are protected from a shameful war make what you will of annette benings sly take on hillary clinton boden and fleck made their bones with independent dramas notably 2006s compelling half nelson and most recently 2015s mississippi grind coheadlined by mendelsohn they have a feel for the friction of characters who cant find contentment in their world and the selfdestruction that can eventuate that continues here with vers rediscovering her life as carol and the intensity of her friendship with a fellow former pilot maria rambeau lashana lynch the scenes between them particularly where maria recounts what she lost when carol disappeared have a genuine empathy and connection with brie larson more at ease than she is as initially cocky woman who fell to earth unfortunately they cant find a similar finesse visually with rote chase scenes and handtohand combat that lacks a distinct sense of spatial feel or an illustrative dynamic in wonder woman patty jenkins kept the frame open so that the commanding strength of gal gadots diana shone through but carol has to fight her out of a box much as she has to battle to piece together who she is what makes the film work is that a woman claiming her identity from a life thats told her otherwise is explicitly feminist and when captain marvel asserts herself its not just with noble intent but also galvanising pleasure nevertheless you realise she persisted
Sep 27 2019,negative, if you asked me to recite the marvel cinematic universe origin story of any avenger id say just about the same thing for most of them ordinary person living their normal life strange event they try to figure out their powers for a while they chase a macguffin yadda yadda what im more likely to remember is that one funny scene where they did this or that other part where they did that  these origins tend to function more as sandboxes that give the characters room to breathe and a collection of small moments where we get to know who they are and what makes them special if were speaking in terms of technicality captain marvels plot has the same ingredients as most origin stories but theyre added in a different order so we end up with a new dish she starts the films with powers and without a memory of her life or who she was before she had them this difference yields more depth and mystery in the plot than i ever anticipated but at a cost the movies central premise asks who is this person im not sure we get more than a superficial answer captain marvel opens on the planet of hala home of the kree  youll know them by their blue blood and combat skills thats honestly about all i can say about the kree even though theyre the only part of carol danvers brie larson life that she can remember up to this point danvers has spent the last six years being raised as a soldier and honing her powers with mentor yonrogg jude law after they find her neardeath after a mysterious accident unfortunately the time we spend on hala feels rushed and full of exposition but also somehow missing context at the same time danvers gets captured on a mission against the shapeshifting villains the skrulls and ends up escaping to earth a la 1995 once we get to earth captain marvel switches gears a bit and also begins to function as a semiorigin story for nick fury samuel l jackson and his role in assembling the avengers a side note the visual effects used to deage jackson in this film are nothing short of incredible i was worried id be dealing with the uncanny valley effect for the movies full running time but it genuinely works on earth the tone and plot takes a turn for the better for starters we get a joyous set of 90s songs that are right up there with the guardians soundtrack and to my relief the majority of captain marvels run time doesnt feel like one giant glamorous advertisement for the air force there is plenty of macguffin chasing sure but we get to meet goose the cat which is basically the groot of this film there are plenty of guardians comparisons to be had here we also get to see more of ben mendelsohns skrull leader talos mendelsohn really ended up stealing the show for me which again speaks to the intricacy of the plot at the expense of the title character theres also a pocket of about 3040 minutes in the back half of this film where the originality and weirdness of this universe starts to peak out and this is where captain marvel really shines i think there was enough room in captain marvel to have both a compelling plot and solid character development but two things get in the way 1 making danvers own life a riddle to be solved and 2 tying everything into the mcu origins as quickly as possible furys involvement mostly worked for me maybe because he already felt like a fullyformed character but just about everything else mcurelated felt like it took away from the time danvers could have spent getting to know herself and her best friendfound family maria rambeau lashana lynch better i think rambeau and furys roles could have been swapped in terms of screen time and involvement and it would have made the world of difference but because captain marvels own life is the big mystery we dont get to know these two and their friendship as well as id have liked im going to need a little more time to digest it and rank this one in the mcu but i already know it wont be at the top or the bottom of the list for me itll hover somewhere in the middle held back by weak character development and soso dialogue held afloat by a thoughtful story an adorable cat and the impending tweets about jude law and gemma chan that are about to completely flood my timeline hrmm i got that feeling from the trailer in regards to dialogue would you say better outing than the 1st thor or cap or right there with them hmm id say i liked it more than the 1st thor but less than the 1st cap its somewhere in the same soso territory as the first ant man for me wow this was a much better movie than most of the reviews led me to expect its also a very different movie than i expected in a good way i thought larson was fantastic and there was some strong chemistry among the actors most of the mcu stuff was on the light sidenot essential to the plot so it doesnt derail the story but mostly fun enough not sure where id rank it but usually i like these movies even more on the second and third or more viewings it certainly makes me hopeful that the mcu isnt running out of steam justin chang on nprs fresh air described captain marvel as a pleasant and likeable movie but nothing very special that does sound like the antman movies ok timefillers he doubts it will do for female moviegoers what black panther did for black moviegoers because its not as rich a movie but ill see it anyway
Sep 26 2019,positive, were all familiar with superhero origin story ordinary flawed person is granted superhuman abilities ordinary flawed person struggles with their abilities on a physiological and psychological level ordinary flawed person finally harnesses their gifts in a selfless way its a template for compelling storytelling because its all about growth and selfactualisation and all that good stuff we go watch escapist movies for on the other hand the structure of this is wellworn by now to say the least  captain marvel a superhero origin story movie attempts to circumvent this structure were immediately introduced to a superpowered young woman named carol danvers brie larson a member of an advanced alien race known as the kree furthermore shes already found her place as a loyal soldier in their elite intergalactic military unit called starforce their mission is to locate and wipe out the skrulls led by talos ben mendelsohn whore shapeshifters intent on infiltrating kree home worlds  however its not as straightforward as all that through carols dialogue with her mentor yonrogg jude law we learn that her past is a mystery to her after a mission to take out some skrulls goes sideways carol crash lands on earth through the roof of a blockbuster because its the year 1995 there she meets nick fury samuel l jackson here a young shield agent with two good eyes as they teamup to repel an oncoming skrull invasion carols learns more about her past life on earth  to paper over this crack theyve cast brie larson and shes as magnetic as other mcu heavyhitters like chris evans or robert downey jr through sheer charisma she gets you to care very much and perhaps i imagined this because of the films 90s aesthetic but larson imbues carol danvers with this specifically disaffected and wryly sarcastic quality thats highly reminiscent of the 90s tough chick protagonist think dark angel or buffy  aside from some neat perspective shifts and twists captain marvel lacks black panthers thematic sophistication thor ragnaroks kooky visual splendor or infinity wars ambition its a middletier marvel movie and yet i liked it a lot more than that label implies brie larson ben mendelsohn and samuel l jackson are so much fun to watch carol danvers is so cool the 90s references obvious as they were in places tickled me what else can i say i got a kick out of it 
Sep 25 2019,positive, sometimes its hard to be a woman especially if you have superhuman powers and according to certain men in your life a tendency to become too emotional captain marvel packages this dilemma in a stylish thoughtful and funny superhero movie thats a twist on the usual origin story formula its less about learning to master new powers than it is about learning to accept already being powerful for the eponymous hero played by oscar winner brie larson  who shoots thunderbolts from her fists can pilot any spacecraft and actually fly unaided herself  this change of emphasis is significant the genesis of this new marvel character goes back to the end of the 1960s in comic book form just as secondwave feminism was gaining momentum her reintroduction to audiences at this point in time is framed as a story of empowerment thats aimed squarely though not exclusively at young women and girls codirectors anna boden and ryan fleck  former indie filmmakers who cast ryan gosling as a drug addicted schoolteacher in their 2006 debut half nelson  introduce her in a way that feels relevant and occasionally even bold the film begins like a scifi noir she greets the dawn alone in a small apartment overlooking a city of concrete towers and floating traffic having barely slept beset by yet another nightmare of a deeply buried yet vague trauma  dressed for work in a hitech bodysuit and sporting hair with bounce  she might look like a typical almost banal marvel heroine without much of an inner life scarlett johansson as black widow comes to mind but its immediately clear she has much more to offer after a blistering introduction featuring a bungled raid on a tribe of shapeshifting aliens known as skrulls she ends up in our world on a mission to recover some top secret tech before they do its the midnineties la and an old photo of her wearing a guns n roses tshirt proves she has history here though she doesnt seem to remember  she falls from the sky and through the roof of a blockbuster video store not the last 90s reference milked for nostalgia or comedy barely able to get her bearings before shes exchanging fire with more skrulls their leader is played by ben mendelsohn a scenestealer who becomes the source of some of the films increasingly droll humour  quite an achievement given hes delivering his best lines through a thick green mask as elasticas jagged britpop hit connection pierces the soundtrack and before you can say terminator 2 larsons character has stolen a motorcycle and changed into the more 90sappropriate attire of flannelette and nine inch nails tshirt to start looking around  it takes the rest of the film for her to put the pieces of her past together discovering the identity of an older woman annette bening who reappears in a vision and reconnecting with an old friend lashana lynch whos become a mother since they last hung out  along the way shes aided by her commander jude law and partnered with local grunt investigator nick fury samuel l jackson a man marvel fans already know has an extraordinary future ahead of him in two hours the film weaves its story of personal intrigue with some bruising if sometimes confusing action sequences and the odd cathartic fist pump of righteous triumph in a key moment captain marvels shadow will fall across the face of one of her worst enemies as he literally cowers in the sand at her feet by the end she will accept her powers and know how terrible they can be and even emerge from the experience with some innocent blood on her hands the idea that good people sometimes do terrible things is grist for the dramatic mill in the marvel universe and larsons superhero is set to become just as morally complex as her betterknown mostly male peers given how multifaceted the journeys been you cant help but feel slightly sorry for scarlett johanssons relatively less complex black widow and look forward to when both women are finally on the screen together this service may include material from agence francepresse afp aptn reuters aap cnn and the bbc world service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced

Sep 17 2019,positive, out of all the moviejawn writers im probably the least qualified to write about a superhero movie let alone a marvel cinematic universe effort yes i wrote about both black panther and thor ragnarok for mj butlike captain marvel seems way more complex its many many many iterations and history of storylines are overwhelming to say the least soooooooooooooooooim just not gonna talk about all that problem solved  what i do feel the need to discuss is brie larsons everything ive been in love with her since she bitchsang her way into my heart in scott pilgrim vs the world as scotts evil ex envy adams and thennnnn she was adorably smart and funny in 21 jump street a dumb little reboot i never ever knew i needed but totally and completely did after that i started following her as much as i could and in short term 12 as a woman struggling with her own past while managing a group home for teens well she blew me away besides bries knockout portrayal the film features a heartwrenching script and raw performances by larson lakeith stanfield kaitlyn dever rami malek stephanie beatriz and john gallagher jr and then she went on to do room and we know how that worked out for her finally in 2017 she directed a quirky little gem called unicorn store about astore of sorts run by samuel l jackson that sellsunicorns yes i swear i caught the film at tiff that year with mjs rosalie kicks and i really enjoyed its lowkey vibe and message of selfacceptance and larson directed it i remember thinking to myself after the screening what cant brie larson do and i cant wait to see whats next for her unicorn store is scheduled for an april 5 release btw  one of the things that came next was captain marvel and while i wouldnt call it a near perfect film its one of the more solid in the mcu and i would argue a more soulful two hours than that other femaleled superhero jawn wonder woman i was really happy ww got made and i felt gal gadot did an amazing job leading the overall solid effort but ww feels like its missing something for meheart an emotional center huh what the hell am i even talking about anyway i shouldnt really be comparing wonder woman to captain marvel anyway because thats not really important or the point there is certainly room for more than one femalecentered actionpacked jam obviously and i would love to see more of them i guess im just programmed deepdown to pit female against female which is a real shame considering so many of us ladies of all backgrounds and experiences dont often get a seat at the table instead i should support and be positive and uplift  so in that vein back to brie word on the street is mixed but i think she was a superb casting choice larson and jackson go well together like vanilla ice cream and applesauce or pretzels and chocolate chips trust me both are really good as captain marvel otherwise known as vers aka carol danvers she brims with confidence infusing hohum dialogue and simpler moments with a little something extrato me she always shines larsons scenes with lashana lynch as carols earthly bestie maria rambeau are warm and lively  i genuinely believed in their friendship and identified them as the films heart immediately its these particular emotional threads that can be a hard sell in superhero films black panther is the only other such film i would categorize as showcasing such capable acting yet larson jude law annette bening ben mendelsohn and lynch do a decent job with what they have to work with gemma chan and djimon hounsou have a few small moments while crowd faves clark gregg and lee pace reprise their regular marvel roles as agent coulson and ronan respectively  besides solid acting the most noticeable to me is the rather subdued look and feel of the film which isnt surprising given the previous work of directors anna boden and ryan fleck the two started collaborating at nyu and are most known for half nelson fleck directed the two cowrote sugar directed by both and its kind of a funny story also directed by both if youve seen any of their work you might thinkhuh thats an interesting choice while featuring a bit of that ol marvel sleek and shine captain marvel isnt necessarily a marvel of technical filmmaking its capable and sturdy cinematic craftsmanship  a solid effort by two fairly independent directors but its the storytelling aspects of the film the character development of carol danvers that really sticks out this is after all an origin story and origin stories can sometimes be booooooringly bogged down with exposition and back story but in thinking about all the films of boden  fleck a pattern emerges  in all of their films there is a strong sense of characters a real progression and feel for the heroes of their films that is quite powerful in that way its no surprise to me these two were granted the captain marvel reins  to sift through all the possible iterations and past plots in the captain marvel back catalog to fully introduce her character to existing and potential new fans alike  its a hefty task while there are some aspects of her character i wanted to know more about namely who she was on earth before getting sent to kree i think boden and fleck should be proud of the work they did here  one thing i wouldnt be so proud of using really overplayed 90s songs to convey an overall 90s vibe and reference point yes the film is a bit of a prequel of sorts taking place at some point in the 1990s which sigh can we move on from our 90s nostalgia now radio hits by nirvana hole garbage and rem are all here cool like you couldnt dig a little deeper like maybe prioritize mood over highly recognizable songs youre likely to hear in passing at a wawa or in an uber or some shit and dont get me started on the fight sequence set to no doubts just a girl i get it shes a girl fighting evil aliens and stuff and gwen stefani isjust a girl fighting the patriarchy in a bra top and plaid ska pants  look i have nothing against this music or any of these bands  i love no doubt sunday morning is the bomb dont speak is karaoke fire i recently listened to nothing but nirvana for three whole weeks but picking these particular played af radio jams just smacks of laziness to me the song choices felt phoned the fuck in and they made me laugh roll my eyes and sigh all at the same time which is quite a feat in this regard the film could have benefited from some stronger music supervision i mean they had a big budget to work withhave fun with it its like someone opened any 90s playlist on spotify and said this one oh and this one and yeah this is fine and then called that shit a day and went to chipotle for a burrito bowl i think we can do better  captain marvel as a standalone film within the mcu lacks a bit of overall fire power which is a bit upsetting considering the people involved brie larson samuel l jackson the almighty jude law etc but what it lacks in wonder and aweinducing moments it makes up for in warmth and heart and a strong sense of who captain marvel is and where shes going i for one am looking forward to seeing whats next for her in avengers endgame a hopefully no doubtfree film

Aug 23 2019,positive, but what i wanted  what i demanded  was more depth more potency and a lot less of the boxticking hamfisted bids for my female feels captain marvels kind of girl power isnt targeting me and what she embodies is the popculture potential to empower young women all over the globe i just wanted a more cohesively meaningful experience thats all  without the hollow 90s button pushing and with more cinematic oxygen for brie larson to breathe in
Aug 22 2019,negative,the first half hour of captain marvel feels disjointed and poorly developed in part because youre dumped into an alien culture you know nothing about which you see from the perspective of a woman who has no memories and doesnt know who she is
Aug 22 2019,positive,i wanted to love captain marvel i really did and there was a lot to enjoy but after all is said and done i feel a bit underwhelmed but i did love the flerken  aka goose the cat
Aug 18 2019,positive, comic book fans first met carol danvers in 1968 as a supporting character to a male captain marvel an air force security chief she was by turns a sharp investigator and a batty blonde as some angry fans called her often reduced to a romantic interest  but when she reappeared in 1977s ms marvel she was advertised as a superheroine for the seventiesand equally well set for the eighties and nineties too even the ms moniker nodded to the feminist movement paralleling reallife superhero gloria steinems ms magazine on her new career track as editorinchief ms marvel took on the fight for equal payand won since these origins audiences have seen a total of 7 different captain marvels in making its film entry for the superhero marvel studios could have easily drawn from one of its male iterations but the world would have been the worse for it we need another male superhero like tony stark needs to borrow a dollar luckily marvel studios finally seems ready to answer the pentup demand for more diverse leads and carol danvers was chosen to enter the marvel cinematic universe mcu bringing with her a wealth of canonical material to pick and choose from  with that long canon however came a challenge for the filmmakers who had to balance between the central mysteryhow did the human carol danvers brie larson become the supercharged vers of the kree empire and whywith the need to create a superhero exciting enough to stand with marvels allstar lineup of avengers they succeed for the most part but for carol the problem of a muddled identity and a cookiecutter villain fail to set her up for the kind of journey weve come to expect in a superheros origin story let alone a superhero whose powers go far beyond anything weve seen before the heavy mantle of being the first femaleled film in the mcu means that captain marvel cant spend too much time actually confronting systemic issues of gender lest it differentiate itself too much from the standard fare of kicking ass and saving the world rather marvel neatly weaves the patriarchysmashing thread into the larger origin story by genderswapping the role of carols mentor marvell annette benning making their relationship all the more significant marvellor as carol knows her dr wendy lawsonnot only solidifies the importance of female relationships but provides meta commentary on women succeeding in maledominated fields be they the air force or a film franchise the bond between carol and her best friend maria rambeau lashana lynch proves similarly poignant recounted in flashbacks as carol begins to regain her memory of life before she wakes up on the kree planet of hala maria pervades her past as both women eagerly become test pilots for dr lawson in the only opportunity for women to fly combat aircrafts during that time their bond marks another first for marvel whichdespite plenty of opportunitieshas never deemed the relationship between two women worthy of its own narrative along with her role as conduit to carols memories maria provides emotional support with the help of her daughter monica akira akbar monica in turn provides affirmation through her belief in carol delivered with the sort of cleareyed certainty that few adults retain  despite this brilliant lineup of role models though theres still no staving off disappointment at the absence of peggy carter hayley atwell after a tragically cancelled series a painfully short presence in ant man 2015 and a heartbreaking death in captain america civil war 2016 seeing the woman who founded and led shield welcome captain marvel into the fold would have felt more like an ending that honored her legacy  the mcu has a dismal track record when it comes to characters of color with the notable exception of black panther 2018 consistently relegated to secondary roles with thin backstories even gamora zoe saldana whose history featured heavily in avengers infinity war 2018 lacked autonomy she was there primarily as a romantic interest to starlord chris pratt and a means of tying epic baddie thanos josh brolin to the fate of the avengers meanwhile captain marvel centers a white protagonist but offers significantly more fleshedout roles that rise above the sidekick status bestowed upon rhodey don cheadle and falcon anthony mackie in iron man and captain america civil war respectively in fact captain marvel offers two origin stories delving beyond the stoic oneeyed stare and intimidating facade of nick fury samuel l jackson the fury of the midnineties exudes humor and optimism as well as a babytalkfilled fondness for goose the cat or as we learn goose the flerken the movie also builds a bond between carol and fury that rationalizes how and why his last moments on earth before being poofed in avengers infinity war are spent reaching out to captain marvel the relationship carol rediscovers with maria conforms slightly more to marvels sidekick model like rhodey to tony stark and falcon to steve rogers maria is the ally in a deeply personal battle unlike previous ones though maria exists in her own right outside of her relationship with carol in preparing for her role actor lashana lynch made a point of meeting pilots who were also mothers emphasizing that she wanted the character to have a real throughline that the black community or people of color will be proud of and for mothers to be proud that theres a single mother in the mcu where captain marvel does fall down is in its representation of asians something that has long been a problem in this universe if only it could take a cue from the marvel of the small screen when asian characters arent being whitewashed or reduced to tropes theyre prone to being stripped of their asian identity altogether in the guardians of the galaxy movies mantis played by frenchkorean actor pom klementieff has her features distorted to appear alien filipinoamerican actor dave bautistas character drax has grey skin covered in red marks while in captain marvel gemma chans minnerva is canonically blueskinned like most kree its hard not to notice a pattern thats part of the problem with colorblind casting it becomes altogether too easy to erase identity altogether captain marvel finally delivers a female superhero to the mcu one whose story stands on its own and earns her feminist cred while making for an enjoyable time all around a few slow moments and jude laws lackluster villain sorry yonrogg but ya basic are offset by a strong set of allies the thrill of nineties throwback references and a peckish flerken masquerading as a cat  marvel also deserves major props for tying the air forces past policies that barred women from combat into carols backstory without making it seem contrived amidst manufactured outrage from misogynistic mens rights activists and incels offended by the idea of a female superhero movie the acknowledgement of systemic sexism is both timely and necessary given everything one outstanding mystery is why marvel didnt spend more time hyping goose in the leadup to the movie where nick fury knew to call in his most powerful weapon in a time of crisis marvel never saw to combat the online trolls hellbent on tearing down captain marvel and its star with the internets most powerful weapon a picture of a cat 
Aug 18 2019,positive, evangeline lilly may have broken ground as the first female titled character in the marvel cinematic universe but the studio has yet to deliver an origins story that rivals dc movies wonder woman a decade since iron man marvel finally puts a female superhero in the limelight starring an ensemble cast captain marvel follows carol danvers brie larson an alien kree warrior suffering from amnesia discovering that earth is in the middle of an intergalactic war she travels to the planet  only to rediscover her past and truth behind her identity the events after avengers infinity war have left marvels superheroes  not just the avengers  somewhat lost with captain marvel teased at the end there was always the pressure to deliver a badass superhero that is more than capable of assisting the avengers as we head into the forthcoming avengers endgame  on paper it feels like there is a lot of pressure up until last year marvel has been criticised for its lack of diversity after the success of black panther audiences have been more eager than ever for a femaleled marvel film therefore captain marvel needed to be seen as a celebration of women and what they are capable of in this respect the film focuses on carol overcoming her demons and becoming stronger than her mostly male peers  it is almost easy to forget how significant it is while black panther highlights its roots in africa with its focus on the continent and its place in the world captain marvel subtly celebrates women as a gender this not only applies to its protagonist but the team who bring it to life this ranges from codirector anna boden and coscreenwriter geneva robertsondworet driving the project to notable supporting cast members gemma chan lashana lynch and annette benning who make an impact in smart and physical roles the dynamic between carol and male characters is also interesting to see while female characters in the mcu are mostly supporting roles or love interests captain marvel offers a complex relationship between her and starforce commander yonrogg jude law he assumes the role of superiority as carols mentor but thankfully it is not demeaned by romantic overtones instead their conflict stems from their capabilities and allows carol to be judged by her punch rather than her looks throughout the film carol has been trained to control her emotions to make her a better warrior but it is her empathy that truly makes her a hero larson offers charm amid selfconfidence and smiles delivering both emotional punch and physical presence marvel mainstay samuel l jackson reminds audiences of his comedic talents as rookie fury whose eyes are instantly wide open when confronted with his own close encounter in addition his trepidation makes him a more likeable and complementary character for carol unlike the stoic yonrogg combining impending doom emotional angst and wit the screenplay is typical of an mcu film the direction is smart and imaginative with aerial chases reminiscent of independence day orstar wars and fight scenes brilliantly set against a 1990s soundtrack dripping with nostalgia after 11 years a cynic could argue marvel studios is almost overcompensating for a lack of a female heroine but you cant argue with the results  fun actionpacked and empowering captain marvel is the girl power film the mcu needs
Aug 17 2019,positive, from the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes cultured vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming join cultured vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling whether its wwe news or something from across the sea lets talk shop captain marvel had a lot of impossible expectations to live up to that were put in place by the worst kinds of people there were demands for the character to smile and emote more after only being shown a couple minutes of footage anger at the films star brie larson for having the audacity to want to engage with and hear the opinions of more women and people of color during the press tour instead of the usual white straight males that make up the vast majority of film critics and a coordinated bombardment of negative reviews for the film both before and after its release as a stand against disney and marvel studios for daring to put out a superhero movie with a female lead played by an outspoken activist surely the companies must be pushing some sort of sinister agenda with all of this youd be wise to steer clear of the battle thats raging online surrounding this film if not just to be able to form your own unswayed opinions on it than to help keep your sanity or if youre like me you can take all of captain marvels discourse and channel it into viewing the film as a direct and necessary response to it marking it as not only an important moment in movie history but in culture as well it remains to be seen whether it will have as major of an impact as dcs wonder woman which beat it to the punch or marvels black panther but captain marvel soars above the predetermined hate and animosity aimed at it standing tall as both a fantastic standalone movie and a powerful and necessary addition to the marvel cinematic universe vers larson is a soldier in the kree army an alien race led by an ai known as the supreme intelligence annette bening the kree have been waging a war against another alien race known as the skrulls reptilian shapeshifters that are able to turn into other life forms perfectly blending in to society and they star in many youtube conspiracy videos vers team of noble warrior heroes as she calls them is sent on a mission to take down the skrull general talos ben mendelsohn but it quickly turns south and vers is sent crashing down to planet c53 otherwise known as earth if that sounds like exposition overload thats because it is captain marvel struggles a bit at the start the first act is filled to the brim with exposition dumping and learning the names of all the different aliens and planets but it manages to find its footing once vers is kidnapped by the skrulls early on were shown the life she once had on earth she was born as carol danvers a young woman who overcame the worlds sexist obstacles in front of her and who along with her friend maria lashana lynch became an air force pilot until an unfortunate runin with an alien force ended up cutting carols career short as well as giving her superpowers were shown carols life and backstory via the skrulls scrolling through her brain and watching her memories rewinding fastforwarding and even adding commentary which ends up being a fun and unique way to unload the information onto the audience captain marvel is a lot of things at once its a space fantasy adventure a superhero origin story a buddy cop comedy a period piece set in the 90s a prequel to the larger marvel universe and even a piece of social commentary all in one it miraculously never falters in being all of those things and the balancing act is a testament to the writing and directing skills of anna boden and ryan fleck the duo that marvel hired to helm their first womanled film the studio has often brought on smaller filmmakers before and put them in charge of their massive films but boden and fleck could be considered as indie as they come so its quite impressive that they were able to handle a project as big and important as this particular movie the film really gets moving once carol is back on earth and teams up with sam jacksons nick fury jackson is having a ball finally free from having to be the hardass director of shield that weve come to know this is a much younger fury who isnt afraid to have fun and show that hes enjoying himself and the chemistry between he and larson makes for one of the better duos in marvels vast list of characters the deaging technology used on him is a ridiculously convincing feat of visual effects so utterly seamless that you wont even be thinking it after the first couple of seconds mendelsohn is also a scene stealer if not an entire movie stealer  his performance as talos is one of his best and most entertaining performances in years what marvel always seems to get right is its dedication to character and for good reason the whole idea behind the mcus heroes both in casting and in writing them is to establish someone that audiences will be happy to see onscreen for the next decade or so and larsons carol danvers is a very welcome and long overdue presence carol is a hothead whos fueled by emotions like anger and sympathy and is constantly told by her superiors to suppress her feelings if she wishes to succeed it hopefully shouldnt go over anyones head that this story of female empowerment is about a woman whos told that her emotions make her weak and vulnerable when in actuality those emotions are her source of strength theres no need for subtlety here carols powerful feelings towards things are what makes her the godlike being shes destined to become and i cant imagine what seeing that kind of story in a massive blockbuster like this must feel like to a good number of women across the globe carol is a natural successor to captain america and shes similar him in a good number of ways she has a moral sense of right and wrong like he does and always gets back up no matter how hard shes knocked down but what sets her apart is how much more empathetic she is than most superheroes her motivations are heavily influenced by her need to help the less fortunate not that steve rogers doesnt fight for the same ideas but the people that hes trying to save are rarely shown to us and given time to exist as characters themselves in his films the people that carol chooses to protect and fight for are actual characters in her film and it makes for one of the mcus most righteous and empathetic causes weve seen a hero take a side for i usually consider the marvel films to be at their best when they reflect certain social issues and events that are taking place in the world today such as the first iron man or captain america the winter soldier and captain marvel joins the list by making some pretty poignant commentary besides the obvious themes of sexism and the suppression of women in positions of power the film also tackles ideas on opening up ones mind and not being afraid to reconsider everything you think you know vers lives her life without questioning her commanding officers and their noble conquest and its not until shes exposed to the other side and its people that she begins to understand the bigger picture the ideas and morals youve always held true may not be so black and white and that can easily lead to conversations on blind patriotism and nationalism versus exposure to new viewpoints and ideas captain marvels most impressive aspect to me is its unapologetic stance on certain government policies and fascismlike rule of law theres dialogue about refugees who are only looking for a home and how those refugees are treated like dirt and even eradicated theres talk about keeping out invaders through whatever means necessary and even family separation and the traumatic consequences of that its bold moving and surprising to see issues like these being addressed in a superhero movie but its all the better for it the film throws so much into its two hour runtime that it doesnt seem like theres any way to properly handle them all and yet it does and does it well despite a clunky first act captain marvel shatters the opposition against it its a touching exciting and fun adventure that introduces one of marvels better lead heroes and it easily exists on its own without needing to cater or connect to the larger universe it takes place in although it does answer plenty of questions the story takes some great twists and turns that keeps the energy up and carols final transformation into the extremely powerful titular captain is one of the most earned triumphant and chillinducing moments in the history of the genre carol danvers is a monstrous force of good to be reckoned with and as she herself states she has nothing to prove to anyone  some of the coverage you find on cultured vultures contains affiliate links which provide us with small commissions based on purchases made from

Aug 15 2019,negative, bill murray as the chief of police in a town beset by zombies delivers a key line in the dead dont die i was supposed to retire two years ago adam driver who plays his junior officer asks him why he didnt to which murray breaking the fourth wall replies are we improvising here they leave it at that this scripted offscript moment and their deadpan delivery evade the question which the characters the actors playing them and writerdirector jim jarmusch never answer the dead dont die alludes to a gerontocracy that has refused to make way for the next generation holding on to power even if it has to do it from beyond the grave tellingly the first zombies reanimated are iggy pop and sara driver playing 1970s rockers who crawl out of a graveyard and head for a vintage diner like the one in american graffiti classic rock will never die the 1950s will never end murray and his subordinates dispatch members of the current generation swiftly and cruelly without thinking much about it they invade the motel room of three twentysomethings played respectively by a former tv tween turned pop idol another former tv tween and an influencer who makes money by wearing sunglasses on instagram selena gomez austin butler and luka sabbat the cops find these tourists dead attacked by the zombies they chop off their heads preemptively before they can turn the three dead tourists are a far cry from the blank generation hipster trio who ended up in a florida motel in jarmuschs stranger than paradise thirtyfive years ago bohemians who came from nowhere and ended up nowhere back then jarmusch implies such people could afford to be aimless wanderers to kill time without getting assassinated themselves jarmusch does let some kids from juvie run off but the movies one real survivor is tom waits the only hermit left alive as unkillable as he was in the ballad of buster scruggs last year the dead dont die situates our unabated longing for the zombie apocalypse in the permanent october of rural areas where the halloween store is open yearround the exurban jarmusch depicts both the sadness of halfempty towns upstate and the annoyance of having to live among neighbors like steve buscemis farmer a rightwing sourpuss in a modified maga cap this is a film unhappy with humanity right down to specific neighbors mild and bleak idyllic and enamored with hopelessness the film is either jarmuschs version of the trouble with harry the autumnal hitchcock film in which a dead body keeps reappearing or one of those goofy william castle horror comedies from the 1960s with sid caesar in which bodies escape their coffins in the end it plays like a country version of ivan passers bleakfunny 1974 movie law and disorder which starred carroll oconnor and ernest borgnine as auxiliary policemen cruising the nighttime streets of the prejarmusch lower east side back then strungout thieves and rapists outnumbered hipster artists in the city the same way zombies outnumber the hipster cops in this movie jarmusch has moved upstate and found the same deadeyed weirdos milling around from only lovers left alive to the dead dont die alive or dead has ceased to make much difference to jarmusch when the highclass vampire couple in the former murdered people so they could survive they were different from these cops because they were aristocrats not civil servants what matters to jarmusch is that there is a natural order in the universe when tilda swinton removes herself from the scene to take her place among the aliens in this movie that order is preserved as it was when she was a vampire in only lovers left alive for jarmusch these lumpen zombies lack panache their brainlessness is not romantic and they deserve what they get jordan peeles followup to get out also mines countrycity terror though its point of view is californian not bohemian unlike jarmusch who would never do something so uncool peele channels the steven spielberg of the early 1980s the spielberg who hired director tobe hooper to make poltergeist edgy but then interfered to ensure it remained family friendly in us spielbergas a concept as a theme and now as a memoryconstrains peeles vision the same way spielberg constrained hooper poltergeist is not the texas chain saw massacre because whatever that movie was and however much money it made it was not commercial according to the aesthetic moralities of hollywood peele is haunted by his reaganera childhood and its popculture debris which is understandable but by compulsively inserting it into his movie peele makes us much less frightening than it could have been too much of the movie depends on whats on the tshirts characters wear peeles wardrobe choices are supposed to ground the film in specific time periods but also have to perform the function of grounding it thematically this is a recurrent tic of hollywood filmmaking that is both distracting and flattering to an audience already primed to hunt for 1970s and 80s shoutouts in every netflix show in us it lessens the impact of the hands across america tshirt at the films climax peele presents a classdivided america using this ironic signifier but it has the effect of implying that what will unite us as citizens is not class consciousness but liking this film as one audience because we get the references lupita nyongo has no trouble being terrifying and disturbing as both the villain and the hero of us the scary constricted voice she uses for her prisonjumpsuited doppelgänger was performance art with laurie anderson vocals that seemed to come from an lp i couldnt quite remember tim heidecker as an evil version of the slightly more successful backslapping white neighbor was more genuine in his dangerous frenzy and therefore more frightening heidecker comes across as an actual mirror version of himself revealing in his violence a murderous id hes channeled from comedy us exposes the shadow world of poverty and despair that undergirds the sunny lifestyle of people who are pretty sure but not quite sure that theyve made it as middleclass americans it peaks during its home invasion scene after way too much lovingwinking establishment of regular family life the kind of thing hitchcock or a tv commercial would have done much quicker peeles slow buildup to the familys confrontation with the twisted starved versions of themselves who seek to eliminate them and take their place brings something to the screen that black audiences have been denied in hollywood moviesa chance to see themselves in the spielbergian glow of alleged american normalcy the nightmare image of the jumpsuitclad doubles in the shadows of the driveway a family car sticker come to life as menacing paper dolls holding their own scissors is the highlight of us the home invasion is the films best scene but it doesnt last long enough after all the buildup it could have been the whole movie from that point and maybe would have been in a cheaper film somehow the clash between the competing versions of this family ends up muddled in postblack swan ballet the same way luca guadagninos ponderous suspiria remake did ballet as a signifier of class privilege lacks shock value in something as allamerican as us pretending that its eerie and sinister is like hitting all the keys on the organ at once phantom of the opera style ie a cliché not scary captain marvel takes place in 1995 the year of the oklahoma city bombing and the o j simpson trial of gangstas paradise and common people thats why i went to see it i wanted to find out how marvel studios handled the mid90s it turns out they handled them like top gun so more like the 1980s the blockbuster video scene in the movie reminded me that people today think the former existence of blockbuster video is funny i guess the existence of netflix the contemporary version of blockbuster is not funny because you dont have to go to a store its hard to remember captain marvel because it was boring brie larson who plays captain marvel and two other young women who are also captain marvel gets to kick an old ladys ass on a bus the old lady is a shapeshifting skrull however so its ok later larson becomes a god her apotheosis reminded me that before the film came out larson insisted that instead of the usual superheroindoctrinated 40yearold men attending her press junket there should also be a young woman in a wheelchair in attendance i thought about this young woman as i watched the rest of captain marvel i might resent captain marvel it occurred to me if i were in a wheelchair and brie larson had summoned me to watch her flying through the air and into outer space in the movie the skrulls turn out to be the good aliens and the kree friendly at the beginning are revealed as evil and destructive the same thing could happen to an entertainment reporter who gets a special invitation from a movie star there is an astonishing fight scene in john wick chapter 3 that takes place at night in a glass building with glass floors and walls the inky set design in this scene striking and ultracontemporary makes everything look like its taking place under cracked iphone screens but the dynamic between wick keanu reeves and the mewling sycophant hes fighting mark dacascos took a lot away from the action there was no way this guy named zero could get the upper hand for long the choreography and the blacktransparent look of that section of the film gave it a jolt and for a while a reason to exist the rest lacked anything as involving despite the aggressive nonstop complication of every second of the film including the title there is also a ballet scene that is supposed to be moody and frightening and isnt asia kate dillon a nonbinary actor with a neatly shorn head would have made a better foe for wick but dillon is instead constricted to helmut newtonesque slinking and posing in tight black pencil skirts ian mcshanes winston a traitorous hotelier sleepwalks through his role like hes playing the most interesting man in the world in the dos equis beer ads as incessant gunfire in the lobby and corridors destroys his hotel mcshane responds with ever faker nonchalant bullshit acting mirroring the overelaboration of everything else in the film the john wick franchise has an official weapons supplier but the films target audience isnt gun nuts this is a movie for corporate travel agents upset that it costs so much to stay in hotels brian de palma the director of the first mission impossible movie with tom cruise in 1996 and therefore one of the architects of the genre has at this point approximately zero chance of directing a 100 million action movie like john wick chapter 3 ever again his reputation may have been enhanced by the 2015 documentary about him made by noah baumbach and gwyneth paltrows brother but his career got no bounce from it the director of carrie dressed to kill and scarface depends these days on sketchy european producers who have an unfortunate tendency to mirror the plots of his movies by betraying him thus domino his latest arrives bitter and slapdash more a plan for a movie

assayas movie about the parisian publishing world has things in common with things to come the 2016 film by mia hansenløve assayass exwife which starred isabelle huppert as a parisian philosophy professor and author the difference is that things to come was a cleareyed case study in middle age and nonfiction is an immature french farce binoche plays a tv actress named selena to whom another character mentions juliette binoche a bit of selfreferentiality drawn from the he looks like that fellow in the movies you know ralph bellamy gag in his girl friday the dead dont die does this kind of thing too only more so with the actors breaking character to switch into script discussions maybe jarmusch and assayass generation of arthouse directors feels trapped by storytelling and wants to leave it behind the lettrist ending of assayass irma vep pointed in that direction in the years since assayas has become a more conventional filmmaker here he mistakes his girl friday for a zany romp instead of understanding that its a cynical fasttalking adventureromance like all hawkss movies as well as a comedy about the warlike nature of mass communication the world of bigcity newspaper reporters in the us in the late 1930s must have struck him as akin to the publishing world in contemporary paris where the big issues are not capital punishment and government corruption like in his girl friday but whether ebooks are the future that adds up to french people saying the word kindle a lot this is a variation on the handwringing over the future of the cinema in irma vepone thing assayas keeps telling us is that its a changing world out there with all this technology vincent macaigne is better and funnier than all that as an autobiographical novelist kind of inspired by philip roth in the same way this film is inspired by screwball comedies in the end whatever happens to book publishing doesnt matter as long as these french people can sleep with each others spouses and have young mistresses and go to their summer houses in his girl friday when cary grant promises to remarry rosalind russell then cons her into going away with him to cover a breaking story instead it was important to the film that they werent married anymore grant was exploiting russell and stringing her along to get what he wanted for his newspaper in nonfiction nobody can get back together again because they never leave each other in the first place joanna hoggs roman à clef of a movie covers her years in film school in early 1980s london when she was figuring out how she wanted to make movies and living on and off with an upperclass junkie boyfriend employed by the foreign office julie honor swinton byrne naive from a good home doesnt at first understand that the semicomatose but welldressed and handsomely flawed anthony tom burke is a user her slow realization that something is wrong and her polite matteroffact introduction to anthonys addiction which they dont discuss are the stuff of a horror movie hogg downplays the lurid aspects of their love affair replacing them with the familiarity of everyday life as their relationship unfolds strange awkward scenes begin to pile up anthony brings julie lingerie from paris asks her to put it on tells her youre a dark horse julie then she sees the tracks on his arm not knowing what they are their meals at harrods have a sleepy wellmannered mood that becomes nerveracking and narcotic as anthony runs out of money and begins to steal and sell julies possessions burke plays anthony as peter lorre in an evelyn waugh novel hes creepy but since hes unaware of it julie doesnt see it either we never see him away from julie so his scoring and shooting up are not part of the film nor his last hours the blownout white light from the windows in their apartment and the pillow shots hogg uses between scenes accompanied by snippets of songs from the period by robert wyatt joe jackson and the pretenders shield the film from becoming too novelisticit reminded me of a margaret drabble novel crossed with ozu the souvenir is a beautifully realized painful movie that only hits the viewer in the hours and days after seeing it tilda swinton in gray hair plays her own daughters mother communing humantohuman for a change instead of with the astral beings her muse or casting directors usually put her in touch with i never thought id see elisabeth moss singing another girl another planet as courtney love in the kat bjelland story in alex ross perrys her smell set in the 1990s postgrunge amerindie rock scene moss plays becky something an alcoholic drugaddicted guitarist and singer in a band with drummer ali gayle rankin and bass player marielle hell agyness deyn becky is a mess a thrower of dressingroom tantrums by the time she is finally able to make it onstage she insults the audience and can only plow through a song or two before tottering into the drums and collapsing between gigs she annoys everyone by hauling around her shaman an irritant named yaema eka darville in the studio she fumbles between illprepared nothingness and rage perry and moss follow beckys descent into addict hell and eventual recovery with true commitment to cassavetesstyle selfdestruction and enlightenment the difference is that john cassavetes did not make period pieces the 1990s evoked in her smell are as cleanedup as becky isnt a new allgirl band comes to supplant something she beckys weirdly named combo and perry presents them as more posttween green day than posthole veruca salt theyre nice studious and millennial like they got extra credit in a college course on riot grrrl for being in this movie this removes the film by one step from the rawness of beckys damaged life turning her smell into an acting exercise with 90s touches the films fiveact structure brings becky uptodate at a reunion show where she almost pulls her disappearing act sober that could have been more interesting than all the covenbased female empowerment on display in the scenes where other women musicians sit crosslegged on the floor light candles and praise her those scenes came off as both pandering to a contemporary audience and a rejection of the generation becky represents i guess thats realistic by act four she had already moved upstate to strum her guitar alone in a big house and ruminate on her misdeeds a trajectory artists from her era know well becky wins her battle with herself but when it was over i felt bruised and tired as if shed been pummeling me too like roberto durán fighting sugar ray leonard she had me holding up my hands and muttering no moss then the credits rolled and snapped me out of it with their fake album covers from the 90s the hustle is very low stakes and i only saw it because i was stuck in a mall in new jersey for two hours and it was the next thing playing the point of this remake of a remake is that the genders have been switched anne hathaway and rebel wilson now play roles played by men in the other two versions yet by the end it is a man who fools these two women con artists blackmailing them into being his employees not the ending i was expecting from a film that begins by asserting that all men are suckers alex sharp plays this unconvincing manboy grifter as a bland nothing whose initial guise is colorless and emptya niceguy tech billionaire shy around women hathaway has to pretend by turns that she is a member of the british leisure class and a german psychoanalyst femme fatale she excels in the latter puton opening a new path for herself she will probably never explore again wilson meanwhile must pretend she is blind an acting stunt which i guess is only not offensive because blind people wont see it at one point hathaway demonstrates to wilson how to produce tears on cue giving the lie to her awardwinning crying jag in les misérables its a secret of her craft she reveals too cheap with his second feature following his excellent debut 2015s kaili blues bi gan has done something radical an incursion into form long days journey into night reveals the trick of 3d instead of a continuous pseudoimmersive experience that starts at the beginning here 3d infiltrates more than halfway through the films nearly twoandahalfhour running time when it finally enters bi reemphasizes its alleged immersiveness 3ds main selling point by having this last hourlong section comprise one continuous take a single shot that floats from a gondola lift through a nighttime market and elsewhere through the end of the film before this shot begins the viewer must figure out when its time to put on the clunky 3d glasses a point in the film bi signals by having his protagonist luo hongwu huang jue sit down in a movie theater bi has established himself as a significant artist with just two films partially by being a synthesist of all previous auteur cinema long days journey into night combines many strains from the poetic realism of le jour se lève to hiroshima mon amour and in the mood for love from warhol a character eats an entire apple in one shot to tarkovsky a glass shakes itself off a table it all seems put together in a calm hypnotic state using the gliding camera of theo angelopoulos to move through the torture and violence of johnnie to and tarantino gangster movies via the observational modernism of apichatpong weerasethakul that all of this becomes present in the viewers mind without taking away from whats original about his film is a testament to bis skill hes an artist who learned online like some poker champions watching films at home and its significant that he comes from provincial china not the nyu tisch school of the arts we inhabit the romance and fatalism of long days journey into night as in a dreamsomeone says in the film that dreams are lost memories bis camera follows luo as he searches his hometown for his lost love the enchanting tang wei from lust caution and his best friend from twenty years ago wildcat probably murdered i happened to see long days journey into night at the metrograph at a morning show at which i was the only person present during the 3d sequence a woman came into the theater and sat down right next to me which i thought was odd i turned to her wearing the 3d glasses over my regular glasses wondering what was going on she looked at me and in an australian accent she asked is this the appatmint i had no idea what she was saying i was fully inhabiting the film and her entrance seemed like part of it she repeated the same questionis this the appatmintand this time i understood she wanted to know if this was the apartment billy wilders movie of that name was showing at the metrograph in the other theater no i told her this is a new chinese movie in 3d she looked at me wearing the 3d glasses then at the screen and instead of leaving she watched the movie for a while something about what was going on froze her in place in front of images that were out of focus for her because she didnt have 3d glasses on suddenly she got up and walked out maybe i should have followed her out and gone to see the apartment starting my own journey into night but by then bi gan had me pinned in place stuck in the flow with his moving camera jia zhangkes latest film also focuses on events in the early 2000s but since jia has come to his mastery the hard way his view of the interrupted relationship between a gangster liao fan and his moll zhao tao expands not just in filmic memory but out into the real world of contemporary chinese history his vistas are bigger plainer and harder on the people who inhabit them if this is a genre story in some ways just as long days journey into night is its a more tragic one with bitter unromantic repercussions there is fatalism and then there is stoicism here it is a womans longing not a mans that propels the film zhao is one of the greatest actresses in cinema and her journey in ash is purest white is hardboiled and subtly melodramatic she begins as the realist daughter of an outmoded communist ideologue then transforms herself into a cool moneymaking criminal in the provincial jianghu underworld she takes the fall on a gun charge for her lover and ends up a jailbird to get back to him after prison she passes through the three gorges area of the yangtze river on a ship where her identity and money are stolen the new chinese capitalism erases her past rendering her sacrifice meaningless zhaos qiao is absorbed into a vast audience singing along with pop performers onstage a wider angle on the individual karaoke in bi gans film jias tour of his country displays a 21stcentury china that is dirty and mean punishing its characters for coming into adulthood in a petty greedy time there is no progress in their lives only aging qiao ends up where she started doubly abandoned in her old hometown serving the old gangsters who never made it out for bi gan only love can break your heart in ash is purest white there are many more things that can break your spirit this soccerrefugee satire from portugal by gabriel abrantes and daniel schmidt is cute as hell and as fluffy and pink as the enormous pekingese puppies diamantino matamouros carloto cotta pictures in his head when hes on the field about to score a goal unfortunately its also about as savage as those puppies diamantino is a modern candide a pampered star athlete without a thought in his head he adopts a refugee as his son after a sudden burst of compassion then allows himself to be experimented on by scientists who are after his perfect superman genes diamantino is too clueless to realize his refugee son is actually a queer girl cleo tavares scamming him and that his doctors are slowly turning him into a woman a side effect of their genemapping drugs on top of all this he is duped into running for office by a fascist antiimmigrant political party the plot sounds like nextgeneration almodóvar or latterday john waters but because diamantino is so gentle and nice in its intersectionality it ends up somewhat hapless with a downbeat wistful ending surely big pharma rightwing manipulation and the endless greed of the already wealthy deserve something a little harsher than this ninetysevenminute underwear ad an example of presentday camp too sane and wellbehaved to have much bite shot by sean price williams the dexterous cinematographer who also filmed her smell michael m bilandics jobez world which is set i think in the present is way more forthright and weird than alex ross perrys film the kind of microbudget new york indie that exists to get gloriously terrible outofit reviews in the hollywood reporter and variety jobez world is pretty glorious and outofit itself the film follows jason grisell

standup comic owen kline the younger brother from the squid and the whale is barely coherent and wears a large button that reads license to bullshit this feature film is a concise and actionpacked sixtyseven minutes long and i could have easily watched another half hour of it or definitely another ten minutes does the angle between two walls have a happy ending asked j g ballard jill magids epic troll of a documentary on the mexican architect luis barragán suggests that it does not magid who features herself in her film as prominently as barragán he died in 1988 visits the architects house in mexico where she stays on a oneperson residency to make barragáncentric art of some kind using his personal archives in this section of the proposal we see shots of barragáns monumental colorful slablike work which photographs beautifully and is a pleasure to look at magid then reveals that barragáns estate and the rights to depicting his work are owned by an italian woman federica zanco zanco is an art historian married to the swiss billionaire whose family owns vitra a design firm that manufactures highend modernist furniture runs a museum and has headquarters that feature buildings by famous architects including frank gehry and zaha hadid zanco owns the barragán estate because her husband rolf bought it for her as a 25 million engagement present in 1995 federica and rolf have subsequently trademarked barragáns name they dont allow researchers to see his professional archives nor do they allow any of his work to be displayed in other museums including ones in mexico photographers who take pictures of the architects buildings are supposed to pay them as are publishers who reproduce the photos theyve got the barragán intellectual property rights in copyright lockdown understandably barragáns family finds these swiss capitalists obnoxious and creepy so they allow magid to dig up the urn containing the architects ashes and turn a portion of them into a diamond magid sets this new diamond in an engagement ring she offers to zanco in exchange for freeing the barragán rights zanco will finally get an engagement ring if she accepts magids macabre offer magid films her meeting with zanco from across the street using a long lens like a police surveillance video zanco is barely glimpsed inaccessible to the public protected by her wealth this could be the subject for a hitchcock or a de palma movie and magid comports herself with a certain allure and mystery even though she is open and cheerful her necrophilia is loving and allamerican she contrasts it with the secrecy of these austere swiss oddballs and their exploitative scheme much of the film is epistolary because it takes magid forever to get zanco to meet her in magids letters she compares herself and zanco to barragáns lovers while zanco responds with an excessive perfect cordiality that seems both ultracultured and psycho somehow the precepts of the art world allow magid to execute this giant prank flawlessly hiring workers to dig up the cemetery and paying scientists to make the diamond in a commercial lab all just to freak out one avaricious italian woman who lives in

Aug 8 2019,neutral, captain marvels vers brie larson cant remember a thing about her past life she has only known this training with her mentor yonrogg jude law and fighting with her fellow kree warriors in starforce  things start slowly as origin films do with a lot of worldbuilding groundwork in outer space starforce includes talented actors like rune temte gemma chan and djimon hounsou but theyre badly underused in the picture separated from captain marvel almost immediately thats probably so we can get to earth quicker but it makes their obviously forthcoming return later in the picture less emotionally impactful than it could and should have been given what they represent in the narrative when we arrive on earth in the 1990s the movie picks up considerably buoyed by cheeky nostalgia plentiful jokes its strangely hilarious to see brie larson slowly tapping away at old computers and a stronger focus on the protagonists plight  the best move is an overall lightness in tone which springs from the fun chemistry between brie larson and samuel l jackson reprising his nick fury role this time with both eyes since were in the past and the total relief that the stakes arent the destruction of the universe for once whew but a war in outer space that we largely arent privy to  were on a more personal journey for captain marvel to recover her memories and become her truest most powerful self with something of a blank slate to play brie larson leans into her star charisma with professional ease  the supporting cast are all strong jude law is compelling as usual but this time with yellow eyes annette bening who we didnt expect to see in a superhero picture is having fun with her dual role as a mysterious figure from marvels past and the kree leader known as supreme intelligence lashana lynch has a largely thankless role as maria rambeau captain marvels former best friend who she has completely forgotten due to the memory wipe but lynch rises to the challenge and gifts the exposition with some heart and soul the films happiest surprise though is that it features not one but two true scenestealers in the form of an adorable ginger cat named goose and a very game and rangy performance from ben mendelsohn as both a shield agent and the skrull who impersonates him comedy aside the bread and butter of superhero movies are their action sequences and unfortunately here captain marvel comes up bland directors anna boden  ryan fleck best known for the fine ryan gosling drama half nelson have always been gifted with actors but havent yet conquered the unique directorial challenge of fight scenes and crafting memorable action set pieces  one early sequence requires our heroine to fight without the use of both of her hands long story and in another she isnt exactly sure whos shes fighting stopping frequently to suss out which human is actually the skrull shes chasing giving the sequence a unique rhythm  these significant obstacles make a world of difference in the end the problem with the other action sequences particularly the dreadful finale may be that captain marvel is too powerful when a character feels unbeatable action sequences deflate into mere pyrotechnics and foregone conclusions cgi light displays doing all the work when its the heroes themselves and those insurmountable odds that we cant imagine how theyll overcome that were invested in if its too easy for them theres no triumph to cheer on with film 21 marvel is breaking no new ground but for the gender of its protagonist it seems insane in a subgenre that firmly belongs to the actionadventure side of filmmaking thats already given us iconic female characters like the bride sarah connors lt ellen ripley neytiri catwoman and wonder woman to name just a few that it would take this long for marvel to let a woman lead the way but here we are  women and fans of female heroes deserved better than captain marvel a mediocre entry in the marvel cinematic universe but theres no denying that its rousing to see a woman triumph within the context of this heretofore excessively masculine universe  that said theres unfortunately not a single moment thats a patch on the kind of ecstatic cultural charge of the no mans land sequence in wonder woman it remains a shaming miracle that the messy warner brosdc school of superhero filmmaking pulled off a great female hero movie before marvel even deigned to bother trying  perhaps now with marvels selfimposed glass ceiling shattered theyll be able to reach for that kind of grandeur themselves we hope theyll try comic books have a rich history of great female characters and all too few of them have been done justice on the big screen  it was so much fun to see annette bening having a ton of fun and reminding us all what a big star she is im so used to seeing her in smaller films now that it was great to see her in something like this hopefully this is the start to a great year for her  i mean i get it marvel needed to introduce a thanos killer and it had to be relatively serious not an absurdist punchline and thats why this is a captain marvel movie not a squirrel girl movie butwouldnt that absurdist punchline character make a better movie that having been said now that theyve committed to including carol danvers as captain marvel im pulling for her solo film 3 being a 6080 million cancer special i too thought the beginning dragged and the return of her space team towards the end lacked emotional punch but everything on earth and especially the new orleans sojourn was just aces the latter part especially felt refreshingly indie to me which makes sense thats where fleckboden excels i did seem to like the film more than you since larson and the other actors were just so good and it was damn thrilling to see her kick ass as well as lynch in her one big moment mendelsohn is perfection and the cgi to jackson is eerie good i had a much more positive response  some of the filmmaking criticism is warranted  there are significant holes in the plot and the hala aesthetic seems as you put it rushed and empty  but the solid performances all around especially from larson and jackson whose danvers and fury have the most chemistry of any marvel duo since thor and loki makes for a great time at the movies i like brie larson but shes totally miscast as captain marvel  she seemed out of her depth  her performance lacked her usual charm and fun and charismaand i didnt think she had great chemistry with samuel l jacksonthe dreaded curse of the green screen perhapsbut she can work in blockbusters  she worked like gangbusters in kong skull island for instanceso i dont know why she came across so bored and dead in captain marvelshe also looked kinda terrible with that awful hair  wig  very distracting and unflattering ulrich because she wasnt really here for this and was more interested in solo movie 2 and 3 as i mentioned earlier i am honestly so down for a 6080 million cancer special ending this franchise shes the strongest avenger according to a short clip i watched on imdb and boy isnt it awesome to finally see a hero who totally dominates  we havent had that in a marvel film and that someones a woman i liked this film a lot  it wasnt a toptier film of the mcu  however it did what it needed to do and more  plus i agree joe on lawshana lynch as i liked what they did with maria rambeau as someone who would help vers remember who she is as well as take part in the battle proving that she can kick ass wo superpowers mild spoilers but here are some issues that captain marvel may or may not have touched on police brutality the after effects of the scramble for africa dadt immigration the end of history gender equality in government institutions but it handles those issues in a frustratingly problematic way jaragon when i saw that the red and blue costume went with the starburst thing i groaned pure lazy translation with no regard for future continuity yes carols ms marvel swimsuit sash  and heels look wasnt going to translate to liveaction see catwoman elektra barb wire i could mention how dull the mcu versions of scarlet witch and elektra look like as counterpoints of antisexy gone wrong but id rather dull design to that creeping feel of wrongness of design but also yes carol needed to wear a costume with a thunderbolt symbol on it and that being the red and blue costume makes all the sense im with you 100 nathaniel i dont usually care for superhero movies and i cried like a child watching wonder woman maybe its not fair to expect captain marvel to feel the same but i thought it was just as forgettable as most marvel movies it didnt feel any more special than antman or guardians of the galaxy 2 and thats just depressing
Jul 30 2019,positive, one sentence review captain marvel is a fun corny and empowering origin story that feels like a bridge between the past and the future of the marvel cinematic universe one paragraph review captain marvel harkens back to the mcu origin stories that kicked off this wave of superhero movies  and thats a good thing its smaller tighter and more character driven than the other movies in the franchise even if it feels nonessential it also helps that brie larson and samuel l jackson have firecracker chemistry and are supported by a stellar cast  ben mendelsohn and lashana lynch are standouts captain marvel had one of the hardest time slots on the marvel cinematic universe calendar if the forthcoming avengers endgame is the series finale then captain marvel is the penultimate episode however like many penultimate episodes it feels like any typical entry in the marvel cinematic universe  for both better and worse  like last years bumblebee  the out of sequence 80s dripped entry in the transformers franchise  captain marvel is a prequel to almost all of the mcu  except captain america the first avenger taking place in the 90s and following a kree soldier called vers brie larson captain marvel is less about forwarding the overall storyline of the mcu  though it certainly connects some dots  and more about giving captain marvel a warm welcome to the mcu with her own origin story  and while the movie hits a lot of the same beats as a typical superhero origin story it presents them in an interesting way thats because vers spends most of the running time of the movie trying to make sense of these dreams of a life on earth that feel like memories  along with her crew of kree warriors  vers mentor and commander yonrogg jude law minnerva a criminally underused gemma chan korath djimon hounsou reprising his guardians of the galaxy role among others  vers continues the longrunning war with a shapeshifting species called skrulls however after being captured in a battle vers escapes only to crash land on earth there she catches the attention of shield operative nick fury a deaged samuel l jackson  the cgi is phenomenal who helps her on her quest to find out who she is and defeat the skrulls the movie balances funny fishoutofwater moments as vers marvels at the 90s culture and technology  she literally crashlands into a blockbuster  with a charming buddy comedy between fury and vers and while its all fun and entertaining the movie does get at something deeper  so much of what works in captain marvel comes from directors anna boden and ryan fleck best known for half nelson which scored ryan gosling his first oscar nomination mcu mastermind kevin feige choosing the duo to tackle the introduction of what is most likely going to be their most important hero to date was surprising theyve directed quiet charactercentric indies for most of their careers but its that indie intimacy that drives the movies best moments  vers finally tracks down some answers in the form of her former best friend on earth maria a terrific lashana lynch and instead of it being this huge melodramatic moment where the hero reunites with their best friend or finally learns their identity the movie slows down and gives a genuinely emotional moment between these two women lynch nails the scene shes a standout  to both its benefit and detriment captain marvel is essentially inconsequential in the mcu timeline we could have jumped into endgame without this story it pulls some of the tension and stakes out of it  even the villain of the piece talos ben mendohlson  truly great is mostly benign however it also allows the movie to be that corny fun and uplifting origin story that weve seen but still eat up  it helps that brie larson is magnetic as captain marvel shes not your typical superhero theres something genuine about her even when she truly harnesses the extent of her powers it feels like a real person experiencing something extraordinary speaking of the extent of her powers thanos better beware  at just two hours captain marvel is really just a blast to watch its a movie that i think will replay a lot better than in this current moment when we can separate it from the conclusion of the franchise it doesnt bring much new to the table other than the fact that the hero is a woman but with that it inherently has these touching moments of empowerment that make this an important entry in the mcu  hey im karl founder and film critic at smash cut i started smash cut in 2014 to share my love of movies and give a perspective i havent yet seen represented im also an editor at the new york times a rotten tomatoesapproved critic and a member of the online film critics society
Jul 17 2019,neutral, everyones going to be talking about captain marvel for the next few weeks as its inarguably the biggest film being released in the world but precious little of that chatter is going to be about the film itself as with last years black panther the latest marvel release is being positioned less as an actual film and more a wokeness bargaining chip for social media debate only where last year the conversation was centered around representation along racial lines this year its largely about gender captain marvel is the first mcu film to be fronted by a female star in this case the very talented brie larson after a decade of the opposite so it stands to reason that there would be a ghostbustersesque showdown between mouthbreathing mens rights activists and feminist film fans but the digital back and forth is even more convoluted than that simple right and wrong binary the films marketing is reaching michael bay levels of militaryindustrial complex pandering which alongside marvels weird relationship with northrop grumman has given folks pause does seeing this film mean youre supporting diversity in genre film or does it mean youre aiding a corporatespun military recruitment tool the answer is neither this is a superhero movie in fact its basically the same superhero movie weve seen roughly three to five times a year for the last several years perhaps the reason so much of the captain marvel discourse has expanded into this larger interconnected web of special interest group opinions and the inescapable tendrils of late capitalism is because its more stimulating to fight about each of those issues than it is to unpack an empty box there just isnt that much to say about this movie and thats basically by design halfnelson directing pair anna boden  ryan fleck along with a coterie of female screenwriters including nicole perlman meg lefauve and tomb raider reboot scribe geneva robertsondworet were tasked with making captain marvels mixedup history into a coherent and unified superhero origin story in the mcu mold unlike dcs wonder woman marvel doesnt have the luxury of a century old pop cultural icon as their first lady so the creative team dismantles and rearranges elements of carol danvers green lanterny origins into a coherent narrative about an air force pilot with amnesia who thinks shes an alien super soldier technically a prequel the film utilizes its 1995 setting to fill in some mcu history blanks like figuring out how nick fury samuel l jackson lost his eye or finding out how long it takes for things to download on the prehistoric internet oh wait no its much more of that latter than the former anyone hoping for a fascinating expansion of the marvel mythology is going to have to settle for buzzfeed 90s kid bait masquerading as comedy all delivered with the identical mcu sense of humor that is effortlessly charming in the moment but groaninducing hours later when one ponders how much screen time it took up whats so frustrating about captain marvel is that at its core theres a truly engrossing narrative surrounding carol and her best friend maria lashana lynch and their mentor dr lawson annette bening but the decision to make carols history a mystery means we only catch it in glimpses between much less interesting material in interviews larson talks about how much these relationships meant to her in the script but in the finished product theyre just glimmers of hope for a better more emotionally engaging film than the one we get larson herself is a welcome presence to these films but her character is less a character than a collection of quirks and entertaining line delivery at one dramatic moment carol exclaims about not even knowing who she is but the real tragedy is that the audience doesnt either when her best friend comforts her with a monologue about her identity and character that just isnt a sufficient substitute for letting her actually have one the closest the film gets to exploring gender equality the way the marketing would suggest is a climactic sequence that at best resembles a super bowl ad leveraging feminist iconography to get you to buy something captain marvel is one of the most expensive movies of the year and it still looks ugly and drab and universally less cinematic than most modern television series the editing style used for exploring the nonlinear nature of carols story feels formally inventive at times compared only to other mcu films but the action and everything else is the same rote beatforbeat second unit mediocrity weve come to expect from this brand why mess with a successful formula one might ask well its because as much as this film breaks a glass ceiling for women in the superhero genre the mcu still lives under a domed limit of their own creation sure because theyre fun and entertaining and people love the characters theyll keep getting high grosses so they cant lose but if theres no risks taken ever then how can they truly ever win early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Jul 12 2019,positive, carol danvers captain marvel character has had a long strange trip from her debut to landing into theaters this year while danvers originally appeared in comic books way back in 1968 but wouldnt be known as captain marvel until 2012 in that span of time the character underwent massive changes to a very convoluted origin story arent they all and adopted multiple aliases ms marvel binary warbird ms marvel again outfits and abilities it wasnt until the last decade or so that writers kelly sue deconnick chief among them attempted to streamline all of that continuity settled on a specific set of superpowers and a real solid understanding of the characters role in the comics and her personality as a whole this scrambled backstory before landing on solid ground is different than most of the other main heroes in the mcu thus far with the exception of the guardians of the galaxy movies luckily writers anna boden ryan fleck and geneva robertsondworet figured out a way to create a clear throughline for danvers origin and story unfortunately a lot of their characterization ends up feeling flat and not as engaging captain marvel is an incredibly mixed bag with a lot of great elements butting up against weak character and thematic work in the year 1995 on the distant planet of hala veers brie larson is an amnesiac who seeks to fight with the kree starforce under the command of yonrogg jude law unlike her fellow soldiers gemma chan djimon hounsou rune temte veers is able to shoot out energy beams from her fistbut has great difficulties controlling her emotions she and the other starforce members are fighting the skrull an alien race of shapeshifting terrorists after protracted fight veers ends up on earth with the skrulls in close pursuit led by their general talos ben mendelsohn veers teams up with nick fury samuel l jackson to figure out the skrulls plans save the day and learn the truth about veers origin as carol danvers back on earth also theres a cute cat named goose in it captain marvel directed by anna boden and ryan fleck does a lot of things very well the casting is utterly stellar with a ton of talent given good moments scattered throughout jackson and mendelsohn are particularly excellent and play so well against each other mendelsohn possesses a great mix of menace humor and sympathy while jackson is clearly in the long kiss goodnight mode and having a ball who knew hearing the ultimate spymaster talking with his mouth full of sandwich could be so delightful annette bening as a shadowy member from danvers past has some fun moments and gemma chan is incredibly badass as minnerva larson is a solid actress who shines best in her moments of being charming and playing off the actors around her she also can do righteous anger well but for some reason it is a very bifurcated performance with these two sides never being reconciled or seeming to be part of the same character a lot of her jokes and action quips fall flat and while theres a narrative arc to the character there isnt an emotional one there were plenty of opportunities to build that into the film but ultimately its scattershot and misses a propulsive sense of maturing that would truly engage audiences technically the movie is also kind of a mixed bag it looks great with engaging cinematography by ben davis and cgi that really creates an expansive galactic world for danvers to exist within the costume and production designs and makeup work are similarly great and do an excellent job create an interstellar world that viewers can immediately step into but then there are far too many visual gags and callouts to its the 90s that it becomes groan inducing the score by pinar toprak is probably one of the top five scores in any marvel movie with a great shift between electronic synths in the alien planets and a more melodramatic orchestra on earth before becoming very john williamsy when the two worlds collide but the needle drops of its the 90s hits are so blatant and awkward that it doesnt quite work the songs are obvious choices they are very loud in the mix and most are meant to be nostalgic gags the one that is mildly clever doesnt even make sense within the context of the movie and is so underlined that it goes back to being annoying one other element about captain marvel that is also a dichotomy is the fun element in the third act embracing her abilities and taking on villains there is a certain glee to be had when flying around and shooting energy beams  i get that but when she destroys ships with people on them and literally shouts woo right after doing soits just odd thats not to say she should be somber and sad but its an odd exclamation to killing people obviously marvel heroes tacitly kill people all the time but its not usually done with such glee and the arguments that its because shes a warriorsoldier doesnt make sense compared to the fact that captain america falcon black widow hawkeye and others are that as well it should be noted that i was the only one that felt this way when i asked folks after the screening the other movie nerds  all white males  said that they would woo too if they could fly and were killing people that tried to kill them its just an odd take that couldve been solved by using drones or robots or something because its not like shes a character with bloodlust or anything captain marvel isnt bad but it isnt great it has some excellent moments terrific performances and solid lines of dialogue in the hands of other writers and directors larson will shine as the character who will better combine her modes into one wellrounded person hopefully with much better jokes it has a few fun prequel moments taking place way before iron man and the avengers but it also has a few groan inducing prequel moments its a fine and fun movie that manages to create a streamlined origin that honors the comic roots along with a mostly satisfying narrative arc but the lack of digging deeper and giving a real emotional character arc with a true set of goals keeps it at a distance from the audience it is still important and great to see such a powerful female character who is strong yet vulnerable that is able to be beacon of representation and inspiration for young moviegoers and audiences should look forward to more adventures with captain marvel

Jul 8 2019,positive, kree warrior hero vers larson has the same recurring nightmare and doesnt know why  she remembers very little of her past except being in some kind of war  she trains with her starforce commander yonrogg jude law the talented mr ripley who tries to help her harness her power and curb her emotions  they along with the rest of their team are fighting the skrull a group of alien shapeshifters out to destroy the kree after being captured and escaping from the skrull captain marvel finds herself on earth searching for the person in her recurring dreams dr lawson annette bening american beauty while searching for lawson and fighting the skrull on earth captain marvel meets nick fury samuel l jackson pulp fiction a member of shield at first he doesnt believe anything she is telling him and he simply thinks she is crazy until he has a firsthand encounter with one of the shapeshifters  together he and captain marvel find pegasus a top secret project lawson was working on which leads them to carol danvers best friend maria rambeau lashan lynch brotherhood  after listening to a tape of the black box from her plane crash captain marvel remembers who she and lawson are and that the skrull are not the enemy  she must then find the topsecret project lawson was working on before it falls into the wrong hands larson is a great casting choice to play danverscaptain marvel  she has an air of power with a soft femininity underneath and a sarcastic wit that helps lighten the mood of the serious action film  seeing fury digital deaged was incredible and im curious as to what jackson thought when he first saw it  law is well cast as marvels commander because he lulls the audience into a false sense of comfort when in reality his motives are questionable  bening plays dual roles here and does so wonderfully  she is kind and generous as carols friend and mentor and deliciously evil as supreme intelligence of the kree the story is interesting and plays out well on screen  for me the 1990s references were a stroll down memory lane and i loved it  the recreations were excellent and most of the eclectic soundtrack was enjoyable other than an illplaced no doubts im just a girl  im not sure what directors anna boden sugar and ryan fleck half nelson were thinking on that one but it definitely didnt work the film also had a few cheesy moments and the last fifteen minutes of the film left something to be desired for me  from the glowing captain marvel to the cringeworthy dialogue it loses the momentum it built up throughout the film however despite being two hours long the movie doesnt seem long at all captain marvel had a more interesting story than the trailers led us to believe and it is blended with terrific action sequences and great special effects to make for a very entertaining movie  after watching this film i cant wait to see what captain marvel brings to this springs avengers endgame allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Jun 28 2019,positive, in 2019 we measure success in marvel movies roughly three times a yearin spring summer and sometimes falla marvel film debuts and becomes the benchmark against which all other blockbusters are weighed if the film is wellreceived we immediately hear buzz about a sequel if it isnt well thats what the avengers films are for but after ten years of adapting comic book icons what was adapted became just as important a question as how and because of this captain marvel like black panther before it has become a film burdened with expectation all this time and all these billions of dollars and now we get a marvel film about a woman and since marvel is the benchmark of blockbuster success then a marvel film about a woman then becomes a yardstick for arguing how viable all blockbusters built around women are this burden wasnt fair in 2018 and it isnt fair now in a lot of ways captain marvel is better at the perfunctory origin story than just about every one of marvels first wave of films instead of merely conveying a conventional heros journey wrapped in a colorful new setting captain marvel tells the story of how carol danvers became the most powerful being in the marvel cinematic universe by way of a scifi mystery at the start of the film danvers is an amnesiac known as vers a member of the kree starforce a team of highly trained humanoid warriors dispatched to quell threats to the kree empirea posh theyre literally bluebloods hightech society with very specific ideas about how the galaxy should be run in a mission to take on the shapeshifting greenskinned skrulls vers crashlands on 1995 earth at the same time as the skrulls and must hunt down the shapeshifters that have infiltrated our world while also figuring out why she cant shake the feeling that she had a life here at the end of the day captain marvel is a marvel movie with all that entails this means the action is serviceable with flashes of truly cool video gameesque inventiveness theres going to be gestures at complicated ideas that arent fully explored because we only have so much time to get from there to here and theres going to be a fun castsamuel l jackson is having a ball as a young nick fury who spends most of the film on the road with danvers as an incredulous young shield agent who still has both eyes intact the pair are delightful together as is jackson with captain marvels breakout feline goose and well everyone else annette bening and lashana lynch deliver warm understated performances that make you wish for a more lowkey film where we spend more time with them and ben mendelsohn is surprisingly wry and funny as the skrull warrior talos as an action movie captain marvel is really clever with more than a few twists thatll surprise both comics fans and newcomerstwists that also make an effort to tell a subtler story than marvel movies generally attempt there are some bumps in that storys telling the 90s setting is mostly deployed for shallow cloying humor the music choices are both on the nose and the opposite of deep cuts and the sweeping nature of the storyfrom the kree homeworld of hala to the deserts of the southwest and the suburbs of louisianais too busy constantly moving to really allow for much in the way of character work the biggest problem then is that captain marvel is doing so much we dont actually get to know captain marvel all that well we get glimpses of her carol danvers loves karaoke is fiercely competitive and knocks back a beer to unwind but we really dont get to see this person were just told about her and due to her amnesia carol is too the audience and carol herself spends much of captain marvel learning who carol danvers is and as such we only get to spend precious few moments with her and thats the most heartbreaking thing about captain marvel weve waited so long to meet this hero yet by the end of the film bearing her name we know her about as well as we did at the start
Jun 23 2019,positive, vers brie larson is a kree warrior sent to defend her civilization from the shapeshifting aliens known as skrulls captured in combat she escapes  only to find herself on mid1990s earth a planet she is shocked to discover she has visited before teaming up with shield agent nick fury samuel l jackson she fights to stop a skrull invasion attempt while working to rediscover her true identity marvel studios widely loved and phenomenally successful superhero franchise clocks up its 21st feature with captain marvel heralded as both the first marvel film with a female protagonist and the first to have a female director anna boden shares those duties with her regular collaborator ryan fleck dwelling on either point is understandable since both are well overdue dwelling on them may also be a potential mistake since focusing on either risks overlooking simply what an effective and entertaining blockbuster captain marvel has turned out to be the film opens to a relatively messy first act dropping the viewer into the kree empire and a secret military mission undertaken by vers her mentor yonrogg jude law and a team of elite kree warriors from there its a short dash to a first encounter with the reptilian skrulls a crash landing on earth and a meeting with a younger and less cynical nick fury while it takes a while for the film to settle down to a comfortable setup it does avoid the usual pitfalls of a superhero origin the pace is faster and the usual tropes of the genre are either absent or remixed into a less traditional form it is a great showcase for its cast as well i am a big fan of brie larsons work and she does not disappoint as vers she also has a natural sort of chemistry  or at least it feels natural  with samuel l jacksons more playful version of nick fury the film regularly acts as a gift for the more continuityobsessed fans not only showing off young fury but also franchise stalwart clark gregg agent coulson and guardians of the galaxy alumni lee pace ronan the accuser and djimon hounsou korath it is undertaken with a pleasing subtlety it adds an additional layer of entertainment for the hardcore while not getting in the way of the actual story for casual viewers if there is a mostvaluableplayer to the cast however it is ben mendelsohns spectacular turn as talos the skrull leader and primary antagonist mendelsohn plays the role with a deft handle on comedy his timing is sensational his use of his own australian accent when in his lizard form is wonderfully odd he is also a valuable addition to any film but here mendelsohn creates one of the most entertaining characters marvel studios have ever had the film boasts strong cineliterate action paired with a solid sense of production design once the narrative settles down on earth for its second and third acts it presents a good balance of action drama and comedy the films pairing of action scenes with mid90s rock and pop music is a little on the nose but amusingly selfaware the ultimate achievement of captain marvel is that it can be two films at the same time it honestly works as a straightforward science fiction action film in which a hero discovers their true identity and learns the full extent of their alien superpowers it also works spectacularly as a feminist text in which a woman steps out from a patriarchal shadow and challenges a sexist male mentor in the process it frames the story as a recognisable maledominated world and then breaks that world in two it is this extra dimension that really makes the film rise above the standard marvel cinematic universe fare i too loved ben mendelssohn in this film the odd detail of his australian accent when in skrull form delighted me and allowed me as another australian to find extra sympathy for his character yes it was an odd choice but for me sheer genius it could have overshadowed the rest of the film but the film is good enough entertaining enough and sheer fun enough to work on all levels im in the throes of a third watch and therell be many more wouldnt wolverine have worked with an australian accent i think it could have fake american accents are a pet peeve of mine im looking forward to future captain marvel films and just hope that ben mendelssohn is in them it also works spectacularly as a feminist text in which a woman steps out from a patriarchal shadow and challenges a sexist male mentor in the process it frames the story as a recognisable maledominated world and then breaks that world in two it is this extra dimension that really makes the film rise above the standard marvel cinematic universe fare 1970 just called they would like their men suck trope back what an idiotic statement recognizable to whom people like yourself who are trying to find your inner feminine wokeness perhaps but to the grown ups in the room this was just a good action hero movie
Jun 18 2019,positive, for the first 10 minutes captain marvel choochoochooses to chugalug down the same green lantern train tracks that ran over ryan reynolds a vomitorium of needless exposition that may as well have had annette benning holding a wile e coyote picket sign reading we dont trust you idiots in the audience the opening is thankfully little more than a bellyflop by a pretty nimble swimmer what follows is goofy blissfully weird and wholly original when its allowed to be its either a remarkable coincidence or nakedly obvious why the first major marvel movie with a female lead is also their first film to feel frequently palpably constrained by studio suits every time captain marvel is poised to spill over into the wacky giddiness to which it so clearly wants to succumb brie larson has to put her hands on her hips and stare off into the distance whilst pondering how war is bad for a minute larson actually has a bigger challenge the wildly uneven script does that oldfamiliar melodrama amnesia twostep vers larson whose real name is carol danvers is an alien warrior who can barf laser rainbows from her fists and cant remember beyond six years ago after a battle against the skrulls shapeshifting baddies vers gets stranded on earth in 1995 there she discovers secrets about her past while basically starring in a splendid oh no my partner is a space alien buddycop sitcom with nick fury a digitally deaged samuel l jackson the problem with who am i plots is that they strip actors of their ability to fully define a character by the end when carol is more completely herself and gleefully whooping while testing the limits of her powers you only wish you had more time with that version of her especially when she gets confronted by the extraterrestrial equivalent of a dudebro blogger on twitter yelling debate me at an elected female politician although not quite ideally how to get there captain marvel does render you desperate for more of her those quibbles aside complaints about this film falling into a stupefied sameness with other superhero movies are totally unfounded from a plotcentric cat to ben mendelsohns legitimately surprising turn whenever writersdirectors anna boden and ryan fleck get the space to make their space opera both sincere and offbeat it is triumphant as opposed to something like aquaman where the silliness is jarring and too frequently unintentional captain marvel endears itself with its quirky nonsense this was the first major blockbuster from the duo they should be brought back and they should be given more latitude to lean into the intimate and weirdo moments at which they so clearly excel complaints about this being boilerplate superhero shenanigans ignore unique traits like the single weirdest needledrop during a fight sequence in recent memory love or hate that moment it is as bold as the hero who emerges by the end there is a fresh creative heartbeat pumping at the center of captain marvel that wills it into being something special even if it could have been somewhat more so
Jun 17 2019,positive, the paradox of captain marvel is that its a diverting lark with seismic sociopolitical ramifications for hollywoods most lucrative widely viewed film franchise a movie set in 1995 and enamored by blockbuster video saltnpeppa needledrops snailspacedialupinternet jokes and paying homage to michael kamens synthpunchy die hard score is an unlikely vessel for messages of female empowerment but this is the marvel cinematic universe so you make do and make concessions  this is the mcus first film centered on a female character in its 11 years of existence which makes you think more than once its about time but to the chagrin of its potential the film settles for just being a fun installment in a bigger scheme  on one hand there is something inherently rewarding and desperately needed in watching carol danvers soar across the sky like a technicolor firecracker blasting space baddies left and right and proving that shes well much much much more adept to taking on thanos in next months avengers finale than most of her male counterparts the natural ascension of onscreen representation is going to inspire any number of young girls in the audience in a way that no marvel film quite has before the film gains much of its merit from just being what it is and being willing to represent what it represents that matters  on the other hand captain marvel struggles with building danvers as a character as it simultaneously tries to build her as a symbol part of what made 2017s wonder woman so lasting was that the hagiography melded with the nuance and relatability the image of diana storming across the battlefield was coupled with natural character progressions and gal gadots fierce regality and fishoutofwater curiosity star brie larson has only so much to work with though as the danvers character is written a bit tepidly and tied to plot her development as a memorywiped space warrior returned to her home planet feels too rigid to sink in from a personal standpoint larson has had to do this in the past with roles though and she clearly knows how to elevate danvers to be more than the page allows captain marvel makes for riveting representational cinema but it lacks the groundswell of genre flourish and gritty character detail that marks the films of her avengers counterparts the film shouldve been able to have both  its status as a 90s buddycop homage doesnt exactly do a ton we havent already seen before shane black did this to better effect in iron man 3 and part of the nostalgia here just comes from shameless reminders that this film very much takes place around 1995 its practically a shaken can of surge to the face while rem blares in your ears by the umpteenth reference  but its when captain marvel finally in its third act harnesses the goodwill of its lead actress and learns to balance its importance with its genre leanings and yearn for flannel and friends it learns to fly with much more zeal and the obvious 90s music cues just begin to feel more apt its a downright shame the film cant find this tone more consistently throughout  the good the film will accomplish will far outweighs the standards it doesnt quite meet film is a multifaceted object able to mean many things for many people captain marvel can stand alone as a step forward for a film series that was long past due making one just as it can fall short of its potential thats the beauty of going to the movies isnt it imperfection never holds a movie back from just at that right moment feeling perfect you get out of it just what you need 
Jun 13 2019,positive, the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe finds itself in a challenging and unenviable position more than twenty films in the franchchise is starting to spread its wings a bit not only does captain marvel standout as this series first vehicle for a female superhero and the first installment helmed by a female director but it also serves as the feeder for what is bound to be the biggest movie weve seen to date avengers endgame theres a lot going on here and a lot hinging on captain marvel does the superhero origin story live up to the hype captain marvel follows the title character brie larson as she enters the marvel cinematic universe discovering not only who she is but also the full extent of her powers along the way she meets up with a baby nick fury samuel l jackson shield and finds herself caught up in a vicious intergalactic war between the kree and the skrulls keeping this spoiler free so thats all youre getting anna boden and ryan fleck direct the film from a script they cowrote with geneva robertsondworet  to start captain marvel is a little slow to find its feet the first act is weighed down by the extent of everything which needs to happen while the film is loosely tied into the guardians of the galaxy universe these are new characters new worlds and new scenes to establish however the script makes an interesting decision to start in the middle of the action instead of seeing carol danvers become captain marvel audiences watch through her eyes as she learns who she is as a result the first act feels a bit muddled theres a lot of play in the realm of the psychological and this distinct stylistic choice will likely work for some but definitely not for others  in the quippy and snarky mcu captain marvel stands as a bit of an outlier the oscar winning larson brings an interesting persona to the character playing danvers very straight and almost emotionless for much of the narrative considering carols tenuous and convoluted mental state early in the film this particular stylistic choice could make sense she quite literally doesnt know who she is and shes almost a blank slate in her own mind however this does stand out in the scope of the mcu and might not play well with some audiences will this make sense as audiences learn and ultimately get a feel for carol of course at this point in her origin story its difficult to find an inroad into this complex and complicated character  now this doesnt mean that this character isnt incredibly important in the scope of the marvel cinematic universe in larsons hands carol danvers quickly becomes the biggest and most formidable badss in the franchise whether she is saving the universe or simply standing up when shes told its called a cockpit for a reason women need to see characters like this for the first time in a long time young girls are finally seeing powerful main characters who look like them we arent prettier when we smile we dont owe anyone anything even a moment as simple as carol repeatedly get to her feet after shes hitkickedfalls down is incredibly emotional with each movie where female characters are shown in a leading empowered and nonsexualized manner we take a step in the right direction ultimately while there felt to be some lack of development in captain marvel the possibility with the character feels incredibly bright as she gains traction in the mcu the performances around larson are bright and quippy allowing the movie to soon feel right at home within marvel samuel l jackson is probably one of the brightest spots for the first time in a while hes given free rein to be the comedic relief and he excels audiences see a new side to nick fury his scenes with a cat named goose are a particular joy interestingly the graphics work surrounding nick fury show the almost scary advances around deaging actors rogue one showed the technology in its infancy and a mere few years later things have improved tremendously looking at nick fury in the film its difficult to tell where samuel l jackson ends and the effects begin its not an exaggeration to say the actor looks and feels exactly how he did in jurassic park where does this technology advance from here do actors no longer need to worry about aging  also fans of ben mendelsohn rejoice in his role as talos the australian actor finally gets a fun role he can wrap his teeth around while hes usually cast as a heavy or in thankless yet challenging parts mendelsohn is an absolute joy to watch in captain marvel he has no trouble diving into what proves to be an incredibly layered and complex character and he shines in a rare opportunity to tackle some comedy please hollywood let ben mendelsohn keep doing this much has been made about captain marvels mid1990s setting and the film has a great deal of fun with its locale children of the 1990s will enjoy and appreciate so many references from a blockbuster video to a number of comedic moments involving dialup internet kids ask your parents do some of the attempts at humor or social commentary feel a bit forced a bit for example the choice to stage a full fight scene to no doubt singing im just a girl might illicit some groans these moments are few though with plenty of chuckles set up throughout once the movie finds its feet its good fun  is captain marvel for the comic purist thats a difficult call to make as the final credits roll the mcu is rapidly approaching phase 4 and things are feeling incredibly complicated where was the tesseract in 1994 when did loki get it again how did it get to asgard captain marvel suddenly makes a complete chronological rewatch feel much needed timelines are starting to feel a trifle full in setting this film in 1994 the movie comes in a weird and unexplored spot in the timeline and viewers watching with an eye for the comic specific plot points might walk away with a bit of a headache that being said stay till the end of the credits there are two cutscenes  alright is captain marvel a perfect movie no the next installment of the superhero franchise has its fair share of struggles however which of the origin stories havent the superhero scene is a crowded one and some are less memorable than others despite the problems the fact that audiences are now watching female superheroes kick butt on screen is what makes this story special theres so much to develop and heres hoping that marvel continues to craft stories outside of iron mans boys club  a film nerd from my earliest years watching abbott and costello that eventually translated to a masters degree in film history i spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms as well as covering film and television

Jun 9 2019,positive, the most useful lesson i learned when my undergrad in creative writing is show dont tell in the opening of captain marvel our eponymous superhero falls from space into a blockbuster video this shows the audience that captain marvel is set in the mid90s and they dont need to literally spell out on the screen earth  1995 you immediately know the time period as soon as you see the blockbuster as well as her picking up vhs types one specifically a homage to her character showing not telling is the best way to tell a story because you get to paint a pretty picture for the viewers whats more engaging her falling into a blockbuster video looking at vhs tapes or the movie opening with a title card of the date  show dont tell method of storytelling is just one reason of many why directors anna boden and ryan fleck the duo who made the excellent half nelson are two of my favorite filmmakers i must admit when i first watched captain marvel i wasnt a fan maybe its because i saw it at 11 pm on a thursday perhaps its because i hold anna and ryan as well as marvel movies in high regard or maybe i didnt like it shame on me for having an opinion that changed when i watched captain marvel in the comfort of my own home movies are meant first to be seen in theaters so saying i liked it better at home is a sentence i never thought i would write but here i am i have similar criticisms as i did the first time i saw it they beat you over the head that its set in the 90s with the soundtrack and constant talk of grunge  this it telling not showing but this plot device is a lot easier to digest when im comfortably lounging in my favorite green sweatpants and white shirt while watching the movie nobody around me is on their cell phone and i can enjoy it without distraction captain marvel is solid and there couldnt have been a better choice for captain marvel than brie larson  she lights up the screen  lets discuss this 4k release like infinity war and ragnarok my favorite film in the infinity stone saga captain marvels slipcover is embossed you probably think who cares well i care and so do many slipcover collectors im a slipcover collector so the embossing is a bonus the 4k transfer is superb as well as the colors when captain marvel lights up on screen i didnt care much for 4k uhd home releases until i got a 4k tv and player and saw it with my own eyes when the transfer is right no matter what movie it is you cant take your eyes off the screen captain marvel is one of these films this 4k is slackjawing  marvel picks a lot of indie directors to make their films because they trust these filmmakers can tell a good story before russo brothers directed winter soldier civil war infinity war and endgame their only credits were community episodes of other tv shows and  you me and dupree before thor ragnarok director taika waititi was known for his gutbusting indie films hunt for the wilderpeople what we do in the shadows boy and eagle vs shark his pleasantly odd sense of humor is peppered liberally throughout ragnarok and gave thor room to be a hilarious and charismatic and not so damn serious and shakesperean this is a long tangent but my point again is marvel knows a good storyteller when they see one and they saw that in anna and ryan the company already has a team that can produce arresting special effects but as weve learned from superhero movies like justice league you need a good director behind the camera to snyders credit who was forced to leave the film because a family tragedy joss whedon is to blame for the failure of justice league  also with the 4k are some digital exclusivesjourney into visual effects with victoria alonsowhat makes a memory inside the mind frackconcept artonset imagespreorder captain marvel here
Jun 4 2019,positive, the first marvel studios production of the year takes things back in time with captain marvel a 1995 origin story for one of the big screen worlds most powerful and important heroes while the story is loaded with new and expansive elements for the marvel cinematic universe some of its best moments spawn from familiar vibes while the movie like its titular hero looks to discover its true identity starting the film with tremendous powers and abilities brie larsons carol danvers is not on a quest to obtain superhero status she is already stronger than most avengers characters fans have come to know instead she is seeking information regarding her past a puzzle which remains blurry for the superheroine and the audience until later in the film in fact captain marvels narrative is built on mysteries straight from launch  possibly too many mysteries an abundant amount of questions are posed to the audience within the first few minutes of the film leaving little room for character development early on this is why the second half of the film becomes more of a fun thrill ride than its preceding hour questions get answered and character personalities are more able to shine through larsons presence on screen comes with an earnest sense of determination with little other depth to carols personality shining through it may be an intentional decision as the characters goals and growth are everpresent but attempts at oneliners indicate a desire to have made her a bit more fun an early scene including larson djimon hounsou gemma chan and jude law quickly shows that the comedic chops and timing are going to shine elsewhere as hounsou steals the first early laugh of the film whereas actors such as robert downey jr chris hemsworth scarlett johansson and gal gadot have an ability to command the screen and offer witty banter on a dime larsons attempts seem to be missing that timing spark for true magic however toss her into an earthbound scene with lashana lynch later in the movie and the rhythm gets rolling as emotion and answers being to pour out as captain marvel sees the titular heroine asking so many questions about the world and herself it will be interesting to see if more of carols personality starts to come through from larsons character as she becomes more comfortable in her own skin avengers endgame will be a true test of this given it takes place more than 20 years after carol danvers became a hero and has a russo brothers directing team who may make different choices than captain marvels anna boden and ryan fleck much of the highlights of the film are offered when captain marvel heads to earth via crashing into a blockbuster surrounded by 90sera references including a flawlessly deaged samuel l jackson as nick fury if there is any chemistry in the film worth noting its the impressive relationship established by larson and jackson as their characters become unlikely friends during a possible space invasion on their shared home planet no marvel space invasion would be this compelling without the skrulls a batch of shapeshifting menaces who make for tremendously exciting villains the notion of not being certain whether the old lady beside you on the subway or best friend hanging out in your living room is truly the person they seem makes for all sorts of brilliant unexpected moments captain marvel capitalizes on several opportunities to use skrulls in surprising ways ushering in a group of baddies which could be the infinity stoneequivalent of the marvel cinematic universes next phases possible wishful thinking but it could all be leading toward a popular secret invasion story from marvel comics if ben mendelsohns talos is any part of future marvel cinematic universe movies featuring skrulls marvel studios is all but guaranteed its next hit marvel comics fans will find extra enjoyment in the film as it fully embraces the cosmic source material in ways which marvel studios had to earn over years shapeshifting aliens characters like yonrogg or minnerva and a flerken if you dont know you will soon had to be ushered into marvels movie world after it eased into the zanier cosmic elements ahead of time in films like thor then guardians of the galaxy and then avengers infinity war the cosmic content of captain marvel is among some of the films best elements and fans with knowledge of each characters source material history and potential future will have a blast depicting where they might be going when it gets rolling captain marvel is exactly what it wants to be an inspirational story told with an abundant level of heart its a big welcome step forward by stepping backward in time in the marvel cinematic universe which feels like both a history lesson for the longrunning fan and a fresh take which a casual moviegoer can walk in to enjoy the heartfelt surprising plot twists and a lead character so determined to succeed help this movie do just that captain marvel shines brightest when it uses elements which have worked for marvel studios in the past the film is entirely unique in terms of narrative timing and locations however goose carols scenestealing cat can be compared to groot of the first guardians of the galaxy airborne fights bear resemblances to iron man in the first avengers movie and some characters are outright pulled from previous appearances to reprise roles in welcome fashion such as lee paces ronan and hounsous korath throw the captain marvel paint job on some of these aspects and they feel brand new if not more fun this time around in welcoming a female hero to the big screen as the centerpiece of her own film marvel studios has an expansive and fun hit on its hands captain marvel offers up a complex heartfelt tale which will leave audiences especially the young girls watching feeling inspired and satisfied this is a brandnew type of hero for the marvel cinematic universe and while it doesnt reinvent marvels eversuccessful formula captain marvel is an exciting and fresh adventure
May 31 2019,positive, breezy and light on gravitas captain marvel doesnt shake up the marvel cinematic universe but it does find a few new ways to perk up the umpteenth superhero origin story it falls short of the intensity that propelled black panther and wonder woman but most do set in 1995 the movie introduces us to vers brie larson a member of an elite special forces unit of the advanced alien species called the kree and mentored by yonrogg jude law a runin with their sinister shapechanging enemies the skrulls brings some of her fractured memories to the surface  those of a human fighter pilot named carol danvers her pursuit of the skrulls and her real identity leads her to earth and results in an unlikely but surprisingly effective teamup with nick fury samuel l jackson an agent of shield at this point in the mcu timeline fanfavorite agent coulson clark gregg also puts in a few appearances hes a freshfaced rookie here and the deageing cgi used on him and furyjackson does a far better job of avoiding the uncanny valley than the rubbery renditions of michael douglas and kurt russell in antman and guardians of the galaxy vol 2 respectively the original captain marvel a kree man named marvell debuted in the late 1960s and danvers went from minor supporting character to superheroine as ms marvel in the late 70s the continuity for  and iterations of  both characters have grown increasingly tangled in the decades since the mcu boils the basics down in a daring way and throws in some unexpected twists that will intrigue some fans and likely piss off others par for the course not surprisingly captain marvel quickly became the target of trolls and broflakes and apparently saw them coming theres a lot of mansplaining aimed at danvers from yonroog whos often telling her to control her emotions from air force officers who tell her shell never fly and a father who tells her she shouldnt even try to compete with the boys suffice to say larson brings the necessary tenacity and defiance the movie gets a lot of mileage out of its period setting with the exception of the soundtrack which plays it safe with some obvious goto tracks from hole no doubt and garbage on the plus side no creed larson and jackson click well as a duo and the buddyroadmovie vibe and mementoesque hook is strong enough for it to feel fresh and distinct however those aspects work against it as well this movie is a prologue meant to quickstart danvers a scant few weeks before her proper arrival in the mcu via avengers endgame theres some withholding going on and that combined with our protagonists sketchy recall means we dont get a full picture of the hero as a whole until the third act fortunately were given enough to make us keen for more
May 29 2019,positive, lets just say captain marvel which will be available to watch at home at the end of may was worth the wait its two hours of pure female empowerment packaged with all the visual power youd expect from a    marvel  blockbuster brie larson is fierce and effortlessly cool as a fighterpilotturnedspacewarrior trying to discover who she really is and it doesnt hurt that hole elastica and nirvana set the beat with some of the biggest hits of the 90s larson is carol danvers a member of the alien kree races elite military unit starforce her mentor yonrogg played by a yelloweyed jude law tries to teach her that the most dangerous things a warrior can encounter are emotions danvers doesnt always listen shes struggling to control her powers but also trying to figure out why she cant remember her past  carol and fury become a sort of odd couple with little in common besides mutual respect they share some of the funnier sharper banter in the movie and he reminds her that emotions dont just make humans human theyre often advantageous  but theres no love interest in captain marvel not even a hint of it and im more than fine with that as much as i enjoyed chris pines steve trevor in wonder woman this is an origin story minus the flirtation and seduction and its all the stronger for it danvers comes to terms with her powers learns to control them and confronts a society that tells her women cant race cars join the army or become fighter pilots that struggle is more than enough to keep her and us engaged  dont get me wrong captain marvel is far from alone as well as fury she also reunites with her longtime friend maria rambeau lashana lynch and marias daughter monica you were the most powerful woman i knew right before you could shoot fire from your fists maria tells carol during a touching conversation when our protagonist needs a bit of a confidence boost rounding out the excellent cast annette bening plays the person carol admires most even when at times she doesnt recall why its very telling that benings character isnt about fighting wars but about ending them that philosophy will influence carols values and give her reasons for becoming a fullfledged warrior and protector the diverse array of female characters puts captain marvel alongside the undeniably feminist black panther  both pass the bechdel test with high grades captain marvel is yet another title that proves you can have a big superhero film that doesnt forget to represent half of the worlds population in a nonreductionist way they avoid flashbacks that would slow the pace and clumsy exposition is almost nonexistent we learn about carol at the same gradual pace that she does  through interesting wellexecuted narrative devices like skrull leader talos ben mendelsohn invading carols memories  you learn about danvers humanity through her failings falling but standing up ready to attempt again becomes one of our heros driving forces  and a quality that reminds viewers that sometimes the most important thing in life isnt necessarily success but continuing to try then there are all those 90s references panama jacks boots and coveralls turtlenecks the fresh prince of belair alta vista blockbuster videorental stores and telephone booths pagers early and slow macs the album poster from smashing pumpkins mellon collie and the infinite sadness  it also helps that captain marvels soundtrack is underscored by nirvanas come as you are elasticas connection and no doubts just a girl obvious choices maybe but its hard not to tap your feet to the pounding rhythm of holes celebrity skin even if youve never been a grunge devotee  there are perfectly choreographed minimalistic fight sequences between two barefoot characters and there are fullblown explosiondriven space battles carol flies in space clad in her blue red and golden suit leaving a luminous trail across the sky wherever she goes you know youre glowing right fury asks carol at one point the movie also pays homage to the late stan lee who was still around to film his cameo for this movie and avengers endgame the legendary comics creator who died in november at 95 is remembered in the marvel studios opening theme sequence and a thank you stan message opens the movie not everything in captain marvel is what it appears there are a couple of twists you wont necessarily see coming and yes the feline goose steals every single scene  at one point during captain marvel carol is wearing a nine inch nails tshirt leather jacket and distressed jeans only happy when it rains by garbage plays in the background fury summarizes the whole thing perfectly grunge is a good look for you he says  feeling like watching it again at home captain marvel will be available digitally may 28 and on bluray june 11 you can already preorder the streaming version on amazon the hd version costs 1999 and has bonus content
May 26 2019,positive, first stop watching trailers immediately if youre already interested in captain marvel then just go see it watching any more trailers may spoil certain surprises and plot points for you second go in recognizing that captain marvel has a lot to do in 128 minutes introduce a brandnew and obscure titular character brie larson who has a very deep and complicated back story introduce a new race of shapeshifting alien skrulls while expanding on the kree an alien race audiences are somewhat familiar with and reunite us with wellknown franchise characters like nick fury and agent coulson digitally deaged samuel l jackson and clark gregg respectively while introducing new supporting characters toss into that meaty recipe a heaping helping of subtext on feminism and american colonialism and youve got yourself a stew be sure to sprinkle it liberally with fan service easter eggs 90s references and some jokes to go along with all the whizbang that comicbook audiences have come to expect oh and make sure it ties into the overall marvel cinematic universe mcu while setting up the next installment avengers endgame finally it has to appeal to a massive audience comprised of people from virtually any age race color and sex with many of them being highly critical fans of the source material easy peasy with that extensive list its impressive that captain marvel is as good as it is not that its perfect nor the second coming of wonder woman then again wonder woman had less to do considering most people were pretty familiar with her the wide age spread of its audience may account for much of the dialog being repetitive or overexplanatory resulting in a possibly lethal drinking game if you took a shot every time someone said captain marvelcarol danvers was too emotional i know the filmmakers didnt want the 8year olds in the audience to miss any of the feminist messages but the rest of us got it the first 7 times with marvels penchant for using jokes to undercut any real drama some of the humor or lightheartedness was unwelcome meanwhile there were genuinely touching moments supplied by a tribute to recently deceased stan lee and more so by danvers earthbound buddy maria rambeau lashana lynch who shows larson how to do it frankly because the odd ingredient in the mix is larson herself she revealed in junket interviews that she was unsure about taking on the role of captain marvel saying it was not only very different from anything shes ever done before but even a different kind of movie as well the closest she ever got to this level of blockbuster scrutiny was 2017s kong skull island again opposite jackson but her character wasnt on the marquee theres a lot more riding on her shoulders this time and it shows she doesnt have much chemistry with anyone onscreen and many of her lines fall flat since shes unable to deliver the obvious applauselines like a more seasoned jackson can some have suggested its part of her character to be awkward and feel out of place and thats possible but unwise remember we were subjected to acting powerhouse natalie portman sleepwalking as queen amidala in star wars the phantom menace because we found out it really wasnt padmé saying those lines it was a servant pretending to be her so naturally she couldnt be convincing as the queen ok fine but we were still stuck with portmans stiffasaboard performance for most of the movie or maybe larsons wooden performance was part of the feminist subtext women are chided for not smiling enough but then are told get a grip when showing emotion again fine could be but then were still stuck with an oscarwinning actress seeming uneasy in her own movie larsons performance may be the biggest issue i have with captain marvel but its not the only one the script is clunky and spends time on chase scenes when we could be exploring danvers past big name actors with bigleague roles like annette bening or lee pace get short shrifted its first act is somewhat choppy and its second tends to lag but captain marvel gets on track just in time to end well and sometimes a movie is its ending the subtexts may be its strongest suit sure it has all the entertainment value and cool soundtrack cues youve come to expect from a marvel movie but to personify in jude laws character yonrogg how men have subjugated women by physically holding them back because they feel threatened by their power and how men further gaslight women into thinking that whatever power they have has been given to them and can be taken away at any time if they step out of line and to further demand that danvers deal with him on his own terms and not by using her own individual abilities such gaslighting takes on skyhigh scifi heights when the kree alter danvers own memories so she recollects only the times she failed and not the times she gotten back up after she had fallen add to that its messages on americas current stance on immigration with the kree thinking theyre the good guys as they separate and scatter skrull families around the galaxy in their quest to enforce their borders meanwhile the immigrant skrulls are painted as bad guys  infiltrating our earthly society and literally taking our places  but theyre just looking for a home a haven away from kree injustice those are bold and potent messages for a popcorn comicbook movie and i applaud them and captain marvel warts and all
May 18 2019,positive,one cant quite help but feel that something this groundbreaking should have felt a bit more fresh and adventurous than it ultimately does
May 15 2019,positive,larsons femininity feels fresh and uncompromising and her presence is intriguingly both grounded and otherworldly
May 8 2019,positive,overall any minor missteps in captain america arent enough to detract from the fact that carol danvers is an enthusiastically essential addition to the mcu
May 4 2019,positive,captain marvel gives everything a fan girl or boy could want  spectacle action heart and inspiration
May 1 2019,positive, the type of superheroine that cinema currently needs and fragile fanboys dont deserve captain marvel is the latest offering in the marvel canon its 21st for those counting  the first in the roster to focus squarely on a woman its been particularly disheartening to see brie larsons entrance into the heroic realm be tainted by comic book readers dripping in toxic masculinity  of course these are the same people who dont bat an eyelid at a bradley coopervoiced space racoon or throwing it to the dc bench briefly a polynesian who can talk to fish but give a vocal feminist like larson a platform and they react as if theyve been castrated nonsense aside captain marvel wastes nexttonotime in introducing us to the titular hero when shes known as vers larson a blueblooded noble warrior hero as she later selfdescribes who lives among the alien race known as kree a technologically advanced military unit inhabiting the planet hala while on a mission with her mentor yonrogg jude law upping the smarm vers is kidnapped by talos ben mendelsohn indeed marvels most exciting antagonist since tom hiddlestons loki leader of the supposedly villainous krulls shapeshifters for the uninitiated and managing to escape their clutches after an extended probe into her memories ones that she has no personal recollection of she crashlands her way onto earth circa 1995 via a blockbuster video outlet admittedly up to this point captain marvel has been somewhat of a clunky nearconfusing slightly fractured affair with cowritingcodirecting team anna boden and ryan fleck the duo behind such indie darlings as half nelson and mississippi grind focusing heavily on flashbacks pertaining to verss life prekree that doesnt always feel as neatly executed as both the story and the audience deserve  theres not much to fear though as once vers is paired up with shield agent nick fury samuel l jackson preeyepatch and looking remarkably youthful thanks to some stellar deageing cgi the film embraces a buddycop temperament between the two with enough mileage earned out of the 90s setting with the soundtrack offering up its share of choice era cuts tlcs waterfalls and nirvanas come as you are to name a few and the dialup internet phase inescapable from a gag or two whilst the film delights in a few neat perhaps notso shocking story twists and certain beats being put in place in a bid to tie it in to the avengers films weve come to know and love captain marvels real journey is that of its subjects own exploration towards selfdiscovery  learning on earth she was fighterpilot carol danvers a woman constantly standing up in an environment where she was putdown by men the films third act reveals its heart when vers is reunited with maria rambeau lashana lynch a fellow pilot who manages to imbue carol with strength beyond the radiant energy blasts she effortlessly conjures out of her fingertips though its easy for captain marvel to be accused of not being as aesthetically accomplished as black panther or for even attempting an origin story beyond the expected its still difficult to fight against its proempowerment mentality  additionally taking its cue from the more humourdriven guardians of the galaxy infuses the film with a scifi goofiness that is perfectly balanced against its throwback timeframe  and then of course theres the unlikeliest of scenestealers in the form of goose an orange cat who steals furys attention and surprisingly inks itself to one of the series most valuable ingredients an 11year span was perhaps a bit too long to wait before marvel served up a femaleled offering but captain marvel as both a feature and a character within larsons capable abilities is worth the wait  especially given that we know shes a major asset in the next avengers film endgame and if this story is anything to go by as well as the obligatory postcredit sequence she may be the saviour the mcu needs set in the 1990s marvel studios captain marvel is an allnew adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the marvel cinematic universe that follows the journey of carol danvers as she becomes one of the universes most powerful heroes while a galactic war between two alien races reaches earth danvers finds herself and a small cadre of allies at the centre of the maelstrom it was a racist white savior film  anybody who reads the comics knows who the real first female captain marvel was and that is monica rambeau  marvel disrespected monicas character by making her a bratty kids kid who had to be imparted wisdom from carol lilly white  this film was so bad and the films lead was so miscast that they had to crap all over the source material just to help sell this character  nick fury would never just hold a cat for a whole movie and let someone else do all the work  ronan the accuser would not just cut and run because he was up against a strong foe  they had to miswrite these characters just to sell the idea that the lead was strong  it was all smoke and mirrors  the continuity issues were also a big problem but i leave it here  this film isnt really about feminism or empowerment  its about a way too large corporation trying to act like they care about social issues in order to make money  if they really did care the would have written this film for the deserving captain marvel monica rambeau

Apr 20 2019,positive,captain marvel is the perfect mix of humor and action brie larson brilliantly brought carol danvers to life in this film a must see movie
Apr 17 2019,positive, it took nearly a decade but marvel studios has finally produced a film headlined by a female superhero with captain marvel it has been a long depressing road littered with many failures 1984s supergirl 2004s catwoman 2005s elektra that unfortunately gave rise to the perception that femaleled superhero movies were inherently bound for disaster of course anyone who has actually seen any of those movies will recognize that they failed not because of the gender of the protagonist but because there were lousy movies while there has been no dearth of female action heroes in the various marvel franchises from avengers to guardians of the galaxy to xmen there has not yet been a female hero standing front and center and although captain marvel has been in some form of development since 2013 it is hard not to imagine that its production wasnt accelerated to some degree in response to the critical and commercial success of dcs wonder woman 2017 a true gamechanger that remains a superior film in virtually every way this is not to say that captain marvel is not solid entertainment but it lacks some of the moral and thematic clarity and visual elegance that made patty jenkinss film such a standoutnot just as a femalecentered superhero film but as a superhero film period based on the marvel comic book character that was originally introduced in 1967 and has been through more than half a dozen mutations and reinventions over the ensuring years captain marvel features recent oscar winner brie larson room as the eponymous supercharged hero who we first meet on the distant planet hala training with her mentor yonrogg jude law at this point known as vers larsons character is an outsider living among the kree a humanoid alien race that is at war with the skrulls a shapeshifting lizardlike alien race vers has been with the kree for six years and she has no memory of anything prior to that a brief evocative opening sequence gives us some hints of a violent event that changed the course of her life but it will take much of the film to reveal the details of her human origins it is on earth where most of the action takes place as vers finds herself back on her home planet where she teams up with young shield agent nick fury a digitally deaged samuel l jacksonthe story is set in 1995to fight against the skrulls led by talos ben mendelsohn along the way vers discovers her true past as a human named carol danvers which then leads to her fully embracing her extraordinary powers which begin with glowing photonblasting fists that can punch holes in pretty much anything and eventually lead to galaxycrossing powers of flight lashana lynch plays an old friend of carols who helps fill in her back story while annette bening shows up in both flashbacks as a mentor to carol and in the present as the embodiment of the supreme intelligence the ai system that leads the kree directors anna boden and ryan fleck who also cowrote the script with geneva robertsondworet tomb raider from a story partially conceived by nicole perlman guardians of the galaxy and meg lefauve inside out manage the interpersonal drama much better than they do the big action sequences which should come as little surprise since their background is in dramas like half nelson 2006 sugar 2008 and mississippi grind 2015 and television series like the affair 20142015 and billions 20162017 they cannily embed some hereandnow political issues particularly with one group of characters that are labeled terrorists but see themselves as displaced refugees there is a consistent subtext about the nature of identity and how others seek to define us which will resonate particularly with women and minorities who are particularly susceptible to others selfserving definitions and labels the big action sequences are generically hectic although there is a nicely sustained bit in an enormous government records facility in which the characters attempts to remain unnoticed is undone by the automatic lights in each row that crank on with a loud bang boden and fleck are effective in conveying the enormity of captain marvels eventual powers which are supermanlike in their breadth and depth and the movie retains interest largely because she is constantly learning what she can do the narrative is a journey of selfdiscovery not just about carols past but also about what her future holds  the mid90s setting doesnt hurt as it creates space for jokes about slowloading cdrom drives and allows for the inclusion of all manner of clintonera rock and pop music i have to admit that i admire any superhero movie in which the hero spends at least half of her screen time wearing a faded nine inch nails tshirt the fact that carol is a woman gives the film an edge that it uses wisely for the most part there are some cathartic moments in which she is allowed to directly kick the patriarchy where it hurts particularly when she slams her former mentor and assures him that she doesnt have to prove a thing to him an assertion that will ring joyously in the ears of so many girls who have been told that they have to earn what is usually handed to boys sometimes the filmmakers lay it on a bit too thick as when a climactic action sequence is scored to no doubts i am just a girl but you cant fault the films ambitions and enough of it worksparticularly
