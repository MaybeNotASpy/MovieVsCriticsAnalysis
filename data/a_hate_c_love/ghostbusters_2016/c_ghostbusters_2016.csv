Aug 7 2023,positive,see this film for ghostbuster laughs and a new era of ghostbusters
Dec 21 2022,positive, the two movies on the top of my list were genderbending and genrebreaking movies released early in the year with a brilliant ensemble cast outstanding writing and directing by jocelyn moorhouse a crossdressing police sergeant and couture to die for the dressmaker was a delightful feminist take on the spaghetti western and a timely antidote to 2015s hateful the hateful eight a bigger splash written by gay filmmaker luca guadagnino starred ralph fiennes and matthias schoenaerts as exlovers fighting over rock star tilda swinton other contenders included three films from the yearend oscar race isabelle hupperts mesmerizing performance in paul verhoevens provocative elle natalie portmans stunning work in jackie and amy adams transcendent portrayal of a linguist who saves the world in arrival the best lgbt movie of the year was the outstanding being 17 by the french auteur andré téchiné without a wasted word or shot the film is a master work that offers a complex portrait of two teens and their families as the boys deal with both coming out and coming of age a close runnerup is the powerful moonlight written and directed by barry jenkins and based on a play by tarrel alvin mccraney while the pacing occasionally stumbles and the female characters are rather stereotypical the film is a stunning portrayal of a young black man at three stages of his life and features sizzling performances by an amazing ensemble cast and lush cinematography by james laxton other lgbt titles of note were the handmaiden based on a novel by sarah waters but transported to 1930s korea by director chanwook park little men by ira sachs and florence foster jenkins which found not only the obvious comedy but an unexpected tenderness in the tale of a tonedeaf diva meryl streep her supportive husband hugh grant and her gay accompanist simon helberg despite its terrible title which does get explained during the film the best documentary of the year was norman lear just another version of you directors heidi ewing and rachel grady use some innovative techniques to create a multifaceted portrait of a man whose groundbreaking television series challenged americas ideas about gender race class and sexuality the best lgbt documentary of 2016 was hbos richly layered mapplethorpe look at the pictures an intricate examination of the provocative artist and his enduring legacy the best foreign film of 2016 was pedro almodóvars heartfelt julieta working with three short stories by canadian author alice munro the openly gay spanish auteur moves from the worlds of camp and melodrama to a sharplydetailed gritty tale of grief and loss the best animated movies of 2016 were finding dory starring ellen degeneres as a delightful blue tang with memory issues and moana about a polynesian girl who saves her island while singing some great songs by linmanuel miranda hamilton mark mancina and opetaia foai the oddest cinematic trend of the year was playing with the gender and sexuality of characters in established franchises in an attempt to bring fresh blood to stale stories in one case it worked despite some horrible internet trolling by the likes of milo yiannopoulus the allfemale remake of ghostbusters offered a fresh and fun spin on the classic testosteronefueled comedy and featured chris hemsworth as a dimwitted himbo delightful cameos by cast members from the original movie and a wonderful breakout performance by lesbian comic kate mckinnon on the flip side of the trend three flailing franchises suddenly discovered that already established characters were gay revelations that did little to generate box office or critical notice neighbors 2 sorority rising outed frat boy dave franco independence day resurgence revealed that brakish okun brent spiner was still alive and was in a longterm relationship with partner milton isaacs john storey to the dismay of george takei a brief scene in star trek beyond reveals that the rebooted sulu john cho has a partner and child the 2016 hall of shame includes two movies that tried to erase lgbt lives the leaden will smith fantasy collateral beauty went to great lengths to depict a diverse manhattan except for the fact that no openly lgbt people are visible anywhere in the film the turgid courtroom drama denial focused on the legal battle between a renowned historian and a holocaust denier but failed to mention the lgbt victims of nazi hatred dcs expanding film culture is supported by a variety of fine presenters across the region including the four landmark theatres the two angelika theaters and the avalon theatre dcs vibrant film festival scene has become increasingly diverse with great lgbt offerings this year at the dc independent film festival the maryland film

silver spring regularly includes outstanding lgbt programming in its amazing blend of contemporary independent films stunning showcases weaving together classic films from hollywood and world cinemas and fascinating showcases of the latest international films to round out the list of the years best movies here are some other great movies to catch on dvd or vod eye in the sky maggies plan love and friendship and the lobster and some great performances to enjoy in theaters loving manchester by the sea and la la land it might come as a shock to some comic book fans but the idea of super heroes and super villains has always been very queer think about it the dramatic skintight costumes the dual identities and secret lives the inability to fit in or connect because you are distanced from the normal world by your powers   all the standard tropes that define this genre of pop culture mythmaking are so rich with obviously queercoded subtext that it seems ludicrous to think anyone could miss it this is not to claim that all superhero stories are really parables about being queer but if were being honest some of them feel more like it than others an obvious example is batman whose domestic life with a teenage boy as his ward and close companion has been raising eyebrows since 1940 the campy 1960s tv series did nothing to distance the character from such associations  probably the opposite in fact  and warner brothers popular 80s90s series of film adaptations with gay filmmaker joel schumachers muchmaligned batman and robin starring george clooney and chris odonnell in costumes that highlighted their nipples which is arguably still the queerest superhero movie ever made or at least it was that title might now have to be transferred to the peoples joker which  as it emphatically and repeatedly reminds us  is a parody in no way affiliated with dcs iconic batman franchise or any of its characters even though writer director and star vera drew begins it with a dedication to mom and joel schumacher parody it may be but that doesnt keep it from also serving up lots of food for serious thought to chew on between the laughs set in a sort of comicsinspired dystopian metaamerica where unsanctioned comedy is illegal its the story of a young closeted transgender comic drew who leaves her small town home to travel to gotham city and audition for gcb  the official governmentproduced sketch comedy show unfortunately shes not a very good comic and after a rocky start she decides to leave to form a new comedy troupe labeled anticomedy to skirt legality issues along with penguinish new friend oswald cobblepot nathan faustyn they collect an assortment of misfit wouldbe comedians to join them and after branding herself as joker the harlequin our protagonist starts to find her groove  but it will take negotiating a relationship with trans bad boy mr j kane distler a confrontation with her selfabsorbed and transphobic mother lynn downey and making a choice between playing by the rules or breaking them before she can fully transition into the militant comic activist she was always meant to be told as a wildly whimsical mixed media narrative that combines live action with a quirky cgi production design and  multiple styles of animation with different animators for each sequence peoples joker is by no means the kind of bigbudget blockbuster we expect from a superhero  or in this case supervillain  film but it should be obvious from the synopsis above thats not what drew was going for anyway instead the emmynominated former editor uses her loopy vision of an alternative batman universe as the medium for a kind of mythologized autobiography expressing her own reallife journey both toward embracing her trans identity and forging a maverick career path in an industry discourages nonconformity while also spoofing the absurdities of modern culture subverting familiar tropes yet skillfully weaving together multiple threads from the real dc universe shes appropriated with the detailed savvy of a diehard fangirl its an accomplishment likely to impress her fellow comic book fans  even if they cant quite get behind the gender politics or her presentation ot batman himself or rather an animated version voiced by phil braun as a closeted gay rightwing demagogue and serial sexual abuser these elements of course are meant to be deliberately provocative drew like her screen alter ego is a confrontation comedian at heart bent on shaking up the dominant paradigm at every opportunity yet although she takes aim at the expected targets  the patriarchy toxic masculinity corporate hypocrisy etc  she is equally adept at scoring hits against things like draconian ideals of political correctness and weaponized cancel culture which are deployed with no quarter from idealogues on both sides of the political divide this means she might be risking the alienation of an audience which might otherwise be fully in her corner  but it also provides the ring of unbiased personal truth that keeps the movie from sliding into propaganda and elevates it like barbie to the level of absurdist allegory because ultimately of course the point of peoples joker has little to do with the politics and social constructs it skewers along the way at its core its all about the real human things that resonate with all of us regardless of gender sexuality ideology or even political parties the need to feel loved to feel supported and most of all to be fully actualized that means the real heart of the film beats in the central thread of her troubled connection between mother and daughter superbly rendered in both drew and downeys performances and its there that joker is finally able to break free of her own selfimposed restrictions and simply be who she is other performances deserve mention too such as faustyns weirdly lovable penguin standin and outsider multihyphenate david leibe hart as ras al ghul  a seminal batman villain here reimagined as a veteran comic that serves as a kind of obiwan kenobi figure in jokers quest in the end though its drews show from top to bottom a showcase for not only her acting skills which are enhanced by the obvious intelligence including the emotional kind she brings to the table but her considerable talents as a writer director and editor for some viewers admittedly the lowbudget vibe of this crowdfunded film might create an obstacle to appreciating the cleverness and artistic vision behind it though drew leans into the limitations to find remarkably creative ways to convey what she wants with the means she has at her disposal others obviously will have bigger problems with it than that indeed the film which debuted at the 2022 toronto international film festival was withdrawn from competition there and pulled from additional festival screenings after alleged corporate bullying presumably from warner brothers which owns the film rights to the batman franchise pressured drew into pulling it back clearly concern over blowback from conservative fans  who would likely never see the film anyway  was enough to warrant strong arm techniques from nervous execs nevertheless the peoples joker made its first american appearance at las outfest in 2023 and is now receiving a rollout theatrical release that started on april 5 in new york and continues this week in los angeles with washington dc and other cities to follow on april 12 and beyond if youre in one of the places where it plays we say its more than worth making the effort if youre not never fear a vodstreaming release is sure to come soon  theres something about an antihero that appeals to us all why else would so many of our greatest stories revolve around a character whose behavior goes against everything weve been raised to believe is right actually that question probably answers itself for many of us the things we are raised to accept about life in the human world often feel less acceptable once weve gone through a few years of adult experience which tends to put us at odds with the socalled norms of conformity naturally this can be frustrating from time to time  and while that might not be enough to make us go rogue without regard law or ethics its certainly sufficient to fuel our guilty fantasies that along with the literary skills of patricia highsmith the queer novelist who created him is why the character of tom ripley has been engrossing us in various forms for nearly 75 years the eponymous antihero of the talented mr ripley originally published in 1955 went on to feature in three additional books by highsmith and was subsequently brought to life in multiple smallandbigscreen incarnations perhaps most prominently by matt damon in anthony minghellas 1999 film adaptation these versions managed to skirt the books obvious queer subtext but queer audiences recognized it anyway now thanks to creator writer and director steve zaillian highsmiths starryeyed sociopath has returned in an eightepisode series  which pares the title down to the shortbutevocative ripley  that debuts on netflix april 4 and portrays his adventures with an eye toward honoring highsmiths intent while delivering the kind of upfront queerness that the author could never have dreamed of accomplishing in her heyday not that this ripley is exactly out and proud though the actor who plays him  andrew scott all of us strangers  certainly is the acclaimed irish thespian brings his own queerness to the table in illuminating a character whose survival depends on never calling attention to himself  and though the series moves the action ahead a few years to1960 its still a world where any hint of deviance is likely to draw suspicion thats the last thing tom ripley needs hes a con artist the mid20thcentury equivalent of modernday phishing scammers grifting gullible marks from his squalid oneroom new york city apartment hes good at what he does an anonymous figure hiding in a sea of strangers  but when a wealthy shipping magnate tracks him down with a request for help and the offer of an allexpensespaid excursion to italy he sees it as an opportunity to change his life for the better that opportunity as it turns out involves a barely remembered college acquaintance named dickie johnny flynn whose postgraduation trip to europe has become a yearslong vacation on the mediterranean coast from which his father  ripleys surprise benefactor  would like him to return sent on a mission to convince his old schoolmate to go home he is instead spellbound by the idyllic seaside setting and opulent lifestyle that surrounds him  and also by dickie himself he ingratiates himself into the young mans life winning his sympathies despite some initial awkwardness not so easily persuaded is dickies girlfriend marge dakota fanning whose lingering distrust must be overcome if ripley is to enact his new master plan to claim dickies life of expatriate luxury as his own thanks to its sources relative familiarity ripley makes no effort to hide the fact that its antihero is a shady guy we see from the start that hes a liar and an opportunist what zaillian manages to do unlike others who have adapted the novel is move past a clinical focus on ripleys psychology to give us a less prosaic  and therefore more complex  interpretation of the character much of this comes from a script that echoes highsmiths hardboiled style by framing the story and its protagonist in a shadowy amoral universe enhanced by the stylish blackandwhite treatment delivered by robert elswits cinematography which leans into both the paradigmchallenging euro art cinema from the period of its setting and the gritty chiaroscuro contrasts of film noir setting up an instinctual understanding that this narrative like its visuals is composed entirely in shades of gray in the shows engrossing first episode this is a particularly effective hook style coupling with context to underscore the bleakness of ripleys daily routine in new york which is no less soulcrushing perhaps than the more lawful ones into which most of us are locked though we see that hes a predator its hard not to relate to his struggle and by the time we get to the next chapter and meet dickie and marge weve already entered a mindset in which easy ethical judgments become unconvincing and shallow our sympathies are effectively split were either on nobodys side or on everyones and maybe its a little bit of both needless to say perhaps this tricky transference would not be possible without the presence of a consummate actor in the title role and scott fits the bill beyond expectation though at first he reads as a bit old for the character that notion quickly disperses  indeed his weathered features bespeak the effects of a hardknock life the kind that makes a person willing to do anything to break free more crucially the unmistakable authenticity of his inner life is communicated with exquisite precision engaging our empathy even as we recoil from the machiavellian logic that guides him and the clear conflict between his notsohidden feelings for dickie and the agenda to which he has committed is made all the more stark by the ring of queer truth that underpins the performance its a tourdeforce turn by an actor whose skills become more breathtaking with each subsequent role fanning whose equally adept performance provides a powerful counterpoint to scotts is a strong contender for our sympathies by virtue as much of the intelligence she brings as the peril into which it will eventually put her and flynns dickie wears the weight and damage of his upper class status like a chain he can never quite break making us dread the seemingly inevitable fate that awaits him even as we subliminally sign on to ripleys endgame with a sense of guilty but unapologetic satisfaction also notable is nonbinary actor eliot summers child of former police frontman sting who brings another level of queer identity into the narrative as another old acquaintance of dickies that throws an unwelcome wrench into the works of ripleys plan based on its first two episodes ripley certainly lives up to the anticipation that naturally awaits any adaptation of a highprofile story and reasserts the queerness of an author who boldly pushed boundaries as far as censors of her time would allow thats more than enough to warrant staying with it until the end  and if audience numbers warrant a renewal through additional installments that might chronicle the less wellknown escapades spun in highsmiths sequels what cinches the deal though is the masterful performance that takes centerstage which represents yet another escalation  and welldeserved triumph  in the rise of the talented mr scott not only that but a surprising number of these movies  more accurately described as neonoir to distinguish them from the formative blackandwhite classics in this murkiest of all genres  are also very queer weve seen ethan coens tarantinoesque darkly comic lesbian road trip driveaway dolls and the uk drag queen revenge drama femme now from sophomore director rose glass saint maud comes love lies bleeding which might be queerest of the bunch so far it might be the noirest too though there are a lot of vagaries around the characteristics that are required for applying that label one of the most essential qualities is surely a morally ambiguous story and morality cant get much more ambiguous than it is in this retronostalgic throwback tale set on the fringes of the albuquerque underworld of 1989 thats where lou kristen stewart has been for her entire life and where she continues to stay  working as the manager of a rundown gym  out of protective loyalty to her sister beth jena malone despite a longtime estrangement from her father ed harris and a desire to distance herself from the shadowy family business that he runs  reclusive and guarded she mostly avoids social interaction  until an aspiring bodybuilder named jackie katy obrian hitchhikes into town on her way to a championship competition in las vegas and in need of a place to crash theres an instant spark between them which quickly leads to flaming passion unfortunately it also leads to an incident of explosive violence which puts both of them not only into the crosshairs of lous ruthless and powerful dad but those of the law as well theres no need to say more than that in terms of synopsis in fact it would be unfair to the film which unfolds with an exquisitely slow burn before igniting into a climactic powder keg as satisfying as it is gripping because so much of the thrill comes from the feeling of uneasy expectation it delivers through its gradual revelation of details even without knowing more however its clear that theres a lot going on in love lies bleeding that doesnt quite line up with the comforting ethics of a blackandwhite worldview  and that of course is what gives it the kind of unpredictable edge that makes it both a tautly engrossing thriller and a deliciously subversive saga of queer and feminine empowerment this latter quality is something it shares with movies like bound  the 1996 debut feature by the wachowskis which pushed mainstream acceptance by presenting its lesbian protagonists in a realistic manner and refusing to frame them in the thenusual trope of queer victimhood  and elevates to a refreshingly contemporary tone while still reveling in homage to the stylistic flourishes of their era  indeed glass peppers her film with echoes from dozens from the past that so clearly provided inspiration in both its visuals and its themes from the twisted duplicity of clouzots les diaboliques to the chaotic irony of the coens blood simple from the slickbutgritty nihilism of william friedkin to the disquieting body horror of david cronenberg and the transcendental surrealism of david lynch love lies bleeding borrows liberally and unapologetically from an array of cinematic touchstones almost as exhaustive as the one employed by greta gerwig in barbie  and like gerwig manages to incorporate them all in a sort of metasphere that allows our recognition of them to enhance and inform her own piece far from coming off as derivative the effect is something akin to a mashup of iconic eighties and nineties films and genres that uses their easy familiarity to both pay open tribute and tickle our nostalgic fancy even as they are deployed as the building blocks for something with a singular identity of its own if you think that all sounds a little campy youre not wrong theres a definite element of tongueincheek self awareness that permeates it and a deliberate will toward underscoring the grimness of its outward scenario with the sly satire of its subtext that after all is something else it shares in common with many of the older films it draws upon in which coded characters and plotlines often served as subtle lampoons of the absurdly conventional messaging being conveyed on the surface camp is one of the oldest weapons in the queer artists arsenal and glass wields it like a pro yet while she might use it to undermine cliches and upend expectations the director never lets it distract  for long at any rate  from the deadly stakes of her story with a tight terse screenplay penned by glass alongside weronika tofilska that patiently sets up the dominoes for us until were quivering in anticipation of their fall bleeding takes time to relish in the details  the quirks of its characters the unspoken dynamics between them the secrets they keep and the moments they choose to reveal them  while making sure every one of them serves to wind the tension tighter the effort pays off in a series of escalating climaxes that we know are coming yet still manage to surprise shock and ultimately thrill us gorgeous cinematography from ben fordesman helps as does a periodperfect tangerine dreamesque score by clint mansell but in such a characterdriven film as this one its always the actors who are most crucial to selling the directors vision in this case stewart and obrian are the linchpins delivering a pair of deeply realized performances and a sultryyetsweet chemistry that wins us over almost before it does their characters both shine with stewarts growth as an actor continuing to stretch her beyond her twilight years and obrians earthy femininity bringing a welcome  and provocative  layer of gender ambiguity to the mix backing them up are fine supporting turns from malone and anna baryshnikov whose hypnotically oddball performance as a clingy admirer who complicates lous newfound romance is a highlight  as is dave francos simultaneously hilarious and repellant performance in a role its best we let you discover for yourself finally though its veteran screen baddie harris who dominates filling us with the kind of irrepressible dread that the most memorable movie villains always inspire  all while sporting a set of overthetop hair extensions that immediately and intentionally wed like to think call to mind richard obriens riffraff in the rocky horror picture show because of its skillful blend of such campy bold strokes and a genuine spirit of righteous rebellion that makes even its most broadly ridiculous moments cut with both sides of their satirical blade we find bleeding to be a new addition to an evergrowing canon of essential queer movies  with the disclaimer that some of its weirder moments might leave some viewers a bit perplexed and those with a low tolerance to gratuitous violence and uninhibited sex scenes will likely want to skip it
Aug 21 2022,negative, it still surprises me to see 1984s ghostbusters venerated by so many dont get me wrong i think its a fun movie with good characters lots of big effects and some really funny moments but going back to my first viewing i never considered it to be the great film that others do perhaps thats why i wasnt up in arms when i heard the announcement of a remake featuring an allfemale team it also may be why i wasnt excited for the remake well the crummy trailers didnt help either sadly the trailers and the movie have a lot in common now before im accused of mean closedminded misogyny remember im no ghostbusters fanboy or apologist there are certainly those who have instantly dismissed the movie due to its female leads but there are also those who have lashed out at any criticisms of the film regardless of their validity the truth is the movie just isnt that good not because women were cast not because of sexism paul feig cowrites and directs what turns out to be runofthemill popcorn movie fare pieces were in place for what could have been something fun and original instead it follows a fairly traditional summer blockbuster blueprint  1origin story 2buildup 3loud unwieldy cgiheavy finale there are moments where this new ghostbusters shows promise the first 30 minutes or so does a pretty good job of setting up the characters and showing how they come together to the credit of the ladies they do their best with what they are given some better than others there is also a really fun performance by chris hemsworth in a funny bit of satirical gender swapping hemsworth plays an airheaded but good looking secretary the film has a lot of fun with that as for the new ghostbusters kristen wiig is particularly good and her quirky selfeffacing humor is a perfect fit for her character melissa mccarthy is surprisingly dialedback and i enjoyed the calmer variation of her usual tiresome schtick kate mckinnon has some really funny moments but she is also letdown by the script on several occasions leslie jones is dealt the worst hand from the writers her character is paperthin and given some of the worst lines in the entire movie but again the ladies give it their all heres the thing you can have the most committed cast but that means nothing without a good script feig and cowriter katie dippold do a good job of developing the teams camaraderie but not much past that for every mildly amusing joke there are five that fall flat and some that are simply cringeworthy storywise there really isnt much to it once you get past the origin stuff the ghostbusters form everyones skeptical ghosts attack ghostbusters save the day basically everything outlined in the trailer andy garcia shows up now and then as the new york city mayor and there is an uninteresting villain neil casey tossed in to no effect they offer little to the story which noticeably starts losing steam about halfway through and culminates in a long effectsheavy ending which looks good but thats about it so what to make of ghostbusters while it may have been the most unfairly maligned film of the year prior to its release it may also end up being the most overhyped movie of the year some people wanted the film to fail and never gave it a chance from the start others want it to succeed so bad that they are impervious to the films obvious flaws but that stuff aside it really is a shame instead of doing something memorable with the great chemistry we see from the cast ghostbusters settles for being another in a long line of mediocre 80s movie remakes this could have been something special but instead its just another forgettable modern comedy that happens to carry the title ghostbusters i wanted to love it but left feeling severely underwhelmed exactly with four talented leads it was hard for this to go wrong i think sony should consider hiring a new director and screenwriter for the potential sequel i was initially not going to see the film for a number of reasons  1 the marketing was a complete disaster in every single way 2 the filmmakers response to people hating the trailers was absolutely atrocious 3 the theme song by fallout boy and missy elliot  that being said i did go and see this one as well and i was fairly entertained  the four leads mostly did a good job and chris hemsworth was funny  however the entire movie basically portrayed men as total idiots  every single one  the constant references to the original movie bugged the hell out of me and the cameo was were awful especially bill murrays  a lot of the jokes landed fairly well while others didnt  but i do have to say kate mckinnon stole the show for me  she was so much fun to watch  the ghostbusting sequences are actually quite good even thrilling at times  some of the visuals were a little sketchy but mostly okay  the villain though was a complete screwjob and the ending to the filmoh dear  with all that said it was not the train wreck that many were expecting  is it a good movie  not really  especially not compared to the original film of which i am a huge fan great point about the cameos im glad you mentioned it that was something that i thought was poorly handled they basically seemed wedged in they also didnt help the film develop its own identity and we definitely agree on the villain absolutely horrible lots of wasted potential though right i gave the movie a 710 so there was a great deal that i liked and im curious where they go next but this not the best way to reboot a franchise like ghostbusters i may be wrong but it looks like the film may fall short of 50 million for its opening weekend that could be a really big problem going forward yep except you need a lot more love for the original  that first movie was very dependant on the guys to riff off the script especially  murray  here it just falls flat over and over i like wiigs character but she does not work as the linchpin needed to make the crazy stuff hang together minus points for the horrible fall out boy version of the theme the first movie had good characters but did indeed center itself around murray this one has no character that can carry this one and amen to the crappy version of the theme song give me ray parker jr any day i be glad when you start talking about good new movies again this movie is about thirty year old and outdated next thing you tellin me they re made it with a bunch of women in it i aint got time to watch all this remake stuff ill wait when that star trek come out next week and watch something new thats what i was hoping for sadly i just didnt come away that impressed i did like the four ladies and their efforts but i felt the writing really let them down some more than others i will say that i liked some of it hemsworth and the ways the ladies worked off him were fun also in not a melissa mccarthy fan but i did like her quite a bit in this one  havent seen ghostbusters since i was a kid  like it then didnt love it should probably do a ghostbusters run sometime with all of it and then see how it goes been really indifferent about this to be honest indifferent rightly so it certainly hasnt presented itself well leading up to its release the trailers were utter garbage it wouldnt go as far to call the movie that but it has a ton of problems it sure has people talking though as for ghostbusterssigh it doesnt absolutely nothing beyond its unique casting to set itself apart from other bland summer popcorn movies were you a fan of the original  and thats a shame those people who criticize the film to those degrees without even seeing it have no credibility in my book i was hesitant after the trailers but i couldnt make any honest assessment without taking time to see it unfortunately it didnt fully work for me  it still surprises me to see 1984s ghostbusters venerated by so many this is exactly how i feel enjoyed it enough at the time and it was the first time as a kid that id seen murray in anything but im certainly not up in arms about a remake either id say that its one of the better ivan reitman films that ive seen  which isnt hard considering how his career panned out afterwards  but i dont know if itd even get into my top 10 murray films anywayhavent actually seen this yet but i might go tomorrow or wednesday sorry to hear it was a disappointmentim hoping itll go the other way for me but not counting on it by any means oh man for all of the hype both senseless bashing and lofty exaltation this thing is nothing more than your standard mediocre popcorn movie dont get me wrong i like some popcorn flicks but for all of the hype saying this film was going to be a fresh and original experience it literally checks so many boxes hopefully you will come away with more i certainly wish i did ive seen such a range of reviews i dont quite know what will happen theres nothing else out here this week in the multiplexes so its either ghostbusters or now you see me 2 for me the reviews and chatter surrounding ghostbusters is mindboggling such a crazy range of reactions i dont know which surprises me most the rabid hatred for the thing before it even came out or the immense love for a film that i feel would normally get treated pretty rough critically it was weird to see those extreme views a few months ago the internet is a horrible place sometimes i guess some people do genuinely like the film and find it funny but i keep reading the line that people are pushing back against the misogyny and overpraising it stillitll all be forgotten about by the end of july i caught bit and pieces of the original ghostbusters on tv but it wasnt until the 30th anniversary did i watch the entire film in theaters really liked bill murray in it the reboot never got me excited unfortunately and i dont plan on seeing it soon it truly is a showcase for bill murray he was really good unfortunately there isnt much that could be called really good in the remake pretty generic often unfunny and not at all memorable you wont miss out by skipping this one im not quite sure why they made a remake of this film instead of a reboot i had no qualms with the female cast but i thought the movie looked like shit after the first trailer and i made my judgments from there nice review tho the trailers were just awful they certainly didnt help promote the movie in a positive light and the movie doesnt help itself starts promising but it doesnt end that way hi keith having just seen the original im even more baffled by the super negative reaction to this ah well i dont even want to give those haters my energy well i did like this more than you did mostly thanks to the terrific cast im glad you still enjoyed it for the most part but yeah i wish the script were better the ladies do their best the script just runs out of steam at the midway point and as you said in your review what a terribly uninteresting villain didnt read this back when you posted it because i knew i would be seeing it soon finally got around to it so here i am i enjoyed it thought it was pretty good however it is also extremely flawed like you said the pieces are all there for a great movie they just arent utilized correctly your take on mccarthy is interesting she is dialed back i found her too dialed back i was hoping she would give me some of her bombastic shtick and yes hemsworth was the best part of the movie i think my take on mccarthy comes from my deep dislike for her shtick it seems like she basically does the same thing in every film thats why i liked what she brought to this role but i can see where her fans may be a bit disappointed lots of people herald the original as an absolute classic i really like it but have never held in as high regard as many do its still really fun the remakenot so much the original is now one of my favourite movies ive become a definite fanboy  lol the reboot isnt as good as the original  and some parts of the climax felt slightly underwhelming  but i personally found it a rather fun if somewhat mindless fantasy comedy its funny nothing in the reboot stands out to me except chris hemsworth i literally dont remember anything else it left no impression on me
Apr 11 2022,neutral, theres a funny moment in the new ghostbusters when kristen wiig reads youtube video commentary aloud aint no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts and then dismisses the comment as unnecessary since the first trailers for director paul feigs allfemale reboot appeared online detractors have been vocal about their disdain for the concept of a female cast feig openly acknowledges and mocks the criticism in this scene however he fails to address or resolve what may become the most valid complaints about the film its brash poorly written and completely unnecessary indeed the four lady leads are actually the best thing about feigs comedy whereas the films script is sloppy its characters underdeveloped and its reliance on the formula of the 1982 original is frustratingly unoriginal in trying to pay homage feigs film provides little more than an assemblage of recycled ideas presented by fresh faces for new commercial prospects and rather than provide a showcase for the four comedianstars wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon the secondhandedness of everything onscreen spoils any possibility of ghostbusters succeeding on the merits of the talent involved an unfortunate case of déjà vu lingers throughout the proceedings as almost every plot point and character correlates to one in the original once again white scientists studying the paranormal are sacked for the fringe nature of their scholarly pursuits and then start ghostbusting for a living learned physicist abby yates mccarthy reluctantly joins her childhood friend erin gilbert wiig and erins weirdforweirds sake nuclear engineer friend jillian holtzmann mckinnon to go into business for themselves catching ghosts once again the newly formed ghostbusters adorn tan jumpsuits and convert a hearse into their company car and while feig may have reformatted the material for a female cast he doesnt do anything innovative in terms of race once again the fourth ghostbuster is also the sole token african american patty played by leslie jones is not an academic but a streetwise subway operator the other three meet on assignment after becoming a ghostbuster patty occupies a racial stereotype in which shes all buggyeyed and runs from ghostly danger harkening back to minstrel shows on the sidelines the ladies hire a gimmeabreak dumb male receptionist in kevin chris hemsworth whom erin drools over feig uses hemsworth as a comic nonsequitur in nearly every scenefrom kevin spitting out coffee to wearing glasses with no lenses hes present only as a running gag until that is he becomes a plot device the plot follows the same basic trajectory of ivan reitmans original enough to call feigs film a remake instead of a reboot for some reason or another paranormal activity in new york city has been going haywire the ghostbusters investigate and learn angryattheworld loner rowan neil casey schemes to release the underworld realm on new york of course the ghostbusters must consult the nitwit mayor andy garcia and his bossy top aide cecily strong to justify their claims of an apocalypse and by the finale the powerpacked foursome takes on a series of ionized apparitions including a towering familiarlooking baddie feigs brand of comedy may appeal to modern audiences but its also the characteristic that diverges most from the original the humor of bill murray dan aykroyd ernie hudson and the late harold ramis may seem quaint and subtle compared to the overthetop comic flamboyance composed by the director anyone familiar with feigs earlier work bridesmaids the heat and spy knows his jokes are big big big he likes broad humor particularly slapstick and trendy comebacks like really and overused lines like lets do this at the same time he also includes a cameo by ozzy osbourne who shouts sharon i think im having another flashbacka moment that feels more than a decade passed its prime lazy throwaway moments such as these fill ghostbusters as well as cheapen it feigs bright cast is wasted on his frustratingly messy script which he wrote alongside katie dippold in the ray stantz role mccarthy is best when shes geekingout over some paranormal tidbit shes also no stranger to behaving outrageously having done so in feigs last three features and she has a few typical blundering mccarthy moments here if theres a peter venkman in the proceedings wiig fits the bill using her awkward shtick in scenes with hemsworth mckinnon might serve as an egon spenglertype except shes not so much nerdy as just random and strange behaving like an incohesive oddball in a saturday night live sketch thats carried on far too long jones occupies the same role as ernie hudson once did and thats a shame none of these characters feel real or endearing theyre all onenote and none have even the slightest character arc and so when erin saves abby in a climactic green vortex what shouldve been a touching moment feels empty the other charactersthe ghostsrange from familiar looking to kinda neat and finally to nonsensical fans will groan about reappearances of slimer and the staypuft marshmallow man what no viggo love but jaws will drop at the sobadicantbelieveimseeingthis appearance of slimers wife a character soon to join jar jar binks and skids  mudflap as one of the worst movie characters ever the ghosts themselves are rendered with topnotch computeranimation often glowing in smoky neon wisps of color they look tangible in a computergenerated kind of way but they hardly compare to the practical almost touchable photography effects used to create ghosts in the original the fx are even less impressive when the arbitrary ghost of a dragon appears how is this a ghost does this ghostbusters exist in the same universe as game of thrones its best not to spend too much time thinking about these things the filmmakers haventtheres very little logic about how the ladies fight ghosts in the original ghosts had to be captured trapped and contained here the chaotic finale vomits out a swarm of spirits and our heroes blast ghosts dead again with laser guns and grenades apparently with no further explanation required all the while the franchiseness of ghostbusters radiates from the screen whether its mckinnon delivering an infilm pringles ad or the four ladies enjoying a dinner of papa johns the product placements appear throughout maybe im just reacting to the silly music video that plays over the end credits but reboots are among the most commercially gratuitous creatively uninspired products to come out of hollywood and yet as a critic and moviegoer i am not opposed to the very concept of a reboot its just that most of the time they prove to be nothing more than grabs for cash every once in a while something like star trek 2009 comes along and reminds us what is possible but most of the time you end up with overly familiar nonsense like total recall 2012 or point break 2015 studios treat beloved properties like the latest model of smartphone now with a new cast and modern cgi they make needless changes to reestablished old material and hope to make considerable bank on namebrand recognition in a way we should admire feig for trying something sortof different had the reboot been an allmale cast ghostbusters would have seemed even more unnecessary than it does but the story including cameos by almost everyone from the original cast not playing their former characters and alltoofrequent nods back to reitmans film demonstrates how despite his genderswapped cast feig rests on the laurels of the original classic had the director made a completely unrelated supernatural comedy starring these four women but not referenced the original ghostbusters in any way the result probably would have felt only mildly derivativebut no less annoyingly commercial instead feigs reboot plays like another forgettable addition to hollywoods longrunning nostalgia craze worse the ghostbusting comes in doses of loud busily filmed nonsense and its humor is about as subtle as a pie in the face getting worse and worse as it goes ghostbusters offers a few laughs early on but then descends into the worst kind of hollywood product
Feb 18 2022,positive, the fanboys can put their proton packs away there is no need to put this film into a trap where ray peter egon and winston trapped ghosts 32 years ago ghostbusters is not the train wreck most people were anticipating it would be as a matter of fact the film is quite fun and the perfect example of what a summer blockbuster should entail the issue of this film stems from its marketing after the conclusion of the film i can now say with confidence that this is one if not the worst marketed films since 2000 the trailers were poorly cut edited and included scenes that were not even in the final cut of the film sony has had its fair share of failures in rebooting franchises including the amazing spiderman and last years fantastic four reboot so it was difficult for fans to embrace a reboot just based on past attempts from sony ghostbusters 16 is to ghostbusters 84 what jurassic world  was to jurassic park  a reboot with a similar story structure and visuals the film follows the format of the original as 3 paranormal enthusiasts erin gilbert kristen wiig abby yates melissa mccarthy and jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon discover a pending ghost invasion to save manhattan they become the ghostbusters transit workertrivia expert patty tolan leslie jones joins the group and offers her expertise on mass transit and architectural history while the film does follow the same story structure as the original catch one ghost early on followed by a climactic finale feig does a fine job incorporating a back story to the characters we understand why erin and abby have such a great bond and why holtzmann has a large input into the creation of the ghostbusters leslie jones who has been bashed based on the trailers to the film for her seemingly unfunny comedic tone does a fine job in this film and is a bright spot to the film the chemistry between the four leads is what works best in this film the dialogue all throughout brought back memories to the first time i saw ghostbusters and the chemistry the original four had lead by kate mckinnon she absolutely owns this film as she brings the venkman charm and the egon brains and molds them into her own fun witty sometimes strange holtzmann every time she is on screen she steals the show not everything is sunshine and rainbows as ghostbusters does have plenty of flaws the villain is a reminder of the issue marvel films have suffered throughout their solid run the villains motivation is weak and really feels like a place holder for the ghostbusters to eventually take down while there were subtle nice cameos of old locations from the original the cameos of the original cast while most being nice to see minus bill murray affect the pacing of the film there are moments where certain events are occurring and the film pauses just to scream hey look an original ghostbusters  slimer makes an appearance with a female version of himself and it comes off tacky unoriginal and most importantly unneeded while i dont feel ghostbusters 16 will have the staying power ghostbusters 84 had it does what it intended to do its an entertaining film that respected its predecessor if you were against this film being made because of the love of the original you will still find reasons to dislike this film however if you go into it with an open mind then maybe just maybe ghostbusters might just entertain you
Aug 18 2021,positive, the timing is certainly coincidental in the same week thats witnessing the release of ghostbusters a new scientific study i believe conducted at johns hopkins university but dont quote me on that has conclusively revealed that the brain size of mras misogynists and other militant morons is larger than a penny but smaller than a quarter the test which originated in the wake of the release of 2008s sex and the city and entered the home stretch as mad max fury road was hitting theaters last summer serves as the bookend to a similar study that yielded the exact same results among racists around the time the annie remake starring quvenzhané wallis was playing multiplexes as was emphatically declared in a thomas dolby music video science yet the interesting component is that as this reinterpretation of the beloved 1984 ghostbusters gets underway it appears as if maybe for the first time in their entire worthless lives the social suicide squad of femalefearing fanboys will be right  albeit of course for the wrong reasons after a moodsetting prologue the film doesnt start so much as lurch forward and the inclusion of some unnecessary and unfunny scatological humor suggests that maybe rebooting this franchise wasnt such a great idea if the end result was basically going to be a genderswap the hangover with a higher cgi budget but as the script by paul feig who also directs and katie dippold a writerproducer from parks and recreation and madtv gets its bearings as additional characters are added to the roster and as the gags start to rely less on lockerroom humor and more on the comic abilities of the cast ghostbusters soon takes off and never looks back is it better than the original ix nay although the distance between the two is perhaps closer than anyone will care to admit and despite some terrific contributions from the newcomers theres no buster quite as glorious as 84vintage bill murray whose deft turn was one for the comic ages but to be clear this is no rancid ghost trek so clueless and selfcentered that it soils memories of the original if anything it enhances it with some nicely placed cameos even the late harold ramis sort of and clever allusions to the original be sure to stay through all the credits to catch a teaser not unlike the grabber that closed batman begins wisely feig and dippold dont make their stars female versions of the boys from back in the day eg peter venkman hasnt suddenly become patricia venkman but rather come up with new characters for them to inhabit kristen wiig is comparatively speaking the calm one  shes erin gilbert a scientist who tries to bury her ghostdabbling past as shes set to attain tenure at a prestigious university but thats easier said than done since her former partner in the paranormal abby yates melissa mccarthy has been hawking their previously published novel on the subject all over the internet as expected erin does not attain tenure but she does develop a reenergized interest in ghosts joining with abby and her lab mate jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon as they investigate some unusual activities occurring around the big apple and once their outfit is enhanced by the presence of mta worker patty tolan leslie jones and possibly hindered by the addition of dumbasabrick receptionist kevin chris hemsworth all the team now requires is a catchy name and a catchy logo wiig and mccarthy are fine playing within their normal parameters so its the support staff that yields the largest dividends jones is very funny as a woman whose common sense occasionally and understandably takes a back seat to hysteria while hemsworth builds on the comedic promise he displayed in last years vacation with an absolutely riotous portrayal of a hunk so lunkheaded he covers his eyes whenever he hears a loud noise best of all is mckinnon who never seems to stay still as she infuses holtzmann with reams of eccentric personality the picture becomes heavy with visual effects spectacle in the final act but because the creatures on display are a far cry from the usual dinosaurs spaceships and transformers even this section manages to remain inventive and eyepopping the smartness of the script not only informs the nods to the original marshmallow anyone but also directly addresses the tantrums thrown by the nations manboys from a nice line about the bullying of women to the fact that the villain of the piece played by snl scribe neil casey looks exactly like the sort of keyboard warrior who spends his friday nights anonymously bashing women online as someone accurately notes its always the sad pale ones whether on its own fearless terms or even as an update of a zeitgeistcharged smash ghostbusters proves to be an oasis of entertainment in the midst of this cinematic summer drought  a popculture popcorn picture designed to raise spirits in more ways than one how can you claim that people who dont like it are misogynists it was a genuinely bad movie and completely unnecessary i was looking forward to it until i found out it was a reboot and not a sequel 9 out of 10 remakes reboots are worse than the original and this one falls right into that ratio you claim they arent female versions of the males they are direct flippedgender versions did you watch the original its 100 obvious the only one who wasnt was the secretary they turned janine into a ditzy musclebound dude it was filled with crass humor and the humor that wasnt vulgar just wasnt funny they relied too heavily on the special effects which was the only thing that didnt suck it was pretty to look at but everything else fell flat i like melissa mccarthy and kate mckinnon but even they were bad in this movie i dont blame them i blame the pacing and the plot i will admit i was more critical of it because i thought they would to the smart thing and say they were the daughters of the original ghostbusters or something similar but i tried it i watched it and i hated it i am especially disappointed that some complaints about the new movie is that they are ignoring the 2016 movie well the 2016 movie ignored the previous 2 movies the 2016 was a flop most people didnt want it nor like it making a sequel to the good movies was the smart way to go if you have a foundation made of concrete you dont rebuild it out of glass and then get made when people choose to go back to the concrete foundation to build off of thanks for writing chuck if you note i wasnt referring to everyone who saw the film obviously there are many such as yourself who genuinely didnt like it my comments were directed at the fanboys who among other juvenile activities blasted it sight unseen simply because it starred women wrote awful racist things about leslie jones to the point she had to leave twitter and repeatedly whined this movie is ruining my childhood pretty sorry childhood right
Apr 2 2021,positive, from the moment it was first announced back in 2014 director paul feigs reboot of ghostbusters has been the focal point of debate a depressing amount of that discussion has centered on the decision to go with four very funny very talented women in the lead roles but the real question  for sane rational people at least  is the one that lingers over any reboot remake or sequel these days does the movie justify the decision to start over fortunately while ghostbusters does indeed stumble and occasionally feel more like 1989s ghostbusters ii than the 1984 original the final product not only does the franchise proud but leaves you wanting more adventures with its allnew team cowritten by feig and his screenwriter on the heat katie dippold ghostbusters casts bridesmaids actresses kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy as a brilliant particle physicist and an expert in the paranormal respectively who find themselves caught up in an investigation of spectral pests plaguing manhattan theyre assisted by an eccentric engineer played by saturday night live cast member kate mckinnon and a former subway station worker played by fellow snl veteran leslie jones to their credit the cast of ghostbusters does a nice job of creating some distance between their characters and those of the original films stars naturally the teams investigation leads to the discovery of a far more sinister threat facing the city and the ghostbusters soon find themselves in the role of reluctant heroes as they face off against a villain whose diabolical scheme could put an end to the world  or at the very least new york as far as reboots go ghostbusters is positioned in a comfortable place at the midpoint between slavish shotforshot remakes and movies that share nothing in common with their source material beyond a title to their credit feig and dippold break new ground where necessary but still seem to keep the original 1984 film just below the surface of their story many of the overarching plot points echo the original from the downontheirluck scientists treated like frauds who step up to become heroes to the storys reverence for new york city and its role as a nexus of sorts for paranormal phenomena the movie also doesnt shy away from overt callbacks to the original with much of the 1984 films primary cast appearing in the reboot in cameo roles and in the case of one particular cast member a bit more than a cameo and more than a few tongueincheek references to elements of the first film that have found their way into the collective memory of fans while the motivation behind all of the callouts and cameos is obvious at times all of the nostalgia does weigh down the story feig is trying to tell fans might enjoy the sight of so many familiar faces and lines from the original film but those elements rarely feel organic and occasionally end up stalling an otherwise fun story right as it gets rolling along on its own momentum to their credit the cast of ghostbusters does a nice job of creating some distance between their characters and those of the original films stars there are few surprises to be found in the performances of wiig and mccarthy who play to their strengths and essentially play smarter scientisttype versions of the characters theyve had so much success playing in the past wiigs erin gilbert is equal parts ambitious and awkward while mccarthys abby yates is simultaneously confident and a little bit flakey theyre the sort of characters both actresses do well with and to their credit  and to the credit of feig and the ghostbusters creative team  theyre not simply female analogs of the male characters in the original film fans of the two actresses will find a lot to like about this new setting for them to continue doing what they do best in the role of the teams quirky tech expert mckinnon shines as jillian holtzmann at times holtzmann feels like an embodiment of all of the best parts of the original films ghostbusters brimming over with confidence and intelligence to spare and not giving a damn what anyone thinks  or which safety concerns she might need to overlook to get the job done shes a buttkicking science warrior on a quest to know the unknown and she absolutely positively isnt afraid of any ghosts jones patty tolan is a subway station worker whose encounter with a ghost leads her to the ghostbusters who eventually make her part of the team tolan is the closest thing to an analog the film has with its 1984 counterpart jones character is every bit the outsider that ernie hudsons winston zeddmore was in the original ghostbusters and serves much the same purpose in the story shes the audience standin caught up in a wild supernatural adventure and although she gets more screen time than the underused hudson did in the original film their characters essentially exist for the same reason to hold a proton pack and be the teams voice of common sense and rational thought amid all of the scientific and supernatural chaos jones does a fantastic job with what shes given but her role is limited the films postcredits scene yes youll want to stay through the credits suggests that shell play a far more integral active role in the teams investigations down the road  if there is a sequel of course the film also features a fun performance by thor star chris hemsworth who plays the teams meathead receptionist kevin the superhero actor does a surprisingly good job with the comedy and holds his own alongside some pretty formidable funny actors but does overstay his welcome with more screen time than seems necessary for a film about the ghostbusters not their receptionist janine never got this much time in the original if theres one flaw that permeates ghostbusters its the films reliance on some pretty heavy digital effects for its ghost characters  effects that occasionally feel too cartoony texture is often the key to selling digitally created elements and far too many of the specters and paranormal pests in ghostbusters feel like flat images on a screen instead of characters in the story its a problem in more and more movies as hollywood leans heavily on digitally created elements the issues with ghostbusters shouldnt be construed as a vote against computergenerated effects or for practical effects for that matter but more of an example of what could use more attention in a sequel feig and the ghostbusters team have built a strong foundation for a rebooted series that  despite all of the issues that come with a nostalgialaden property like this one  seems more than capable of standing on its own even where ghostbusters falls short the film shows a tremendous amount of potential for the characters more holtzmann please and the franchise down the road sometimes the most popular movies on netflix are not the best movies on the streamer case in point m night shyamalans glass is currently at no 3 and that film somehow pulled off the unique feat of retroactively making shyamalans previous movies in his superhero franchise unbreakable and split a lot less fun thats why were specifically putting the spotlight on a terrific movie amadeus as it celebrates its 40th anniversary this year by streaming on netflix were also featuring the bricklayer an action thriller that will probably be on top of netflixs movie charts by the end of the weekend this film barely registered at the box office but thats never stopped the netflix effect before almost every big movie that was once on peacock inevitably arrives on amazon prime video that was part of the deal that universal pictures struck with amazon so the studio shouldnt be too upset when a new arrival on prime video like the exorcist believer suddenly becomes a bigger streaming hit there than it ever was on universalowned peacock similarly universal and illuminations minions the rise of gru is also experiencing a surge in popularity on prime video after its recent arrival so horror fans and comedy lovers both have something fun to watch as they head into the weekend fair warning the rest of prime videos new arrivals are pretty light through the

Mar 3 2021,positive, i dont think there was a person in the world who didnt hear the outcry of butthurt fans after the first ghostbusters trailer dropped it quickly became one of the most controversial summer movie trailers gaining nearly twice as many dislikes as likes on youtube the polarizing reactions came partially in context to the plot and largely towards the casting of the protagonists as female instead of male ill be the first to say that as a person who has never seen the original sue me im 24 with chinese immigrant parents this was not apart of my childhood repertoire the trailer made me a little apprehensive ive heard all these praises about the original film my entire life and i definitely didnt need an article or to see the ratings to know that the fans would dislike it as with most reboots these days  and there have been a choking amount of them to swallow  ghostbusters remade the original film it was not a sequel but a remake that is nearly the same as the original save the genders of the main characters to me it felt a little contrived with some funny jokes and cgi to jazz up the story i agreed with the sentiment that keeping the racial dynamics the same felt like a step back that the casting of the main protagonists was used as a business move to buffer the film from critics by using the defense of accusatory sexism however i took a step back from it like i do with almost all the movies i review and stayed away from the promotional material to walk in with an untarnished view i could have had watched the original and done a comparison but i wanted it to be unfiltered by a lens that so many have worn without the original movie bias its been easy for me to see some of the choices that were made in creating this film to me this movie was a movie about four people fighting ghosts in new york i went in with few expectations and i had a good time with little knowledge of the plot of the original or anything about the characters other than an overplayed theme song and wellknown aesthetic ghostbusters just felt like another summer movie to me the plot was goofy in the same way that movies in the 80s are typically  goofy in the same way that movies now are kind of goofy looking at you now you see me without knowing the plot the twist is unexpected and adds to the strength of the movie the comedy the cgi was bad but in a way that was kind of good at the same time you dont really need ghost cgi to look real you know its fake i think ive watched enough ghost adventures to know that ghosts are orbs and light flecks not green and blue and shimmery but the movie wasnt bad not by a lot the leading ladies have a great rapport with one another and it plays very well on the screen they work off of each others comedic flare and stylistic humor melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig play perfectly off one another as estranged best friendsghost hunters leslie jones is on fire with her witty lines and relatable character and kate mckinnon nails the performance as the eccentric engineer and mad scientist are there issues with the racial casting yes definitely its almost painfully obvious when a black bluecollar working woman is standing in a room full of white female scientists babbling on about protons that the racial profile is a dated one that doesnt really fly with many of the audiences today but then again you could say that the gender profile is progressive and yet many audiences had an almost instantaneously negative reaction to it that is by no means a justification for the racial casting but its a remains to be a vocal observation the film itself is littered with cameos and chock full of humor one thing ill say is that i never stopped laughing while watching the film the leading actresses are effervescent and breathe a lot of life into a stale plot same goes for chris hemsworths rendition of an prettybutdumb airhead secretary which he acts out in superb fashion it seems like they could be headed towards a sequel given the way it leads into a mention of a certain well known figure from the original film in the postcredits scene however this seems to be a hopeful stinger mixed in and on the whole it is a film that can stand on its own firmly ending strongly final thoughts the graphics are probably as rough as they were in 1984 and the plot is nothing fresh but the comedy still lands solidly and the leading actresses pull off their roles with perfect ease that make this remake enjoyable summer movie fun the diehard fanboys will likely still hate it but who is surprised
Feb 11 2021,positive,ghostbusters is fun its silly and it doesnt take itself too seriously
Dec 23 2020,negative, since 1989 dan aykroyd and ivan reitman have been trying to bring another ghostbusters into theaters the pair found very little success with writing a good enough script and getting the team back together with bill murray very resistant to return to the franchise however in early 2015 columbia pictures announced the ghostbusters would be rebooted with an allfemale lineup and paul feig in the directors chair the end result features a lot of laughs and genuine scary moments but falls short of capturing the same lightning in a bottle that the original ghostbusters created in 1984 the film follows erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy a pair of scientist who started off their careers as specialists in paranormal activity over the years gilbert moved towards legitimate science while yates kept up with investigating ghosts and unexplained phenomenon with her partner jillian holtzman kate mckinnon when gilbert and yates reunite after a number of ghost sightings in new york city they start a business with former mtaworker patty tolan leslie jones who turns to the scientists after she encounters a ghost in a subway tunnel to further investigate why the city is a hot bed for the paranormal ghostbusters feels like it belongs in the franchise as a clever comedy with a touch of horror however it also seems to be middling when it comes to constructing a smooth story it really feels like everyone involved was hamstrung into making fans happy as if the backlash really did get to them time and time again the movie gets in the way of itself when it shoehorns in a number of references to the original this is called fan service and it hurts the new ghostbusters when it comes to its storytelling why cant movies just be movies why do reboots and sequels have to keep paying tribute to what came before it why does a franchise movie like ghostbusters continuously wink and nod to a fan base instead of paving its own path the most frustrating part of watching ghostbusters is when the story and laughs have to stop so bill murray dan aykroyd and the rest of the original cast can appear on screen to wink at the audience afterwards the story and comedy have to restart and move forward only to stop again for the next cameo and reference although paul feig has been brilliant in balancing laughoutloud moments with heartfelt ones ghostbusters suffers from constant fan service one of the things that the movie does best is its ensemble comedy surrounding the wonderful chemistry with the cast including chris hemsworth who plays the ghostbusters inept assistant kevin and andy garcia who plays the mayor of new york however the real star of the movie is kate mckinnon as nuclear engineer holtzmann from the moment shes introduced on the screen the character practically steals every scene shes in with unexpected cleverness and wit ghostbusters is a goofy reboot that really uses its 3d formatting to good use the new movie is presented with an imax 3d option which takes advantage of the format images popped out of the frame to give a complete experience as it were coming alive in front of you feig and cinematographer robert yeoman really take advantage of 3d while playing around with what we expect from blockbuster filmmaking its quite impressive the new ghostbusters isnt as tight as the original but it does have flourishes of real subversive comedy the cast and filmmakers really play with audience expectations but unfortunately they do not fully realize the potential of what they can do
Dec 4 2020,negative, fter casting aside her lifelong dream of scientifically verifying the existence of the supernatural physics professor erin gilbert kristen wiig now focuses all of her efforts on gaining tenure at columbia university in new york city but shes expelled from her job when former friend and colleague abigail yates melissa mccarthy an expert in metaphysics involves her in a rather public expedition to capture a ghost in a haunted mansion the experience finds her unemployed but with a renewed passion for the paranormal  so together with abigail her technologicallyproficient assistant jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon and former subway employee patty tolan leslie jones who was recently confronted by an unfriendly apparition the group sets up shop as the ghostbusters with a monopoly on the industry and an unusually high number of spectral beings appearing around town they quickly perfect the art of nabbing the incorporeal as the sightings rapidly increase the ghostbusters determine that something sinister is afoot and must attempt to locate the source of the unearthly disturbances before an unspeakable terror is released onto the city there are so many homages and cameos and references to the original film that this remake practically demands that audiences familiarize themselves with the existence of the 1984 property ironically thats the last thing this latest incarnation should require instead it should have desperately attempted to distance itself from its predecessor  to introduce unknowledgeable viewers to a fresh take on the lighthearted tracking and apprehending of paranormal entities but especially with its story which so briefly touches upon the why and the how of identifying and capturing ghosts this 2016 reboot expects moviegoers to be well versed in the business of ghostbusting sadly thats not the biggest problem the most disappointing component is the complete lack of chemistry between the leading foursome they have scant camaraderie no emotional connections and zero repartee when they do make jokes theyre all of the juvenilely inappropriate kind such as commentary on flatulence and bodily excretions there are also a few pop culture nods and updated technologies but the inability to land solid oneliners and the overdependence on scifi jargon really stifles the laughs despite fleetingly curious cat jokes or graphic design spoofs or the witty sexual remarks about hunky yet dimwitted receptionist kevin chris hemsworth the role reversal gimmick wears off quickly and when all four of the stars act as if theyre participating in different projects mccarthy does her usual routines full of exasperating complaining and wiig plays her typical tyrannized underdog while mckinnon is the oddball nerd and jones is the enthusiastic streetwise warrior it all becomes hopelessly incompatible with no one working toward a harmonious sense of humor you have done this before right theres a lot of slapstick but none of it is exceptional disbelief is a bigger opponent than otherworldly scheming the theme music is remixed and reshaped for modern audiences though it only reminds of the muchloved campy dated feel of the original which cant possibly fit nicely here and the special effects receive a boost of cg but essentially duplicate the ideas previously manifested nothing about this production is particularly thrilling or funny its crushingly uninspired and very very slow numerous concepts are entertained but drop off abruptly including erins backstory jillians resemblance to q from the 007 films and explanations as to why the initial ghosts are tormented souls of dead people but the later phantasms are gargoyles or blobby balls of goo and theres no sensibility to the designs or explanations  which matches the absence of passion and purpose its painfully evident that writerdirector paul feig just didnt know what to do with the notion of revisiting a cult classic franchise designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Sep 8 2020,positive, i became a different human being that day a better human being i wanted this tiny wondrous and miraculous human being in my arms to have every opportunity to chase every dream and to explore every opportunity her heart and mind desired i wanted her to never live a day without realizing she was loved adored accepted celebrated and valued for exactly who she was i wanted to be a positive role model for her something i hadnt particularly been up to that point in my life but i knew i had to change i mean sure i knew that her parents would raise her up to be talented and strong and compassionate and intelligent but yeah i wanted to be part of that journey i wanted her to have role models who would remind her that she could achieve the impossible tackle the terrifying and become the superhero of her own life growing up she loved xena heck i think she still does xena is this badass warrior princess who is intelligent and strong and well just pretty awesome xena wasnt really my thing but you know how it is when you love someone right you try your damndest to love what they love and god i loved that she loved xena and not some wimpy ass barbie now here we are its 2016 shes a young graduate student in her mid 20s studying criminal justice she is simply extraordinary shes loyal and kind and remarkably intelligent and talented and if i may say so myself shes a total badass i thought of victoria as the closing credits rolled by after having watched ghostbusters the second coming of the 1984 classic that has had fanboys up in arms for months at the thought of a ghostbusters remake with gasp an allfemale squad of badass funny and intelligent women prepared to fight the paranormal and yeah save new york in the process to be fair to the haters and to make sure i dont build up this reboot too much i will acknowledge that on one point you are absolutely right  ghostbusters is not a new comedy classic its not it doesnt reach the dizzying heights of comedy that have allowed the original to remain such a beloved film over thirty years later but ghostbusters is a good film its a damn good film with a terrific cast a decent story and amped up special effects that come courtesy of thirty years of technological advances ghostbusters will frequently make you laugh and even more frequently make you appreciate the spoton chemistry between erin gilbert kristen wiig abby yates melissa mccarthy jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon and eventually patty tolan leslie jones erin and abby are fractured friends who once wrote a book about ghosts before largely going their own ways in life when the aforementioned book suddenly resurfaces erin loses her tenure at columbia university and the previous tension rises to the surface again the tension begins to subside of course when ghosts suddenly start showing up it feels a little bit like having a baby you know it sort of masks the tension but hey whatever works kate mckinnons jillian is the groups egon a wildeyed yet brilliant inventor and one might argue the brain behinds the group leslie joness patty tolan a transportation worker knows new york city like the back of her hand and handles most of the squads logistics in yet another gender reversal chris hemsworth is here as kevin the dreamy receptionist who seems to serve as erins ghostbusting muse if theres a problem with ghostbusters its that director paul feig tries too hard to make everyone happy and at times ends up muting the films impact below what it should be in fact its a bit of a shame halfway through the film i couldnt help but think that ghostbusters actually could have been a comedy classic but feig couldnt quite let go of his need to aim to please the impossible to please fanboys while the second half still works its not quite on the same level while ghostbusters may not quite achieve comedy classic status rest assured that its a mighty fine film and yeah significantly better than one might think after watch the mediocre to just plain suck trailers feig wrote the screenplay with katie dippold a screenplay that nicely balances the films abundant humor and horrorlite it would be nearly impossible to single out any member of the cast as ghostbusters is truly an ensemble film and mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon are as weve come to expect from each of them individually incredibly committed to their performances and wildly inventive in how they interact with each other chris hemsworth reveals a quietly comical side that weve not seen from him before but im fairly sure well see it again ghostbusters could have gone wildly wrong the internet trolls would have loved that there arent a lot of true hollywood classics that get remade successfully far more often they fail miserably instead in a summer that desperately needed an energetic fun and spirited comedy ghostbusters rises to the surface and kicks major paranormal and internet troll ass do you remember the look on your daughters face when she looked up the screen and watched rey come to life in star wars the force awakens it was like this magical experience for hollywood to finally create a female character who was intelligent sensitive heroic and completely badass
Jul 13 2020,negative, after all of the talk surrounding its lead up paul feigs ghostbusters 2016 remake is finally hitting screens and for the buzz generated between it being a remake of a beloved film and the gender swapping of the main characters the final product turned out to benot bad actually its pretty fun in spots in a summer season that has been loaded with disappointment this stands as one of the few good ones in fact the problems that plague feigs film is in its insistence to call back to the original the screenplay by katie dippold and feig seemed hesitant to steer away from the familiar course tossing in a ton of elements directly lifted from ivan reitmans classic some scenes are shot in the exact same locations and bits of dialogue are translated almost word for word the basic plot outline is nearly identical this causes problems for ghostbusters 2016 in establishing its own identity there is so much fan service going on here just like in star wars the force awakens 2015 how did the filmmakers expect us to view this on its own terms when they continually remind us of ghostbusters 1984 the biggest issue is the constant cameos of the original cast bill murray dan aykroyd ernie hudson sigourney weaver and annie potts make appearances the late harold ramis shows up as a bust while seeing their faces was a delight they added nothing to the narrative the momentum comes to a screeching halt whenever they show up murray has an extended cameo that has no relevance to the main plot and after he makes a joke or two his character which is not peter venkman is completely forgotten about but theres no denying that the talent brought together here is first rate kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones are four of the funniest comedians working today and the camaraderie between them is great some of the best moments are through their interactions and how each of their differing personalities clash or gel kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy are the standouts as scientists erin gilbert and abby yates respectively a few years earlier erin and abby collaborated on a book about paranormal activity in the present erin works to gain prominence in the scientific field while abby continues the research they started when real ghosts start popping up around manhattan erin and abby join forces once again to notify the world of the pending danger leslie jones provides good work as patty an mta worker who knows the ins and outs of new york she joins the team to provide insight on buildings roadways and tunnels  shes also responsible for retrieving the famous ecto1 hearse a lot of credit should also go to chris hemsworth as kevin the ghostbusters absentminded receptionist in a funny role reversal hemsworth lays waste to his hunky macho persona giving us a glimpse of his surprising comedic talents hes actually allowed to let loose here unlike his work in the thor films and has fun doing so the audience at my screening loved kate mckinnon as holtsmann the wacky scientist who invents the teams ghost battling weaponry during the credits when her name came up she got the biggest applause theres no doubt of mckinnons skill as she has been a highlight of recent saturday night live seasons but sadly i have to disagree with my screening audience mckinnons character was awful an over the top caricature mugging for the camera every moment she came on screen she did garner some comedic bits but most of her efforts fell short with her exaggerated facial expressions and goofy voices holtsmann belonged in a different universe let alone a different movie its as though she couldnt have one regular conversation without inserting a quirky gesture just for a laugh im aware that im probably going to be in the minority on this one but so be it what about the ghosts they were fine in that computer generated sort of way early haunting scenes have a nice spooky feel to them  spooky being the keyword not scary the special effects have that usual glossy sheen those expecting the grit and grime of the original will be disappointed the ghosts are completely passable some recognizable friends such as slimer  show up once again reminding us of ghostbusters 1984 the artificiality strongly shows in the third act during the climactic battle the slow motion and cgi work combine for something akin to a light show rather than an epic fight to save the world with the controversy that came with the release of ghostbusters 2016 the gender swapping is  for the most part  one of its strengths its when we examine everything else that things start to unravel this still has the problems many recent comedies have a lack of strong narrative flow for the benefit of extended improvisational scenes but those hiccups are balanced by the number of laughs this was an entertaining but entirely disposable summer blockbuster take that for what you will
Jul 3 2020,positive,  ive always been a big ghostbusters fan but i wasnt going to watch this one until it arrived in the 99 cent bin  after reading this review im ready to watch it tonight 
Jun 30 2020,positive, while i personally remember minute details about going to the movies as a kid there are very few filmgoing experiences that hold fond and lasting memories for the rest of my family ghostbusters is one of those movies on top of being a fantastic film we remember it because a storm passed overhead while we were in the theater when we came out the combination of the poststorm clouds breaking apart and the setting sun had turned the sky many strange colors which almost mimicked the clouds over spook central in the movie we had just experienced its a memory we still talk about today and its one of the few movies that my parents have been willing to go see again every time it has been rereleased in theaters over the past few yearsneedless to say its also one of the more influential films to me personally i have affectionately named my cubicle the nerd desk for all of the silly pop culture figures and items that fill a lot of the space the amount of ghostbusters items is second only to the amount of back to the future paraphernaliai mention all of this to show that i have every reason to be one of those naysayers who condemned the new version before it was even released based on the pedigrees of everyone involved though i never was a negative nellie i have kept an open mind from the announcement of the reboot all the way to its release and what i found in the finished product surprised meerin gilbert kristen wiig is a physics professor up for tenure when she finds out that her former friend abby yates melissa mccarthy is still selling a book they wrote together about the existence of ghosts something that would hurt her chances for tenure with the very conservative university staff she pays abby a visit in order to get her to take the book back out of printerin finds her still in the pursuit of proving the paranormal now with a new partner jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon she ends up tagging along with abby and holtzmann to check out a haunting report after experiencing a rather up close and messy encounter with a real ghost the trio launch into their new venture as ghostbustersthey hire the hunky yet dumb as a box of rocks kevin beckman chris hemsworth as their secretary and set up shop their first real client is patty tolan leslie jones a subway employee who has seen a ghost in one of the tunnels at work she also had a strange moment with a man just before her spectral encounter he is rowan north neil casey and he is using homemade devices to break down the barriers between our world and the hereafter in order to cleanse the worldghostbusters is a genuinely entertaining film its quite funny actually spooky at times and even fun and exciting especially when its combining the modern with the throwback moments the women are a wellmatched comedic collective especially the nutty performance from mckinnon what differs in the comedy this time out is that all of the leads are given a chance to shine rather than how they gave bill murray most of the great lines in the original not that that was a bad thing since it definitely proved to be the right move for that version but the choice here not only expands the humor possibilities it also expands their characters personalitiessince its a reboot most of the story is given to setting up the ghostbusters team while less attention is paid to the villains plot this is where the movie is weak rowan is not a very compelling character they try to set up reasons for what hes doing but he only comes across as a character thrown in so the movie can say see this guy hes your baddie it feels like they assumed the core audience of ghostbusters fans would identify with rowans motivations but we all know what happens when you assume he does become more interesting during the third act but it takes a certain something and someone for this to happenluckily rowans storyline is only a small part of the overall movie setting up the team including a realistic look at the evolution of the proton packs and the rest of their equipment and their struggle to be taken seriously in a sea of ghost hunter tv and internet shows is entertaining enough to carry the rest of the film especially when handled by these four very funny womeni also have to commend director paul feig for his own geekiness not only does he obviously have respect for the original shown through the many nice nods peppered throughout but he is a true film geek nowhere is this more prevalent than in his use of 3d while most films converted to 3d these days give off the air of being above using the gimmick of throwing things at the audience feig fully embraces itthats what 3d was designed to do and he knows it ghosts reach out of the screen all kinds of stuff flies toward you and best of all the proton streams shoot into the theater they have even gone so far as to letterbox the 3d version so that some of the effects can spill outside the movie itself its almost disney theme parklevel 3d entertainment minus having things physically happen to you the tenyearold in me was literally bouncing up and down in the seat going this is so cooli cannot say enough about how awesome the 3d is in this film no matter what you think about the casting or rebooting a classic or whatever your gripe towards this version is if you are a true ghostbusters fan you should go see it just for the amazing 3d it brings the general ghostbusters world to life in the way you probably always dreamed it could be done who knows maybe youll also be surprised by the high quality of the film toono this new ghostbusters will neither replace the original nor will it ruin your childhood however it is a really good start for a potential new expansion of the ghostbusters universe when it comes to remakes and reboots in general we couldve gotten a lot worse oh yeah and make sure you stay through the end credits hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs

May 4 2020,negative,it just wasnt very fresh
May 4 2020,negative,it just didnt click for me
Feb 13 2020,positive, as moviegoers were conditioned to sigh in resignation whenever we hear about a remake oh god there are no original ideas in hollywood anymore we say as we roll our eyes so far back we can see our brains  but remakes have been a part of american film since the beginning cecil b demille made the straw man in 1914 remade it in 1918 then remade it again in 1931 if remakes were an issue for you you probably should have started complaining about them 98 years ago it bears mentioning that just because a remake exists its not simply an inferior copy of the original john carpenters remake of the thing is leagues better than the original only someone whos clinically insane would claim that david cronenbergs remake of the fly is a lesser effort compared to the original sure theres garbage remakes like the illadvised reboots of total recall and robocop but when judging the quality of a remake you have to do it based on whos involved so heres the conclusion we have to draw from that nothing is sacredand thats okay when it comes to movies nothing should be sacred because by placing a beloved film on a pedestal we rob talented filmmakers of the chance to put their own spin on it besides going back to our examples just because the remake of robocop is stupid and pointless theres no way it can retroactively affect the quality of the original or do harm to your cherished memories that brings me to ghostbusters there are some people that believe 1984s ghostbusters is an untouchable and unassailable classic of modern film that belief even leeches over into 1989s ghostbusters ii and the numerous animated television series as a result they believe this franchise is goldplated in terms of quality but when they heard that a remake was coming down the pike and that four women would be the leads a chunk of fans lost their damn fool minds the trailer was the most downvoted in youtubes history fans of the original passionately refused to see it like flatearthers or trump supporters these folks dont let little things like logic get in the way of their convictions thats a pity because 2016s ghostbusters is light funny and pretty good overall we meet dr erin gilbert kristen wiig a physicist at columbia university shes sharp and shes on the cusp of getting tenure the only problem is that years ago she cowrote a book on ghost hunting the book has been republished and is showing up on amazon its the kind of thing that could bring her dreams of tenure crashing down she does the only thing she can do which is to beg her coauthor and former best friend abby yates melissa mccarthy to remove all traces of their book she finds abby working as a paranormal researcher at a downscale college alongside abby is jillian holzmann kate mckinnon a fascinatingly weird nuclear engineer abby and holzmann have made significant progress in designing equipment to handle paranormal phenomena the three women become involved in a ghost hunt at a historic new york mansion and this kicks off an explosion of spectral occurrences along the way theyre joined by patty tolan leslie jones a friendly mta worker and amateur nyc historian they also hire kevin chris hemsworth as their receptionist a man who is both incredibly handsome and bafflingly stupid but we wouldnt have a movie without an antagonist and ours is rowan north neil casey a bitter nerd who is harnessing ectoplasmic energy in order to destroy the big apple the newlyformed ghostbusters must get to the bottom of rowans supernatural scheme and save the city because thats how these things work first its very funny very very funny we all know that humor is subjective especially in this day and age but the majority of the jokes here as surreal as they occasionally get are rooted in character and context even throwaway bits like a tour guide played by zach woods talking about an antiirish fence work well because theyre connected to specific behavior while there may not be any lines here as instantly iconic as he slimed me there are comedic moments that easily go toetotoe with the original is it good yeah mostly director paul feig along with coscreenwriter katie dippold has been honing a unique comic voice for a while now last years spy was a terrific comedy and much like ghostbusters it was saddled by a mediocre trailer that effectively hid what a solid film it was feig and dippold make films about strong and relatable women while a lesser filmmaker would have saddled erin or abby with a dull romantic subplot the emotional spine here is their friendship erin turns her back on the paranormal and sprints towards academia after the reaction of her book while abby becomes more of a truebeliever the film charts the way these two reclaim their friendship and its refreshing seeing a movie where the main characters genuinely like each other feig is able to efficiently balance the laughs character work and a few good scares the cast overall does good work and they all play effectively to their strengths feig seems to bring out the best in melissa mccarthy and instead of playing her usual pottymouthed slob shes charmingly earnest wiigs erin is the straight woman mostly but she mines laughs from pentup desperation as patty leslie jones brings energy and infectious joy to every scene but there are two performances in particular that make this movie a mustsee mostly known as the god of thunder for marvel chris hemsworth possesses formidable comedy chops and hes been itching to use them his kevin is astonishingly dumb and better yet he has no idea how truly stupid he is whether kevin is showing off his questionable skills as a graphic artist or attempting to master the difficulties of answering the phone hes the second most entertaining character in the film however kate mckinnons holzmann is genius like ryan reynolds deadpool or johnny depps captain jack holzmann is a character thats so unique she immediately becomes legendary shes the tech geek of the ghostbusters constantly fiddling and tweaking the hardware to learn new applications mischievious brilliant hilarious and a little dangerous holzmann fools around with wildly dangerous equipment because its fun even when shes lurking in the background of a scene you cant take your eyes off her and she gets huge laughs continuously her character pushes things to the next level and feig uses her precisely the right amount so whats not so good the film starts off so strong but by the third act the energy starts to get overwhelmed by too much cgi while i love the concept of flipping the bird towards haters by making the villain one of them rowan north is a pretty uninspired bad guy yes hes convinced of his own superiority and yes he wants to use an army of spooks to exact revenge so what its as if feig and dippold spent so much time honing their leads and they remembered at the last possible minute that there needed to be an antagonist also some of the cameos are clunky and the theme song by missy elliott and fall out boy kind of sucks really none of that matters for everything that doesnt work theres so much more that does these ghostbusters are solid and this film effectively riffs on the original and creates its own thing for those willing to engage it with an open mind theyll be rewarded with a big slice of goofy summer entertainment its not goldplated or even bronzeplated the original is a classic but ghostbusters ii is a lazy and shameless cashgrab no wonder bill murray wanted nothing to do with making the proposed ghostbusters iii some pseudomens rights activists have tried to claim with a straight face that chris hemsworths dopey kevin is a character thats actually sexist towards men thatis just adorable
Jan 14 2020,positive,2016s ghostbusters comes as a sip of water in a historic drought feig has pulled off the impossible by successfully reworking an unlikely masterpiece and everyone involved deserves major kudos
Dec 5 2019,negative, there is a scene in paul feigs reboot of ghostbusters where abby yates melissa mccarthy is scrolling through some comments at the end of a youtube video yates hopes the clip featuring a frightening standoff with a ghost in the subway is proof that phantasms actually exist instead she reads this comment aint no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts its a sly reference to the heat the film has faced from fan boys of the 1984 original upset that this reboot features female leads i was afraid to give ghostbusters a negative review or forever be called a misogynist no i dont hate women ghostbusters is simply a terrible movie  hollywood is not capable of leaving any concept good or bad dead or undead and 32 years later we have a new version of ghostbusters feig once again tries to populate a genre that features male leads with women this isnt the first time someone tried to replicate the lightninginabottle success of the original there was a crappy sequel and a halfhearted stab at an animated series so what could feig and cowriter katie dippold learn from those blunders was simply swapping the gender of the lead characters enough happily there is no correlation between the female characters and their male counterparts there is no direct standin for venkman or stantz each of feigs cast is given an entirely new role though most of them are not very believable kristen wiig stars an erin gilbert a professor at columbia who is up for tenure when a book she wrote in the past with yates about paranormal activity surfaces gilbert is shown the door umm okay so she reluctantly joins forces with yates and her partner the hyperactive jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon when she learns that a local mansion may be haunted it isnt long before patty tolan leslie jones a former mta worker rounds out the group as more and more hauntings plague new york the women find themselves in high demand wiig and the gang are likable enough although mckinnon really chews up her scenes but the big problem here is the plot sure zuul and the gatekeeperkeymaster business from 1984 isnt that great of a story but at least a cohesive thread held the film together this version of ghostbusters feels like a series of loosely connected scenes that usher the audience along until we reach a climax of mass destruction akin to something you see in a marvel movie a lot of poorly done special effects and very little heart this is a movie built to make money and feig stumbles a bit when aiming for that pg13 rating more profanity and more wedding dress shitting please its strange because there are some genuinely scary bits to the movie why dial back the comedy with the chastity cuffs firmly on feig is forced into mediocrity then theres chris hemsworth who takes on the annie potts role as the ghostbusters secretary however his kevin is so dumb its amazing he can function in the world yes hes handsome and wiigs character is constantly making a fool of herself hitting on him but kevin is so dumb its unbelievable like not knowing how to answer the phone dumb the best part of the first ghostbusters films is it feels like real people thrown into an extraordinary situation when you have a character as poorly drawn as kevin it is impossible to suspend your disbelief when the ghosts come in  worst of all the movie just isnt funny even if it tries to separate itself from the 1984 film most of the original cast shows up in increasingly awful cameos more concerned with special effects than plot ghostbusters doesnt even let wiig and mccarthy do what they do best instead they more or less stand around until the next ghost comes along for them to scream at sorry folks your fears that this film is awful will not be allayed you may not be afraid of no ghost you wont even be afraid of having your childhood dreams dashed you will just be disappointed  early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Oct 23 2019,positive,we found them all more than capable of taking on the action as well as the comedy it just could have been put together and paced better but its still fun especially if you see it with a big audience
Oct 21 2019,positive, what do you say about a film that inspired almost a million youtube users many of the masculine variety to give thumbs down im sure scores of women felt like me and it got their dander up  this weekend director paul feigs galfronted reboot of ghostbusters is releasing across the country and fingers crossed will bring out female fans in droves in support of women in film and not least to smack down and dissuade the kind of girlbashing behavior so pervasive online prerelease   but is it any good the short answer is its good enough to enjoy but not as great as representing total vindication there are certainly moments that shine so brightly the entire audience glows like say slimer in particular kate mckinnons character jillian holtzmann and leslie jones as patty tolan are wonderful and without question raising their stock to alisters chris hemworth makes himself nearly intolerable by being so funny and entertaining he nearly steals the movie this is not a sequel or a remake  these four female ghostbusters have their own back stories their own quirks and exist in their own shared world  interestingly the new york where they ply their trade is somewhat out of time  we dont see lots of cell phones or trappings of the now and only the occasional plotdriven reference to the internet  kristen wiig is erin gilbert a professor of physics working to get tenure at columbia trying to live down and forget a book about the paranormal she wrote with her childhood friend  melissa mccarthy as abby yates is that friend who still does research in the basement of a barely accredited college with the help of genius loose cannon holtzmann when an investigation into a haunting leads to a video that gets gilbert fired the three decide to continue their work together  bored transit agent patty tolan jones joins the team after having an encounter with a belligerent ghost on the metro tracks and the rest is ghost fighting quip tossing and slime cleaning fun especially when dumb as dirt hottie kevin hemsworth acts as their entirely inept receptionist there are a few weaknesses that bring the proton power downcameos come fast and fierce as do other nods to the original franchise and they tend to pull the audience a bit out of the proceedings while mckinnons character is an oddball hoot and entirely magnetic some of her moments seem to hang out in the stratosphere in a way that makes them feel out of place and badly paced  some jokes dont seem to land particularly well  the movie is probably a good ten minutes too long on the other hand the camaraderie is off the charts  i cant remember ever feeling more excited to see four people in costumes together especially as a woman who yearns for cosplay options that dont involve over 80 of exposed skin  this isnt just women kicking butt this is women kicking butt without any help from men or talking about men with confidence fearlessness and humor  the moment where mckinnons character wreaks havoc while wielding two weapons is really worth sitting through the looser aspects of the rest of the film the next time the powersthatbe in hollywood say women cant open and carry a film i hope they will be reminded of this one and strong box office numbers mentioned as proof  ghostbusters may not be a film for the ages but its definitely deserving of a thumbs upmaybe even a million of them
Oct 2 2019,neutral, dr erin gilbert kristen wiig the martian is a professor at columbia university who years ago wrote a book on the paranormal with her former partner abbie yates melissa mccarthy spy abbie has continued that research at a much less prestigious college when that book surfaces erin is faced with a claim that one of new yorks agent landmarks is haunted upon further investigation the ladies come facetoface with a ghost when a second ghost shows up in the nyc subway erin and abbie along with jillian holtzman kate mckinnon saturday night live and patty tolan leslie jones saturday night live set up shop ready to capture and study these apparitions unfortunately the mayor wants to discredit them to avoid mass hysteria until the vortex is charged and a portal is opened unleashing ghosts all over the city i was cautiously optimistic when this movie was announced but less enthusiastic once i saw the trailer this version is a little scarier and decidedly much less humorous than the original one the story isnt well thought out or well written and cant live up to its predecessor mccarthy isnt funny and her voice is annoyingly nasal wiig is slightly better but mostly uninspired jones adds a few moments of hilarity and a streetwise toughness that works most of the time but the real star is mckinnon her portrayal of the intelligent inventor with a tinge of slightly mad scientist is refreshing and chaotic she adds an element to the dynamic that is ingenious and disturbing and she stands out in every scene she is in the other saving grace of the movie is the cameos from almost every significant member of the original cast those moments are nostalgic and terrific conversely the sexist role reversal with the dumb hot yet inept male secretary chris hemsworth thor had the potential to be funny but sadly falls flat the graphics were one of the few shinning moments in the film with fantastic looking ghosts that arent cheesy or cheap looking however sometimes they we too well done and could be scary to younger audience members the direction also misses the mark and it is very obvious in scenes such as the dance sequence that could have been epic but was cut and stuck in the credits to keep audiences in their seats not only should the dance have been kept in the film but it would have been better if they had broken into the thriller dance just one of many missed opportunities throughout the movie that helped makes it the disappointment it ultimately becomes if you have never seen the original films you may enjoy this reinvention but for those of us who fell in love with the movie in 1984 the new ghostbusters cant hold a candle to what paved the way allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Sep 23 2019,positive, this isnt to say that the reboot is unrecognizable on the contrary it delivers pretty much everything youd expect to find in a ghostbusters film there are jokes about bodily fluids there is ectoplasm spraying everywhere there are power beams blasting away there are plentiful cameos not excluding the stay puff marshmallow man tip stay all the way through to the credits for the best appearance although its ostensibly about busting ghosts the plot of the original ghostbusters involves disparate forces working together to stalk leading woman dana barrett sigourney weaver protagonist peter venkman bill murray evil antagonist zuul and the nebbish neighbor louis tully rick moranis all shower dana with unwanted sexual attention dana seeks help from the ghostbusters because zuul has possessed her apartment venkman takes the case in large part to get close to her venkman makes inappropriate comments basically whenever shes in hearing distance but dana needs his help so she cant just tell him to go to hell its a textbook case of harassment at one point he even nibbles on her shoulder when shes unconscious like the rest of his smarmy comeons this is presented as a joke louis also pursues her when he becomes possessed he actually gets to have sex with the possessed dana again this nonconsensual violation is presented as amusingand even sexy the original films unhealthy obsession with dana is the reason that at times it feels like a horror movie rather than a comedy theres a real disturbing sadism in the scene where the chair in danas apartment grabs her and shes swallowed by her kitchen this cruelty fitted in uneasily with films supposedly light tone and the ending with dana and venkman as a couple is particularly sour after being violated dana is delivered by the film as a victory prize to her harasser how is this a happy ending erin gilbert kristen wiig is smitten with the perfect physique of receptionist kevin chris hemsworth and even makes a couple of inappropriateforaboss comments that recall bill murrays venkman but she quickly realizes that kevin is as she says dumb as a bag of rocks so she gives up on sex and settles for admiring him from a distance the rest of the women have no apparent significant others male or otherwise in place of stalking the new ghostbusters substitutes female friendship and trust when erin was young an old woman who lived next door died and her ghost visited erins bedroom for a year she was terrified but no one believed herexcept for erins schoolmate abby yates melissa mccarthy while the first ghostbusters blithely ignored danas trauma the reboot takes pains to acknowledge and address erins none of these changes are accidental yes the reboot shows a lot of affection for the original film but theres also a critique of it bill murray shows up as a professional skeptic his smarmy condescending treatment of the female ghostbusters is right in line with the smarmy condescending way he treated dana in the first film in the remake his hyperbolic comeuppance is one of the films better twists the villain narrative quietly recalls the original film as well rowan north neil casey is a nerd with a grudge a quiet loner filled with rage that his genius isnt recognized its easy to read him as a dig at the misogynist internet trolls who were so upset about the reboots casting choices indeed the movie explicitly mocks its critics in a characteristic bit of selfawareness but rowan also resembles the original heroic ghostbusting dudes the first film presented nerdy genius guys as its heroes the second makes it clear that male geeks with a grudge arent always so benign from the treatment of murray to the unapologetic embrace of sisterhood theres plenty in the film to enrage fans who feel threatened by a femaleled ghostbusters but the truth is in most respects the reboots reworking is for the best today the snickering harassment in the original comes off as dated cramped and not much fun to watch the reboot paradoxically feels much more comfortable in its own skin its as if in exorcizing the originals misogyny ghostbusters has at last managed to find the soul it thought it had all along

Aug 23 2019,positive, the new ghostbusters reboot has hit cinemas after months of trailerbashing from nervous fans it has an allstar cast of excellent comedians and its clear they aint afraid of no ghosts in case youve been living under a rock for the past year this new ghostbusters has an allstar cast of talented comediennes in the lead roles with melissa mccarthy and kristen wigg leading the charge given hollywood studios and mainstream multiplex audiences seem more afraid of allfemale cast than they are of ghosts i love that this movie even exists  its a topnotch cast and i love the ghostbusters story  but the humour just didnt fire for me and neither did the nostalgiabuttonpushing cameos 
Jul 9 2019,positive, sadly but as expected news that writerdirector paul feigs reboot of ghostbusters would feature four women in the lead roles was met by the kind of childish misogyny that has come to exemplify the worst of the internet fragile manbabies cursed with boundless insecurity and access to wifi have made hating this movie suffice for their lack of personality intentionally tanking the films imdb rating before it was even released and crusading in comments sections which have long been sanctuaries for the cowardly and hatefilled ultimately the best rejoinder to this legion of douchebros is the one feig delivered ghostbusters is pretty damn good cue the sad trombone for mens rights activists gone are the ghost blow jobs and dancing slime from the original films feigs reboot begins in a new york city whose citizens know neither that the paranormal is popping off nor who to call when it does erin gilbert kristen wiig a fusty academic is up for tenure at her prestigious institution when she discovers her old friend abby yates melissa mccarthy has released an embarrassing book the pair cowrote about scientific evidence regarding ghosts erin storms into abbys office to confront her only to get strongarmed by abby and her new partner jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon into going to a haunted mansion after seeing anhonesttogoodness slimebarfing lady ghost the trio agree to work together and are soon joined by patty tolan leslie jones a history buff who forces her way onto the team the squad hires a muscular mongoloid named kevin chris hemsworth to man the phones and soon find themselves confronting a dangerous breach between the lands of the living and dead proton packs are engaged slimer shows up to throw hot dogs down his throat hallway and an epic battle against an oversized white dude not named donald trump ensues the four leads are magnificent mccarthy reins in her increasingly allusedup overthetop comedic bravado wiig is likeable and approachable as the films emotional core jones brash and savage style is deployed strategically to great effect and mckinnon steals the show as a labeldefying mad woman with the perfect blend of oddness and badassery sure the climax is a big paintbynumbers cgi cluster but by then the actresses have instilled such good will its easy to let go and have fun the films shortcomings are predictable and understandable its actually too beholden to the original with no less than five cameos and scores of dialogue callbacks the villain although appropriately a loner dude willing to destroy everything because the world doesnt make him feel like a special boy is wholly forgettable and boring still this is a film with a laserguided purpose establishing a new status quo and endearing us to our new busters what feig and company did by inverting gender expectations was create a reboot with intent and purpose bringing a wholly new vibrancy and dynamic to expected events heres hoping for a longrunning series with this group much to the chagrin of blubbering womenhaters typing onehanded on reddit
May 3 2019,positive, ghostbusters is that rarest thing  a remake that is as much fun as the original some would say more that also honors the memorable original take that internet grumblers fans who were worried about this remake can relax  the results are very funny the comedy is great and nonstop packed with clever affectionate references to the original the logo and the catchy theme song are back with a few remixes added and the goofy humor of battling ghosts with technology is all there kristen wiig reteams with her bridesmaids director paul feig and costar melissa mccarthy for a hilarious romp that is like a superhero movie without the ponderous stuff these folks know it is ridiculous and they are just here to entertain better yet it should put to rest that question about whether women can be funny  they definitely are in this film wiig plays physicist dr erin gilbert who is on the verge of gaining tenure at columbia university when her past comes back to haunt her that haunting emerges in the form of a book on ghosts that she cowrote back in high school with her then best friend abby yates mccarthy abby has decided to finally publish their joint effort online as a way to fund her paranormal research abby is also working in academia but at a um much less prestigious institution in her research as a professor of the  paranormal abby is hoping to prove the existence of ghosts with the help of weird but gifted engineer holtzmann kate mckinnon a call about a haunted mansion launches the three on a quest to capture a ghost but a haunted subway brings them together with transit worker patty tolan leslie jones who quickly joins the team pattys knowledge of new york city streets and history and practical viewpoint helps ground the others and the four soon find themselves battling an invasion of ghosts flooding new york adding chris hemsworth as the gorgeous but dumb receptionist was the final perfect touch the story is similar but not the same as the original roughly wiig and mccarthy play loose versions of the bill murray and dan aykroyd roles with mckinnon as the harold ramis character and jones in the ernie hudson role but actually these are their own unique characters inhabiting those niches ivan reitman who directed the original ghostbusters and its sequel serves as producer and stars from the first film appear in cameos watch for a bust of the late harold ramis it is all done with a sense of great fun and affection for the first one turns out remaking ghostbusters with a female cast was an inspired idea for a reboot the characters in the original film were outsiders people who are dismissed and who have to prove what they can do this time those outsiders are women but again they are people trying to break through to gain recognition  an ongoing theme in the world particularly in film recently instead of playing female versions of the old characters with pink bows in their hair feig and his stars wisely makes these new charactersjust people strangely that choice gives the film a contemporary girlpower edge and a little rebellious undercurrent the film is an ensemble effort with each cast member contributing her bit and without one lead role although wiigs sweet sincere erin comes close for comedy mckinnons eccentric grinning holtzmann sometimes threatens to steal the show jones patty gets in there too with wellplaced wisecracks mccarthy who can often stray into icky humor keeps a lid on that and adds just the right amount of madness and mayhem even hemsworth holds up his end adding his comic bit  who knew he had that in him occasionally the comedy subtly jabs at the controversy that casting women sparked on social media of course there will still be those who are not pleased  taste in comedy is very individual murray and aykroyd were big name comedians when they made the original and this is one of their best plus remaking any beloved film even a comedy is risky business but for most the new ghostbusters will entertain in summer comedy style it is all great escapist fun perfectly in the spirit of the original a final note to the reader you will want to stay for the credits and all the way to the end they feature a couple extra scenes a very funny bit with hemsworth dancing and little jokes are peppered in the background as the credits roll by the end is capped with a little teaser about a sequel just as deadpool had this years funniest opening credits ghostbusters has this years most entertaining end credits
Apr 16 2019,positive, some fans have already made their decision but if you go into the movie with an open mind this is one of the better remakes hollywood has produced in recent years its fun and funny breezy and playful and finds its own voice while staying respectful of the original the special effects do a neat job of updating the floaty gaseous ghost effects of the original and modern cgi means the film doesnt have to cheap out on apparitions have you ever noticed how few ghosts there actually are in the original its even legit spooky at times sure its mostly chucklesome rather than laugh out loud and its nowhere near as quotable as the prototype while the original ghostbusters is a great comedy schindlers list it aint and treating it as some kind of sacred text is pretty laughable this affectionate reinvention isnt going to make your copy of the original movie spontaneously combust any more than the past 30 years of lunchboxes cartoon spinoffs or spurious toys like the original the new flicks strength is its core casting once again it unites four comic actors who form basically a gang you want to be part of kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon dont try to recreate the characters so memorably inhabited in the original movies by bill murray dan ackroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson instead they form a new team to unite against both ghosts and a skeptical world while none of them runs away with the film the way bill murray did in 1984  wiigs character in particular is a bit of wet blanket for much of the movie  the breakout star is kate mckinnon the camera constantly cuts to her reactions as if it can barely keep up with her scenestealing energy and yeah they all happen to be women the new ghostbusters doesnt so much pass the bechdel test  an informal measure of how women are represented in fiction  as ace the bechdel test it should win a bechdel prize for showing the rest of the world how its done it shouldnt be novel but it is ghostbusters is fun and silly and if you dont like it you dont have to watch it no need for mass hysteria the film opens in the uk on 11 july in australia on 14 july and in the us on 15 july
Apr 12 2019,positive, today i saw the movie that broke the internet for months the battle over the ghostbusters remake has been raging strong  it has a female cast some idiots trolled people involved overreacted and then a bunch of lousy trailers came out plus like independence day its another movie that others feel much more nostalgia for than i do you can see my best shot pick and thoughts on original ghostbusters here so is this new version the monstrosity that some people hoped for yes some idiots hoped it would be bad no in fact i liked it very much going into ghostbusters i looked for a few things 1 i wanted charismatic likable female cast 2 i wanted to laugh 3 i wanted some entertaining ghostbusting action this film gave me all of that i left with a big smile on my face so lets start with our leading ladies we have kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon i like that they arent exact copies of the 4 original ghostbusters mccarthy and wiig are long time friends who have written a book on the paranormal they had great chemistry together and i thought mccarthy stole every scene she was in i know some are tired of her shtick but its really not here there isnt a single fat lady joke in the whole movie shes just funny all of the ladies have great chemistry together and things like leslie jones being from the street was actually well done for the most part characterwise what worried me in the trailer didnt come to fruition  kate mckinnon verges on being a little annoying but i was ok with it a lot of people have complained about the depiction of men in the film i think this complaint misses the subtle humor these roles have i cant even tell you how many movies ive seen where every female character is a dimwit shrew or hooker now they turn it around thats part of the joke its called turning the tables to make people think and maybe laugh a bit at the way we see gender played out in film chris hemsworth isnt just the idiot hes a satirical jab at every dopey receptionist babe weve seen in a thousand other films lets get to the humor i must own i actually havent seen many paul feig films because they are usually hard r ratings here he is working in pg13 territory and for the most part i laughed a lot the banter between the ladies was very funny and dry also chris hemsworth is hilarious in every scene he is in as the dopey receptionist i also liked little moments like when melissa mccarthy cant get her broth to wanton ratio right from the chinese restaurant things like that made me laugh now the action it is not as horror influenced as the original but i liked it i thought some of the designs of the specters was cool and how the women had to use their brains to take them down was also cool i particularly liked a set of ghosts that were giant balloons that felt very day of the dead influenced it was also cool to see all of the new gadgets that mckinnons character invents i think young girls will see this movie and have fun playing scientist and killing those ghosts its the same thing that makes me excited to see girls playing rey i had ariel and thats basically it nothing tough and fighting like this that does bring me to a negative i had in the movie most of the movie is so kidfriendly that it bummed me out when unnecessary crude and vulgar humor was thrown in for no reason like a character gives another the middle finger repeatedly why did that have to be in there i dont need that for my little girl you also had a joke about female anatomy i could have done without that said those crude and vulgar jokes are much worse in the original so its not really a surprise there are also a number of cameos and callbacks to the original and some of them do feel forced it didnt bother me that much but it is definitely fan service i particularly could have done without slimer and his wife driving around i honestly hope there is a sequel because i think that will be even better i think these fan service moments are out of the way and we can move on to an entirely fresh story overall if you can turn off the critics i think you will have a good time  is it the greatest movie of the year no but honestly neither was the original at least to me  they are both fun summer movies with quippy dialogue and scientists taking down ghosts give it a shot i dont think you will regret it ill see this when it comes to dvd but im not really interested in it as im also not really a big fan of the first 2 films so i dont have any desire in this franchise and im hoping to like the film with my low expectations i dunno their snl stuff doesnt usually make me like although i have liked kristen wiigs voicing of lola bunny in the looney tunes show kate mckinnon and chris hemsworth are amusing but the script hangs the rest of the cast out to dry  the personalities of established stars mccarthy and wiig have been lobotomized by the script they severely minimize their normally quirky appeal here perhaps thats admirable this is an ensemble piece and it allows others like mckinnon and hemsworth to shine however in the process we lose what makes their comedic personas so invigorating you read my review you know i was all primed and ready to just love this  unfortunately it just didnt set itself apart enough so many cameos  ok ill admit it was fun seeing sigourney weaver bill murray dan aykroyd ernie hudson and annie potts again  what no rick moranis   but the script just kept reminding me of the past  an interesting remix i suppose but this has already faded from my mind interesting because wiig and mccarthy were my favorite but youre right about it being an ensemble feel i dont know for whatever reason i was laughing but i can see what you mean too its not the most memorable movie do you think the sequel will be better now the cameos and fan service are out of the way i do for some reason this year ive been really soft on a lot of comedies i liked this central intelligence and even laughed at the boss and a little bit in zoolander 2 go figure but still comedies i didnt like such as the doover and my big fat greek wedding 2  glad you enjoyed it its been interesting to follow everything going on with this film midnights edge have been doing videos about it on youtube as they did with fant4stic and it really all seemed to be building up to a disaster again fant4stic with even the studio looking a bit desperate  so the fact that the movies been generally well received is a big surprise im still not going to see it at the cinema but i will check it out at some point in the future yeah some of those creatures were a little scary mccarthy really did nail her jokes when she got all those wontons at the end i laughed ha
Mar 29 2019,positive, it could have gone so many ways but there are countless genuine great laughs throughout ghostbusters which continue the whole film through  the sign of a truly great comedy kate mckinnon is a firecracker who steals every scene with her strange wired energy and lust for explosions and chris hemsworths dumb pretty receptionist role is a stroke of genius from feig and dippold flipping gender stereotypes to comment on them without us even registering what theyre doing as the safety of new york city gets increasingly fraught the fear feels real and there are plenty of jumps there is perhaps a need for a stronger grounding of the plot in these moments but theres soon another wave of highaction proton gunshooting to wash away these worries remaking such a classic was always going to be a gamble but feig and dippold manage to establish a perfect balance between referencing the old and leaving their own mark  the use of the original music fed in subtly throughout the film is a perfect example of this keep your eyes open for plenty of cameos which err on the side of fun rather than cringeinducing getting to see four normallooking women on screen of all shapes sizes and colours is rare let alone seeing them be action heroes who save the day and ghostbusters isnt preachy about it at all  it presents the fact that theyre women as entirely normal which might be the most revolutionary thing of all snappy jokes kickass women and great fight sequences all make ghostbusters a funashell blockbuster which you wont want to miss its a silly funny scary romp into the other side that leaves you grinning with pure joy and marveling at some positive female role models synopsis doctors erin gilbert and abby yates scientific theories about the existence of ghosts seem to be proving themselves true but they must learn to control  as well as understand  the horrors coming through from the other side  sian is a writer and performer based in south east london who sometimes puts on plays and sometimes tells jokes shes been writing articles since she was about 14 and her dad took her to film screenings and made her bring a notebook the first film she ever saw was hercules during which she filled her nappy which her dad deemed an adequate review shes been filling her nappies in cinemas ever since
Feb 16 2019,positive,ghostbusters isnt as good a movie as the original but theres no shame in failing to reach the level of a classic its still a fun and funny film with plenty going for it particularly a wildly talented cast that is pretty obviously having a ball

Jan 15 2019,positive, this ghostbusters finds lifelong friends and paranormal enthusiasts erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy reunited when a series of ghost sightings in manhattan sparks local interest after months of lackluster advertising i went into the new ghostbusters fully expecting to hate it there was just nothing about any of the trailers prior to the release that appealed to me so imagine my surprise that this new incarnation of the beloved 1984 comedy actually works is it on the same level as the original certainly not but it is still a film that stands quite well on its own merits this ghostbusters finds lifelong friends and paranormal enthusiasts erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy reunited when a series of ghost sightings in manhattan sparks local interest working with a nuclear engineer named jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon and subway worker patty dolan leslie jones erin and abby uncover a plan to open a paranormal porthole that would allow the undead to take over the world ghostbusters does a good job of creating its own identity while staying faithful to the charm of the original film the cameos from original cast members are very creative and drew some of the biggest applauses in the screening i attended as did the other nods to the original film at the heart of the film is the relationship among the four leads and all four actresses are more than up to the challenge their chemistry is very good and their comic repertoire helps to keep it all zipping along mckinnon is the standout in the pack as the slightly aloof but brilliant member of the group its a breakout role that should lead to even more movie roles for the saturday night live cast member im sure there will be some diehard fans of the original that will still find faults with this ghostbusters but if you go in with an open mind you might find yourself pleasantly surprised another film opening this week is the infiltrator b a crime thriller that has plenty of familiar elements in play but also has an aceinthehole in the form of a dynamic lead performance from bryan cranston based on a true story of a government operation that led to the arrests of many of the key players in pablo escobars drug empire in the mid1980s cranston plays robert mazur a us customs agent who helped orchestrate the bust with the help of a rogue cop named emir john leguizamo and a rookie agent diane kruger mazur was able to shift the drug war in ways that hadnt been seen up until that time directed by brad fullman the infiltrator is a barebones crime thriller much like one of fullmans previous films the lincoln lawyer that doesnt stray too far from the genres formula the supporting cast which also includes benjamin bratt and amy ryan could have been fleshed out a little more to add a little more substance to it all but ultimately the success of the infiltrator comes back to cranston its a performance that allows cranston to channel his walter white a mildmannered guy at heart asked to be something totally opposite when he goes undercover a scene where mazurs cover is nearly blown while at an anniversary dinner with his wife is among the films best showcasing cranstons ability as an actor the infiltrator is rated r for strong violence language throughout some sexual content and drug material and is now playing at the regal bowling green stadium 12
Jan 9 2019,positive, the controversies around the ghostbusters reboot have been so varied and often upsetting that talking about the film itself unfortunately seems like small beans at this point ive been getting into polite disagreements with folks on the internet yes polite ever since the film was announced and particularly once it was clear that the crew would be allfemale detractors have run the gamut from concerned oldschool fans to outandout hostile trolls who are determined to make certain that no one finds a chick ghostbusters film funny or worth anyones time they are currently on reddit planning to tell everyone that all positive reviews were paid for guess ill be added to that list then but if we throw all that aside heres my simple verdict the movie is great and not just because it stars a female cast though thats a big plus its actually becauseget ready for my confessionthe original ghostbusters drove me kind of crazy before people descend to pick over my bones allow me to clarify i thoroughly enjoy the film nostalgia rightly situates it as one of the best scifihorror comedies on offer but i learned that i didnt have quite the same reverence for it as my friends and colleagues due to one niggling little catch the film had practically no worldbuilding or set up zilchyzilch nonezo thats not a dealbreaker for most fans clearly but it was for me i was irritated by the fact that the film refused to answer so many basic questions why do these guys know each other how did they start doing this research in the first place who gave them funds for their equipment was the paranormal common enough but ignored in their world i know its a comedy and im not supposed to care but i did i cared watch the cartoon then everyone said and i did sometimes but i could never get over the fact that the film itself refused to build out at all also the cartoon was way different the new film does all of this legwork it doesnt allow those choices to displace the humor or the action but it tells us who these women are and how they come to work together as friends it tells us why the world ignores the paranormal and who helps to keep it that way in effect it erases every qualm i had with the original that likely wont matter to many viewers but boy did it matter to me so on that note alone i was prepared to look on it favorably this movie is funny and its funny in the same way that the first films were being that the humor all comes down to the casts individual quirks as comedians when you add the fact that all of the team are women its brand new territory particularly in the realm of sff comedy they are a dynamic and unique crew and every single one of them is hilarious the standouts here are leslie jones and kate mckinnon after the posttrailer concerns that jones character was the only woman of color in the group and also the only nonscientist it was rewarding to finally see patty tolan in all her history nerd glory her knowhow isnt down to stereotypical street smarts but a genuine love of new york history and she inserts herself into the group by sheer force of logic and pragmatism you need patty she tells them at one point and its indisputable yes we do we need patty kate mckinnons jillian holtzmann offers a character ive been searching for my entire lifea female mad scientist with all the oddities and deeply questionable decisionsexperiments that persona comes with this sort of character is practically always conceptualized as a man and here we have holtzmann unmistakably strange totally reckless likely queer she hits on erin multiple times is all im saying and possessing no filter whatsoever shes perfect i needed her when i was twelve but im just as happy to have her now the biggest thing i can fault the film for is paul feigs editing style which can often muddy the progression of events there are far too many scenes in this film where the jump to another frame reveals that something happened in the space of two seconds that we never witness it can make following the action a little rough at times but it certainly doesnt distract from the laughs fascinatingly the film seemed to divine precisely the sort of people who were going to have a problem with its premise the villain of ghostbusters is in many ways a reflection of the exact type of fan who railed against the movies inception in the first place rowan north neil casey inside amy schumer goes on about how hes been overlooked and bullied planning to bring about an armageddon of his own making to punish the world for being cruel to him but of course he has chosen to respond to this bullying by becoming a bully himself and then theres the fact that the ghostbustersall of them pointedly womenunderstand what its like to be bullied and disbelieved and disadvantaged and stand there as a tribute to the opposite philosophy all of them stand up to him and stop his plan from coming to fruition even though the world refuses to believe them or treat them with respect theres kevin as well the groups dim receptionist who is hired mainly for his good looks and for being the only applicant who offers an extreme comical inverse of the token female in a guy movie trope kevin serves practically no purpose to the plot whatsoever hes there to be pretty and get caught up in the anticsbut he has very little initiative and the one time he shows a bit of agency he only causes more problems chris hemsworth makes the role work by clearly understanding exactly what joke hes contributing to grinning and posing and occasionally getting in a sly nod to his superhero alter ego thor though there are bound to be folks who think that reversing this particular trope is a mean move it works precisely because everyone is aware of the gag so the movie is compelling and entertaining if thats your only concern before stepping into a theater as it should be for an action comedy then theres no reason to avoid it if your concern is lack of respect for the source material its basically a nonissue this ghostbusters is very much its own film while it gives the occasional nod to fun gags from the first movie the universe is entirely different and has another story to tell it doesnt hurt that the cameos made by bill murray dan aykroyd ernie hudson sigourney weaver and annie potts are all fabulous and that the late harold ramis gets a sweet nod too but most important of all this film delivers on something that is still often denied to women on pop culture termsbasic accessibility so many people who didnt want this film claimed it had nothing to do with an allfemale cast but more a lack of originalitywhy do we have to remake great things they said why cant you just come up with a new idea why do you have to take something i love and make it something else the answer is simple in my opinion when something is a cultural touchstone you want to participate the other primary reason i never liked ghostbusters as much as so many of my friends it was a boys club intensely so i could no more relate to those characters than i could relate to rambo but the premise of ghostbusters was still something that i had a passion for it was a fantasy a ghost storythat i could only play secretary to and id be lying if i didnt say that hurt especially as a kid and now thats no longer true now there are women who are ghostbusters and they are every bit as fun as their male counterparts the barrier has been brokenand it was fun to kick down so if youre looking for a little more than that was so funny theres your answer ghostbusters is a funny summer flick that everyone can enjoy but its also more than that its a restructured touchstone its a bigger club its a little girl in a gray jumpsuit on halloween who comes to your house to defend you from the paranormal rather than collect candy emmet asherperrin is pretty sure that holtzmann cosplay is in her future you can bug her on twitter and tumblr and read more of her work here

Nov 19 2018,negative,from top to bottom this movie fails both as a remake and as a stand alone film
Nov 13 2018,positive, there was a huge negative response when it was first announced there would be a remake of the classic ghostbusters with an all female cast once trailers began to come out it seemed that most of the crowd began to get on board i had high hopes for this female cast and they definitely delivered to a certain extent ghostbusters opens with a well done spooky haunted museum which i have to admit was very funny and an excellent way to open the film we are then introduced to dr erin gilbert kristen wig who in her past coauthored a book about paranormal activity with her exbest friend abby yates melissa mccarthy erin is currently trying to reach tenure at columbia university and needs the book to be taken offline so it does not discredit her abby is currently continuing their research with her new partner jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon it is then that the ladies are introduced to their first ghost at the haunted museum and the rest after that is history we are later introduced to patty tolan leslie jones from another ghostly encounter and the cast is now complete i was surprised to see a quiet kristen wig in this film from her time on saturday night live and movies like bridesmaids i expected to see an all out physical comedic performance from her the same goes for melissa mccarthy who even those she was one of the main characters of the film her scenes were not very memorable the friendship connection was great between wig and mccarthy but i feel as though these women could have given us a lot more even with a pg13 rating for kate mckinnon on the other hand i truly believe she stole the show with her mad scientist outbursts and some special karaoke moments in the film mckinnon also gives us an awesome action sequence in the film that had me wanting even more screen time from her leslie jones also holds her own in this film and takes a break from her typical characters on saturday night live to give us a different personality from her it was refreshing to see that she can play other roles that dont require her to be over the top chris hemsworth was another standout in this film with his receptionist role as kevin if you havent seen him in vacation you wouldnt know that he can be very funny as well when hes not protecting asgard he did a great job at playing the hot yet not so smart guy and delivered numerous funny lines in the film overall i thought the movie was good and definitely had its funny moments you will also see some familiar faces in some muchneeded cameos  i loved the action scenes i still expected more from this stellar comedic cast but i did not feel that money would be wasted seeing this film in theaters i would have to rate this film a pay to see in theaters id say wait i was excited for the idea of a bunch of women kicking butt however this just wasnt done right i didnt like the action and the fact that leslie jones the bw had to be the only nonscientist just street smart very typical hollywood remake but not well executed on
Nov 9 2018,neutral, filmmaker paul feigs ghostbusters reboot pretty much followed the characteristic aspects of his previous films bridesmaids the heat spy all incorporating a selfawareness of femaleoriented friendship and the estrogendriven escapades rooted in inspired goofiness so given this familiar foundation of feigs big screen blueprint one would expect that his creative input into the continued ghostbusters franchise for the millennium moviegoers would result in the heralded hype his film project is now enjoying at large sure the femininecharged ghostbusters seemed like a radical concept and would obviously trigger the nostalgic sentiments and comparisons of the classic 80s comedy spearheaded by beloved onscreen paranormal hucksters bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson nevertheless singer ray parker jrs lyrical catchphrase who you gonna call within the ghostbusters theme song needs to be addressed accordingly the answer the handlers behind the original ghostbusters film that could uplift the disjointed high jinks and synthetic silliness of feigs current comedic ghostly shepower schlockfest it is only natural that ghostbusters had high expectations for sony pictures to perform well given the aggressive marketing tactics early release of the ghostbusters movie trailer which was heavily panned online and the aforementioned cinematic legacy of the original films fanatical following and reputation however this third installation of ghostbusters feels curiously flat and strained in its stillborn witticism the creep factor borders on campy and cheesy although this effectively worked for ivan reitmans 32year old spookridden farce in the eighties for which in todays cinematic circle is inexcusable due to the edgier and challenging special effects that could have played up the whimsy and wonderment of this breezy bubblegum coloured romp with seemingly lowgrade spark and sizzle feigs interpretation of the ghostbusters universe could have been fresh and favorable especially with the colorful casting of his capable four female principals in the emmywinning and oscarnominated melissa mccarthy along with saturday night live personalities kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones unfortunately for these noted funny ladies they were saddled or slimmed if you will by a transparent script almost as invisible as the pesky ghosts they are trying to pacify the recycled bythenumbers hilarity and hysteria does not make this brand of ghostbusting quite distinguishing chemistrywise the ghostbuster gals seem to revel in the collective merryminded mischievousness and genuinely try to bring energy and outrageous antics to this flaccid frightfest still the mixture of ghostbusters gooey gumption with a dash of egghead feisty femininity never seems to translate into anything beyond the tired gimmick of promoting another excuse to tap into yesteryears profitable fun and frolic that made the wisecracking murray and his klutzy cohorts so amusing and welcomed in their rollicking ghostly gem from the reaganera quite frankly the notion that ghostbusters is unfairly being knocked for its misogynistic overtones fueled by bias internetbased fanboys not accepting that nerdy womanly scientists cannot fill the shoes of their revered male counterparts from the previous two predecessors is somewhat misleading sure the decision to cast an allfemale ghostbusters team turned some curious heads but for the most part many thought this to be rather intriguing and experimental the actual disdain can be pinpointed to the fact that feigs flimsy boospewing fable is grounded in clichéd and forced chuckles weakkneed jokes and gags lazy writing and uninspired visual neon lighting techniques that look like a cheapened explosion from a vintage late 70s new york discotheque unfortunately ghostbusters wallows in mediocrity and fails to capture the acquired giddiness and imagination so pronounced in the prior entertaining installments even if the original actors in murray aykroyd the late ramis and hudson had decided to reprise their roles under feigs problematic production the results would be the same an aimless reboot without any definitive bite or backbone for a cobbled comedy that is slight and stretched thin to its toothless core amazingly ghostbusters cannot decide if it should remain faithful to its humble roots it does help trivially that iconic ghostbuster notables make scattered cameos sans rick moranis including that glorified scenestealer in the stay puft marshmallow man as well as hot dog gulper slimer or venture off into something resembling its own goofy identity and distinction either way the third time around simply meanders in overproduced noisy emptiness the socalled plot in ghostbusters focuses on college professor erin gilbert wiig presumably in the murraydr peter venkman role and her fascination with ghost activities that end up costing her an academic career in the process specifically erins controversial book that she wrote along with coauthor abby yates mccarthy served as the basis for her firing abbys obsession with ghosts still has her invested with this spirit phenomenon that she researches defiantly with her kooky associate jillian holtzman mckinnon in tow eventually it would take the trios status of joblessness not to mention a runin with a slimspewing ghost that loves soaking humans with its sticky green goo to collaborate on going into business as paranormal exterminators out to showcase their expertise in busting ghosts in the meanwhile there is something brewing in the twisted mind of supernaturalloving freak rowan north neil casey after all he is the lost soul responsible for unleashing the onslaught of riffraffish apparitions upon new york city courtesy of his miserable lonely existence now it is up to erin abby and jillian to eliminate rowans sinister agenda and eradicate the spooky pests that he has manipulated to cause the citywide panic as internet sensational darlings the ghostbusters are committed to step up to the plate as the sassy saviors they were meant to be since going into the ghostbusting industry the later arrival of streetwise transit worker patty tolan jones completes the ghostbusters quartet patty whose run in with one of the slimy ghosts in the subway tunnel was pivotal to joining the three scientists has something to offer the ghostchasing brainiacs a her knowledge of the citys whereabouts and b her funeral director uncles hearse that serves as the official transportation for the ghostbusters overall the third outing regarding this toothless entry ghostbusters notoriously lacks the robust impishness and rapport of the male character counterparts that were devilishly drawn together and cemented by murrays droll humor here the ladies come off as bland and indifferent at least for the paul mccartney and john lennon of the team in wiigs erin gilbert and mccarthys abby yates mckinnons jillian holtzman is the only truly spry ghostbuster who is credible as an offkilter genius ditz with offthewall likability some may gravitate towards joness stereotypical brassy black chick with the brash quips and animated overreactions although jones brings in the highwire urbanized smirks in contrast to her quieter geekier counterparts it is cringeworthy watching her play an overthetop towering mouthy cultural exaggeration that is woefully embarrassing for the sake of this dismissive hedonistic hoot ironically it is the hunky chris hemsworth that fares decently as the handsome himbo kevin the dimwitted ghostbusters male assistant that serves as the doltish eye candy for the cerebral lasses particularly for the smitten erin another snl alum cecily strong checks in as the menacing mouthpiece from the mayors office that tries to discredit the popular ghostbusting technicians as sad thrillseeking women feig serving as both the films director and coscreenwriter along with the heat scriber katie dippold has no cohesive vision for the listless ghostbusters and could have used some critical pointers in studying the proven anatomy of what made reitmans nostalgic vehicle so engaging that still thrives after three decades since coming into the movie audiences consciousness from the lame and limping laughs dipped in cartoonish crudeness ie a male ghost gets a rousing jolt to his junk courtesy of his heroic ghostbusting detractors to musical acts fall out boysmissy elliotts relentlessly unrecognisable erratic and choppy remake of the aforementioned parkers infectious ghostbusters theme song in this regurgitated comedy that has no excuse for catering to a lackluster rebirth while diehard and casual fans patiently waited for a festive followup from murray and crew for thirtyplus years to randomly quote a classic ghostbusters lyrical line i aint fraid of no ghosts this may be the case but one should be

Nov 4 2018,positive,a great team deserved a greater story
Nov 2 2018,positive,just like the first one ghostbusters 16 benefits simply by putting a supremely talented comedic director and cast together and letting them do their thing
Nov 2 2018,neutral, someone is trying to amplify ghost activity in manhattan in an attempt to study these happenings a group of skilled women get together and start a new business the team includes a paranormal researcher a physicist a nuclear engineer and a new york city subway worker together they will investigate the ghost sightings and try to determine what is causing them will the ghostbusters be able to save the city from a ghost invasion the marketing campaign for this film was not well done the trailers made it look cheesy and most people assumed that this would be one of the worst films of the year while i agree that the trailers were not great i was still optimistic about the new allfemale version of ghostbusters im happy to say that this film delivers when doing a remake or a reboot it is important to create something new and exciting while also paying homage to the original the ghostbusters of 2016 is a hilarious film that someone who has never seen the original can watch and absolutely love at the same time there are numerous nods to the 1984 ghostbusters including many great cameos that bring a healthy dose of nostalgia for the viewers that grew up with the original film it is almost comparable to the goosebumps 2015 movie as well in that it was made for old and new audiences to enjoy while being completely self aware and adding in jokes about itself ghostbusters 2016 has a great story line the filmmakers do a great job of creating dynamic characters whom the audience really gets to know it is clear which 1984 ghostbusters are used as inspiration for the 2016 ghostbusters yet they clearly have their own personalities as well they also do a great job creating a mystery as to how and why the supernatural occurrences are increasing in number and severity leading up to the epic finale the plot has many aspects that reminded viewers of the previous films but it can stand on its own because the story is something audiences havent seen before it is fun exciting and kept me laughing almost nonstop from the opening scene up until after the credits helpful hint stay until after the credits are done rolling all of the characters in this film are incredibly well cast and absolutely hilarious we all know from the film bridesmaids that kristin wiig and melissa mccarthy have amazing on screen chemistry and are guaranteed to make us laugh they do not disappoint in this film with wiig as the physicist erin and mccarthy as abby the paranormal researcher the two lesserknown actresses are excellent as well leslie jones saturday night live does an amazing job as the ny subway worker patty she brings a healthy amount of sass to the cast as well as bringing the street smarts and knowledge of new york history to the ghostbusters team the ghostbuster who stole the show for me is kate mckinnon saturday night live as the outrageous holtzmann mckinnon manages to take the idea of a mad scientist to a whole new level there isnt a moment when mckinnon is on screen that my eye wasnt drawn to her and she had me cracking up all of these women were the perfect choices for an all female version of ghostbusters i also have to mention that chris hemsworth thor the avengers delivers some great laughs as the dimwitted receptionist kevin while i am generally not a fan of cgi this film would have been virtually impossible to accomplish without it the ghosts in this film are similar to the original in that they are somewhat transparent and mostly green in color in this film they also added blue tones to the look of the ghosts the biggest difference is that the original film used cgi effects to turn actors into transparent ghosts in this film the cgi is a bit more cartoon looking so when you see the ghosts it doesnt look like an actor but something entirely made by computers i didnt love the cartoonlike look but again it would be very difficult for the filmmakers to achieve the film without the cgi aspect ghostbusters 2016 is an uproarious film filled with laughs intrigue and girl power  it will bring in a new audience that has never experienced ghostbusters before while also appealing to those who know and love the franchise before the film came out the internet essentially took a big crap on the film whether it was because people opposed an allfemale cast or because the trailer let them down im here to tell you that this is one of the best reboots i have seen in a very long time i dont anticipate the film having a huge opening weekend thanks to the marketing but hopefully those who do see it will spread the word that this is a genius film go to the theater enjoy the film spread the word the ghostbusters are back in town
Nov 1 2018,positive, up front i just need to make it clear that i am a massive fan of ghostbusters it has been one of my favourite films since i first saw it when i was six years old i love the movies i love the cartoons i love the toys and nothing brings me more joy than when i can find an excuse to quote the movie in everyday conversation but ever since it was announced ghostbusters was getting a reboot the internet has been in uproar not only because of the usual childhood sodomising claims but because the filmmakers had the audacity to make the titular group of paranormal investigators all female all of this at first could easily be blown off as the usual sexist internet trolls blowing things out of proportion but then that first trailer came out and all hell broke loose suddenly this new ghostbusters became a marketing nightmare and even anyone with any legitimate criticism unfortunately became associated with the aforementioned trolls but now that the film is finally available to the public and i have witnessed it i have a very strong urge to break composure and address the naysayers with some colourful language but im going to remain civil and simply say i liked this movie quite a bit actually heres why in describing the new ghostbusters the key phrase id use is similar but different the film is structurally comparable to the original especially in the first half as our heroes discover the presence of ghosts and set up their business to fight back against them youve got the university dismissing the ghostbusters for their preposterous findings accusations that they are actually frauds causing these apparitions for monetary gain the slow discovery that the spike of paranormal activity is leading to an apocalyptic event and government figures who ignore their findings in the face of this crisis but to call this film a rehash of the original is like calling the force awakens a ripoff of a new hope its clearly intentional from that basic template this new ghostbusters takes the series in a different direction and that is mainly done through having its own unique voice it takes the core concept of the franchise and injects it with paul feigs outlook and sensibilities creating a film that certainly respects its source material but also wants to do things its own way with that the sense of humour is definitely more akin to his movies than the ivan reitman originals or similar films of that era and genre the jokes are a lot faster and cruder full of more adlibs and asides than the more sarcastic and absurdist comedy that fuelled the original but the key thing youre all concerned about is far simpler is it funny thats hard to judge because everyones funny bone is tickled differently but for me i can happily say i laughed consistently throughout the entire runtime sure not every joke hits with most of the duds being the ones they used in the trailers seriously was sonys marketing department trying to make this movie look bad but enough of them do that it keeps the movie consistently entertaining the movie does begin to outstay its welcome as it reaches its third act especially given the slightly bloated twohour runtime and the many different pieces of fan service vary from chuckleworthy to cloying but none of that is enough to stop the movie from being a fun entertaining ride recapturing the magic of the original ghostbusters cast is something you just cant do and so again the filmmakers have done something different with their new batch of heroes and im not just talking about their lack of ychromosomes there are definitely elements of those original characters in the new team with melissa mccarthys abby having an enthusiasm for her work comparable to ray and kate mckinnons holtzmann being an awkward introvert genius in the vein of egon but these are otherwise original funny and likable characters that stand apart from their masculine predecessors in many facets these comediennes are just playing exaggerated versions of their reallife personas but no more so than bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson were kristen wiigs erin is certainly the most unique of the group coming into this situation with more trepidation than excitement and her inner conflict as she tries to find that balance between respectable scientist and paranormal geek makes her a deeper character and a great role model for those fighting against their own quirks in an attempt to be normal mccarthy as she did in spy thankfully uses her usual abrasive persona sparingly for comic effect rather than just being a walking trove of colourful insults and her relationship with wiig gives a strong emotional core to the story as two friends driven apart by conflicting priorities leslie jones patty makes for a good grounding presence as the layman of the group who honestly gets more character development in this one movie than winston ever did in both of the originals but i do think she will be a divisive presence if you already dont like jones sense of humour this wont change your mind but the breakout mvp of the main cast is most certainly mckinnon finally putting her saturday night live chops to good use and stealing every frame of film she appears on shes a hilarious wildcard of a character with nothing that comes out of her mouth being predictable or sane seriously if nothing else i hope she at least gets some more shots at the big leagues because she bloody deserves it the supporting cast in comparison however feels a little undercooked neil caseys scheming rowan does bring to mind peter macnicols janosz from ghostbusters ii but unfortunately not only is he not a particularly original character but he lacks development its a real shame because there is a lot of potential with his character and towards the end he does start to become more interesting and even funny but eventually it just devolves into another blast the ghost finale andy garcia and cecily strong have some funny moments as the mayor of new york and his conniving assistant respectively especially in how confusedly they try to deny the existence of paranormal phenomena despite the obviousness but they come into the story a bit too late to be effective michael k williams and matt walsh are basically just glorified extras with nothing particularly interesting to do charles dance is funny whilst hes there but is never seen again after his two scenes and the various cameos from the original cast members are mostly just throwaway gags nevertheless the salvation of the supporting cast comes from the most unlikely of places and that is the simple but elegant brilliance of chris hemsworths kevin his entire shtick stems from the simple joke of hes an idiot and the sheer lunacy of how far his stupidity goes never ceases to get a laugh even when other jokes fall flat you can always count of kevin to get that smile back on your face the similar but different approach the film takes also applies to the film on a technical level appropriating many of the visuals of its source but repurposing them and giving them a new twist along with some welcome additions the redesigns of elements like the jumpsuits the proton packs and the ecto1 are ultimately harmless changes but the new tech the film adds some much needed variety to the actual busting of ghosts and gives the action something a little more panache than just a bunch of guys standing still and firing lasers the ghost designs are perfectly fine and match up well to the style of the original films though i do wish there were more practical elements to the ghost effects instead of the full cg blowout however the effects themselves never seem unconvincing and for the most part fit in well with the more colourful tone of the film the films overall look is far brighter and slicker than its forbearers but its a shift in aesthetic than is again more fitting to the films tone theodore sharpios score for the film is certainly nowhere near as iconic as elmer bernsteins compositions for the original but some of the pop music choices for the soundtrack are inspired oh and for those who dont like fall out boys cover of the classic ghostbusters theme im kind of indifferent to it dont fret too much its only used briefly in one montage scene and the ray parker jr original remains front and centre lets all face it there was no way any new version of ghostbusters could match up to the original remember the core creative team tried to with ghostbusters ii and even they couldnt manage it its a unique lightinginabottle film that could not have worked at any other time and expecting the same thing to happen again in completely different circumstances is pretty much insane so the fact that this new ghostbusters isnt as good as the original is absolutely no shock to me but the fact that it succeeds on its own terms does bring me a great deal of delight its a film that is keenly aware of its legacy and wants to honour but it also wants to do it on its own terms it takes the premise of ghostbusters and makes it its own bringing a different sense of humour a different cast of characters and a different outlook on the world the gender change to the main cast is absolutely the last thing wrong with this movie and if there is any justice in this world their chemistry and humour will only inspire hollywood to bring more casting diversity to hollywood blockbusters will every fan of the franchise be pleased by the final result given the backlash before even a frame of footage was shot i can unequivocally say no but for anyone willing to accept the film for what it is trying to do rather than measuring it against a film it isnt trying to be then id say theres a far stronger chance youll come out liking it if you have even the slightest affection for ghostbusters you owe it to yourselves to go see the movie and decide for yourself if you dont like it thats perfectly fine with me as long as your opinion doesnt completely stem from a preconceived place of hate
Oct 31 2018,positive, its unfair to compare the 2016 reboot of ghostbusters to the 1984 original that film was possessed of a singular type of chemistry and coincidence that remains impossible to quantize or replicate even the cast and the crew of the original was unable to do it for 1989s ghostbusters ii the new film is its own creation even if it is outwardly and reverentially devoted to the original its just as effortlessly funny and the cast is just as solid in some cases its even better than the original something that the legions of easilyoffended ghostbros  arent going want to hear as before we have a team made of three scientists and a civilian who have taken it upon themselves to combat the rising tide of supernatural mayhem threatening to engulf new york city drs erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy coauthored a book on ghosts years prior to the opening of the film but while erin has disavowed the book and tried to become a respectable professor abby has continued researching the paranormal alongside brilliant mad and brilliantly mad scientist jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon when the sighting of an apparition brings the two friends together again erins belief in ghosts is rekindled and the three go into business as ghost hunters the trio becomes a quartet when they are joined by mta worker patty tolan leslie jones who has an encyclopedic knowledge of new york city and end up being assisted by their very pretty but very airheaded secretary kevin chris hemsworth oh and if you didnt catch it in the previous paragraph all the ghostbusters are women this is more important to the audience than it ever is to the narrative however director paul feig has made a career out of femaledriven comedies that often toy with genre expectations like the heat or spy both of which also feature mccarthy  ghostbusters is no different and like those films it isnt a film about female characters but a film about characters who simply happen to be female this shouldnt be a radical concept in 2016 but given the unprecedented and disproportionately sexist backlash against the film thats accompanied it since day one thats apparently the case feig and cowrier katie dippold never make the film about the ghostbusters being women and thats part of what makes it work so well aside from one character patronizingly referring to the busters as girls nobody questions their legitimacy because of their gender this allows the characters to exist organically in their surroundings to breathe and become their own creatures without constantly having to fight a battle on behalf of all women everywhere there are no romantic subplots unless you count erins quite understandable but completely onesided and awkward crush on kevin and the film passes the bechdel test with flying colors a very large part of what makes the film feel so natural are the lead actresses four of the most consistently funniest women working on screen today mccarthy and wiig have a very distinct chemistry and they easily sell the relationship between erin and abby both characters are tailored to each actress comedic style without either seeming like another variation on their previous roles similarly leslie jones riffs on the outloud persona shes cultivated during her time on saturday night live but patty is a much richer and more complex character shes just as smart as the scientists she teams up with but her knowledge comes more from practical experience than theory and she helps ground the other three characters from becoming lost in whatifs and scientific jargon even chris hemsworth displays a remarkable level of comic timing and physicality that breathes giddy life into his otherwise onejoke himbo the clear standout of the cast however is kate mckinnon proving once again why shes been snls most valuable player almost since her first season with the show in the wrong hands hotlzmann could have been a wild caricature but mckinnon gives her an easy almost deadpan charm that makes her weirdness seem genuine and almost infectious she effortlessly steals every scene shes in even with just a reaction shot from the side of the frame and she has the same improvisational edge bill murray displayed in the original without any of the selfsatisfied smarm she delivers huge helpings of technobabble with aplomb and a confidence thats almost frightening in its solidity holtzmann is macabre manic and pansexually flirty in equal measures and its doubtful that anyone but mckinnon could have made her work so brilliantly well what ends up keeping the film from truly flying high however is not the cast the director or the script but the unfortunate subtext of real life and cinematic constraints a number of jokes from the trailers arent in the final cut of the film and its glaringly obvious where they should have been a number of editing cuts seem abrupt and haphazard and it mars the pacing and flow of far too many scenes it really seems as if the studio took the film at the last minute and cut bits out to keep the runtime as close to under two hours as they could and feig claims that his first cut clocked in at over four hours the film also has an unfortunate and completely unfair amount of baggage it has to deal with from the internet backlash against it something it comments on repeatedly with everything from jokes about youtube comments to having as its main antagonist a pasty and socially maladjusted geek named rowan played by neil casey who plans to unleash spectral armageddon on the world simply because he gets picked on by other people on its own this is fairly innocuous and it plays out well over the course of the story especially when compared to how the busters have similarly been discounted and ridiculed by others for their work but have chosen to do something productive about it but given the atmosphere in which the movie has been released it takes on a metatextual and almost satirical vibe that doesnt fit with the rest of the film and threatens to pull viewers almost completely out of the narrative its as if the busters are literally fighting their reallife haters and while that should be admirable given the circumstances it prevents the film from existing purely and totally on its own a lot of that is forgiven during the climax however a thrilling citywide wellchoreographed effectsheavy smack down that highlights the personalities of each of the busters through something as seemingly simple as their choice of weapons their arsenal is much more varied than the 1984 original the reboot is never going to supplant the original but it is a much more worthy successor to that film than either the official sequel or any of the embarrassing animated spinoffs that have been attempted over the years whether its the ghosts that plague new york city the specter of nostalgia or even just the trolls of the internet these girls kick a whole lot of ass without ever once losing their sense of humor if all reboots were this much fun summer at the movies might not be quite as scary any time jennifer lawrence jeremy renner and orlando bloom want to have an archery contest at comiccon just let me know and ill be there
Aug 27 2018,positive,the new ghostbusters film is a smart spectacular addition to the series
Aug 24 2018,positive, when paul feig bridesmaids the heat decided to dip his toes into the ghostbusters franchise he probably didnt expect the disgustingly hateful wave of backlash he received from meninist crybabys and bill murray fanboys the world over making the 2016 reboot of the 1984 classic that no one really cared so passionately about until this was announced the most disliked trailer in youtube history and spurred a mass imdb votedown placing women in the leading roles shouldnt be considered a brave move but ghostbusters was painted as just that a feminist film to end all prejudice a scathing attack on nerds and dudebros and surely the end to feigs career what people forgot to address was that this was all bullshit ghostbusters is simply a comedy about a group of scientists fighting off ghouls in manhattan childhood friends erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy havent seen each other in years until a leaked copy of their book divulging their theories on the supernatural threatens erins job at columbia university when erin confronts abby about the matter she also meets jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon a mad scientist type and abbys new partner who is working with abby on the pairs old theories because of the scandal of the book erin she loses her job and ends up reuniting with abby and holtzmann after a ghost scare is rumoured downtown they proceed to set up their own company dealing with the removal of paranormal entities its typical scooby doo mystery inc fanfare from here on out a few cases a rocky relationship a new addition to the team in the form of patsy leslie jones a subway worker spooked by the goings on and the fun mashup scenes where we watch holtzmann build and test their various paranormal detectingdefeating equipment but its fun and its nostalgic cheesy and kind of adorable seeing these women famed for gross adult humour knuckle down and get on kidhumour level our badguy takes shape in the form of rowan a lone creepy outsider just like the critics of this ghostbusters reboot funny that who wants to achieve ultimate power by creating a portal in the middle of manhattan and letting ghosts and monsters rule the streets please tell me youre still following the live action scooby doo vibes but the girls are hot on his tails with proton packs guns lasers and the iconic hearse van kicking off some wicked action sequences paired with some early 00s cgi monsters although ghostbusters doesnt move forward with the times in plot or special effects but thats why it works a homage to slime and goofy effects that riddled films in the 80s 90s and 00s its refreshing to see the return of the liveaction childrens film something silly and grand that isnt shrouded in the disney pixar canon and as a standalone film ghostbusters knows exactly what it is remake or not will it stand the test of time probably not but for now its a much needed break from endless animation whether you are a lover of cartoonish special effects or not its the comedic performances of the leads that drive the film chris hemsworths offbrand turn as kevin the receptionist is a harmonious highlight every last second hes on screen is milked within an inch of its life for laughs but pays off in an innocent and mildly flirtatious manner the decision to not push erins crush on kevin into romance territory was a fine move indeed however the usually sidesplittingly hilarious wiig and mccarthy are often left in the whirlwind of bigscreen newcomer and snl wizard kate mckinnons holtzmann whose whipfast quips pantomime facial expressions and impromptu dances shine through and are sure to land her a place on 2016s most popular halloween getups her slightly maddening jibes and eccentric personality take away some of the fun from wiig and mccarthys performances but not their credibility as leading ladies holtzmanns irrevocable coolness accumulates in the slickest scene of the film a long take showing her stomping through ghouls with her proton pack to the ghostbusters theme song with a precision and flair i can only pinpoint to the hallway fight scene in park chanwooks oldboy shes not the only cool cat of the bunch though leslie jones still manages to shine through though with her bubbly charm and cheshire cat grin though being the only woman of colour in the new lineup its sad that her role was diminished to a subway worker with no scientific or supernatural backgroundinterest even though her passion for the team is cemented the representation of black women in a scientific field would have been a welcome and progressive addition to the plot scientific jargon is used widely by the team obviously a lot of it made up for the purpose of the ghostbusters work and machinery but it was never explained what it meant during conversations as most science based films do using a lessintelligent member of the cast to open up that conversation in this case kevin whom nothing was explained to it was a brilliant little way to assert the girls knowledge and intelligence in a world where women are too used to explaining themselves its a feat to see such intelligent women on screen unapologetic in their vast knowledge and to encourage girls to work in stem fields to show them that they can be fighters but still be smart ghostbusters isnt a grand feminist statement and probably wont change attitudes to women on screen but its a perfect popcorn family film for all ages uniting the nostalgia buried within adults and the glossy wideeyed spectacle of the movies for kids its a sure fire hit for anyone wondering how to entertain their children this summer what feig has successfully done is put women in the centre of the picture in a male driven genre it doesnt display a super progressive cast or even a very intricate plot and that shouldnt matter its a kids movie its exciting and fun and scary and funny and for that 10 year old girl sat in the front row merely seeing those women up there is enough chloe leeson is the founder of screenqueens she is 20 and from the north of england the proper north she believes harmony korine is the future and is pretty sure she coined the term selfie central she doesnt like pina coladas or getting caught in the rain but she does like ezra miller a whole lot her favourite films are into the wild the beach and lords of dogtown but dont talk to her about paranormal activity she rants about cinema screenings kawaiigoff this was a great read thank you chloe i cant wait to finally see this film with my own eyes do you all ever share your work on any other film sites this blog is great would you be interested im a community manager here at moviepilotcom and would love to invite you all to share your writing with our fans
Aug 23 2018,positive,    was there ever a film so haunted by an original than ghostbusters from the time a reboot was announced with an allfemale cast of spectre hunters  pause here for munchian scream at the feminist cheek of it  anyone would think hollywood was planning to remake citizen kane with sock puppets     in reality apart from a cracking oscarnominated song the 1984 comedy directed by ivan reitman and starring bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and sigourney weaver had its flaws among them a third act that lasted almost as long as some have been waiting for the second coming if it wasnt for the song and the who you gonna call hookline the first ghostbusters hands up who even remembers the 1989 sequel might have been just another enjoyable enough comedy fondly remembered but nothing groundbreaking     paul feigs 2016 version hits the same mark it has some ace lines and some cracking performances but it is also irritatingly baggy unfocused and has a character so annoying i would rather wake to nosferatu than willingly submit to five more minutes in her company     the picture starts promisingly with a tour guide telling visitors about a haunted house from olden times that included a room where pt barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants feig the director of bridesmaids and the heat here writing as well as directing always gives good snark you can tell some of the lines have been polished till they gleam     the tour does not end well leaving the curator to seek the services of erin a physicist played by kristen wiig once a believer in ghosts now a respectable academic trying for tenure erin does not want the gig but fate hurls her together with her old ghosthunting partner abby melissa mccarthy who has never lost her faith in an afterlife these two are joined by patty leslie jones a subway worker looking for a new challenge and holtzmann a wacky inventor type played by kate mckinnon how wacky is this character phenomenally shes the team equivalent of the fast shows colin hunt the office joker complete with silly specs and nonstop girning some have found her one of the best things about the film  make your own mind up     there are predictably enough nods to the first film one or two work others are clunkers it might have been best to leave on the drawing board     far more successful than the cameos or the cliched inventor character is leslie jones a comic actor i would definitely want to see again she could carry a film on her own wiig and mccarthy already do that of course both graduates of bridesmaids they spark off each other like the old pros they are also worth mentioning in dispatches is chris hemsworth playing a nice but dim receptionist who could have come straight out of a diet coke advert when it comes to eye candy in ghostbusters hemsworth is it another winning touch of role reversal there from feig     the technical stuff the conjuring up of ghosts ghouls and ectoplasm is impressive reflecting the decades that have passed in special effects since the first film but what we have come for is the comedy and this ghostbusters is not quite enough of a blast compared to say mccarthy and feigs special agent spoof spy or wiigs weird but wonderful bleak comedy welcome to me a few great lines  and when they are good they are very good  do not a 116minute comedy make not even the practised sparring of wiig and mccarthy can disguise a shortage of jokes in the script riffs go on too long scenes are overextended and gags stretched thin and yes perhaps in some misguided homage to that first film the finale goes on forever and a day     we are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers who occasionally find their way onto our site to abuse our journalists and readers we also hope it will help the comments section fulfil its promise as a part of scotlands conversation with itself     we are making the subscriberonly change to support our valued readers who tell us they dont want the site cluttered up with irrelevant comments untruths and abuse 
Aug 22 2018,positive,ghostbusters is actually fun with callbacks to the original present without making itself out to be an exact copy it has its own brand of charm and is pretty entertaining for a summer flick
Aug 22 2018,positive, i so dont get the controversy over this film the 1984 original did indeed become iconic but its certainly ripe for a reboot after 32 years dont batman superman and spiderman get a little work done and then come back to plague us three or four times a decade this fresh take on a comedy classic starring some of the worlds greatest comediennes is at least something we havent seen before whats so wrong about letting the girls have a go at it theres absolutely nothing wrong with it as it turns out melissa mccarthy leslie jones kristen wiig and kate mckinnon are spot on choices to replace bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson as a quartet of manhattanbased paranormal investigators who arm themselves with whacky gadgets to combat the odd uptick in ghosts and ghoulies and things that go bump in the night the addition of chris hemsworth as their himbo receptionist is sheer genius now this is not to say that the 2016 version of ghostbusters is the perfect film i place the blame for that squarely on other shoulders of paul feig who directed and cowrote the script with katie dippold while feig was able to elicit razor sharp performances from the actors he took a charming and amusing first half then overstuffed the rest of the film with so many ray gun blasting special effects i felt like id stuck my finger in a light socket by the time it was through and while the stars all gave game performances they would have been better served with a sharper script that better defined their characters and dialogue many bits just trail off without the crisp punctuation of the original and the characters all have funny mannerisms that never quite gel into identifiable personalities but perhaps im expecting too much from the summers most anticipated popcorn flick according to a fandango moviegoers survey see it in 3d for stunning pop outs and just close your eyes when the ghost busting rays start to sizzle them ghostbusters is definitely night out worthy products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation
Jul 16 2018,positive, while it would have been nice to have seen the likes of peter venkman raymond stantz and winston zeddemore pass the baton to a new generation harold ramis death in 2014 would forever change the face of the franchise  never mind just how hard it is getting bill murray to sign on board for anything  with that out of the way lets discuss the film melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon are among four of the most talented women in comedy  bridesmaids director paul feig who penned the script with katie dippold is at the helm of the franchise update  what helps is that these folks are playing new characters and not trying to do their impressions of the originals  mccarthy and wiig may be comedic forces of nature but mckinnon brings her own quirkiness to the role while jones outright steals the show  its absolutely fun watching the four of them working together at the start of the film physicist erin gilbert wiig and parannormal expert abby yates mccarthy have been out of touch for a bit  the two wrote a book together but they became the laughingstock of the science community without having proof  by the time that erin reunites with abby jillian holtzmann mckinnon is helping out abby out as an engineer  while investigating activity in the subway they encounter and then recruit patty tolan jones to the team  pattys knowledge of new york plays to the teams advantage lets talk about kevin  chris hemsworth adds such a funny layer to the ghostbusters secretary kevin beckman  we already knew from thor ragnarok that there was a funny side to hemsworth  what he does in ghostbusters goes above and behind  improv isnt an easy skill to master but hemsworth is able to hold his own against talented improvisers  as a character kevins looks are able to offset his lack of a decent iq  oh he can dance too  oh can he ever revisiting the franchise some thirty years after the release means the technology gets a scientific upgrade  the proton packs arent the only things to get an update  a 198183 cadillac hearse replaces the 1959 cadillac ambulance to serve as the ecto1 listen im not a fan of reboots  what im not going to do however is bash a film because all four leads happen to be female  theres more to life than sexism and thats a fact  if people dont like this film solely because its an allfemale reboot thats on them  the question that i have to ask myself is this how does this film do on its own merits  the films spirit holds up to that of what we saw in 1984 one positive thing that comes from casting the four women in leading roles is that films like this can help when it comes to women working in stem  when young girls see women as scientists on screen they get inspired to go into those fields  whether this is something that filmmakers considered going into the film i dont know two years after the film was released in theaters paul feigs ghostbusters answer the call holds up just fine  its just a shame that the box office take wont allow us to see more of their stories danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
Jun 13 2018,positive,its goofy and stupid in a good way exactly as the original was
Apr 19 2018,negative,ghostbusters is a very uneven movie
Mar 21 2018,negative,part of the problem is that ghostbusters is so busy going through a karaokestyle reenactment of the original that these new paranormal exterminators have little time to stand on their own
Mar 7 2018,positive,its absolutely hilarious whip smart a whole lot of fun and certainly the best studio tentpole youll see this summer
Mar 7 2018,positive, after all the hype around an allfemale remake of a beloved dude franchise and the subsequent misogyny that hailed down on the trailer to make it the worstrated of all time  as if all the 900 xmen movie trailers are masterpieces  it began to feel like the fate of middleaged women in hollywood and the future of feminism and all potential earnings of my unborn daughters daughters were at stake with paul feigs ghostbusters reboot given that baggage i was hoping id love it and terrified of what it meant if i didnt would i have to justify myself to other women who felt i was hurting the cause would i be forced to shut down smug mens rights activists by explaining that i can be both be a feminist and someone who thinks ghostbusters is meh as a feminist there are few things less tedious than dissecting how feminist or unfeminist a piece of pop culture is ghostbusters now in theaters is not some savior of feminism but why does it have to be it was pretty funny selfaware and even subtly subversive at times theres a queef joke a nod to the whiny manchild youtube commenters who write things like aint no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts and it lampoons the ditzy secretary role women are forced to play by instead objectifying the very hunky chris hemsworth its a modern recast of the nerdy scifi drama injected with an undercurrent of female power  some critics like the hollywood reporters caryn james argued that ghostbusters isnt female enough and suffers from bland expository dialogue that doesnt adequately celebrate the richness of female friendships the economist posits that the film misses an opportunity with a movie meant as a seismic shift claiming its instead an enjoyably forgettable goofball of a film i get these criticisms part of me agrees with them if given an option between more personality or less in a film ill always go for more it wouldnt be fair to evaluate this movie without acknowledging that but if this movie falls short of creating a seismic shift id rather focus my concern on why its expected to in the first place why should this one movies critical and boxoffice success dictate the future of femalelead films given that major studios so far have zero female directors lined up for movies through 2018 that female actresses get paid less than their male counterparts as in other fields and middleaged women are considered past their prime while older men still have sex appeal it does feel like so much is riding on every prowoman movie book tv show or song but lets not fall into the trap of expecting perfection every time either this is a pretty fun movie that gets a lot right not a pathetic shell of a film that tries too hard or is tonedeaf or does a disservice to women the movie isnt making some declarative heavyhanded grandstanding statement about female strength or gender equality or the power of female friendship its not biting satire and it doesnt get emotionally deep or poignant its just showing some badass funny women being badass and funny on the screen which is in itself progressive even in 2016 in fact many male critics seemed unable to appreciate how significant and thrilling it was for women to simply to watch other women leading a blockbuster as the films screenwriter katie dippold told cosmopolitancom i grew up with so many movies where every movie was about someone trying to find their husband im constantly looking for more movies with camaraderie  letting people grow up watching movies where its not about chasing a husband  thats kind of been my whole mission perhaps thats not enough to start a seismic shift but i bet you more than a few girls will watch this movie and get excited about science and action movies and thats still something 
Mar 6 2018,positive,feel free to take a walk down memory lane with the ghostbusting girls confident that they havent committed any major sacrilege against your fondest cinematic memories just know they havent done anything to add to them either
Feb 26 2018,positive,after all the argumentsheres the thing about the ghostbusters movie it is without a doubt average all that argument a waste of time
Jan 23 2018,negative,if you were to chug five gallons of ecto cooler and then throw it up that would be better than the new ghostbusters movie
Dec 5 2017,negative, following a ghost invasion of manhattan paranormal enthusiasts erin gilbert and abby yates nuclear engineer jillian holtzmann and subway worker patty tolan band together to stop the otherworldly threat it is completely ridiculous that the gender politics controversy surrounding paul feigs spy the heat and bridesmaids ghostbusters reboot has spiraled out of control to the point where i must begin my review by saying up front that while i do not particularly think this film is great i am not misogynistic or sexist some of my most highly praised movies of last year here starred women brie larson gave the best acting achievement of 2015 in the emotionally charged room emily blunt was a strong presence in the narcotics thriller sicario and i even enjoyed melissa mccarthy in last years action comedy spy furthermore some of the best movies of all time future women being complete badasses whether it be sigourney weaver in aliens or linda hamilton in terminator 2 judgment day i also very enjoy watching this little show you probably have never heard of called game of thrones and yes emilia clarke and her dragons are a powerhouse spectacle to behold with all of this preamble out of the way ghostbusters is admittedly definitely not the dumpster fire disaster most expected it would be going into it based on the horrendous trailers for starters it was immediately refreshing knowing that patty leslie jones is not just a onenote stereotypical loudmouth black woman but a loudmouth black woman that contributes to the group with a working knowledge of the subway system and some interesting history of various old buildings around manhattan is her character great no there is practically no character development at all but it could have been so much worse speaking of characters that is the primary flaw with this new take on ghostbusters of the four women only erin kristen wiig actually feels like a person that has motivations a backstory and some sort of transformation throughout the proceedings of the film even though it isnt explored to the amount of length necessary if it was a certain part during the final battle would have felt a lot more emotional instead of par for the course in hollywood blockbusters it is something while the other three ladies basically get nothing we know abby melissa mccarthy is a childhood friend of erin and even less about the characters played by kate mckinnon and leslie jones kate mckinnon in particular gives one of the most obnoxious performances of the year going way too far over the top with her bizarre and abnormal personality she is constantly making strange facial expressions talking with far too much annoyingly complicated paranormal technical jargon that probably makes no sense and is the literal definition of photobombing an entire movie early on the girls spot their first ghost to which the camera cuts to kate mckinnon randomly eating from a can of pringles on one hand it is just very stupid product placement from sony and on the other hand you are just left screaming inside your head mentally wondering why she is eating chips and wondering where she even got them from in a span of five seconds none of this is meant to be a knock on the acting capabilities of kate mckinnon because i dont think she is necessarily to blame at all the first few times she acts weird is most definitely endearing and it is evident that she knows how to portray the thin character she is given but the script and possible impromptu nature of shooting accidentally goes overboard when less would have been more from this performance however for all the bashing i kind of just did i will admit that she has by far the most entertaining action sequence of the movie also this will come as a surprise to literally no one but melissa mccarthy essentially plays melissa mccarthy she yells a lot talks back to everyone she comes in contact with complains about her fast food orders and somewhat feels out of place to be fair everyone feels somewhat out of place considering all of the characters are so wildly different from one another that they never really come together in a way that gives them chemistry as a cohesive unit now lets get to the other heavy flaw which is the fact that the dimwitted receptionist played by chris hemsworth that the women hire its also worth noting that they do this just because of his good looks and beefed up body full of muscle steals the show and yes i am aware that the very thought of that is going to send in the misogynistic hate brigade but i dont care because some of his lines are so stupid and brilliantly delivered that he made me laugh more than anything in the movie he also actually has more chemistry with the ghostbusters than the actual ghostbusters do with each other anyway the special effects and designs of the ghosts are a bit of an uninspired mess and not particularly engaging to look at it is nice that the colors chosen are typically bright but the designs themselves are lacking not necessarily coming across as imaginative or even somewhat frightening as some of the apparitions in the original film its all just kind of there and not even a cameo from slimer is enough to make their presence fun what i will say is that i actually didnt mind the idea for the final entity to defeat however the actual villain of the movie is a complete waste of time and one of the most unmemorable villains of the year i almost wish the movie didnt even have a villain and just featured horribly rendered ghosts many of the citywide largescale battles also contain numerous composition shots depicting greenscreen plain in sight but it is somewhat forgivable considering that director paul feig isnt really experienced yet with handling special effects heavy blockbusters of this caliber ghostbusters also does not contain a great deal of misandry at all if there was one fear more terrifying than the rest going into the movie it is that it was actually going to be two hours of jokes hating on and degrading men for no real reason other than the social justice warrior craze that fuels the internet today the truth is that the presentation and characters here are more about female empowerment rather than sticking it to the man yes men in the movie are either ridiculously stupid or holding the women back but it feels more like coincidence than done solely to anger men i still however do believe that an intergender team would have been most interesting what does mitigate ghostbusters from being flatout terrible is that although structurally the narrative is a mess and it doesnt really feel like a ghostbusters movie paul feig has a decent handle on comedy so if nothing else the movie is a decent experience in the style of humor you would expect from him there are quite a few funny moments and hilarious pieces of dialogue but unfortunately none of it comes together to form a movie that makes this a worthy franchise reboot

Oct 20 2017,positive, so a mere 32 years after the hugely popular original and 27 years after the inevitable sequel the third ghostbusters film arrives and as you may already have noticed its very much a case of all change  out go the original male characters  a decision brought about largely by the death in 2014 of harold ramis cowriter and costar of the first two films  and in comes a new allfemale ghosthunting gang led by bridesmaids stars melissa mccarthy and kristen wiig  and very good fun too with director paul feig who with bridesmaids the heat and spy under his belt is the comedy filmmaker of the moment  look out too for annie potts who played janine the ghostbusters lippy receptionist in the original films and who returns as a lippy hotel receptionist i can happily report that sigourneys here too although youll wait virtually the entire film to discover that and if youre anything like me come out wishing wed seen more of her  and sooner  nor is ramis forgotten his son daniel plays a small cameo and my teenage son assures me he spotted a bust to dr egon spengler the character ramis played in the offices of the ramshackle research institute where two of our future ghostbusters  abby mccarthy a lifelong believer in all things paranormal and jillian kate mckinnon a brilliant but eccentric engineer  both work shes a lecturer in conventional physics at a new york university and desperate to get a tenure so when she discovers that a book on the paranormal that she wrote  with abby  in her impressionable youth is being promoted and sold online she fears professional humiliation  very soon all three of them are out of jobs  just as the original trio were in the first film  and looking for something new to do ray parker jrs ghostbusters hit song nearly won an oscar for best song at the 1984 academy awards but it was beaten by stevie wonders i just called to say i love you premises are sought oh look a strippers pole exclaims abby as they consider an old fire station another tribute to the original and transport is obtained this time an old hearse rather than an ambulance  shes a very funny woman but feig who cowrote the screenplay with katie dippold really should have given her something more original to work with than what she has here this may be a film that empowers women and laughs in the face of internet bigotry  listen out as one online comment aint no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts is shockingly quoted  but im not sure it does a lot to challenge racial stereotypes presumably as some sort of response to the predatory sexism employed by murrays character in the original our female foursome recruit a dumb blond male australian gamely played by thor star chris hemsworth to be their receptionist  youre hired shouts erin as soon as she lays eyes on his hunky gorgeousness at the beginning of a scene that starts brightly but  like one or two other moments  eventually goes on too long dont get me wrong theres more than enough lightweight fun here to keep a summer audience entertained and feig dippold and their talented cast deliver some very funny lines  but the basic ghostbusters template is familiar as is the central story of an insecure but brilliant nerd who wants to bring back new yorks dead mccarthy  mostly playing nice rather than her customary nasty  seems to have been under instructions to dial it all down a bit too mccarthys used to being the star but here its mckinnon who wont be wellknown to most british audiences who catches the eye with a performance as odd as murrays was three decades ago but nothing like as creepy  amazingly it is now 14 years since the strange squirrellike creature that we would come to know as scrat made me cry with laughter with his futile cataclysminducing attempts to bury his beloved acorn at the beginning of the first  and best  ice age film  as ice age collision course  the fifth film in the series  limped towards its halfway mark it occurred to me that scrat is the only thing still funny in a franchise now a good millennium or two past its sellby date  how jupiter got its red spot saturn its rings and mars lost its water theyre all down to scrat who having inadvertently tumbled into an alien flying saucer zooms around the cosmos in pursuit of that acorn causing galactic chaos as he goes the asteroid belt is his fault too and so is the huge meteor now heading towards earth threatening the strange and decidedly unscientific mix of dinosaurs and mammals that has been the creative bedrock of the ice age films  yes manny voiced by ray romano and the rest of the mammoth gang together with sid the sloth john leguizamo and diego the sabretooth tiger denis leary all face mass extinction which is distinctly bad timing as mannys beloved daughter peaches keke palmer is about to get married the story jumps all over the place the screenplay is festooned with modern american colloquialisms and just when you think it couldnt get any worse up pops simon pegg voicing the englishaccented weasel buck and being even more annoying than his american counterparts  jesse j contributes an equally charmless late cameo as a youthful sloth beauty be still sids beating heart ensuring that the latest  and i sincerely hope  last ice age film goes down as a transatlantic disaster you can see the sort of thriller that precious cargo wanted to be what with its basic setup of two thieves  one goodlooking and male the other inevitably beautiful and female  who cant decide whether they love each other or hate each other and are basically only happy when theyre stealing  but so many things go wrong in the execution of this not unpromising idea that the end result is as unimpressive as it is unlikeable television regular markpaul gosselaar think of a cross between ryan reynolds and keanu reeves plays jack whos trying to build a new life of crime without the dangerous love of his life karen claire forlani  and then karen doublecrosses a dangerous mr big bruce willis and suddenly shes in desperate need of jacks help  first simply to keep her alive and then to pull off the only heist that can get her out of this mess 
Oct 10 2017,positive,the sense of fun remains strong throughout even as the movie falls down a bit at the end everyone is obviously having a ball and its tremendous fun watching these four women together
Sep 26 2017,positive, landing the plum assignment of rebooting ghostbusters the writerdirector realized that he was dealing with a product that a lot of fans held dear it was up to him to find a way to revive the franchise in a way that respected the original without slavishly remaking it and he succeeded admirably borrowing just enough from the 1984 film written by dan aykroyd and harold ramis and twisting the elements in clever ways to prove that the line of succession was peaceable he enlisted cameos from every major member of the original cast sans the late ramis and rick moranis who left acting 20 years ago of course anytime a movie gets remade there s going to be some griping about it from the fanboys but the level of bile that was directed at this one was way off the meter earlier this week the imdbcom rating was  39 thats before it was even released usually just the opposite is true prerelease ratings tend to be high because the only ones casting votes are fans who cant wait to see it why all the hate you can try reading the comments on imdb and other sites if you have the time and the inclination but while most of the aggrieved deny it it probably comes down to this girl ghostbusters thats right feig and the films producers had the temerity to cast the story with four female leads was that stunt casting maybe but if so it was smart could you put together a male ensemble these days that would guarantee any kind of opening box office and generate enough chemistry to keep viewers coming back for sequels doubtful feig cast kirsten wiig and melissa mccarthy whom he has worked with before on bridesmaids spy and the heat all substantial hits to round out the quartet he added snl players leslie jones and kate mckinnon who are arguably the best things about the movie its hard to believe that so many people could get so upset by something as trivial as this then again its hard to believe that so many people are so invested in what was a secondrate movie in the first place one that skated along entirely on a combination of bill murrays snarky persona which by 1984 was already wearing thin and some flashy for the time special effects second for second the music video for ray parker jrs title song was more entertaining than the film is the new ghostbusters a masterpiece of film comedy no but i have no problem saying that its better than the original its sloppy and doesnt do enough to work wiig and mccarthy into their roles but its genial fun throughout it has a fair number of jokes based on rude bodily functions true but there are just as many that zip right past i laughed at the very first bit of dialogue a tour guides description of a 19th century manhattan mansion that had such contemporary luxuries as a face bidet and an antiirish security fence i love chris hemsworths explanation of why his eyeglasses have no lenses as what seinfeld once called a mimbo he steals most of his scenes which is probably why most of a hilarious sequence in which he leads hundreds of zombified new yorkers in a dance was consigned to the end credits and while it may pass most viewers by hardcore gothamphiles will get a kick out of the climactic sequences use of longgone times square landmarks like the rko national theater feig who ought to be revered by fanboys as the creator of the tv show freaks and geeks gets the last laugh on his detractors in a scene where one of the busters is looking up something on the internet she is advised to ignore the comments section you shouldnt read what crazy people write online in the middle of the night good advice
Sep 26 2017,negative, easily angered denizens of the internet especially those of you clinging to the 1984 ghostbusters as though its the new and improved dianetics and youre all the second coming of l ron hubbard  youve been had all that huffing and puffing and moaning about how one of your classics was being ruined with the addition of girls because everyone knows girls have cooties like duh ok and it all turned out  fine thats it the new ghostbusters from paul feig starring melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon and leslie jones is perfectly fine it is very much a paul feig movie not his best but bearing all the signature trademarks weve come to expect from him but before we get further into that a word about jones our worries about her about the way she would be used were overblown frankly the leslie jones who appears in ghostbusters isnt all that different from the leslie jones who appears in top five which like ghostbusters is also set in new york the most cringeinducing aspects of jones performance have already been revealed in the movies trailers and when consumed in context with her costars im inclined to shrug my shoulders maybe ive just been worn down but at this point my sentiments regarding jones amount to get money leslie get money jones is a sixfoot tall 42yearold darkskinned black woman in one of the biggest films of the summer she inspires the deepest of rep sweats but we still need her to win feig is best known as the director of bridesmaids the 2011 film written by wiig and annie mumolo that arrived at the perfect time to send up the wedding industrial complex by illustrating what it does to friendships across class boundaries it launched mccarthys career as a movie star and although bridesmaids was wildly successful mccarthy initially faced the same issue jones recently publicized on twitter in june no one would make a dress for her for the 2012 oscars mccarthy and feig went on to team up on the heat and spy class and female friendship are the two consistent through lines in feigs films mccarthy plays underdogs or workingclass heroes who have been overlooked in the heat she constantly gives sandra bullocks character a hard time for being too soft and mccarthy takes bullock to visit her workingclass family in south boston in spy mccarthy plays a secret agent who finally gets her chance to do field work because no one else is available her cover designed by her colleagues is that shes a shlumpadinka american cat lady with hemorrhoid pads and stool softener in her purse so its understandable that feig who grew up in a workingclass suburb of detroit would want to do with jones what hes done with mccarthy and make her a workingclass hero too patty is an mta agent who sees a ghost and wants to join mckinnon mccarthy and wiig who all play scientists feig could have arguably been more sensitive about how race affects our interpretations of class but jones mckinnon mccarthy and wiig all feel like previous versions of themselves that weve seen either in other movies or on saturday night live abby mccarthy is earnest and determined and jokes about food wiig uncomfortably babbles around kevin the office sex idiot played by chris hemsworth the gunlicking jillian god bless her is a glorious parade of mckinnons freakiest saturday night live affectations and theres nothing unexpected from jones either there is some injustice to the fact that in a movie built on girl power hemsworth has most of the best lines if anything the girl power aspect of ghostbusters is what does it in if only because youre left wishing feig had leaned into it even more the second act is a bit wishywashy and unfocused it suffers from a lack of clarity around its villain rowan neil casey a wouldbe typical misogynist that the film for reasons unknown simply doesnt want to identify as such when we finally come to understand rowans motivations for wanting to destroy new york by opening up a catastrophic ghost vortex it mainly boils down to him being a crazed misanthrope instead of making it obvious the movie hints at the fact that rowan is the type who hangs out around mens rights activist forums  he envies kevins body and the attention it gets he becomes a giant menacing white blob clobbering the buildings of new york with his own ghostly weapon of mass destruction its always the sad pale ones abby quips frankly if youre going to make a new ghostbusters with a female foursome as the leads and youre facing a backlash from clanging dungeons of the womanhating internet it seems like it would make for an epic opportunity to troll them and yet this is where ghostbusters lacks its bite there are some attempts to work the gender controversy surrounding ghostbusters into the script just about everyone standing in the way of the ghostbusters except for cecily strongs character is a man at one point patty is reading comments under a video the group has posted on the internet because theyre mostly positive picking the first one she ends up reading aloud aint no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts from the moment it was announced the conversation around ghostbusters has been followed by a cloud of sexism which was obviously unfair it was always going to be a difficult task to separate the movie from its politics which is why it probably would have been a better choice to simply face them head on with zero ambiguity instead where ghostbusters  a perfectly serviceable summer comedy  falters is that its simply too polite soraya nadia mcdonald is the senior

Sep 15 2017,positive,like bill murray and dan ackroyd before them kristin wiig and melissa mccarthy have rightfully earned their place as comedic icons of this generation
Sep 12 2017,positive, in the buildup toward the release of the reboot of 1984s ghostbusters much has been made about the decision to go with an allfemale cast that buzz reached fever pitch once paul feig became the director known for his breakaway hit bridesmaids which deftly showcased the comedic charms and dramatic potential of kristen wiig maya rudolph rose byrne and the oscarnominated melissa mccarthy he seemed to be the perfect choice and his continued collaborations with mccarthy the heat and spy have been among her better projects during her postbridesmaids stretch run  but in the prerelease phase the reboot ran into a brandingmarketing dilemma that haunts all such projects  nostalgia for the original how could anyone ever dare to replace the sheer lunatic genius of bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson  so lets get to the nitty gritty does feigs ghostbusters put all the naysayers in their place by addressing the notion that women can in fact be funny as with most critical discussions complexity prevents me from delivering a definitive answer feig penned the screenplay with katie dippold who scripted the heat and it is plain to see that they adored everything about the original because they have crafted a devoted homage to it that is not to say that they have presented audiences with the kind of shotforshot recreation gus van sant did with his version of psycho but like most reboots of the day this ghostbusters could be labeled a thoroughly modern update and as such it would have been far more intriguing if feig and dippold had directly addressed the topicality of their ghostbusters facing a world where they are being dismissed not simply for their research into the paranormal realm but also because they are women a gag or two that hint at casual sexism drift into the mix but they are casperlike sightings lost in the behemoth of the broader jokes and torrential downpour of special effects raining all over the screen in the finale  where the film succeeds though is with its talented cast wiig and mccarthy  as erin gilbert and abby yates the primary dynamic duo of paranormal science  solidly anchor the narrative feig provides a degree of comfort for them to settle into an ongoing banter that while sometimes hilarious also allows for characters to show some heart their work here doesnt break new ground for either performer but it offers recognizable humanity that at least for me was missing in the breezy comic interplay of the original the real star is mckinnon as engineering genius jillian holtzmann the tech specialist who develops all of the gear used by the team from the first moment she appears onscreen mckinnon becomes the definitive scenestealer inhabiting both the character and each frame of film shes in as if the movie was always supposed to be hers she portrays a pansexual imp the mxyzptlk to reference a superman character in this world of ghostfighting superwomen truth be told mckinnon is this universes hybrid of marvel comics tony stark the quiphappy tech savant of iron man and starlord the roguishly sexy member of guardians of the galaxy and marvel would be wise to take note of her
Aug 29 2017,positive,ghostbusters as directed by paul feig and written by him and katie dippold is not about plot but about seeing how the actors interact with each other and the special effects
Aug 28 2017,positive, decades from now sociologists will study the ghostbusters wars theyll try to reconstruct the events that led to internet campaigns downvote brigades twitter abuse and the publication of thousands of articles both condemning and defending a fluffy and funny movie months before anyone had even seen it they might wonder if this crisis was sparked by a specific moment in american history was it the surreal and overlong primary season that precipitated this depth of feeling or the feeble economy or the grim progression of mass shootings the demonization of sugar but the ghostbusters wars actually cant be about any of these things not just because were a frivolous people but because movies  unlike television  are glacially slow responders to the pressures of the present case in point the tom hanks vehicle sully is coming out a full seven years after chesley sullenberger landed us airways flight 1549 in the hudson river movies lumber theyre accidental time capsules for the halfdecade we left behind thats their power but also their problem heres what really happened the ghostbusters remake released friday after months of controversy got caught at the unpleasant intersection of two ley lines in the culture wars one is the giant backlash against the feminist pressure that made the movie possible in the first place its a backlash that shares a lot of dna with the gamergate movement but theres more to it while gamers vs feminists might constitute the immediate backdrop to the ghostbusters wars the movie is fighting a bigger demon the angst of a generation obsessed with its own nostalgic ghosts remakes themselves are ghostbusters they make consumers of the product theyre supplanting anxious if youre old enough to have experienced the original what any remake communicates is that your pleasure  your sense of fun  is literally incomprehensible to a new generation it needs to be translated worse it needs to be updated tuned to the present clime remakes dont just measure our age then they measure the distance the culture has drifted from a phenomenon with which we once connected if someone copies a film we value and improves it by introducing differences we interpret as morally corrective we bristle this is especially true among the demographic whose nostalgia has been most frenetically catered to this demographic doesnt respond well to feeling old and left behind and preached at the whole thing leaves a sour taste such a demographic might get defensive and describe an enjoyable but extremely silly and pretty incoherent movie from the 80s that they liked when they were kids using overblown terms like classic or gamechanger indeed critics of the new ghostbusters movie had a hard time talking about a film they hadnt seen without talking about how the original defined their childhoods whats good for the goose is good for the gander so heres what it meant to me not much as a girlkid in the 80s i loved slimer and the proton packs and the logo and the staypuft marshmallow man that was it the ghostbusters were boring except winston  i liked winston i remember vaguely envying the messy dirty fun the fellas got to have but i didnt find them that funny maybe their humor didnt feel available to me in any event it seemed clear that our funstreams could never cross but ive also discovered my memory of the original had some gaps while preparing to write about this remake i mentioned to my partner that one thing i liked about the original ghostbusters was how little it mattered that the four principals were guys gender isnt important to the plot i said swapping to women would be simple he stared at me and suggested i rewatch the original i did and wow it is a much more symbolically dudely text than i recalled bill murray creeps on college coeds asks the librarian if shes menstruating and his best insult to the epa guy is that he has no penis plus those nozzles on the proton packs are certainly suggestive and some of the ghosts are downright pornographic still its a fun film rewatching it in these acrimonious times i appreciated how secondary ghostbusters sexism felt to its playfulness shooting ghosts by peeing on them together yeah the ghostbusters didnt hate women at all they just didnt have much use for them unless it was for flirting or weapontesting their jouissance was untainted by the fury that animates gamergatetypes for whom this version of masculine innocence is no longer available theres a beauty to that to guys from the 80s untroubled by feminist complaints who get to playhunt and make jokes and pee at ghosts together it helped that the ghosts barely registered as a threat up until the very end the ghostbusters were getting the glory of firefighters for being the spectral equivalent of dogcatchers you could be goofy and stupid and funny and hailed as a hero awesome no 2016 remake could reproduce all of these conditions especially not with women the level of security you need to feel to be your loopiest most playful self isnt often afforded to women in film or tv shows like gilmore girls and murder she wrote are notable and interesting exceptions nor frankly is the absence of anger given the hurricane of abuse critics hurled at everyone involved in the allwomen ghostbusters following its announcement it was hard to imagine a version of the film that wouldnt be at least a little angry so ill admit it i was worried i feared the remake wouldnt be able to capture that magic mix of ebullience and deadpan ease that made the original so fun it had to overcome a lot of stuff the original wasnt burdened with but it did the new ghostbusters is absolutely faithful to the originals drunk sense of joyful play thanks mostly to kate mckinnons dementedly brilliant holtzman and leslie jones charisma as patty there arent as many body jokes but there are some the movie also manages to sustain this humor while addressing some ways in which the world might work differently for female ghostbusters the foursome is never embraced by the city the way their male ancestors were instead theyre repeatedly humiliated and discredited by the mayor who takes public credit for their work the film nods early and often to its trolls with references to youtube and reddit its an amazingly apt adaptation that i think improves on its sourcetext from the aesthetics whoever designed the ghosts worked extremely hard to match the 80sera phantasms using modern technology to an absolutely brilliant appropriation of the gb logo the movie rollicks around the originals stomping grounds but it never stomps its a loving tribute as far as anger goes in melissa mccarthys hands even the films more pointed jabs are made with a matteroffact ease it will be interesting to see how the ghostbusters wars develop  whether the people who so deeply resented the concept will keep raging after seeing the thing itself they may the

ultimately of melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon the other half of these proud paranoiacs whose religious tenets dictate that no women should be allowed near a reboot wrote it off more viciously the second the movies first trailer appeared online it wasnt much of a trailer as many men and women have conceded too much noise not enough funny now we have the movie itself which remains an apocalyptic threat to an untold number of easily shattered adolescent male childhoods all grown up yet eternally young and stupid in spirit over the weekend ghostbusters made a respectablebutnotgreat 46 million it could still break even depending on what sort of dent it makes overseas but it cost a lot nearly 150 million after rebates and incentives applied to the production budget and thats not counting the marketing and advertising that money is one of its problems even those who enjoy ghostbusters and there are plenty of women and plenty of men dont find much to like about the final third when the visual effects  expensive in execution subscoobydoo in conception  sit on the thing the way the zombie ghost of the stay puft marshmallow man parks it on the heroines in one of the better sight gags of the picture honestly any fullon pans of the new ghostbusters are wasting their vitriol enough of the throwaway hitandrun jokes both visual and verbal connect to prevent the movie from stalling completely i also dont get the higherend praise sticking too closely to the ramshackle original which ill leave others to call a classic the reboot carries a dutiful quality this is where the money gets in the way a cheaper movie with the same cast and the same director had a better chance of developing something truly new or newold everything good the new ghostbusters has to do with gender beginning and ending with mckinnon and everything bad about it has nothing to do with gender its size its overreliance on visual effects unspiced by wit as jillian holtzmann the impishly lascivious ghostbuster with the yellowtinted goggles and a comeon for every woman and a man or two within quickwitted earshot mckinnon kills some of its overkill her reaction shots and takes are bigger than kabuki sometimes and often you watch her because shes simply doing so much more than her costars but theres real invention in her freefloating characterization shes the special effect in ghostbusters over the weekend the gender lines were drawn in the sand males and over25yearolds gave the film an uninspiring b exit score in the cinemascore polling where bs are more like cs and often spell financial trouble but on a typical facebook feed there were merry accounts of moms taking their daughters and sons to the movie as an act of solidarity mckinnon operates in the new ghostbusters the way bill murray operated in the old one shes cooking up little side dishes of commentary where and when she can without mckinnon or murray the ghostbusters movies wouldnt be much the fact that the 84 version became a phenom is as strange really as the 2016 version becoming a war between idiot men and all kinds of women
Aug 15 2017,negative,  thanks for reading the tyee today  we hope this article added to your day in some way our team of independent journalists takes pride in doing indepth reporting and taking time to get it right   were able to focus our attention on publishing impactful journalism in the public interest and publish it for free for all to read because we have the support of tyee builders tyee builders are readers who contribute a bit of money  at a level and frequency of their choice  to support our editorial budget   this core of supporters  making up about 1 to 2 per cent of our daily readership  enables us to pay our writers keep our articles free and open to all and not bombard our readers with annoying ads while you try to read   instead of focusing on what kind of articles will attract the most advertising dollars we can spend time devoted to researching and writing stories that our readers find most valuable and make the most positive impact in our region   you made it all the way through the article  i hope that means you liked it or if not liked it gleaned some useful information from it tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work   listen ill get to the point  the article you just read was made possible because our nonprofit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it and we can only afford to do that because of our business model which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called tyee builders   the traditional business model for journalism in canada has been completely disrupted and were witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications lay people off and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy and it doesnt help that tech giant meta has blocked canadian news on their facebook and instagram platforms   between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit the tyee contribute financially but amazingly that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget and it means we can operate without a paywall too 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality factbased journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in bc alberta and across canada we think thats pretty remarkable  the good news is that the remake of ghostbusters isnt terrible its heart is in the right place and its winning enough that one can be occasionally bemused if not genuinely amused although i could count the number of real laughs on the fingers of one hand it was better than i expected it to be which is not to say that its actually any good the new estrogenlaced version of ghostbusters is pretty much the same as the original the testosterone version lets call it its vaguely entertaining with a few good lines and some comedic interplay from four funny people put another way the first film had outies and the new film has innies but other than that there isnt too much difference if thats enough for people thats fine but for all the sturm und drang that precipitated the film i was hoping for something slightly more interesting but before we get to the business of understanding why the film is vaguely disappointing lets deal with the story itself kristen wiig plays erin gilbert an uptight academic on track for tenure at princeton awkward and stiff erin is the kind of woman who wears the worlds smallest bowtie and often seems caught and strangled in her horrible tweedy suit but there is more to erin than a boring haircut and a beigebrown straightjacket with a peplum skirt when her past comes back to haunt her in the form of a book on the supernatural penned with a former friend and colleague named abby yates melissa mccarthy the wheels creak into motion unlike erin who has tried to go straight abby is still plugging away on their onceshared passion for ghosts in a somewhat dodgy academic institution abby and a fellow scientist named jillian holtzman kate mckinnon are bent on finding ways to prove the existence of another spookier realm erin wants abby to bury the book as it threatens her chance to go legit but abby is not interested things like failed friendships betrayed loyalty and complex emotions are sketched out but before you can say ugh squishy lady feelings the women get the call that there has been a scoobydoo type visitation at an old museum it only takes one encounter with a miasmic entity and erin is sucked back into the life covered with green goo and screaming ghosts are real into a camera lens after the video of her ectoplasmic session is splashed all over the internet the trio is drummed out of the hallowed hoary halls of academia since no one has a real job any longer they decide to start a business dubbed the department of metaphysical examination atop a chinese restaurant as one does a transit worker named patty tolan leslie jones who has endured her own mysterious encounter in the new york subway system is their first client because she comes with encyclopedic knowledge of old new york and a handydandy hearse patty is made a full member of the team add in a mancandy receptionist named kevin the toothsome chris hemsworth and a nasty mens rights advocate named rowan north neil casey and were all set rowans evil plan is to unleash a vortex of hell free the undead and set them loose in nyc to tip over postal boxes refuse to pay subway fare and generally cause a ruckus bring on the ghosts with the most and that is precisely what happens with few big surprises mccarthy and wiig pretty much reprise the roles of bill murray and dan aykroyd like the original film a person of colour is added to provide some street cred at least leslie jones unlike ernie hudson before her gets to be a fully functioning member of the team but the comedic timing of the four leads in particular mccarthy and wiig clumps along when it ought to jazz riff the filmmaking itself is also weirdly offrhythm some scenes end so abruptly its like they were chopped off with a knife others linger so long that i was tempted to have a quick kip one must also endure the requisite corny cameos which are almost universally unfunny they are trotted out like a medley of golden oldies an aykroyd here a murray there a few jokes land but most just kind of float along strangely enough the film almost succeeds by trying too hard being super chipper and goodspirited now aint that just like a woman except that director paul feig is still sporting a penis apparently my hopes for mr feig have dwindled with each subsequent film that he has made bridesmaids was plenty of fun but the heat spy horrific and now ghostbusters have been mostly a series of diminishing returns is there any more to be said than that not really it is curious to read some of the early reviews of the film you can almost see critics shrugging as they write their pieces there was a minor kerfuffle over early scores on imdb from dudes giving the film low marks before it had even been released in contrast women have organized screening parties to fight back and give the film a strong opening weekend overall the critical consensus has been quite gentle even the strongest critiques have little more to say than the film is repackaged nostalgia with a feminist twist so marketed and pretested that no one could really get their panties in a twist who cares really other than a few trolls who live with their mothers under a bridge the film gives the trolling types some comeuppance with a few pointed jokes each of the actresses is allowed to strut their stuff although it must be said that kate mckinnon tucks the film in her back pocket and easily strolls away with it as holtzmann a gogglewearing vaguely androgynous science nerd with more than a dash of gunslinger mckinnon seems like she is operating on a different plane from the other women she channels unusual comedic rhythms and plays with the beat of jokes so that they never land quite where you would expect she also owns the only genuinely exciting scene in the entire film during the final climactic showdown holtzmann deploys a battery of whizzy new gizmos and coolio weapons she has designed against an army of the undead she also gets the best lines to wit safety lights are for dudes certainly it is nice to see women be heroes i just wish the film had a few more of these more innovative moments the entrance of something original instead of regurgitated provides a glimmer of hope but it doesnt last long the film lapses back into a lukewarm pudding of warmedup jokes and tired plot tropes and one goes back to sleep both metaphorically and figuratively speaking this something that i have come to think of as the star wars feeling that sense of watching two films simultaneously the remembered version and the newest iteration together they create some strange form of cognitive dissonance where everything that was once new is seen again through the lens of nostalgia which softens and warps but if i had to pick one thing about the film that is most depressing it is that it plays it so safe it is careful not to be too offensive or too feminist or too much of anything really its a nice girl movie and somehow that makes it weirdly defeatist in that girl powerspice lady way of taking something that was once radical terrifying and revolutionary and pulling its fangs out so that it can only gum you is that too much like a woman to complain when you get the thing you supposedly want like so much of contemporary culture the drama that surrounds a thing often obscures and inflates what is essentially something simple and often kind of dumb think chewbacca mom or whatever current internet meme has snagged the collective attention of the populace we bat at the new shiny thing for a while and then we get bored and move on yes there were some squeaks and squawks about people well men having their childhoods destroyed by an allfemale ghostbusters crew but as a wise woman once said people forget that the original film was just another stupid 80s bill murray comedy leave it to one of the dudes exiting the theatre where i saw the film to sum it up as the backwardsbaseballcapwearing male remarked to his buddy i thought this movie was gonna suck but it kicked ass i cant

Aug 14 2017,positive,i really hope for a sequel one that can break free of the original which will remain glorious and magical forever in its own right and give these women a chance to speak and stretch and breathe on their own
Aug 14 2017,positive, at the beginning of the 1989 film ghostbusters 2 we find our heroes  as you do in the first act of a sequel  disgraced in just five short years the droll scientist peter venkman bill murray has somehow gone from saving his entire city from a king kongsized anthropomorphic marshmallow to hosting a lowrent public access tv show called world of the psychic the subject of that evenings episode the apocalypse one of the guests is a mousy woman named elaine who claims to have gleaned some valuable information regarding this topic from an alien she met at the bar of the paramus holiday inn according to my source she tells venkman the end of the world will be on feb 14 in the year 2016 ask some youtube commenters and theyll tell you she was only off by a month on march 3 of that infernal year you know this one the first trailer for the ghostbusters reboot was released perhaps youve heard something about the films controversial casting all the main characters are played by convicted mass murderers haha no im kidding  theyre just women but  thanks in large part to an organized group of haters with a particularly phallic axe to grind  the clip quickly became the most disliked trailer in the history of youtube nearly a million thumbs down and counting plenty thought the reaction had to do with misogyny others said the trailer just wasnt that funny ivan reitman the director of the first two ghostbusters movies and an executive producer on the reboot said the backlash had more to do with nostalgia than sexism i think theres way too much talk about gender he told mashable last month i think that many of the people who were complaining were actually lovers of the original movie not haters of women still ghostbusters which for purely copyediting purposes i really wish had been given a silly fast and furiousstyle title like 3ghost 3bust3rs cannot resist poking some metafun at these trolls about 20 minutes into the film when a video of the ghostbusters goes viral straightlaced columbia professor dr erin gilbert kristen wiig makes the mistake of reading the comments aint no bitches be busting ghosts her childhood friend and fellow paranormal expert abby yates melissa mccarthy tells her not to pay attention to all the chatter  after all they have a job to do there are a few more injokes like this if you make a point to listen for them but they do not overwhelm the movie wokebusters this is not  and that is often a good thing toward the end the films resident himbo an actually very funny chris hemsworth makes a joke along the lines of women theyre never on time amirite it was only then that i realized how completely devoid of this kind of lazy genderstereotyped humor the film had been to that point and anyway when he delivers that line his body has been seized by a demonic spirit so we are to forgive him for momentarily going a little dane cook on our asses for those of us who were actually excited at the thought of a group of talented women portraying the ragtag heroes of their childhood ghostbusters has the potential to be nothing short of squad porn still in practice the group chemistry sometimes fails to spark they often seem to be acting in different movies  the most entertaining of which almost always belonging to kate mckinnon thanks to their respective reigns as snls resident female genius youve heard a lot about kate mckinnon being the new kristen wiig but getting to see these two side by side puts their relative personalities into relief wiigs talent is in minutiae and awkward pauses mckinnons is boisterous and i think much more suited to a big loud movie like this melissa mccarthy is in a welcome turn for her the relatively straight man save for a hilarious recurring bit involving wontons but mckinnon is the breakout star of the film proving that shes less like wiig than she is like lucille ball on psilocybin mushrooms it says a lot that her first important line of the film is a queef joke and somehow things only get more bizarre from there with her zany grin windswept pompadour and fuckyourmanspreading body language shes so thoroughly confident in her own anarchic weird that it becomes a force of magnetism leslie jones is quite funny too leaving behind a featurelength string of quotable non sequiturs a basement smells like burnt baloney and regrets but her character doesnt do much to help the subtle race problem the franchise has always had  the original three ghostbusters are always the white people and in the reboot theyre the scientists jones plays an mta worker named patty and though her knowledge of new york city does become a valuable asset to the team her role feels the least developed of the uniformly pretty underdeveloped characters patty abandons her job to start hanging out with the ghostbusters with no consequence explanation or exploration of her life outside the group the other three characters seem implicitly bonded by their paranormal expertise while patty seems to spend much of the film talking to herself would it really have been that hard to cast leslie jones as a scientist or kate mckinnon as an mta worker solving one casting problem doesnt necessarily solve them all the decision to make an allfemale ghostbusters seems very of the moment we are living through a time when our ideas about gender are on shifting sands  when we must get used to powerful women existing and taking up space or be left behind a woman is likely to be our next president three very ghostbusterlike women currently hold it down on the supreme court beyoncé exists the flip side of this is that female empowerment is becoming its own kind of boutique commodity  a product to be bought sold and tweeted about rather than a quiet ongoing way of life every time a woman does something even sort of cool we are pressured to respond with a yas queen resounding enough to shake the heavens how can we possibly be anything less than so so so psyched about the female ghostbusters movie and still call ourselves feminists this way of thinking andi zeisler says in her recent book we were feminists once suggests that feminism is not a set of values ethics and politics but merely an assessment of whether or not a product is worthy of consumption and yet this is a summer blockbuster not a candidate for public office  and so i say yes sure see it consume this product because in the end what i like best about this film is that it transcends this conversation it actually feels a little ahead of its time it resists the modern urge to be grandstandingly woke to constantly and relentlessly remind you of its feminist bona fides save for the aforementioned and dont get me wrong great queef joke it doesnt try to pander to a female audience id have preferred to see these four women in a slightly looser less plottethered movie  where they were free to riff a bit more deepen their roles beyond stereotypes and not have to spend the last 25 minutes justifying the price of the 3d imax experience  but what can you do ghostbusters is somehow both smarter and dumber than the maelstrom surrounding it its just a silly expensive and utterly fantastical movie about three scientists and one mta worker who bust ghosts the most progressive thing about it is that the movie does not constantly remind you that theyre all women somewhere right now a small child is watching it not even noticing that theyre all women a true story told almost annually around my familys thanksgiving table the morning my sister was born i threw a tantrum because i wanted a brother i was 3 years old i told my grandparents that i would get out of bed that day under only one condition if i could wear my ghostbusters costume to the hospital no i didnt feel the need to dress up as cellistturnedartrestorer sigourney weaver just because she was the lady in the movie i didnt ask my mom to turn my jumpsuit into a dress or make it pink yes my mom made this costume from scratch shoutout to my mom i just thought ghostbusters were cool and come halloween i wanted to be one it was as simple as that and yet i still welcomed my sister into this world with tears because she was not a boy i cringe at this now but i think i just wanted someone to play ghostbusters with me somewhere along the line id picked up the notion that a brother was more likely to want to play ghostbusters with you than a sister was all of which is to say this shit really matters until it doesnt what will gender equality finally look like at the movies is it simply a matter of plunking women into existing previously malehelmed franchises or does it have to do with treating womens stories as just as important and potentially universal as mens  acknowledging that the revenant is not inherently better or deeper than say the devil wears prada one womans opinion it is neither ghostbusters arrival into our multiplexes and god help us our social media feeds has prompted much bigger questions than one movie could ever hope to answer but it also represents the subtlest lifting of the burden placed on the movies that will come after it a small step toward that moment when a femaledriven blockbuster can be seen as something less than a referendum on the entire state of a gender thatll be the day or maybe itll just be the true date of the apocalypse rachel and callie discuss the bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes then jodi hops on to talk the valley and vanderpump rules
Aug 3 2017,positive, watching the ghostbusters reboot was like going to mcdonalds it is disposable thoroughly enjoyable and distinctly american massproduced entertainment i savor the flavor of a big mac with the same casual attitude that i and the others attending my screening chuckled throughout this movie this makes it all the more remarkable that it has been inextricably linked with controversy over gender politics and nostalgia culture that really demonstrate one thing we have become a society of consumers defined by the political as well as cultural brands we buy and buy into when you dissect the controversy related to the ghostbusters reboot it predominantly stemmed from two sources one was undeniably misogynistic a kneejerk reaction against seeing such a major franchise associated with women thanks to gender conservatives being used to seeing only 15 percent of movies star female protagonists the other was the one focused on by james rolfe ie angry video game nerd who mainly complains that he wanted a movie that continued the initial franchise and hinted that it was disrespectful to reboot the property with a title that could confuse it with the original film these two sentiments combined with a trailer so maligned that it quickly became the most unpopular in youtube history created a perfect storm of attention surrounding this movie you could be drawn into the nostalgia for a beloved blockbuster franchise as well as those inclined to dislike them or you could take symbolic stands on the intersection of gender politics with popular culture  left or rightwing as far as the politics are concerned it means we should be relieved this movie isnt terrible as the outright misogynists said it would be it has a 75 percent rating on critical aggregate rottentomatoes and a 60 rating on metacritic and though not likely to supplant the secret life of pets is still poised to garner respectable box office results this weekend then again what does it say that we would consider it a setback  or at least highly unfortunate  if the movie was considered to be an embarrassment what if it actually had been terrible  could we be honest with our own tastes without being labelled as sexists the resulting movie was based on my viewing a product perfectly calibrated to avoid that outcome it aims to be a good family film for the summer movie season and it fits right in with the buttery popcorn i ate while watching it melissa mccarthy kristen wiig kate mckinnon leslie jones and chris hemsworth were easily the best thing about the film and any promise the franchise has in the future will rest on capitalizing on their chemistry and allowing them to improvise as such in terms of delivering a quality ghostbusters product its hard to really complain about this film on its merits hence it addresses the gender politics angle of its inception through juxtaposition gags the leeredat target of sexual objectification is a man played by chris hemsworth and some swipes about negative message board comments and virginal misanthropic nerds it also admirably creates a story in which the female protagonists gender matters not much at all to how the plot unfolds all of this is commendable although in my opinion done better in other femaleled franchises aliens the hunger games frozen  similarly james angry video game nerd rolfe has no reason to be upset at the idea of needing to ask whether the term ghostbusters hereafter refers to this movie or the 1984 one it pays due homage to the original  because of course it would those references to slimer the stay puft marshmallow man the logo the theme song and other aspects of the ghostbusters brand are necessary to draw in the nostalgia audience thats how you connect a reboot to an existing franchise its what one of the most successful rebooted franchises christopher nolans batman trilogy did in its own melodramatic and cerebral way  although as reboots go ghostbusters struck me as qualitatively closer to the most recent star trek efforts  if the bottom line is that sony can get your money by making you want to see a new film associated with the ghostbusters brand so be it if they get you because you enjoy the style of comedy provided by paul feig melissa mccarthy et al so be it if a bunch of misogynists overreact to the film and they can sell tickets through a desire to express solidarity with the case of gender representation in cinema all the better the real story here is that ghostbusters demonstrates just how effectively we have been segmented culturally and politically through the brands with which we identify as a result we have so commodified culture and politics that purely consumerist decisions feel more meaningful than they really are for what its worth at the screening i attended young people seemed to get more out of it than the older ones but most of the thirty or so people there chuckled consistently laughed at the jokes myself included the movie is a solid b and yet it has and will no doubt continue to elicit fulsome praise and bigoted denunciations alike regardless of its quality because that is how our culture has trained us to react to the various cultural and political nerves that this film triggers this i suspect is the real story behind the ghostbusters reboot matthew rozsa is a staff writer at salon he received a masters

Jun 26 2017,negative, from the moment it was announced everyone on the internet voiced an opinion of the allfemale ghostbusters remake legions of fanboys complained the film would ruin their adoration of the 1984 original others leapt to its defense excited that a strong team of women performers would get a chance to school the naysayers but while its wonderful to see women as the heroes of an action movie  playing roles they arent typically offered  thats not the only thing required to make ghostbusters a success it also has to be good unfortunately the film squanders the talents of its cast on a poor script thats bogged down with poor jokes underdeveloped characters and a juvenile approach to feminism that doesnt advance the conversation in the new ghostbusters uptight scientist erin gilbert kristen wiig has difficulties advancing professionally because of a book on ghosts she cowrote with onetime friend abby yates melissa mccarthy after erin is approached by a historical site caretaker for help dehaunting a mansion erin abby and abbys assistant jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon start up a ghostbusting business where theyre joined by transit employee patty tolan leslie jones and prettyboy secretary kevin chris hemsworth the groups business drastically increases thanks to a nutcase loner intent on causing an apocalypse neil casey acting as a clear standin for internet trolls one of the original films strengths was its distinct fullyformed personalities of its characters as was getting to watch those personalities bounce off each other and that was what made the idea of an allfemale remake so intriguing particularly since mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon are all superb comedians unfortunately the characters of the remake are underwritten and their personalities are more like individual collections of quirks wiig is uptight for reasons we never fully understand the underutilized mckinnon is simply weird for the sake of being weird sometimes literally dancing around in the back of the frame in search of something to do jones patty tolan is more downtoearth but still behaves in ways that dont quite make sense ghostbusters  approach to feminism is likewise disappointing in part because of the poorlymined relationships between its leads but also because writerdirector paul feig and cowriter katie dippold mistake stereotypeflipping for empowerment chris hemsworths kevin for example has no redeeming qualities except his good looks sending up both the actors strongman image and the dumb blonde eyecandy trope this is a clever idea in theory but its still objectification and unnecessary at that while flipping the script might seem like a clever way to call attention to this particular brand of sexism it doesnt encourage constructive discussion only conflict its also definitely not the compassionate approach were supposed to consider as viewers of faith all this might sound like harsh criticism for a film thats meant to be light and fun but a movie thats trying to improve the overwhelming whitestraightmaleness of films particularly one this highprofile requires some extra thoughtfulness in its making shutting down misogynists and trolls just by teasing them isnt going to get the job done ghostbusters has to prove its worth by being objectively better than the haters both in terms of quality and attitude unfortunately it doesnt get there on either score we value your feedback on the articles we post please fill out the form below and a member of our online publication team will receive your message by submitting this form you consent to your comment being featured in our letters section   please do not include any nontext characters such as emojis or other nonstandard content into your submission  it may cause errors in submitting the form  thanks
Jun 20 2017,positive, why indeed  after all these ghostbusters are  gasp  female a notion so catastrophic that a zillion trillion blog boys have had something akin to a collective meltdown that heiss is played by bill murray one of the original ghostbusters back in 1984 and again in the soso sequel only adds to the take that misogynist idiots joke simply by appearing in the new ghostbusters murray is giving his tacit blessing to the new version as do his former costars dan aykroyd and ernie hudson harold ramis alas is deceased but the new movie is dedicated to him a nice touch paul feigs reboot doesnt reinvent the wheel but it is plenty funny and it goes down easy and compared to the rest of this summers socalled silly stuff neighbors 2 anyone its an oasis of amusement erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy play former best friends who once wrote a book together about the paranormal however erin has since gone straight and is currently trying for tenure at columbia university they are brought back together when spooky things start happening all over manhattan first theres a vengeful apparition in an old mansion then something ickily ectoplasmic confronts city employee patty tolan leslie jones in a subway tunnel  hes gonna be the third scariest thing on that train she observes when the thing hops on a car bound for queens rounding out the quartet is abbys partner jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon a crackpot inventor whos always coming up with new ways to zap the supernatural to smithereens that her thingamabobs dont always work as planned goes without saying but her enthusiasm and commitment are hilarious andy garcia is fine as the falsely jovial mayor who just wishes these women would go away and take their spooks with them cecily strong is also good as his everloyal assistant who condescendingly dismisses the ghostbusters as these incredibly sad and lonely women  its like they read eat pray love and ran with it the most surprising performance comes from chris hemsworth the erstwhile thor is gutbustingly funny as the himbo the women hire as their secretary its as if he studied christopher reeve as clark kent and well ran with it it may be the best work hes ever done still the movie rests in the hands of its four stars and they work like crazy to bring it all together wiig reaffirms her funnycute persona hollywood needs to build more movies around her or at least hand her a sitcom as it did for tina fey and amy poehler newbies mckinnon and jones acquit themselves well jones gets most of the good lines and as she so often does on snl she makes each one a slamdunk i thought this was going to be like a book club she says when she first joins the others as for mckinnon well theres no telling what shell do next  in this movie or her next one wirehaired and wildeyed shes like aykroyds technonerd as played by harpo marx the only one who suffers just a tiny bit is mccarthy and i chalk that up to her generosity as a performer shes already proved she can carry a movie spy and that she can steal one bridesmaids ghostbusters doesnt give her enough opportunities to well bust loose  mostly because shes the one holding it all together did we need a new ghostbusters probably not but we do need more of mccarthy wiig jones and mckinnon together or separately either way works for me saportareport founded in february 2009 is a trusted voice in metro atlanta through the years we have become atlantas authoritative civic website our readers are engaged in atlantas most pressing issues and want to hear directly from leading companies and nonprofits in the region we give those organizations a platform to share their messages and interact with informed atlantans
Jun 13 2017,positive, ghostbusters was always going to have a tough hill to climb even before paul feig signed on fans were skeptical about the very notion of another ghostbusters movie after he did there were fans upset at the idea of female ghostbusters and fans unhappy about getting a reboot instead of a sequel and fans still annoyed that a new ghostbusters movie was happening at all this project has been under intense scrutiny since before a single frame was shot and the fuss and furor over it has only intensified as the release date approaches but the movie itself isnt terribly concerned with all that feigs ghostbusters is more interested in carving out a new space than it is in retracing the steps of the original while it may not reach instant classic status its still an entertaining addition to the franchise bursting with humor and personality thats all its own  in some ways ghostbusters is a change of pace for director paul feig its his first time working on a bigbudget franchise or dabbling in horror elements and its his first nonrrated film in ten years in other ways though it fits comfortably alongside the rest of his resume like bridesmaids the heat and spy ghostbusters is a comedy with a strong ensemble and a laidback improvised feel the cast and crew are stacked with talents whove worked with feig before including the heat screenwriter katie dippold and feigs favorite muse melissa mccarthy and while feig may not be known as an action director per se he has some experience in the genre thanks to the heat and spy its probably not surprising then that ghostbusters is at its best when it feels most like classic feig the early scenes  where our leads are just starting to come together but before the main supernatural plotline has really kicked in  are the strongest melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon have crackling chemistry together and its a pleasure just to watch them hang out since ghostbusters is pg13 the humor is necessarily a bit cleaner but on the whole the comedy doesnt feel too different from feigs other work once again its all about big personalities bouncing off of each other launching into semiimprovised riffs and the occasional bit of slapsticky physical comedy  once ghostbusters starts to dig deeper into its main storyline though it finds itself on shakier ground ghostbusters essentially combines a typical feig comedy with a franchise blockbuster and the marriage isnt always smooth sailing feig and his team make a solid effort the action scenes are capably shot and choreographed the gadgets are fun and the monsters range from amusing to genuinely creepy they also take care to sprinkle some fun character beats throughout still the setpieces sometimes feel more obligatory than organic  as if theyre there to fulfill the expectations of a bigbudget blockbuster rather than because they make sense for this particular movie some of that time and money and energy would have been better spent on ghostbusters strengths namely its characters and its comedy  ghostbusters other concession to franchise filmmaking are the nods to the earlier movies scattered throughout including cameos from certain cast members theyre largely unnecessary but theyre not really intrusive either otherwise ghostbusters is content to stand on its own and does so quite well it doesnt coast on nostalgia or take for granted the affection surrounding this franchise which is more than we can say for a lot of the terrible sequels and adaptations weve seen this year yes it has the builtin advantage of a familiar brand name but it does the work of building its own world and characters from the ground up  once ghostbusters starts to dig deeper into its main storyline though

weve seen this year yes it has the builtin advantage of a familiar brand name but it does the work of building its own world and characters from the ground up speaking of those characters of the core cast mccarthy and wiig are a bit more dialed down than weve seen in some of their other films including bridesmaids allowing their costars to go a little bolder and bigger jones is the heart of the team bringing a warm and upbeat energy to their adventures together but the real standout is mckinnon as holtzmann an engineer who marches to the beat of her own very hightech and probably deadly drum with luck ghostbusters could do for her what bridesmaids did for mccarthy mckinnon steals the scene with her very first line before we even see her face  and when we do get to see her she gets even better because mckinnon is blessed with an elastic expressive face that never stops working in any given scene its worth keeping one eye on whatever shes doing even when holtzmann isnt actually speaking a blink of her eye or a twitch of her mouth says everything you need to know ghostbusters other breakthrough performance comes from chris hemsworth whos good and game as the ghostbusters extremely dimwitted receptionist kevin even in his marvel movies hemsworth is better  more convincing more distinctive more interesting  portraying thors surfer bro side than he is at thors noble hero side ghostbusters feels like further evidence that hemsworth ought to borrow a page from fellow aussie rose byrne and embrace his talents as a comedy star he gets some of the biggest laughs of the entire movie including one im still giggling about days after i saw the movie at the end of the day those who hoped the new ghostbusters would be just like the original will probably be disappointed the comedic sensibility is more paul feig than ivan reitman the characters and their relationships to one another are completely different and it all feels more like a 2010s blockbuster film than a 1980s comedy adventure for pretty obvious reasons but those willing to roll with the changes will find an entertaining comedyadventure full of new characters new gadgets new monsters and new possibilities
Jun 13 2017,positive, the key to the ghostbusters reboot is that it works not so much as a comedy its fitfully amusing or as a bigbudget adventure but as an unforced celebration of feminism the four heroic women suffer some sexism but not enough to get in their way significantly they mostly power through and do what they want anyway if theyre not taken seriously its not because theyre female but because they insist in a secular age that ghosts exist at heart its a story about two friends since childhood who grew up to be scientists erin gilbert kristen wiig and abby yates melissa mccarthy and who have grown apart since cowriting a book on the paranormal which erin has disavowed the whole creaky noisy spectacle leads to the moment when one of these women literally jumps into the abyss to save the other thats what its all about in the end saving the world is okay but sisterhood matters more ghostbusters has a sketchy script by director paul feig and katie dippold which functions largely as a clothesline for supernatural gags but then so did the script for the sacrosanct 1984 original aside from peter mcnicols performance id just as soon forget about the wanting 1989 sequel i think feig and dippold probably with the encouragement of the actresses really just wanted to tell a smallscale story about the bond between smart women and in ghostbusters they seized the chance to do it on a massive scale on a 145 million budget god knows most of the legitimately funny bits could have been filmed in a onebedroom flat for five dollars but movies like that dont get greenlit any more movies that cost 145 million and have a connection to a beloved franchise do feig enjoys stories about friendships between women and he has told them again and again in the last few years in bridesmaids and the heat and spy two minority women the africanamerican subway worker and armchair city historian patty tolan leslie jones and the cryptogay nuclear engineer jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon round out the quartet of ghostbusters and they all go to the limits of existence for each other theyre afraid but forge ahead anyway the true definition of bravery ghostbusters was not as big a hit as it should have been or else mckinnon would have handily stolen the summer and perhaps the year she gives us a scientist highly entertained by the buzz of her own brain weird noises and asides keep leaking out of her  shes placidly unstable and very much giddily alive jones patty largely recalls richard pryors routine about black peoples comically pragmatic response to the supernatural get the hell out while managing to feel much less like a token afterthought than ernie hudsons black ghostbuster in the original this ghostbusters doesnt feel like its predecessors or look like them it lacks the originals cool slick 80s lamination  the director of photography is robert yeoman who provides the warm bright hues of every wes anderson film and all the aforementioned paul feig movies the phantasms glow sickly green and spew green slime the improved technology gives us more visually elaborate ghosts but cant give us a reason for their ghosting around theres a plot thread about some nerdy mad scientist trying to start the apocalypse ah that old thing and the movie itself seems fatally uninterested in everything to do with it this nerd gets killed about an hour in and spends the rest of our time hopping from body to body eventually settling inside the ghostbusters hunky but dim secretary kevin chris hemsworth enjoying being stupid i dont imagine paul feig cared about the whys and wherefores of the ghosts i know i didnt yet ghostbusters is commendable for its respect for intelligence its regard for friendship its stronger together emphasis feels like a balm in the cold days posthillary it may be best apprehended as an artifact of the era when a female president seemed tantalizingly imminent unlike the original it doesnt proceed from a writers genuine hungry obsession with all things inexplicable the ghosts symbolize loud chaotic elements seeking to split up our heroes so they have more going on under the hood than they did in the original where the ghosts didnt mean much of anything except gag fodder here the ghosts have a certain beauty and pathos and are sometimes scarier than their ancestors though slimer makes an appearance as do many other fanservice ghoulies and actors the movie is more readily comparable to feigs other work than to its forefather its a comfortable night out or in pleasing and unchallenging
Jun 2 2017,positive, paul feigs ghostbusters is a movie that embraces every silly aspect surrounding it ghostbusters is far from a perfect film but its full of hysterical moments and goofy scenarios that makes it one of the most fun movies of the summer so far  ghostbusters is at its best when its main stars  melissa mccarthy kristen wiig leslie jones and kate mckinnon  are on screen together its a movie that relies on the antics of an ensemble for some of the bigger jokes to land and when feig lets the comedians work off of one anothers momentum it feels like the film we were hoping for there are slight pacing issues with the movie which leads to moments of brief boredom and that comes as a result of trying to turn the comedy into an action film the actual ghostbusting scenes can be feel pretty tedious but that moment of weariness is alleviated when feig decides to refocus on the comedy ghostbusters has always been a movie about misunderstood misfits with a strong sense of belief running amok in new york city more so than a film about the paranormal for the most part feig realizes this and the film delivers line after line of quirky dialogue perfectly suited to each comedian mckinnons oddball style of humor beautifully compliments jones loudmouthed hollering while wiigs facial reactions to mccarthys sarcastic bite keeps some of the films slower parts moving forward with ease much like one of feigs other movies bridesmaids theres a chemistry between the actors thats infectious and its their obvious enjoyment on screen that seeps into you while watching making it impossible not to laugh along and root for them there are certain similarities between ivan reitmans 1984 film and this version of ghostbusters both take place in new york city feature columbia university as a starting point have a crazed madman obsessed with humanitys downfalls and of course ghosts but the small similarities almost act as background in feigs film its the differences where the movie finds itself and breaks away just enough from reitmans version that the concept of ghostbusters feels fresh after years of being apart following a fallout columbia professor erin gilbert wiig reunites with high school best friend and fellow paranormal investigator abby yates mccarthy during an outing to visit a supposedly haunted house the two  and abbys assistant jillian holtzmann mckinnon  encounter an apparition justifying all of their work over the years and substantiating claims made in a book they coauthored nearly a decade earlier as they investigate more rumors about ghosts appearing around the city they meet subway booth operator patty tolan jones who decides to join the three scientists and scope out where the ghosts are coming from the film couldnt exist if one character was more important than another and even chris hemsworths smaller role feels just as important to the success of the movie as the main casts one of the best parts of the movie surprisingly enough was hemsworths portrayal of dodobrained assistant kevin its one of the few times hemsworth doesnt rely on physical humor to carry a character and although the attention focuses mostly on his good looks he manages to make his character feel like more than a twodimensional sex object easily delivering some of the films best jokes and scenes once the initial awkwardness of realizing theyre forming a strange troupe of paranormal chasers wears off the group becomes inseparable spending all of their time trying out new weapons they can use on various ghosts or eating chinese takeout from the restaurant below them its when ghostbusters begins to find its groove and where feig comes into his own feig is a master of working with an ensemble as seen in his other work including bridesmaids and episodes of freaks and geeks and ghostbusters is a movie that relies on the talents of everyone on screen working in harmony even more importantly however is how serious feig takes the silliest aspects and reiterates their points to make us care about them too the entire premise of ghostbusters is absurd and when making an absurdist comedy the only way to make it succeed is to treat it with the utmost seriousness feig does this and for the most part its what makes ghostbusters such an endearing watch the team is so enthralled by what theyre doing and proving to the world that ghosts are real capturing as many as they can for scientific purposes that its hard not to believe in their vision and root alongside them even though the premise of driving around new york city in a trickedout hearse looking for ghosts is downright ridiculous theres a level of urgency and seriousness coming from feig and the cast that makes it even funnier thats the other thing about ghostbusters its a comedy through and through the least interesting thing about feigs version of the movie was also the least interesting thing about reitmans the ghosts when feig decides to spend his time on the paranormal hunting aspects of the film it loses some of its magic the scenes are big loud and intense and much to the casts credit they do a good job of trying to keep the comedic aspects alive while fighting off ghosts but even then it feels lackluster feig tries to transition seamlessly from goofy comedy to scifi action but never quite succeeds the closest he comes is in a hilarious encounter between jones and a particularly interesting apparition and the only reason it works well is because the scene focuses on the comedy of jones fleeing the ghost more than the jumpscare preceding it even the films climactic allout battle between ghosts and busters feels tedious its a little too long and you spend most of the time wishing it was over so the cast could get back to bantering its a necessary scene considering the entire premise of the film but theres nothing particularly interesting about it and when juxtaposed to the less intense parts of the movie it doesnt feel like it fits well either but where feig loses focus on some elements of the movie he more than makes up for with others including making the gang appear as badass as possible without revealing too much about the scene theres a fantastic moment with mckinnon toward the end of the movie featuring a large group of ghosts it feels like the moment feig had been building up to all along and it shows off the power of these four women feig never calls attention to the fact that this ghostbusting team is entirely female because theres no reason to its not a ridiculous notion that three of the most brilliant scientists can be women nor is it absurd to think that they could handle taking down ghosts around new york city since that doesnt feel strange feig never comes out and points fingers at the fact that theyre women but simply tells a story about scientists trying to save new york city in doing so feig has created a very funny and above all else fun movie about a team of ghostbusters who happen to be women the focus is on their scientific ability and keenness to investigate the paranormal not their gender that being said theres no question that these women are at the top of their game and the coolest of the cool whereas the original ghostbusters  bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson  felt goofy and charming theres a level of respect the new cast demands in their quest to prove themselves and their science to the world theres a certain attitude the team carries that screams they should be taken seriously they also never lose their sense of comedy and deliver hilarious punchline after punchline embracing the selfdeprecating scenes along with the most empowering feigs ghostbusters wont be an iconic film in the same way reitmans was but it is both hysterical and fun that doesnt fail to entertain
Apr 25 2017,positive,with these four performers in place the movie finds some magic
Feb 17 2017,positive,its a lot of fun and allows each of the women to showcase their different comedic stylings whilst going up against the man both literally and figuratively
Jan 8 2017,positive,winningly relevant irreverent anarchic and delightful
Jan 3 2017,positive,very very fun
Jan 2 2017,positive, remember when sony rebooted sam raimis take on spiderman 2002 with the amazing spiderman 2012 their whole conceit at the time appeared to be what if you didnt know the story so they just told it again only everyone actually did know the story the result was an instantly forgettable retread useless but for the printing of money while that may have been the whole point it left a lousy corporate aftertaste it took the world gargling with some marvel studios mouthwash aka captain america civil war to make people excited about spidey again the good news is that this mega corporation appears to have learned from its mistake ghostbusters now does not moronically assume you dont know ghostbusters then sure its the same story again  the ghostbusters set up shop refine technobabble gadgets fight against a supernatural invasion of new york and the bureaucrats that get in their way  but writerdirector paul feig and his cowriter katie dippold who wrote the heat together have correctly guessed that the fun of the movie will be in the makeover  the story gets a new look freshened up details and most famously four female ghostbusters and a male receptionist in place of the originals four men and a female receptionist that gender inversion proved more revolutionary that any rational human might have expected because a lot of manbabies have been freaking out on the internet ever since it is here where i should probably remind you that i think the original is fine but nothing more its reputation as a great comedy is the work of supernatural mass possession andor nostalgia neverthless people hold it sacred those people apparently include everyone involved with the new film given that ghostbusters 2016 takes every opportunity it can to wink in the direction of ghostbusters 1984 as if you know it by heart its a mystery as to why they didnt just write a new story that takes place 32 years after the original rather than revising the origin to take place now but thats hollywood logic theyre obsessed with origin stories even in franchises that are on film number 3 the case here or 7 as with the force awakens and its veritable retread of star warss plot that aggravation aside it was hard to even stay a little bit mad at the film since it starts well with a tour of a haunted house with actual jokes for minor characters and stays funny for good stretches thereafter it also knows how to keep a single gag going through multiple scenes as with its clever obsession with the iconic ghostbusters logo the cast works hard to entertain the original film leaned so hard on bill murrays effortless deadpan for its laughoutloud moments that it sometimes felt like a one man show that the goddess sigourney weaver was occassionally interrupting to steal scenes the new version spreads the joking around much more equitably and why not melissa mccarthy kristen wiig and leslie jones are all dependably funny women and the screenplay makes sure they each get a big solo moment but its kate mckinnon as the lusty for science and holtzmann  who generates the biggest laughs sometimes she conjures them from thin air without any joke there chris hemsworth has a blast mocking his ridiculous attractiveness as their dumb hunk receptionist and the film rewards him with a showstopping finale the ladies keep him around just for the pretty which is more of a gentle mocking  than a meanspirited potshot at hollywoods perpetual male gaze in one of the movies most memorable gestures holtzmann licks one of her weapons her own genius turns her on but keeping it real now no one will love this movie as much as this badass loves science i dont want to oversell it let us not speak of the hideous new version of the 1984 theme song lets not dwell on the unfortunate fact that the only black ghostbuster is the sole nonscientist again and we wont check the running time since paul feig makes super funny movies bridesmaids the heat spy but always risks letting them outstay their welcome but answer the call anyway as the tagline commands the best reason to see ghostbusters 2016 aside from crushing the spirits of misogynists who want it to fail is that its sweet and silly where the original opted for sarcastic and smug they may have nurtured the script with that 1984 template but by its very 2016 nature it becomes a different beast and the feminist revamp if we can even call it that is of the affectingly subtle variety these four women respect each other and work together to get better at busting those ghosts it may not be the freshest popcorn entertainment in the world but in this particular mainstream movie summer itll more than do i just came from seen this movie and i agree that kate mckinnon is mvp but right behind her is leslie jones who does marvels with her character and has some of the funniest dialogue  but the movie in my opinion is overly long and without a strong center around which to create tension  it is a good time at the movies a little scarier at the beginning but it could have been so much more if it werent for the middling reviews i was actually planning on seeing this but an average retread of an average movie doesnt sound like something odd be interested in  i had the same problem with this as most comic book movies incredibly underdeveloped villain the ladies were great and i laughed a great deal kudos on the mvp pick but there was never any tension  that even the original provided any chance you could get your readers to check their spelling etc before they submiti just came from seen this movie rather than seeingsound like something odd be interested in rather than something in which id be interestedspelling errors and bad grammer make this gramper angry rjl  im assuming most of us here comment on our phones which are prone to autocorrecting in the worst way and when youre always on the go its sometimes difficult to go over your text before you post  if you had told me 3 years ago that a female remake of the ghostbusters would cause a full on meltdown from so many immature sexist fanboys i would not have believed you however they really did react badly and fortunately the female version is on its way to being a success these fanboys probably have trouble with the fact that women can vote as well imagine being alive 20 years in the future and being able to tell people that you were present during the year that was the last gasp of the patriarchy i just hope this last gasp doesnt go on too much longer with that said at least they switched it up with a female cast  even if it looks like they otherwise mostly stuck to the same story i hope it fails just like i hoped the garfieldstone spiderman films would fail mccarthy  team could be making much better original films instead i saw ghostbusters on friday afternoon its fun and silly as you would expect a midsummer family movie to be its sheer goodnaturedness makes the fanboy outrage seem all the more weird and overblown however  and it pains me to say it  there are large failings in pacing and actual storytelling in the film it felt too much like a series of sketches tied together to make a plot and where the original actual works is combining some genuinely effective scares with a combination of humour and storytelling zuul the hauntings and the possession sequences in the original were very effective whereas the glossiness of this and elements of humour just dont really work as well i felt that melissa mccarthy  oddly  was the weakest part of this and it doesnt fall down on her but what her character was given i totally love that its an all female reboot the haters are just sexist toads but there were a lot of missed opportunities in this it might be more to do with the state of big budget filmmaking today but it left me wanting so much more not the original just something that struck that balance more you know im reading this review and all these comments most of them are very one sided not to mention the article writer im a girl 28 years  and i thought this movie was terrible one of the most terrible films ive seen does that make me a woman hater being a woman nooo the script is a pile of garbage and gag after gag made me almost walk out got nothing to do with being all woman or that crap and i see me women on youtube that dont like it either stop saying its all men that hate this move because they hate women because that is just not true yes some did say they didnt like the all female thing but read and watch everything and it you find out people dont like it because of many other reason beside the women thing if you want strong female charachter sigourney weaver in alien films god force awaken girl in star wars the new rogue one movie with strong female lead but no one talkes about those stong female roles not the slap stick crap and i likes these actors also in ghostbusters jessica most of the haters came out against this movie before they even saw it that is the difference and that is blatant misogyny period i thought it was quite funny although the ghostbusting finale was a bit overlong and uninteresting  kate mckinnon and leslie jones were definitely the standouts see what i mean you totally disregard every else i say oh its blatant misogyny and yes i did watch the trailers and thought omg what is this but i gave it a chance because yes i am woman and i did see the women hating comments but its not all the comments so dont just make it black and white like sony and paul feig make it out to be no one can probably criticise this movie without being a woman hater god dammit this pc bullcrap is disgusting sometimes i loved it it was so much fun those ladies are incredible kate mckinnon and leslie jones especially but i loved cecily strong too ive never seen the original and found the constant breaks for fanservice annoying i didnt understand them but the girls next to me were freaking out so i assumed the people they were freaking out over had been in the original film but thats my only complaint i have no interest in seeing the original anyway why bother with the dudes when i can have these amazing ladies i saw it last night it was decent this is a seriously talented quartet but i felt that other than mckinnon they werent given especially funny characters to play i saw the original as a kid but dont have any particularly significant memories of itit was never a favorite of mine  that said i hope it does well financially because id love to see these ladies get offered good film work and for there to be more femalefronted comedies the only people to make an issue out of the allfemale slant of this film are a vocal and virulent group of men that regularly make an issue out of things like this its not all the comments but it was more than a fair share and more than enough to shape the dialogue around this film denying that is just delusional  that being said this is a fun film perfect summertime fare its entertaining and bounces along before some thirdact drag kate mckinnon absolutely steals the film with her wonderful and specific weirdness we learn next to nothing about her character but mckinnon is able to create a fullyfleshed brilliant weirdo out of it i wish more performers were as unique and weird as mckinnon has proven herself to be she is a oneofakind performer and that makes her work equally oneofakind from her snl work hers is the best take on hillary anywhere to say nothing of her work as ellen bieber or original characters to holtzmann mckinnon is just a gem i hope hollywood knows what to do with her just saw this last night and what a refreshing time at the movies this is what a summer blockbuster used to befun silly scary goodnatured with memorable characters you really love watching my one complaint was that it could have had a few more great jokes but all in all this was a really fun time at the movies these chicks busted ghosts with a fierceness
Jan 1 2017,positive, slime time the film whose trailer is the most disliked in youtube history 947k thumbs down turns out to be the smartest sort of silly summer fun  talk about coming full circle or history repeating itself or just plain getting old the original 1984 ghostbusters was one of the first movies i reviewed as a professional critic think of it 32 years ago born five months before its release kate mckinnon was literally in diapers   that might seem like a long time but its probably just about the right interval to wait before readdressing a classic too many films that arent remotely classics are remade these days even as the originals still streaming on netflix lara croft tomb raider 2001 for example has the public really indicated its desperate need for a new croft flick or is hollywood just more creatively bankrupt than ever   i digress the great paul feig bridesmaids along with his pretty darn great cowriter katie dippold the heat has resurrected reimagined and rebooted the beloved comedy and done so with both tremendous respect and exemplary finesse this is a picture with more nice touches than a shiatsu massage   first and foremost theres the inspired decision to flip the genders of the principals feigs films have always maintained that female police officers highlevel government staff and secret agents can be every bit as competent  and loony  as their male counterparts why not then make them ghostbusters   of course it doesnt hurt to have a cast this hilarious if there are four funnier females than kristen wiig mckinnon leslie jones and melissa mccarthy making movies today theyre making them on another planet these are the queens of comedy   prudently the script wastes minimal time on setup faster than you can say dont cross the streams the four women have gone into business together rented an office over a chinese restaurant and worked the bugs out of their proton packs their outfits are a gift from jones patty a former mta employee who presumably figures that if theyre going to save new york city they might as well look like they work for it   pals erin wiig and abby mccarthy have always shared a fascination with the supernatural jillian mckinnon has always been a gearhead and pattys just seen a ghost in a subway tunnel and is afraid she signs on to help wipe out the specters   someones created a device that amplifies paranormal activity mccarthy discovers  something thats not great for manhattan but really good for business this would be a nerd of evil named rowan north neil casey whose plan is to unleash an ectoplasmic tsunami on the city in one of the sheboots most wonderful scenes our heroes confront the mayor andy garcia and plead with him to take action please dont be like the mayor in jaws begs wiig   needless to say the effects are more sophisticated than they were in 1984 if rivers of fluorescent vomit can be described as sophisticated the gadgets are more impressive than ever and the surviving members of the original crew pop by for cameos the most extended  and funniest  is bill murrays is this a good time he asks with a smirk playing a professional debunker paying a surprise visit to ghostbusters headquarters of course its always a good time when murray pops by   the times square finale is a thing of cgi beauty with the four women facing down a delightfully frightful mashup of old and new spooks standouts include holdovers such as slimer along with more recent developments like sinister macys parade balloons   that crucial balance of the old and new is just one of many things the director gets exactly right from the iconic theme music to the laidback takenothingtooseriously tone the dna of dan aykroyd and harold ramis gut buster flows through every frame of paul feigs ghostbusters   from 20142020 seven days allowed readers to comment on all stories posted on our website while weve appreciated the suggestions and insights right now seven days is prioritizing our core mission  producing highquality responsible local journalism  over moderating online debates between readers to criticize correct or praise our reporting please send us a letter to the editor or send us a tip well check it out and report the results online comments may return when we have better tech tools for managing them thanks for reading

Dec 28 2016,neutral,while there isnt a cynical note in the entire film it feels like a safe flavorless recipe prepared from gourmet ingredients
Dec 26 2016,neutral,all up its a soso comedy offering with just enough entertainment value to not make you wish youd waited for the stream or dvd
Dec 19 2016,positive, what is the new ghostbusters it isnt a sequel it isnt a remake it isnt even an ordinary rebrand it is i suppose a new form of cinema a feminist rebrand complete with four women playing the roles originally taken by four men a shiny new script written by the chick who wrote the heat plus im imagining a vast committee of hillary clintonstyle female studio execs who pounded the scenes into a perfect female product
Dec 12 2016,positive, three women stand around a recording device listening to a communication from the other side abby a paranormal scientist who works out of the basement of a high school claims that her team has finally done the impossible and caught a ghost on tape erin her frenemy and onetime colleague leans in closely not sure what to expect a fart rings out loudly  thats a scene from the new ghostbusters a film with pleasures that are both small and revolutionary directed by paul feig from a script cowritten by katie dippold parks and recreation its commitment to equal opportunity crassness is central to the movies mission statement  in ghostbusters women behave in ways that are often deemed exclusive to male characters they debate about science they worry about their careers they make queef jokes feig who has previously directed spy and bridesmaids commonly explores what it means for women to act like men in spy melissa mccarthy plays a cia analyst who dreams of being a field agent in an industry where most spies look like jude law bridesmaids features so much scatological humor that it becomes political ghostbusters one of the funniest movies of the year is so daffy and effervescent that it appears weightless as if the film could float away at any moment but that disguises its immense importance at a time when many felt it shouldnt exist the allfemale reboot of the 1980s comedy classic has been one of the most intensely scrutinized movies in history the films trailer is the most disliked video ever on youtube while ghostbusters earned a 40 from imdb users this is despite the fact that until this week almost no one had seen it in the film kristen wiig diary of a teenage girl saturday night live stars as erin gilbert a professor who is up for tenure at her college the plans are derailed when her childhood best friend mccarthy now a feig regular ropes her into investigating a local haunting before erin went into university academia the two were paranormal researchers they even coauthored a book together after discovering the sightings are real the pair enlist abbys coworker kate mckinnon an mta worker who has access to her uncles hearse leslie jones and the worlds worst male secretary chris hemsworth to fight the undead ghostbusters is extremely generous to its stable of actors each of whom is given ample opportunity to shine jones a towering presence onscreen is ferociously good as patty who quits her subway job for the promise of female friendship she was under the impression the foursome was a book club and pictured them listening to stevie nicks together early reaction to the films trailer drew attention to the fact that the character seems to draw from an outdated stereotypethe streetwise token black characterand that shes the only member of the group who isnt a scientist but patty like the rest of the film is handled with intelligence a selfdescribed nonfiction nerd shes like a walking encyclopedia wiig and mccarthy who reteam for the first time since bridesmaids are dependably fine as another pair of women with a complicated relationship wiig who has recently carved out a niche for herself as one of cinemas finest character actors in movies like the skeleton twins and welcome to me wisely plays it close to the vest showing a gift for understatement one of the best jokes in the whole movie goes almost unnoticed a male colleague at her university tells her she needs to rethink her wardrobe she dresses like a physicist and she misunderstands the edict too sexy she asks when she visits the amazon page for her book shes pictured wearing a slight variation on the same outfit clearly erin has a look one of the reasons that ghostbusters works as well as it does is that its comedy is rooted in a genuine sense of character its humor driven by a real understanding of these womens personalities mckinnon snls most talented active cast member steals every scene shes in as a qlike scientist with a delightfully offkilter energy holtzmann is never too busy hunting ghosts to eat a potato chip or play dressup appearing out of nowhere in a purple bouffant and costume shades holtzmann scares the daylights out of erin is it the wig or the hat she asks the plot as tends to be the case in bigbudget hollywood blockbusters is something of a formality a misanthropic hotel worker who believes himself to be a genius neil casey devises an evil plan to open a portal to another dimension thus unleashing a maelstrom of ghosts on new york city the proceedings hew closely to the original featuring a bevy of gratuitous cameos from members of the original crew some of them are groaners but you may be too busy laughing to notice the movies flawsor its smattering of plot holes for instance the girls are able to rent out a chinese restaurant as their home base how exactly is a team with no funding able to afford workspace in new york especially if theyre too broke to get their own car in a year filled with failed sequels and reboots alice through the looking glass take a bow its refreshing to see a film that is not only reverent toward its source perhaps to a fault but also willing to put its own distinctive stamp on the material like the recent star wars the force awakens ghostbusters isnt a hollow copy of its predecessor but a loving recreation a gift to a new generation of fans fanboys might be worried it will ruin their childhoods but for everyone else ghostbusters is a proton back blast  nico lang is an essayist movie critic and reporter who specializes

Dec 5 2016,positive,a very neutral and profoundly unexceptional thing but likable enough
Nov 15 2016,negative, its hard to tell which was more depressing the whining from alleged males about how their precious ghostbusters had been defiled by featuring a new allfemale cast or the curiously dull trailers that have circulated around the web abby yates melissa mccarthy jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon erin gilbert kristen wiig and patty tolan leslie jones are not concerned with any potential harm that might be infl icted upon them by supernatural beings in ghostbusters now that paul feigs reworking of the 1984 hit is finally on the big screen its actually disappointing to say the new film is far more enjoyable than the unbearable ghostbusters 2 you know a movie sucks when its sole virtue is a bobby brown song or that terrible cover that fall out boy made of ray parker jrs original theme song feigs last few films like spy and bridesmaids have impressively balanced grossout humor and compassion for his sometimes troubled characters with the former feig also demonstrated an eye for staging action scenes that made his movies look far more expensive than they actually were with his new take on ghostbusters feig and just about everything else in the film seem subdued by special effects that are both cluttered and obligatory feigs comedies have tended to be character driven and thats hard to set up when viewers are expecting legions of ghosts to not be afraid of to their credit feig and coscreenwriter katie dippold drop lots of little nods to dan aykroyd and the late harold ramis original tale but for the most part act as if the previous film and parkers catchy question never happened in this version kristen wiig plays erin gilbert a columbia university physics professor whos on the verge of getting tenure because her career is on the line she hopes that the world will forget an obscure book she wrote with her childhood pal abby yates melissa mccarthy about the paranormal the two former friends wind up reuniting when they discover the phenomena they explored but couldnt prove in print are now happening all over new york joined by wisecracking gadget guru jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon and patty tolan leslie jones a transit employee whose brain has a builtin google maps the new ghostbusters develop ways to combat and trap malevolent spirits despite the fact that the city and the media discount their existence with limited resources they have to settle for hiring the male equivalent of window dressing kevin chris hemsworth cant take a message to save his life and is a fountain of bad ideas then again with his abs and dance moves he almost makes up for the fact that answering the phone isnt part of his skill set the team members find their workload increasing because a disgruntled janitor neil casey has been summoning specters to attack people he thinks have wronged him feig and dippold have the unenviable task of making up a worthwhile new story while keeping fans of the first movie  like me  happy some of the gags seem lazy perfunctory cameos by aykroyd and sigourney weaver but others are inspired hemsworth has a ball lampooning his superhero image and bill murrays brief turn as a ghostbuster skeptic is expectedly funny as she does in just about every episode of saturday night live mckinnon walks away with the film her geeky but ornery countenance is a lot more fun to watch than the sketchy longtime friendship between wiig and mccarthy developing that relationship could have resulted in some more fully realized sequences and given the story more depth and laughs wiig and mccarthy for the most part serve as decent straight women to mckinnon and jones but it seems as if feig is underutilizing his formidable leading ladies perhaps he could have spent less time showing off armies of flying apparitions after a while its easy to become more exhausted than haunted by all the ghosts material from the associated press is copyright  2024 associated press and may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed associated press text photo graphic audio andor video material shall not be published broadcast rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium neither these ap materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and noncommercial use the ap will not be held liable for any delays inaccuracies errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing all rights reserved
Oct 28 2016,positive, ghostbusters 2016 the reboot  remake  revival of the 1984 frat boy comedy starring bill murray as a sardonic con man in academia turned nuclear powered paranormal investigator was the most controversial film of the year if you measure such things by facebook rants and twitter burns from arrested adolescents why because it stars four women in the roles originally played by four men which is apparently is blasphemy in the fanatical fringe of the church of popular culture its a hard case to make when you actually see the film a playful romp through a haunted new york city by four extremely funny women improvising banter through a halfbaked script falling somewhere between remake and reinvention it takes the basic premise tosses in a new bad guy adds lots of cgi phantoms and the usual apocalyptic assault on nyc and well thats pretty it which is enjoyable enough as these things go but a little disappointing from a film that reunites filmmaker paul feig with collaborators kristen wiig of bridesmaids and melissa mccarthy the heat and spy tagteam leads who generously share the laughs in a genuine ensemble comedy wiig is a physicist whose tenure track is derailed when her buried ghostobsessed past comes back to haunt her thanks to her former high school bff mccarthy still struggling to give her paranormal research an academic stamp of approval kate mckinnon is the teams secret weapon a maverick nuclear engineer who whips up proton packs atomicpowered ghost traps and other cool inventions shes not so much a mad scientist as a gleeful eccentric with a manic energy that comes out in sideways glances wicked grins and spontaneous moves that suggests shes dancing to her own private soundtrack completing the team is leslie jones as a subway worker and amateur new york historian who provides the blue collar practicality there are plenty of cameos from the original film from cast members bill murray dan aykroyd annie potts ernie hudson and sigourney weaver to the grinning green slimer and the stay puft marshmallow man and precious few surprises but there is one unexpected delight chris hemsworth taking a break from the regal authority of thor plays their bubbleheaded hunk of a receptionist aka stripogram clark kent with the glassyeyed abandon of a born improv comic the big special effects set pieces lack the whimsical invention and twisted absurdity of the original film and the running jokes are tired before they hit their stride but these women have chemistry and quickly build a compelling sense of solidarity they are a fun group to spend time with if only they had a movie worthy of their comic potential the film has been rebranded ghostbusters answer the call for home video but its the same film at least in the theatrical version an extended version with over 15 minutes of additional and extended scenes is also available on both vod and disc dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to stream on demand to receive notifications of new posts your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and twitter sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view
Oct 11 2016,negative, for the past couple of decades there was always a high demand for another ghostbusters sequel the original is considered a comedy classic and while the second film didnt quite live up to the first the fans couldnt wait to see our heroes reunite to take on more ghosts however even though the demand was high another sequel was never made after the 1989 follow up instead what we would end up with over 25 years later is a reboot that no one really asked for after all the original characters were beloved by a generation of filmgoers so how would they react to having everyone replaced for a new origin story it seemed like a very risky move but directorcowrite paul feig decided to accept the gamble delivering the simplytitled ghostbusters for a new generation upon discovering that his historical mansion is haunted ed mulgrave ed begley jr seeks the help of erin gilbert kristen wiig a professor who coauthored a book on paranormal activity years before embarrassed that someone has discovered it she denies that it was her and seeks out her old friend and collaborator abby yates melissa mccarthy who is now a paranormal researcher while erin tries to get abby to stop advertising their book she mentions the possiblyhaunted mansion which excites abby and her research partner jillian holtzmann kate mckinnon shortly afterward all three of them find themselves at the mansion facetoface with an actual ghost the experience causes them to start up their own ghosthunting business which is soon joined by patty tolan leslie jones a subway worker who leads them to another ghost sighting in a tunnel beneath new york city meanwhile we are shown exactly who is behind all of the recent ghost activity as it turn out a man by the name of rowan north neil casey a genius who works at a local hotel has been attempting to amplify the paranormal energy around the city to help unleash a plethora of ghosts upon it obviously the ghostbusters cant allow this to happen but will they be able to stop him before its too late i have to admit there was a large amount of personal skepticism when it came to the notion of a ghostbusters reboot especially after the trailers first came out which made it seem as though the film was going to be a complete disaster that being said its at least slightly pleasing to say that the film is not the total train wreck that was expected though the result is not exactly enough to get it up to good either you may recall that the humor in the 1984 classic was much more natural and was delivered by great actors like bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis and while the characters here arent a total misstep they just arent as likeable as the original team it certainly doesnt help that the material they have to work with isnt nearly as good but given that the screenplay is by paul feig spy and katie dippold the heat it hardly comes as a surprise however again the film is not particularly bad the story is engaging enough though it cant quite help being what it is a retread of the origin of the ghostbusters though with a farlessintriguing villain speaking of the villain that was something of a problem in itself we have a genius who has been mistreated by the world so he decides to unleash a ton of ghosts upon new york city as punishment its one of those revenge plots that you have to try not to think too hard about or else youll find yourself wondering why out of all the possibilities he would choose to pursue this one there is a certain charm that permeates the film especially when it comes to the multitude of cameos that can be noticed throughout i wont spoil them here but you should probably know who to expect anyway however some of them are so quick that if you blink you just might miss them so keep a sharp eye out theres also a good deal of nostalgia to be found throughout the storyline as our new group of heroes use their proton packs traps and other gadgets to fight the ghosts which along with other parts of the narrative make it feel as though there was a good ghostbusters film hiding in here somewhere but unfortunately these filmmakers just couldnt quite get to it what we end up with is a reboot that has a few things to like about it but also a few too many things that are holding it back from being a satisfactory return to the longdormant franchise it really makes one wish that they had been able to get the surviving members of the original crew back together for another outing updating us on how the characters have been over the last couple of decades and giving the fans exactly what theyve wanted for so long feigs attempt to bring it back in this fashion wasnt a terrible idea and it certainly could have worked with better writers on board but the result is merely a mostlyforgettable film that just isnt able to recapture the magic that made this series so entertaining in the first place ghostbusters comes to bluray in a 2391 1080p high definition transfer of excellent quality throughout the film the image does seem a little too bright at times but for the most part its clear and sharp allowing for a fine viewing experience the 51 dtshd master audio is outstanding giving you all of the dialogue sound effects and score in great quality overall the film has been given pretty good treatment that will leave viewers satisfied commentary with directorcowriter paul feig and cowriter katie dippold an intriguing commentary in which feig and dippold take you behind the scenes of the making of the film paul feigs ghostbusters reboot isnt the outright disaster that was expected for it does contain some humor that works and a good deal of charm and nostalgic value but it still ends up being a mostlyforgettable outing thanks to a lot of jokes that miss an unremarkable story and a bland villain with a nonsensical revenge scheme it wasnt a terrible idea to bring in new characters in an effort to revitalize the series but in the end it can only get so far with its lackluster screenplay leaving behind a film that just cant come close to the originals legacy
Oct 5 2016,positive,kristen wiig melissa mccarthy leslie jones and kate mckinnon are all absolutely brilliantly hilarious  i couldnt tell you which one made me laugh the most
Sep 27 2016,positive,not as bad as many have said but its not this summers best movie despite that this new version will free us from the ghosts of boredom full review in spanish
Sep 21 2016,positive, to all the internet manbabies convinced that paul feigs ghostbusters reboot will be the worst thing ever to hit theaters on the basis of ruining mah childhood sorry not sorry you big dopes its actually a damn fun movie i know i know to all the internet manbabies who instead say bwuh bwuh bwuh but what if i dont like it because of the trailer why do feminist bitches have to crawl up my urethra all the time literally no one ever said thinking ghostbusters doesnt look good necessarily makes you sexist britney spears wants you to shut up now for the most part were all liberal hippie michael jackson enthusiasts sjw assholes here at the jibez sohopefullyseeing as i am surrounded by likeminded individuals i will not need to go into too much depth recapping how the vitriol against this movie has been distinctly gendered in flavor weve been over it already anyways if you have any more questionscommentscomplaints feel free to send them via post with a sase to po box up your own ass so heres the deal ghostbusters its a very entertaining movie it is not a perfect movie but considering the state of summer 2016 so far doesnt make me want to light my hair on fire is pretty damn good instead of bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis and ernie hudson we get melissa mccarthy leslie jones kate mckinnon and kristen wiig saving new york city though the busters in one scene eat papa johns and what selfrespecting new yorker i ask you etc from a massive spectral threat the villain this time is not zuul but the completely human and alive rowan north neil casey who invented a machine that can for all intents and purposes create ghosts rowan north is like if reddit became a person except without the cursing or rape threats pg13 yall he does not have a neckbeard physically but he is a neckbeard spiritually hes a bullying victim turned bully a man who thinks his intellect entitles him to obedience and respect from people he believes to be inferior to him in every way when he doesnt get it he lashes out he has definitely used the word sheeple and not ironically rowan makes a few comments to the tune of oh you women you shoot like girls and theres a scene where dialogue was slightly tweaked as a reaction to early criticism but for the most part ghostbusters doesnt get too meta these new ghostbusters arent women in a mans world theyre just women in the world they know what theyre doing their gender is rarely spoken of by the other characters in the movie as something that would prevent them from going out and kicking some ghostly ass its kind of refreshing as with its predecessor ghostbusters is funny as hell for christs sake its wiig mckinnon jones and mccarthy plus the guy who directed spy and katie dippold one of the writers for parks and recreation it was going to be funny a quick aside on mckinnon i dont know where i was on the kinsey scale before seeing this movie but im sure as shit at a different place on it now mckinnons jillian holtzmann the weirdo tech genius of the group is to quote kristys review onepart egon earnest nerdthusiasm with twoparts ian malcolm from jurassic park sex appeal i feel like a changed person for having seen it god opened a door for me and i walked through it she spends half the movie eyefucking people it is everything you wanted from the trailers and more feigs ghostbusters isnt as good as ivan reitmans it drags somewhat during the setupheavy first 20 minutes and the climax is a bit overstuffedi preferred the lowkey four guys on a rooftop of the original to the cityspanning action we get here which is more typical of 21st century blockbusters the original ghostbusters had a spark to it that this one just doesnt because its a concept that were all so familiar with by this point and speaking of comparisons the new ghostbusters doesnt help itself with the constant references cameos and callbacks to the 84 film acknowledge your source material fine but you really dont need to work i aint afraid of no ghosts or who you gonna call in there if doing so brings your movie to a distracting standstill cameos for their own sake arent funny cut it out literally and figuratively that said ghostbusters is still a very fun solid action comedyeven the 3d is good and thats not something i normally go in for theres no ghost blowjob as in the original but there is a scene where a ghost gets shot in the dick fun times for the whole family
Sep 13 2016,positive, its been more than 30 years since the ghostbusters first hit the big screen with a thenoriginal mix of comedy and supernatural action intriguingly this new film is neither a sequel nor a remake its a reboot of the franchise which loosely adapts the original 1984 premise to allnew characters thankfully the screenplay is smart and funny and the cast is flatout hilarious it opens as university professor erin kristen wiig sees her hopes for tenure evaporate when a book she wrote years ago with her childhood pal abby melissa mccarthy resurfaces affirming their belief in ghosts so erin seeks out abby and discovers that shes still researching the supernatural now with the sharpwitted gadget maker jillian kate mckinnon with spirit sightings on the rise in new york the three decide to launch a ghostbusting business joined by city expert patty leslie jones and bimbo receptionist kevin chris hemsworth but the apparitions popping up around the city are getting increasingly malevolent and its clear that an apocalypse is brewing the basic plot is lifted from the original movie which is referenced in virtually every scene most of this is rather distracting because a more original storyline would have been a lot more involving and the injokes will be lost on younger audiences but its fun to see the original cast members turn up here and there in random cameos like bill murray and dan aykroyd this film also features veterans from saturday night live wiig already has a varied movie career this reunites her with bridesmaids costar mccarthy and director paul feig and this film gives scenestealers mckinnon and jones their first proper bigscreen roles together they have a terrific sense of camaraderie which engagingly layers real warmth under the sassy attitude its great to see a film led by women who dont feel the need to find boyfriends or husbands and hemsworth is hilarious as their airhead eyecandy filmmaker feig keeps everything moving at full speed filling scenes with eyecatching effects and a continual barrage of witty verbal and visual jokes several scenes feel oddly chopped together with subplots that appear and disappear and running gags that dont quite catch on but thanks to the energetic likeability of the central quartet none of that really matters and as it goes on the film becomes even funnier and genuinely scarier than the original which bodes well for the launch of a new franchise as long as the writers have somewhere interesting to send these characters
Sep 12 2016,positive,the new installment is pretty damn funny and stands as tall as the staypuft marshmallow man
Sep 9 2016,neutral, s take on the supernatural comedy is conceptually shrewd a feminist twist on a beloved classic casting kristen wiig melissa mccarthy kate mckinnon and leslie jones as the wielders of the ohsophallic proton guns used to zap and wrangle spooks and specters but feig and katie dippolds screenplay is a slipshod mess of forgettable gags tossed into a generic plot puffed up with unremarkable special effects its also besieged with references to the 1984 film which backfire because including them doesnt stoke nostalgia as much as it begs unfavorable comparison to be clear nobody watches the original for its depth of character  bill murray dan aykroyd and harold ramis were little more than charismatic goofball conduits for witty and quotable catchphrases wiig mccarthy mckinnon and jones look like theyre making up the characters on the fly as they recite weary cliches say hello to my little friend wiig halfheartedly yells as she blasts the bejeezus out of a cgi ghost in a scene i remember only because i was taking notes wiig plays erin gilbert a physicist discredited in academia for her studies in the supernatural she mends an acrimonious friendship with abby yates mccarthy after they witness a fullon metaphysical phenomenon erin sort of skeptical except when she isnt seeks physical proof of the paranormal and she gets it when a ghost in new york citys aldridge mansion vomits green spew in her face if thats not enough the sliming is repeated twice more in the first act as if the movies goop budget exceeded the salaries of its writers mccarthy and wiigs bland turns as literally buttonedup eggheads are eclipsed by current saturday night live cast member mckinnon whose jillian holtzmann is a spunky punkhaired inventress in omnipresent goggles rejected by institutions both legit and rinkydink the trio pass on an old manhattan firehouse  its 21000 per month to rent  and set up their gear above a chinese restaurant fielding calls for unearthly activity they gain a relatively gregarious fourth member in jones former subway clerk patty tolan as well as some infamy which leads to jokes about crass internet commenters  a direct reference to the backlash feig received upon announcing an allfemale ghostbusters cast feig has a reputation for helming strong femmecomedies with tight narratives and punchy jokes  wiig vehicle bridesmaids mccarthys the heat and spy more apt comparisons than the 84 ghostbusters perhaps its worth noting that the directors weakest effort isnt his original idea this remake  not a sequel or a prequel its a pure regurgitation set in its own reality where bill murray plays an entirely different character  flounders when it should crackle the direction is sloppy scenes dawdle and dillydally when they should poke and jab theres little narrative flow or suspense as the ghostbusters zap glowing satanic gargoyles and evilspiritpossessed parade balloons while pursuing the disaffected dweeb neil casey behind the mayhem chris hemsworth turns up as the ghostbusters extraordinarily dimwitted secretary another example of a flash of inspiration that feels underdeveloped and never really pays off you can see the seams in the films calculation sense its desire to inspire girls and women with strong role models but it fails to capitalize on all that talent the charisma curiously capped it also stumbles in its subjective objective to be funny  i laughed twice when i should be losing count  recycling old jokes from the first ghostbusters and from other movies instead of creating new ones boo yes boo john serba is film critic and entertainment reporter for mlivecom and other advance affiliates read all his film reviews from 2016 here email him at jserbamlivecom or follow him on twitter or facebook if you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site we may receive compensation by using this site you consent to our user agreement and agree that your clicks interactions and personal information may be collected recorded andor stored by us and social media and other thirdparty partners in accordance with our privacy policy use of andor registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our  user agreement updated 442023  privacy policy and cookie statement  and your privacy choices and rights  updated 12312023  2024 advance local media llc all rights reserved about us the material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of advance local
