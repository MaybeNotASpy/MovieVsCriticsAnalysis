Sep 24 2023,positive, even though i saw this movie three days after it opened i felt like it might as well have been three weeks after its release last summer there were four superhero movies and i saw every one of them on their opening day first show of the day unfortunately this just wasnt possible with the avengers but considering that it made over 200 million in three days i dont think marvel really noticed my missing 10 also with all the money it made i dont really feel like i need to go over the whole plot for you guys because it feels like everyone has already seen it instead just like i did with iron man 2 its going to be much easier to just go over how well i think each characteractor did in this movie and thatll also be a lot more fun for me before i do i suppose i can just briefly say that loki as made famous in thor also made famous by just being thors brother uses the tesseract which all comic book fans should recognize as the cosmic cube to teleport an intergalactic army to destroy the world in retaliation iron man thor captain america the hulk hawkeye and black widow are called together to fight the impending galactic war brief enough now i get to talk about everybody maybe its rdjs public personality that gets me kind of annoyed with him and the fact that he is kind of full of himself but considering his financial and critical success has warranted him being a tad bragadocious i was also nervous that the whole movie would focus on him considering hes already got two iron man movies under his belt and i always associate captain america as the leading avenger even though i had these reservations i was glad to see that tony stark didnt have much more screen time than anyone else and considering he didnt have to burden the weight of the whole film on his shoulders he was able to be a more comical tony stark than wed already seen lots of oneliners jabs at other characters and an overall tendency to downplay the seriousness of a situation steve rogers even called him out on the fact that he was selfcentered and narcissistic which made me nervous that thered be a scene where steve rogers would have to say some you really are a hero bullshit but we were spared even though iron man was a key part of defeating the aliens nobody made a big deal out of it which really fits in with the tony stark i know that despite no matter how many successes he might have hes still kind of an egotistical prick and nobody wants to pay him any compliments i love captain america call me oldfashioned for loving america and ill call you a goddamned communist what i love about his character is that he always knows what is right and does everything in his power to stand up for it whether it was in the civil war storyline where he had to allow himself to be arrested or sacrificing himself at the end of captain america the first avenger he knows what to do and doesnt hesitate one scene in particular near the end of the film despite not being the most powerful member of the team he told everyone exactly what to do and exactly when to do it and everyone fell into rank they knew that this guy had fought evil incarnate in world war ii and trust him with everything whether he was breaking up a fight between thor and iron man or jumping across the helicarrier to literally smack a grenade out of the air to protect stark cap really proved that hes more than just a science experiment i also stand by my opinion that chris evans is handsome enough and funny enough to put him into any superhero outfit and do a great job remember how i mentioned that the thor movie really only served as a stepping stone to build up to the avengers boy howdy was i right even though thor wasnt the best superhero movie last summer it introduced you to a regal character who lives in a world completely removed from and much more vast than anything us humans on earth could even wrap our heads around he proves himself not only wise in the way he tries to handle loki and his desire to merely take him back to asgard but also showed how powerful and essentially godlike when he knocks hulk on his ass with one punch or summons lightning to vaporize and shit ton of aliens id say that in films just like in the comics thor works much better as a supporting cast member than as a the major player he could basically solve everything problem with a giant hammer and some lightning you might have found loki to be a quivering whining prick in thor so imagine how big of a douchebag he got after floating around the universe with nothing but the thought of vengeance in mind they were able to play up the god of mischief aspect much more in this movie as we saw how easy it was for him to manipulate humans rather than in thor and he was just playing tricks on his brother we were able to see how cowardly he was and knew he wasnt nearly as powerful as any one of the avengers and had to call on someone elses army to fight for him he strategically manipulated every character to feed off of one anothers insecurities and even though he wasnt physically some sort of powerhouse you could see how annoying he could be to deal with hiddleston was also showing some vulnerability as an adopted son who never received the love of his father and even though you knew he was the villain had a tiny bit of sympathy for his situation this was the part of the movie i was most worried about considering that after two movies based on hulk theres yet to be a successful incarnation of him on film the thing about this character that people want to see most is actually whats easiest to put on the big screen which is a big green monster destroying everything the more interesting parts of the character are figuring out how he deals with this timebomb thats inside of him and the effect it had on his psychological state luckily through the nature of this being an ensemble film dr banner was only used in small doses mostly to show off his level of intelligence there were a few scenes between dr banner and tony stark that were really fun to watch because they both felt like they had found an intellectual peer and playmate when dr banner left and hulk showed up obviously it was fucking awesome he smashed everything i went get into everything he smashed but the smashing scenes were fun i also kept doing doubletakes when a character said banner because i thought our dog might be in the theater i made a pretty bold claim with iron man 2 which was that scarlett johansson was a good choice to play black widow and that she was one of the best parts of that movie but most people thought i was just distracted by her tits i suppose there might be a little truth to that but just because she was good in this role doesnt mean i think shes a good actress in fact i think shes not a good actress and every other movie ive seen her in she just seems distant and emotionally apathetic to everything going on around her luckily while portraying a russian assassin and spy having an outward appearance of not giving a shit about anything or being emotionally involved in anything going on things work out pretty well granted in this movie she had a few moments that seemed a little too superhuman and farfetched in regards to her abilities but it was really only one sequence so i can forgive her mostly because of well you know boobs having only really appeared as a silhouette in thor and having no other film appearances hawkeye was obviously going to be a tough sell as an avenger rather than try to give him a long backstory we instead spend most of the film seeing barton as a villain who is having his mind controlled by loki one reason i really liked them doing this was that it removed the need for a backstory because all you saw was hawkeye being a badass with a bow and arrow and showing of a multitude of different trick arrows another reason i liked this was because in the marvel universe hawkeye was introduced as a villain he might have only been a villain for three issues before joining the avengers but still its something thats constantly referenced in the books and i think that using him as a villain for the first half of the movie not only showed you his abilities but also made you enjoy the heroic things he was doing that much more two things i didnt like however was the fact that the mind control he was under was undone by black widow just punching him a whole bunch and i figured lokis spells would be a little more powerful i also think that hawkeye should have been played by alan alda but i guess jeremy renner was an acceptable substitute although i thought his cameo in iron man was pretty cool the other times this incarnation of nick fury havent been as faithful to the character as i had liked granted that basically means i didnt really care for his scenes in iron man 2 but samuel l jackson is a character on his own he has a reputation of coming across like a badass but also being really funny talented and can deliver these badass lines or insults while adding a smirk to the end of them to let you know hes just fucking with you the nick fury i wanted to see wasnt a jokester or anything other than a grizzled war veteran who has gone to hell and back to ensure the safety of the country he so loves to defend its almost like he has the heart of captain america but with the skills of black widow well maybe not the bazongas of black widow but the covert spy stuff lucky for me they toned down furys interactions with the team so you knew he was the one in charge and wasnt taking shit from anybody there was also a scene that involved him motivating the team by showing them something taken out of a dead agents coat but once the team leaves another character pointed out that they werent actually in his coat but in the agents locker this showed that fury was willing to do anything and everything to get the reaction from people that he knew had to be sparked in them even if that meant lying to them his role in this film definitely made up for the doubts i had going into it someone who was introduced a few years ago to plant the seed of what shield was and where all these marvel movies were going agent coulson has become a loved character to many fans even though he is typically only in marvel movies delivering half a dozen lines those lines are welltimed with great delivery by gregg even giving robert downey jr a run for his money in a few scenes we got that sense from coulson again in avengers and adding in the obsession that a shield agent would clearly have for captain america the fanboy moments between coulson and steve rogers were really charming and endearing and congratulations to mr gregg for having the character take a permanent seat in the marvel universe in not just films but being introduced into the comics as well if theres one show i hate hearing people tell me is funny its the big bang theory if theres two shows that i hate hearing people tell me is funny its the big bang theory and how i met you mother knowing that smulders was on that show i figured the only reason she landed the role was to get audiences of that show interested lucky for me i was wrong dead wrong well not dead wrong but i wanted to say that maria hill is a tough character because she is essentially nick furys righthand man but considering she is younger and a female the relationship could easily fall into a stereotype this is typically avoided and i always viewed the nick furymaria hill relationship to be a lot like the yodaluke skywalker relationship in the empire strikes back we know that the apprentice can clearly handle their shit but they still also have a lot to learn we saw maria hill questioning fury on his actions even doubting his choices but knew her rank and never opposed his views clearly knowing that he was the director of shield for a reason she handled what she needed to handle and stepped up when necessary letting the audience know that shes be okay in the event that fury was ever compromised and she would have to take the reins in  short everyone did a good job in varying degrees wow i could have just said that instead of typing up all those other things i knew this movie was going to be good everyone knew this movie was going to be good in fact id even say this movie was a great superhero movie as far as things i didnt like id say there were only two issues maybe only one and a halfand theyre only issues let me clarify i had zero problems with this movie one issue was that i was disappointed that nobody ever shouted avengers assemble but considering this was their very first gathering i could understand that not showing up naturally i guess i hoped that in the epilogue after all of the action fury would have mentioned assembling in some way i know that any lines of dialogue i could come up with right now would be cheesy but joss whedon is a much better writer than i am and i guess i hoped he had found a natural way to slip that in the other issue was that even though this was a great superhero movie it was just thata great superhero movie this movie wont win any oscars any acting or directing awards or be recognized with any other outstanding achievements this movie is by no means a bad movie not by a long shot it was a witty smart actionpacked fistpumping stand up in your seat and highfive your friends fun movie after seeing the trailer for prometheus and the dark knight rises it was hard to thing of the avengers as being any sort of gamechanger in the superhero genre im also not saying that this movie needed to change the way we view superhero movies it just felt very safe safe isnt bad safe is good thats why people where helmets and seatbelts for some reason which i cant quite put my finger on i kept having flashbacks to when i first saw independence day maybe it was because it was just a big fun summer movie or the fact that there were alien invaders or the fact that you knew the good guys would win i had the same excited feelings for the avengers as i had almost twenty years ago with will smith whether youre a comic book fan or not you will have fun with this movie and even though we spent close to two and a half hours watching this movie this only felt like the beginning i was totally willing to watch these characters interacting with another for two and a half more hours just to see what kind of trouble theyd get into oh yeah and i think i predicted a few years ago how closely this movie would mirror the events of the ultimates comic book series and i am glad to know i was right what the fuck are these chitauri aliens just call them goddamned skrulls and be done with it i think you were right in saying that the movie was good but it was still a superhero movie i had the same trailers before it and truly in comparison the avengers is exactly what it is and nothing more a superhero movie a very safe one at that im not one for reading comics but is it really possible to create a superhero movie that would shake things up that much i also managed to snag a copy of that poster you used above it wont get the prime wall spot but i can still say i watched the avengers assemble for 5 years i was just trying to give people what they want i think everyone knew going into this that plot wasnt going to be what people were going for they were just excited to take those few moments theyve seen in previous movies where tony stark talks to thunderbolt ross or agent coulson finds thors hammer and stretch that into lots of fun interactions  as far as shaking things up id definitely say that the dark knight totally shook the status quo of what could be accomplished through the use of characters created in comic books although the avengers is a great superhero movie i think the dark knight is just a great movie regardless of genre or source material i was sitting in a diner while those posters went onsale and had to use my mobile to try and get a copyand failed you jerk the only marvel poster i have that mondo released were the olly moss captain america set and the tyler stout captain america which i only got because i won a lottery he held im jealous yah i usually work all day so it is rare i get one i literally missed the earlier marvel posters by 5 minutes i managed to get a cabin in the woods one as well its funny i almost told you my tips for trying to snag these prints then realized that if you buy one i cant the cabin in the woods came out at the same time as the exorcist one did and i got exorcist in my cart but when i got greedy trying for cabin in the woods they both sold out my life sucks
Jan 7 2023,positive, unlike the xmen which arrived full formed in 2000 the avengers is the comic book version of the supergroup with stars in their own right coming together not without some friction and egothumping for a battle royale so marvel put together a long term plan launching their stars in a series of solo films and building an entire universe of heroes and villains for the screen they teased audiences with brief crossovers and then after years of setting it all up brought together the team robert downeys cheeky cocky iron man chris hemsworths warrior prince thor chris evans earnest captain america and mark ruffalo taking over as bruce banner and the hulk the third actor in as many films giving the character a haunted embittered edge to round out the team the film expands the role of black widow scarlett johansson a slinky superagent from the second iron man film and adds hawkeye jeremy renner an archer marksman briefly seen in thor  samuel jackson presides over it all as nick fury it could have been a disaster with so many characters to juggle and personalities to respect while engaging in a big noisy apocalyptic battle with no less than gods and aliens and it was a measured gamble to bring in joss whedon a man with wellearned fan credentials and an affinity for this kind of genre storytelling to write and direct no question that he brings smarts and style and selfaware wit to his productions buffy the vampire slayer on tv serenity on the big screen but his audiences have been shall we say small and passionate it was the perfect marriage of subject and sensibility you wouldnt accuse the avengers of being good drama but the sprawling splashy spectacle and its muchmuchmuchlargerthanlife heroes makes for a genuine comic book epic for the big screen whedon loves his characters and enjoys tossing them together to watch the sparks of colliding egos fly and he has a knack for keeping an eye on the stories and the characters in the mess of battle but mostly he embraces the elevated melodrama of the conceitthese superpowered beings are our answer to the greek gods and heroes and they were nothing if not unpredictable mercurial and vindictiveand then works his way back to the humanity under the costume and it doesnt hurt letting downey off the leash to rile up the gathered egos you get the sense that sure whedon is having a blast visualizing the scope of a comic book battle with the millions of dollars of cgi at his command but hes having even more fun setting these lone wolves loose to sniff around and bark at each other before warily settling into a pack dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and twitter the dvd and bluray editions from disney include commentary by joss whedon and the featurette assembling the ultimate team the bluray includes the more featurettes and deleted scenes plus the second screen experience which requires an ipad a downloadable app and a connection to the same wifi network as the bluray player and a bonus dvd copy and yes there is a bluray 3d edition a 4disc combo pack that also includes all of the above so youve got a standard bluray and dvd for non3d showings plus a digital copy and a digital download of the inspired by album sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view
Nov 20 2022,positive, developed in 1963 as marvels answer to dcs superhero team justice league featuring superman batman wonder woman green lantern flash et al the avengers supplies a comic tradition where numerous superheroes join forces against a common or superior enemy but not without facing off against each other first naturally superheroes have bold personalities theyre champions of their particular realmwhy shouldnt they swell with pride about it but when assembled such personalities clash and infighting occurs and our favorite heroes must inevitably learn to work as a team before they can tackle the colossal threat that brought them together another comic tradition is the crossover where an overarching storyline unfurls in the pages of multiple issues and usually ends in a doublesized chromiumcovered megabook to conclude the storyline the avengers is the equivalent of this but not without planting the seeds for future sequels and spinoffs marvel studios started something wholly unprecedented in 2008 by laying the groundwork for this film in iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger each individual entry contains tidbits pointing toward this larger film and by maintaining a handson approach to their productions they ensure each entry is strong enough as a standalone feature but also a key component in a larger whole as a result there comes an expectation that the avengers being a culmination of several successful blockbusters should be nothing short of epic it should appeal to both fanboys and those unfamiliar with comics broadening the storylines established by the preceding films it should give each character their due and yet not allow a single star to shine too brightly it should be bigger louder smarter more expensive and ultimately more entertaining than the other films so does it succeed hell yes with these requirements in mind marvel hired writerdirector joss whedon to helm the avengers hes a former comic author in the pages of xmen hes garnered a cult following for his tv show buffy the vampire slayer he directed one modestly successful film with serenity an offshoot of his show firefly and hes also a resounding comic nerd and generally adored among fanboys as such he appreciates the material enough to know what comic fans expect from a film like this because its what he would expect more importantly he understands how to make the material universal adapting it in such a way that general audiences will be able to identify with the central characters without the need to know their offscreen backstory whats more working with a reported budget of 220 million whedon has resolved to put every dollar toward wowing his audience with the most satisfying event movie to come out of hollywood in recent memory working from an initial draft by zak penn xmen the last stand whedons script picks up where 2011s thor and captain america left off banished asgardian mischiefmaker loki tom hiddleston forms an alliance with an alien race called the chitauri lizard things with biomechanical armor promising them the tesseract an energy cube of unlimited power if they lay waste to earth so he may rule loki steals the macguffin from its current holders nick fury samuel l jackson and his superspy agency shield and hides it while the chitauri plan their attack at the same time fury relocates to his new hqa massive cloaked flying aircraft carrier a spectacular effectand plans for the worst to find the tesseract and stop loki his agency brings together a proposed team of heroes the avengers when the personalities gather the films first half explores their squabbling and clash of egos until finally they band together for an exhausting second half in the battle against loki and his alien army whedons storytelling is at its best as he balances screen time amid earths mightiest heroes portrayed by some very fine actors topbilled and center stage robert downey jrs tony stark dons his iron man armor carting his genius behind his snarky motormouth and signature narcissism another classic egocentric thor chris hemsworth travels from asgard to confront his adopted brother loki spouting shakespearian brogue along the way mark ruffalo who replaces edward norton as bruce banner brings a softspoken nerviness and impressive nuance to his character his alterego the hulk was performed through motion capture and looks like ruffalo the effect is entirely convincing and occasionally brilliant displaced in an era not his own steve rogers aka captain america chris evans brings a naïve but necessary idealism to the team to help unite them reprising her iron man 2 role scarlett johansson represents the sole female member of the group as the former assassin black widow but whedon has gone to great lengths to make her stand out arguably more than any other the newest member seen briefly in thor is a bowandarrow sharpshooter named hawkeye jeremy renner who seems somewhat underdeveloped next to the others save for the resident captain each character could be described as does not play well with others obvious attention is placed on marvels most successful hero and franchise fanfavorite iron man but this is hardly a solo effort granted the films climax takes place on manhattan streets surrounding the newly erected stark tower but starks dramatic arc feels less significant than those of banner or black widow in the incredible hulk banner still struggled to control his green rages but in the exciting finale his counterpart becomes relatively selfawarehe becomes a hero instead of a monster seeing this side of hulk may be more consumable for audiences who can finally root for a character able to differentiate between good guys and bad guys ruffalo an actor normally associated with indie dramas admittedly outdoes norton and eric bana before him when his character blossomsenough for audiences to clamor for another solo hulk feature with ruffalo as the star likewise haunted we learn much more about johanssons black widow and her bloodsoaked past her best scene is not only a filmbest but provides the films most impressive acting she interrogates loki who responds with jawdroppingly violent and cruel threats snarled with precision by hiddleston the look of terror on johanssons face is undeniable and then punctuated with a wonderful turnaround with any comic book film there are always mildtogreat disappointments in how the filmmakers have adapted characters from the page to the screen some are merely nitpicking on the part of fanboys others are noticeable by anyone for example anyone could tell too many villains clogged up spiderman 3 whereas no one outside of a comic book shop cared how galactus was rendered into a cloudthing in fantastic four 2 here fanboys can delight in how much whedon gets right but in addition to not exploring hawkeye enough whedons choice to provide our heroes with a high body count via anonymous chitauri aliens obscure marvel characters to be sure is questionable granted his story infuses elements of the avengers issue 1 from 1963 in which loki manipulates hulk into a frenzy and in turn unites the avengers but in the last half whedons focus remains on loki orchestrating a war of chitauri pawns of course this decision makes an effective storytelling device by allowing the avengers first assembly to be about an ideal gathering of heroes more than the disposable villains still the comic nerd in me wanted a more recognizable crowd of baddies for our heroes to clobber fortunately the chitauris presence leads to a postendtitles scene that will leave fans giddy however negligible a disappointment whedons choice of alien race may be he makes up for it in his arrangement of stunning battle sequences superhero smackdowns and most importantly a riotous sense of humor early on iron man and thor go headtohead followed by the two powerhouse characters thor and hulk throwing each other around their conflict comes up again later on unexpectedly abruptly and hilariously likewise starks quickwitted zingers and caps dislocation in another century furnish no end of laughs in whedons usual brand of smart punchy dialogue these conflicts and joking moments are mostly for comic effect but they also illustrate how noncohesive these characters seem when placed next to one another and how they require wrangling to become a team shield agent coulson clark gregg a niceguy character present in this ongoing franchise since iron man serves as superhero glue in a subplot both funny and tender hes starstruck by captain america and wants only f0r the captain to sign his vintage superhero trading card set as whedon injects copious amounts of humor into the proceedings he plays with his characters dynamic and personal limitations in a selfaware style but without risking the integrity of the characters themselves rather he enhances them when its all over only one question remains how will audiences react to solo stories for characters like iron man thor captain america and the hulk in the future a film as grandiose as the avengers threatens to dwarf anything placed next to it wont next years iron man 3 and thor 2 seem underwhelming in comparison could marvel have unwittingly undone their smaller franchises by making too good a film here my hope is that as long as marvel continues to distribute the kinds of quality superhero films weve come to expect since iron man faithful audiences will return for the next building block not only in the individual stories but in anticipation of the inevitable sequel to this giantsized crossover marvel should take care and make the best films they can in the coming years as they risk turning the inbetween movies into nothing more than the next building block to the avengers 2 that said you wont likely find a more rousing purely entertaining popcornmunching blockbuster this summer no spectacle on par with this film has arrived in theaters since avatar and at a similarly long 142 minutes the film breezes by on these levels and a plane of sheer superhero movie joy the avengers delivers in every respect its not a flawless film what film is but its modest flaws mostly the quibbles of comic book aficionados are washed away by its incomparable height of showmanship that has yet to be matched in this genre while christopher nolans batman films elevated the superhero film by achieving an unparalleled dramatic and artistic timbre marvels decidedly more comicbooky endeavors find their pinnacle in the avengers just as it should the film outdoes what have now become its five prequels after four years worth of building piece by piece against mounting expectations marvel and whedon have managed to satisfy the majority of fan expectations and in some ways even exceeded them
Aug 19 2022,positive, marvel studios the avengers is the culmination of what may be the most ambitious project in film history for those movie fans who have been living in a cave for the past several years marvel has been releasing several individual superhero movies that have all set the table for this huge event film two iron man pictures captain america thor and the incredible hulk have all been linked together through brief reoccuring cameos and hidden aftercredits scenes that refer to something called the avengers initiative as any comic book geek could tell you thats a reference to the marvel superhero team that first debuted in comics in 1963 on the surface the idea for an avengers film thats directly tied into other individual superhero movies sounds great on the flip side even though the other films have been good there are still plenty of areas where the avengers could go off track well as a movie and comic book fan im happy to say that the avengers not only meets the challenges of its vision but its an action packed adrenaline rush that offers some of the most fun ive had at the theater this year to handle this rather large undertaking marvel placed the project in the hands of joss whedon whedon was a good choice mainly due to his variety of experience hes found success in television film and comic books and he uses his knowledge of each combined with disneys deep pockets to create a movie that would appeal to the fanboy and the casual moviegoer alike one thing that helps whedon is that the film doesnt require your traditional origin story while we do see the generation of the team we know all of the characters from the previous marvel movies so whedon is able to dive right into the story that being said dont mistake this for a deep engaging story that will challenge the audience but ill also say that anyone going into the avengers for that has already missed the point throughout the other marvel films particularly captain america we learned about a cosmic energy source known as the cosmic cube in the avengers sheild head honcho nick fury samuel l jackson has a team of scientists led by physicist dr erik selvig stellan skarsgard trying to harness the power of the cube now known as the tesseract but suddenly the cube activates and opens a portal allowing the evil loki tom hiddleston to entire the facility and steal it knowing the immense threat associated with the tesseract being in the wrong hands fury activates the avengers initiative but getting such a diverse group of superheroes to cooperate and coexist proves to be a lot harder than expected fury starts by contacting black widow scarlett johansson he sends her to india to find bruce banner mark ruffalo while sending agent coulson clark gregg to stark tower to speak to tony stark robert downey jr while the two are gone he approaches steve rogers chris evans and sends him on a mission to retrieve the tesseract upon hearing of lokis involvement the thunder god thor chris hemsworth also entires the mix as does the marksman and assassin known as hawkeye jeremy renner each of the heroes have their own baggage and their own personalities which often times clash to the point of dysfunction but their disagreements give us some of the movies cooler and often times funnier moments as you would expect the situation worsens and its up to the team to pull together or the world will be taken over starting with new york city its a pretty cutanddry story but it really works because whedon understand his characters and he knows what kind of movie hes trying to make his familiarity with the marvel comic book universe is clearly seen throughout the picture but nowhere more than in his treatment of the characters as a comic book fan i was really impressed with how they all felt right and its clear that the source material played a big role in shaping the onscreen versions but whedon never falls into the trap of taking things too seriously the movie is filled with laugh out loud funny moments that are cleverly used and they never feel cheap or forced they mix perfectly with the razorsharp dialogue and the jawdropping action sequences but the fantastic action and special effects shouldnt surprise anyone afterall the avengers is a superhero action picture and whedon knows it the action comes at a furious pace and i can see where some may view it as relentless personally i was completely wrapped up in it the movie sells the superhero action through some of the most spectacular visuals and editing that youll see i was blown away i cant write a review of the avengers without mentioning the incredible cast one of the reasons the marvel films and particularly the avengers works so well is because of the amazing casting everyone is invested in their character and not one single performer phones it in downey jr continues to be the perfect tony stark mainly due to his natural ability to use sarcasm and fire off funny quips without hesitation chris evans known more for his goofier roles  is also quite good as the serious and straightlaced captain america i also really liked mark ruffalo as bruce banner hes the third actor to take on the role and he nails it much like downey jr hemsworth is the perfect thor and he shares some of the films best scenes with hulk renner and johannson also handle their roles very well but i have to give special time to the wonderful tom hiddleston hes a remarkably diverse actor and he shows it here his loki is mysterious mischievous and evil and hiddleston slithers through his scenes stealing many of them there are also nice smaller performances from gregg gwyneth paltrow and cobie smulders that are just icing on the cake i can see where some people may not respond as positively as i did to the avengers the action is pretty much starttofinish and if youre not interested in the characters youll have a hard time embracing the story there are also a few shortcuts taken with the story for the sake of convenience that could have been done a little better for me i have a connection to these characters through all my years of comic book reading and this film exceeded my expectations but being a comic reader isnt a prerequisite for enjoying this movie if youve liked what marvel has put out leading to it youre going to love the avengers sure its a loud energetic summer popcorn flick but its also a really good one its honest and it never tries to be something its not featuring one of the better ensemble casts and some topnotch directing from joss whedon the avengers is a big budget blockbuster that actually deserves all the money its going to rake it whens the next showing im ready to see it again yeah i didnt respond to it as warmly as you have but that is most likely due to having never read a comic in my life  on the other hand i also agree that youve got a great cast an undeniably iconic bunch of characters and some impressive action so whats not to like  a lot of fun but just not a five star film to me i dont give many 5 star ratings and i tried finding reasons not to give this one 5 stars but i just couldnt i simple had too much fun i was also incredibly impressed with whedons ability to bring the other tiein films to such a climax which is what the avengers is great review keith i just finished writing mine as well itll be up tomorrow i agree w your assessment its definitely a fun movie and one thatd be fun to watch over and over again thanks a bunch ruth im anxious to read your take on the movie i dont give many 5 star ratings but this film really worked for me when considering it for exactly what it is im having to wait until the weekend hoping to check it out either friday or saturday well worth a second viewing on the big screen decided to drop the movie down to a 4 12 star film its not that i came up with a substantial reason or that a serious flaw or gaping hole came to mind but i began comparing it to the few other films i have given 5 stars to i asked myself  between the avengers and  which movie would i be more inclined to watch again first in almost every instant it was the other 5 star film i also considered that the avengers really does require the viewing of the other leadin films to get a grounded understanding of what the bigger picture is for me that worked extremely well i saw each leadin film and im a big comic book fan but how would it appeal to casual fans and how does it stand on its own i still stand by every word of my review and for me personally it was an amazing experience to see these characters come to life before my eyes and while what marvel was able to accomplish is nothing short of amazing im not sure if the avengers is what should be called a 5star alltime classic a great movie no doubt but maybe not a 5 star one the film is an action film not a thinking film but great film anyway had fun watching it the action however was too fast sometimes i couldnt catch up
Aug 14 2022,positive, the words never before seen unprecedented groundbreaking and revolutionary get thrown around a great deal in the movie business  everything wants to be on that cutting edge ahead of everyone else  few movies deliver on those adjectives  when that cabin door opens in 1939s the wizard of oz and everything sepia turns to color a new world is opened not just in the movie but with movies themselves  in 1995 when pixars toy story brought computers into animation that was a game changer another buzz label  just three years ago avatars technical achievements in performancecapture technology and 3d filmmaking raised the bar and was something dreamed of but never thought possible  i may be picking out too tall of a pedestal but theres an element of newly broken ground to the culmination that is the avengers from marvel studios and walt disney pictures where the avengers breaks historic ground is in longterm planning and scope  many films in many years have had several years of tedious planning put into them but not like this  plenty of film franchises have gone on to make connected sequels  the harry potter series was built for that but not like this  never before has a film attempted to merge this many individual entities  aside from classic horror showdowns like frankenstein meets the wolfman nothing of the sort in terms of uniting characters has ever been attempted at this scale  in my lifetime the closest ive ever seen to a character being in more than one project was michael keatons cocky federal agent ray nicolette appearing as a cameo in 1998s out of sight from steven soderbergh and as a supporting character in 1997s jackie brown from quentin tarantino  both films were based on elmore leonard novels but that doesnt mean jack foley george clooney and jackie brown pam grier were going to teamup and start a crime spree together down the road  what the avengers had in mind was bigger than that marvel studios gained control of their own properties instead of farming them off to the highest bidder ie spiderman is housed at sony and the xmen universe remains at 20th century fox  success allowed them to start bankrolling and selling their own movies without splitting with distributors like paramount and universal  that clout increased when walt disney purchased all of marvel entertainment movies comics and all on new years eve 2009  they became their own creative control  few franchises can say that through uncompromising planning and genius forethought marvel shrewdly enacted a master blueprint of developing five individual origin films 2008s iron man and the incredible hulk 2010s iron man 2 and last years thor and captain america the first avenger from four different directors that built off of one another were interconnected and culminated to the common goal of this massive teamup we are witnessing with the avengers   many studio chiefs just ask warner brothers with their dc comics library of superman batman and the like have dreamed this but none have tried it and none have succeeded until now  the avengers is exactly that a dream come true  no one thought it was possible but marvel stuck to their guns and the payoff monumentally delivers  in the avengers we learn very early on that the cosmic cube aka the terrasect a source of endless power wielded and recovered from captain america the first avenger will be the object of our villains affections  that villain is loki the excellent tom hiddleston the adopted brother of thor and brief former king of asgard and he demolishes an underground shield base to take it away from nick fury samuel l jackson with a full role instead of his usual cameos and company  he also gains mind control over terrasect specialist dr erik selvig stellan skarsgard from thor and shields sharpshooting archery assassin clint hawkeye barton jeremy renner  fearing the chitauri alien army that loki has behind him fury decides to reactivate his rumored avengers initiative as a response team to lokis global threat fury the trusty agent coulson clark gregg and natasha black widow rommanoff scarlett johansson begin to enlist and recuit the resurrected wwii hero captain america chris evans the reclusive gamma scientist bruce banner mark ruffalo taking over for and improving on edward norton and take a gamble working with iron man himself tony stark robert downey jr zinging the oneliners when the god of thunder thor chris hemsworth tracks loki to earth he too sees that shield and he have a common enemy and goal that being recovering their lost colleagues and terrasect  thus a team is formed but one with many kinks and differences which come to light and clash wonderfully as the avengers plays out while robert downey jr is the headliner each main character gets their time to shine in the center spotlight with not only wow moments of action bliss but also meaty characterdriven scenes  combined with extremely wellwritten laughoutloud humor from joss whedon the interactive experiences between these formerly separate personalities is outstanding  whedon as a fellow fanboy on the inside and popular comic book writer on the outside knew when and how to use and respect the epic moments that occur throughout the movie  with all of that said mark ruffalos hulk steals the show  he instigates the best shock awe and leapoutofyourchair spots out of everyone on the team with this nearly fiveyear sixmovie blueprint of building to the avengers completed it will be interesting to see where marvel studios goes with both avengers sequels and new individual adventures from these nowiconic characters  iron man 3 thor 2 and captain america 2 all have the green light  after this film i expect a renewed interest for more hulk that may lead to that character getting a muchdeserved sequel hopefully with ruffalo at the center  as with any marvel movie stay after for the credits for two extra scenes  one sets up the likely heavy on the horizon for the avengers 2 and the other is for pure geeky enjoyment  once again all of this scope in the avengers constitutes nothing short of a moviemaking miracle  go back a rewrite the definitions for unprecedented groundbreaking and those other buzz words from the opening the bar has officially been raised lesson 1 power corrupts simply put power corrupts especially if its a mythical cube that could be a source of limitless energy for an entire planet when something comes around looking stronger than you you respond by raising your level of strength  after that you want a show of strength to prove that youre still on top lesson 2 the motivation to join a team or a cause while nick fury and the people from shield talk a good talk about the threat of alien war each main character has their own reasons for being there staying there and fighting for this cause  motivation comes in many forms and many levels of strength  you will see that going on here lesson 3 stepping up when needed in order to get lesson 2 to happen for the motivation to work the decision must be made to commit and step up when it is necessary  the decisionmaking step follows the stimulus of motivation  again each one of the future avengers steps up in a different way lesson 4 working as a team once you get a team assembled and motivated they have to work together not against each other to succeed  on this team each bigtime player brings a different skill set of strengths and abilities that must be utilized properly and in the right moments in battle  kudos to captain america and his natural leadership ability
Jul 7 2022,positive,the avengers as a movie can be best described as one of the most prominent examples of a crowd pleaser
Feb 11 2022,positive, ever since the postcredit sequence in 2008s iron man fanboy audiences worldwide have eagerly awaited the assembling of the avengers marvels answer to dcs justice league the avengers made up of such heroes as iron man the hulk captain america and thor has always been a beloved comic book property for diehard marvel fans under the watchful eye of shield director nick fury the avengers would team up to take on the villains in the marvel canon while saving room for constant bickering among themselves ever since the moment samuel l jacksons fury told robert downey jrs tony stark of the planned initiative to bring earths mightiest heroes together marvel studios has introduced audiences to not just the carefree narcissistic iron man edward norton brought the hulk to the screen again in 08 but due to some contractualcreative differences nortons satisfying take on the big green man marked his only outing as the beast stark returned to the screen in 2010s love itorhate it iron man 2 aussie chris hemsworth best known at the time for a flashshot performance in 09s star trek brought the proud shakespearean thor to the big screen in 2011 in the same year chris evans completed the preavengers rally with captain americas origin through the thick and thin these setup movies have had their strengths and weaknesses everyone loves downey jrs tony stark but many complain the iron man movies lacked the scale necessary for superhero glory most have already forgotten about the incredible hulk a shame really i find the film highly underrated and thor and captain america the first avenger were enjoyable introductions to the characters no more and no less when joss whedon took the reins of the avengers a mighty task was placed in his hands bringing together so many different variables for one of the most anticipated films in recent memory requires a level of skill that very few directors possess the avengers proves that you have to let the experts take on the big projects in any other hands the avengers could have turned out to be a colossal train wreck honestly hiring anyone else but a veteran of the source material would have been a huge mistake on marvels behalf so far the studio has tapped directors that fit the content individual films perfectly whedon a proven champion of geekdom took on the task at hand and created a rare treat for fans of both the comic and film series while watching the avengers you cant help but see the level of complexity in the story i can image that bringing five different storylinesdynamic characters together for a summer blockbuster event must have been exhausting but whedon made it look easy his script masterfully pulls together the diverse members of this superhero team to take on a threat long established in the marvel universe the tesseract is no stranger to viewers this glowing cube of unlimited power came to light at the end of thor when nick fury introduces stellan skarsgårds kindly physicist to the object actually tony starks dad howard fished the relic out of the sea when searching for the thenlostinaction captain america the events of thor must have brought the cube back into the forefronts of the secretive shields mindset entering into the avengers the sosaid avengers initiative is no more downey jrs tony stark continues to further his weaponsfree empire with establishing a new line of stark towers large buildings than run on clean energy captain america himself steve rogers freshly defrosted after 70 years in ice continues to establish life in the 21st century thor as far as we know is resting peacefully in his kingdom of asgard thors devious brother loki starts off the events of the avengers with a bang the cast out prince a fan of what the tesseract can do for both him and a few of his otherworldly friends steals the artifact from shields headquarters while taking a few of its key members hostage under a mindaltering spell nick fury seeing this as an act of war assembles the supercharacters together to take on loki and whatever the trickster god has up his sleeve from this point on the avengers becomes a balancing act of epic proportions whedon manages to fit the booming ego of tony stark the gungho tothebooks captain america the nononsense thor the timidyetpotentially dangerous brue banner the expert archer hawkeye and the superspy black widow together in the same movie while throwing in a massive alien army a boatload of shield agents and some inspired set pieces to boot downey jrs stark never misses a beat and evans straightlaced take on captain has never been better hemsworth continues to prove why hes the perfect fit for thor and samuel l jackson expands his nick fury character into a true unabashed leader scarlett johanssons black widow gains added depth from whedons screenplay and johansson takes the character to a new level not yet previously established with her minimal presence in iron man 2 tom hiddleston continues to impress as the vile loki and clark gregg continues to bring the fun with his straightfaced agent coulson or to starks girlfriend pepper potts phil jeremy renners hawkeye adds to the fun and newcomer cobie smulders holds her own as maria hill furys righthand woman i couldnt help but become enamored with mark ruffalos take on bruce banner both he and whedon capture the character in a way that manages to honor the comic roots while bringing a fresh take to both bruce and the other guy while whedon takes hulk to smashhappy nirvana in the films latter sequences ruffalos quasisarcastic portrayal of banner had me hooked whedon gave him the words but ruffalo brought the power his scenes with downey jr create instant gratification the action sequences in this film rise above anything else in marvels long lineage of theatrical releases weve seen plenty of the new york assault in the promotional material but one striking section of the film has gone largely unspoiled and for good reason whedon orchestrates the mayhem with sheer amazement allowing for the characters to shine rather than fade into the scenery  a bane in michael bays transformers series while the film rests heavily on scientific jargon to lead the plot during the first half whedon pushes the gas in the last hourandahalforso to create one eyepopping hairraising scene after the other thankfully the film never forgets to add in a laugh here and there whether its one of tony starks wise quips or the realization of a pop culture reference on caps behalf the avengers remains constantly funny without ever sacrificing the seriousness of the scale from now on superhero movies in the marvel universe will look to the avengers as a shining beacon of what these films can aspire to be if you get the right talent in the drivers seat to lead the endeavor amazing benefits can be reaped joss whedon deserves a big pat on the back for what he did with the avengers the story works the acting is superb the humor is on key and the action sequences are breathtaking
Jul 28 2021,positive, enlargepeter opaskarars technica turns 21 at the end of this year but film coverage on site cant exactly purchase synthehol at the liquor store yet quietly weve been reviewing movies on the internet for 11 years nowa bakers dozen years if reviews of 3d experiences countstarting with this max payne piece that certainly qualifies as criticism but beginning in 2014 we made film a regular topic on site and these days we annually bounce from sxsw to fantastic fest with plenty of regional film events in between now this aint variety and we do not write about everything though we have covered beauty and the beast and the jungle book somehow but ars has quite a few highlights in the 2010s beyond just starting a dedicated culture section we failed at vulcan salutes with jake gyllenhall and ryan reynolds we caught the premiere of a academy awardnominated movie at nasas johnson space center somehow we even helped save a star warsadjacent movie from obscurity earning an imdb credit and inspiring a fulllength remake in the process   ars decade in review the 2010s    no foolinthe 2010s were a crazy decade for tech  the 2010s  decade of the exoplanet  the 2010s were a veritable golden age of opening credits in television  after an amazing decade in space these are humanitys top achievements  why the 2010s were the facebook decade    view more stories    so with the end of the decade rapidly approaching we felt it was ok to indulge our film listmaking impulses this is not necessarily a best films of the decade listundeniably great things like lady bird moonlight the master bridesmaids et al are fantastic films that do not really fall within our narrow wheelhouse of science technology and genre fare it is not a list of the most important films either as this decade of streamings rise female directors taking the reins continued globalization of cinema and a golden era for documentaries can likely be better explained elsewhere in the cinemacentric press but the following is definitely a list of the stuff from the last decade that continues to come up in conversation around the orbital hq years later and presumably these films will be forever fixtures of our streaming queues going forward its probably not a coincidence that during a decade when the most important and impactful technological change may prove to be the rise of the private space industry audiences were treated to a renaissance of space cinema too it turns out a great space movie does not have to involve intergalactic war or precise period piece drama though we all underrated first man folks if you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible alfonso cuaróns gravity may have been the intheater experience of the decade the vastness of space has never been more vivid even if some of the details may have irked our resident space purists the matt damonled the martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science no one knew linguistics was this fascinating back in 2016 but arrival just might be the overall best movie of the decade with the way it cleverly examines what we believe while simultaneously delivering a tense gripping scifi story and hidden figures puts the familiar periodpiece lens on an overlooked part of space history without glossing over the ugly bits while still feeling hopeful for what science and technology can achieve when the best and brightest can participate add any number of other fine space movies to this lotinterstellar ad astra etcbut this quartet revived a cinematic subset ars will always have a fondness for the 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes by no means did it start here the nolan batman trilogy began in the 2000s as did the mcu with iron man in 2008 but it became an expanded universe cinematic event these last 10 years the first avengers hit in 2012 and box offices havent looked back since picking favorites among the standard superhero fare feels impossible your preferences of memorable spiderman into the spiderverse ironman iron man 2 captain america winter soldier or other regulation superhero flicks ragnarok eversoslightly over the original deadpool may just depend on which hero your childhood allegiances line up toward the true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular avengers end game over the original guardians by a hair but the caped crusades well remember a decade or two from now all busted out of the familiar formula to some degree black panther showed not only was there audience appetite for a bigbudget black superhero flick but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism oppression and technological disparity logan took a hero long familiar to filmgoers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process and while wonder woman may be the most straightforward superheroy of the three it showed a femaleled comic book conquest was worth doing especially when it leveraged wellexecuted periodpiece elements with delightful sidekick chemistry for the future of the thenbeleaguered dc comics entertainment arm wonder woman also proved everything didnt have to be dark and brooding in order to reach an audience all the fun being had in hbos watchmen seems to indicate dc took the hint and ok its not a traditional superhero movie but we couldnt make an ofthedecade film list and exclude mad max fury road entirely like more traditional capedcrusader flicks this is an existing ip with an established hero that got a reimagining decades after the original it starts with a very super villainy evil plot our titular hero is being sucked for blood to heal the badteam war boys another hero has to help a group of women known as the five wives escape forced procreations the film also offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character finally perhaps most like the trio above this newest mad max film took a decidedly different approach to its familiar postapocalyptic world max rockatansky may be back invigorated by tom hardy but the star of the show is imperator furiosa charlize theron the postapocalyptic female hero scifi action fans deserve
Jun 24 2021,positive, the avengers is the biggest success marvel disney and the entire comic book movie industry has ever seen directed by joss whedon of firefly and buffy the vampire slayer fame the avengers was the first end result of the shared universe experiment that marvel studios was attempting this finally brought iron man thor the hulk captain america black widow hawkeye nick fury and more all together for a true celebratory fireworks display if this worked it would change the landscape of film forever the avengers would go on to not just be marvel studios biggest hit but it would become the third highestgrossing film of all time only behind james camerons avatar and titanic it is the textbook example of a comic book movie the gold standard to strive for and a validation of comic book storytelling as an art form it was a truly monumental success how was this achieved the choice for joss whedon to direct was perfect whedon is a master at directing an ensemble cast to the point where its basically what hes known for the exciting part of the avengers is seeing all of these different characters together and interacting onscreen and whedons penchant for being able to juggle multiple characters and their stories in addition to his trademark witty dialogue ensured that every avenger got their time to shine and their own arcs to go through its an impressive feat for a movie of this scale the avengers also proved to be accessible to general audiences even those who had never seen a single marvel film beforehand you dont necessarily need to have seen any of the previous films to understand whats happening in the avengers every characters introduction at the beginning of the film tells you all you need to know about them another smart choice the film makes is that it keeps the plot simple and streamlined the avengers needs to overcome their differences and work together to stop loki and his alien army thats really it and the film never deviates from it mark ruffalos bruce banner is leaps and bounds better than edward nortons ruffalos banner is cautious and hes someone who fears the hulk not because of any danger to himself but because he knows innocent people will be hurt his face reads deep emotional pain and sadness over the life he was robbed of but he also has a strange sense of humor about his situation at this point in his life bruce has given up trying to rid himself of the hulk and instead has a sort of good naturedness about his condition understanding that its something he simply has to try and live with he also still tries to do some good in the world even in hiding we see that hes become a local doctor in the country hes hiding out in ruffalo somehow balances levity and charisma which nortons banner never had with even more emotional depth than nortons banner ever had he brings real subtlety to what is arguably marvels least subtle character and he accomplishes all of this in one single scene his introduction and conversation with natasha and sparks were flying between those two in that scene and throughout the whole film i resent the argument that their romance in age of ultron came out of nowhere but well save that discussion for another time the hulk himself finally became a character to cheer for this marked the first time he was truly successful onscreen because hes just so much fun in it the iconic im always angry scene is still the greatest hulk transformation to date and his delighted grin at caps orders to simply smash shows us that hes having a good time so we do too the visuals of hulk are acceptable in his solo film but the avengers is the first time he doesnt just look good but looks great im sure having some disney money helped the motion capture technology this time around the avengers is also the first time we see hulk use his powers for something other than destruction his leap and catch to save tony from his free fall received just as many cheers and applause in the theater as the legendary shot of all the heroes circled together not only does the avengers stand on its own without a hitch but the events of the film would go on to directly affect all future films with ideas brought up in the avengers coming back for our heroes to deal with tony stark faces the first situation that he truly cant have any sort of control over its a situation he can barely even comprehend the concept of aliens and gods is completely foreign to tony a threat he never even considered to be a possibility until now and in the climactic battle in his first truly heroic selfless act he almost loses his life this all would go on to haunt him throughout the rest of the mcu and it is the biggest influence on his behavior and decisions moving forward steve rogers is fresh out of his frozen slumber and trying to understand his place in the modern world what does captain america represent to the current climate if anything arent the stars and stripes a little oldfashioned he asks  coulson steve serves the purpose of the everyman in this film he isnt just new to aliens hes new to everything to the very world that the film takes place in he starts off with the idea of we have orders we should follow them but tonys rebellious and untrusting nature paired with bruces own suspicions are enough to send steve on his own investigation into the very people he works for what he finds is that shield is using the tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction even basing these weapons off the inventions of hydra and their use of the tesseract its a direct betrayal to what steve thinks shield stands for and it reminds him that the world even seventy years in the future with all of its social and technological progress is never as black and white as it may appear he along with natasha and clint defy their orders as agents of shield steal a quinjet and take off to fight in the battle of new york while he does continue to work for shield his trust in them is broken and he knows them to be flawed this loss of trust in the government he devoted his life to serve follows him throughout the rest of his time in the mcu natasha proves to be more than just a capable fighter she is first and foremost a spy and a master at mental manipulation from the interrogation in her introduction to her ability to outsmart the literal god of mischief himself into giving away his plan black widow is really given her due here her time working for the kgb and even shield means that she has blood on her hands and crimes to make up for ive got red in my ledger id like to wipe it out natasha chooses to try and make the really heroic decisions to protect and fight for a better world to make up for the mistakes of her past and hopefully clear her conscious clint barton after being brainwashed by loki wants to make up for the people he killed while doing lokis bidding and maybe even get a little revenge clint is also just a really good guy who always does the right thing similar to steve rogers is hawkeye wasted in this film a bit yes having him be mindcontrolled for most of the runtime does prevent us from getting to know the man but it does show us how capable hawkeye is as an adversary he takes down an entire helicarrier and brings shield practically to its knees almost singlehandedly so while we may have not gotten much of his character we do get to see skills on full display he also gets some of the best action beats in the battle of new york thor comes to earth to stop loki but also wants to save him thor still holds out hope that his brother can be redeemed and come home he never fights him with the intention of killing him and during every altercation he pleads with loki to stop his conquest to realize that he has the power to put an end to it and do the right thing thor tragically realizes that his brother may simply be too far gone and beyond saving loki murders coulson in front of him and then proceeds to try and kill thor without hesitation in order to save the planet he has to steel himself and be prepared to kill his own brother if it comes to it its a test not just for his dedication to being earths protector but for his worthiness to lead and take the throne of his own planet speaking of the god of mischief loki became the real breakout of the avengers creating a massive fanbase and adoration for the villain how was this accomplished in an email sent to joss whedon tom hiddleston an actor who one hundred percent understands and dedicates himself to the character sums everything up about why loki works so well as the antagonist for the avengers its high operatic villainy alongside detached throwaway tongueincheek plus the real menace and his closely guarded suitcase of pain its grand and epic and majestic and poetic and lyrical and wicked and rich and badass throughout you continue to put loki on some kind of pedestal of regal significance and then consistently tear him down he gets battered punched blasted sideswiped roared at sent tumbling on his back and every time he gets back up smiling wickedly never for a second losing his eloquence style wit selfaggrandizement or grandeur and you never send him up or deny him his true intelligence that he loves to make an entrance that he has a taste for the grand gesture the big speech the spectacle loki earns his right to be the ultimate baddie that no avenger can beat on their own a saturday morning cartoon mustachetwirling villain while at the same time a genuinely menacing incredibly intelligent manipulative mastermind he repeatedly outwits our heroes and in doing so forces them to overcome their differences and work together to finally defeat him his ability to bring the avengers to their lowest point is what eventually leads to his own downfall clark greggs phil coulson ends up being the secret weapon of the film coulson is the consistent string that ties together all of the films prior even more than nick fury he has a personal relationship with natasha clint tony and pepper thor and in a genius move is revealed to be the biggest captain america fanboy it adds a new level of innocence to the character and whedon knows how to make him lovable giving him the light comedic moments in the first half of the film coulson is the representation of all the comic book fans who are sitting in the theater eager to finally see their heroes come together on the big screen hes the biggest advocator for the avengers initiative and believes in every single one of them and their ability to save the world we need you he tells tony in iron man 2 in the first time he drops his tough government persona and reveals his true genuinely goodhearted nature its why his death at the hands of loki works coulsons murder is the loss of innocence the first true death of a recurring character in the mcu coulson never gets to see his dream of the avengers together come to fruition if anything he only witnesses the opposite yet with his dying breath he understands what his death might be able to accomplish this was never gonna work if they didnt have something to coulsons death serves as the catalyst that finally brings the avengers together and it specifically spurs tony and steve into action tony who was initially cautious around coulson learns to trust and respect him because he learns that pepper does his death wakes him up to the fact that his selfishness and uncooperativeness has consequences when the stakes are this high and innocent peoples lives are at stake steve learns what captain america means or should mean to the people of the modern world and what he needs to do to accomplish that with everything thats about to happen people might just need a little oldfashioned coulson tells him all of this leads us to the grand finale the fireworks display the celebration of all of the work and dedication that marvel studios put together in this new idea of a shared movie universe the battle of new york works not just purely as spectacle though it certainly is that but as characterdriven action an action sequence that is earned that makes all of the build up throughout the previous films worth it the avengers finally assembled working together to stop the biggest threat the world has ever faced emphasis is put on not just taking down aliens but on saving and protecting the people theyre fighting for this role primarily goes to our heart and soul captain america who makes containment of the alien army the number one priority choosing to stay on the ground and defend a single choke point saving and getting as many civilians to safety as he can the avengers remains one of the only superhero universes where the films remember that they need to show us the heroes actually saving people not just fighting the battle of new york remains one of the greatest action sequences to ever be put onscreen and it has yet to be topped in the mcu though infinity war is looking into giving it a run for its money it works on every level and is absolutely thrilling to watch no matter how many times youve seen it the avengers was an event it was something that everyone had to go see and witness the idea of multiple characters from several different movies appearing all together in one big extravaganza was completely new and exciting its something that no one has able to successfully replicate since look at sonys amazing spiderman universe scrapped after only two films universals dark universe dead before it even began only one film in and of course dcs illfated justice league universe in disarray after two films and whos grand teamup film ended up being their lowestgrossing out of all of them why was the avengers successful where others werent marvels secret is the immense amount of planning and forethought they put into their universe and above all their dedication and time that they commit to all of their characters its why ive spent this entire essay primarily talking about each one of them the awesome spectacle is nothing if i dont care about whos involved marvels devotion to the avengers team and the time spent with each of them is what makes it all work its what makes the grand display of an hour long action scene worth it and thrilling even though the avengers was dropped down to fifth place after the 2015 nostalgia trip that was jurassic world and the force awakens it remains a benchmark of entertainment and popular culture marvel studios knew that this was make it or break it time they delivered and the world has never been the same since connections to the mcu the battle of new york and the public emergence of the avengers is the biggest impacting moment of the entire mcu and the aftermath of it all would go on to affect not just the films but the television shows as well every show set in the mcu minus agent carter takes place postavengers spiderman homecoming deals with people getting their hands on leftover alien technology tony gets some serious ptsd from the battle lokis deeds carry on into the thor sequels shield secretly planning to make weapons from the energy of the tesseract the world security council attempting to nuke new york city and furys little white lie surrounding coulsons death all serve to show the darker underbelly of the organization an idea that would come back in the biggest way possible in the winter soldier a member of that council would go on to become a major antagonist in agents of shield and of course coulson would return to spearhead that very show we are also given our first glimpse at the ultimate mcu villain thanos he gives loki the scepter and the army to steal the tesseract and conquer earth for him lokis failure and loss of not one but two infinity stones does not bode well for his fate when he runs into thanos again in infinity war nicolás delgadillo is a movie and heavy metal junkie who can always be found at the theater or in the mosh pit he is a senior film critic

Apr 22 2021,positive, there are several moments during joss whedons ecstatically awaited avengers assemble  the marvel franchise mashup promised since the samuel l jacksonstarring postcredits sting of 2008s iron man  that youre certain youre watching quite possibly the greatest film ever made this sensation doesnt last too long obviously youll probably come to your senses during a postfilmwee moment of clarity but considering the extent to which the film pulls out all the stops in its relentless desire to simply entertain you as much as possible is seems cruel and churlish not to hyperbolise just a little  whedon of course is currently enjoying success at the moment with the magnificently apeshit the cabin in the woods yet avengers assemble marks the exbuffy helmers first stint as director since 2005s serenity the bigscreen version of his sobrilliantitwasdisastrouslyunpopular tv series firefly that evidence of this directing hiatus isnt present in avengers assemble is something of an understatement whedon has not only managed to tie together the disparate strands of the brands marvel wanted to unite hes done so in a film which is bombastic hilarious confidently and  in places  exquisitely directed most importantly of all its hard to recall another film released in recent years that is simply this much fun from beginning to unapologetically preposterous end of course in order to get our heroes together in the first place we need an enemy worthy of their attention step up tom hiddlestones charismatic and deliciously evil loki last seen on the business end of a harsh bollocking in thor who teams up with a reassuringly nasty race of indiscriminate aliens to enslave the earth hey look no one said it was the wire whedon then wastes little time before reacquainting us with those were here to see samuel l jacksons superspy nick fury iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo stepping into the perpetuallytorn shoes of bruce banner thor chris helmsworth as well as newcomers hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlet johansen most of the bitplayers from each characters solo efforts also get a look in and its a real treat for those whove managed to see each of the separate heros films that have led to this one whedon doesnt exclude those that havent though  enough backstory is given for each to bring the audience up to speed so if you havent seen the hulk or thor then dont worry you wont have any trouble keeping up goodies baddies mcguffin thats all you need to know  the deeper layers are there for those who want them and when the ensemble is brought together avengers assemble truly begins to shine  wedons shtick if its not unfair to call it such is sassy witty scripts and hes on careerbest zinging form here downey jnr is effortlessly droll while no shortage of surprise laughs come from the unlikelier members of the group who for the most part each get their own golden chucklesome script nuggets you just get the sense that everyone involved is having a rollocking good time and this permeates into you through some form of chummy goodnatured osmosis its only renners hawkeye that feels a little underused this is admittedly for plot reasons which wont divulge but we may have to wait for the mooted hawkeye spinoff to give him the cussquipping screen time he deserves when the excrement hits the propeller which is frequently does whedon also orchestrates the vast action scenes with aplomb and joyous flair michael bay the leading purveyor of epic mindless action could learn a thing or two here these scenes are thrilling and refreshing in their clarity largely eschewing the shakycam and quickcut histrionics that hinder so many films of this scale sure theres little in the way of genuine threat but in giving an audience what it wants seeing these heroes team up to lay the smack well and truly down avengers assemble delivers and then some and then a bit more then it nips out for a fag comes back and delivers again the only real complaints are inherent to the plot itself which is fairly standard maniacal overlord fare its serviceable and certainly never dull but these are plot points that have been pounded into flat patties by countless films that have come before and the sense that story had to be kept light in order to give screen time to the reestablishment of the characters pervades the films also cheesier than a wotsit fondue on occasion but  crucially  its always aware of it and were all in on the joke whether youre a stellaguzzling comicphobe or pale seasoned ubergeek also by way of minor gripe captain america is shit just saying   captain americas shitness aside avengers assemble somehow manages to be much more than the sum of its parts making it the best time youll have a the cinema this week and probably for a good few weeks to come like a beautiful superheros game of soggy biscuit only everybody wins and no one wants to cry afterwards a megabudget action extravaganza that succeeds on just about every level and its one you should certainly go and see as soon as possible 
Apr 1 2021,positive, otherwise known as the avengers everywhere else in the world avengers assemble sees the first marvel team up film that nobody was quite sure if it would work until it cracked a billion at the box office while iron man obviously kicked the mcu off it was this film that sold both fans and studios on the idea that a shared universe of visual media could not only be pulled off but if done right can be pretty damn lucrative and trust me this was done right so lets take a look at the first avengers film shall we when thors evil brother loki gains access to the unlimited power of the energy cube called the tesseract nick fury director of shield initiates a superhero recruitment effort to defeat the unprecedented threat to earth joining furys avengers are iron man captain america the hulk thor the black widow and hawkeye the avengers succeeds due to two reasons a fantastic cast and some really great and exciting action scenes sadly the director of which has turned out to not be a very unpleasant man but ah well not going hold that against the cast and crew of the film robert downey jr is still the focus of a lot of the attention as tony stark  iron man but thankfully that is entirely in his character and hes great at it chris evans captain america chris hemsworths thor and mark ruffalos bruce banner  hulk do all get plenty of screen time though and their various interactions are great cap and stark arguing due to completely different philosophies on life thor getting rubbed the wrong way due to his lack of knowledge on earthly affairs and stark trying to poke and prod banner out of curiosity and eventually to motivate him to not be afraid of his power this was ruffalos first appearance in the role and he nails it both funny and vulnerable a really good take on the character then theres tom hiddleston as loki once again perfectly nailing the snide and sarcastic villain role and again his scenes with the avengers themselves are all so well written and enjoyable the crazy thing about this ensemble is that there are many other cast members to mention samuel l jackson as nick fury is well samuel l jackson but that plays well in the role he has and he has the kind of presence to be the man who pulls all these people together scarlett johansson is back as black widow which given she is the only female member of the main cast shows how far the mcu has come on that from in the last decade and she does a good job as badass secret agent her interaction with banner  hulk are fun as well jeremy renner as clint barton  hawkeye is good but sadly he does spend a lot of the film as a mind controlled zombie but heyho and finally we get more of clark gregg as shield agent phil coulson and stellan skarsgard back as erik selvig to continue the cliffhanger from thor it also features cobie smulders as high ranking shield member maria hill though beyond an exciting chase at the start of the film her role is limited speaking of the start of the film heres a quick sum up of the plot loki takes the tesseract mindcontrols a bunch of people including hawkeye causes some trouble as he gathers equipment to open a portal and let some alien allies invade and then gets caught by a combination of iron man captain america and thor i still love a moment where thor and loki are arguing on a cliff and thor is tackled away midsentence by iron man who at this point doesnt know if hes friend or foe and loki just acts like he was waiting for the rest of the conversation to happen after a fun minibattle everyone joins up on nick furys helicarrier where bruce banner and black widow are also based and soon it comes under attack by the people who are under lokis influence banner hulks up thor is outsmarted and thrown to the earth and agent coulson is killed  for now if you count agents of shield coulsons death becomes the catalyst to force the team to work together which is good because loki successful opens up a portal above new york and lets a whole army of chitauri warriors invade otherwise the only other complaint you could have is if you dont like this kind of super hero quippy and actiony film but in that case why are you watching it
Dec 1 2020,negative, o how does one pose a threat to a demigod a supersoldier a man in an indestructible metal suit and a hulking green juggernaut well it cant really be done but with a surplus of loud explosions massive battles and limitless cg effects the right amount of adventure to appease fans of such monumental clashes between good and evil can be feigned the avengers keeps the concepts simple enough but piles on so much mayhem it can become wearisome to those not previously invested in its subjects and willing to readily believe in the delirious events transpiring on screen viewers not cheering by the time the gang of superheroes takes down a giant mechanical space worm probably knew a long time ago this movie wasnt for them as nick fury samuel l jackson and the agents of the secret military agency shield attempt to harness the power of the extraterrestrial energy source known as the tesseract the villainous exiled demigod loki tom hiddleston returns to earth to steal it along with the cube loki brainwashes and kidnaps assassin clint barton jeremy renner and scientist erik selvig stellan skarsgard to aid in his devious plot to conquer all of humanity to combat this new threat fury reinstitutes his scrapped avengers initiative and sets about gathering together the worlds greatest heroes  iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth and black widow scarlett johansson the posing evil grimacing to denote villainy and arsenal of oneliners are at an alltime high in the avengers which works to assemble a group of superheroes that constantly compete for screen time oneupmanship and the last laugh the humor is actually overdone poking fun at all of the characters and situations to the point that audiences will probably question which absurdities they should be taking seriously and thats detrimental in a film overflowing with fantastical silliness both visually and from dialogue its bad enough that despite gods and alien worlds the extremely advanced technology is still unbelievable  and that jargon like gamma signature thermonuclear quantum fusion and cognitive recalibration sound so ludicrously forced for the sake of convincing viewers that the avengers instruments are beyond general comprehension although its not quite a sequel it still only feels appropriate to measure it up to films like transformers 3 fantastic four rise of the silver surfer iron man 2 superman returns and the like its not as mindnumbingly nonsensical as a few of the aforementioned titles but it doesnt look or feel original and the abundance of special effects and overwhelming destruction create nonstop spectacle without substance never once is there any real peril this is made upsettingly apparent with the inclusion of nonsuperheroes black widow and hawkeye who are just too drastically inferior to go up against global catastrophes initiated by intergalactic alien wargods with a complete lack of definition for the various powers exhibited by the antagonists and protagonists alike their massive demolition of manhattan and battling one another for the title of toughest superhero means very little they might as well all be invincible no villain is formidable enough and no force threatening enough for these cartoonish cginundated extravagances to be sympathetic designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Sep 2 2020,positive,the avengers will undoubtedly please nearly all fanboys and most other moviegoers hoping for the quintessential popcorn flick experience
Jun 11 2020,positive, film critics havent been mincing words about the avengers from hollywood life and the washington times to the dekalb county timesjournal pundits of the silver screen are not only praising joss whedons take on the band of marvel icons but referring to his motion picture as the greatest superhero film ever made while i dont quite agree with this superlative assessment it hits very close to the truth  a brief retrospective of recent cinematic history is necessary to fully understand why the last dozen years have been something of a golden age in comic book movies ever since the success of bryan singers xmen in the summer of 2000 cineplexes have been bursting at the seams with narratives inspired by or ripped straight from the pulpy pages of graphic novels lucrative blockbusters like spiderman spiderman 3 and the dark knight were the highest grossing films in their respective years of release 2002 2007 and 2008 while especially acclaimed entries like iron man and the dark knight have netted prestigious oscar nominations and spots on critical top ten lists in the midst of this deluge two categories have emerged first there are the traditional superhero stories characterized by the familiar tropes of likeable good guys memorable baddies and unapologetically melodramatic threeact story archs the spiderman and iron man series are perhaps the most popular in this group alongside those have been the more existential pieces defined by their topicality thematic depth and attempts to transcend normative genre strictures more famous examples include unbreakable the dark knight and watchmen saying that the avengers falls into the first category though true does it a bit of an injustice while no single aspect of it stands out as unusually superb every element that needs to fall into place does so beautifully as these types of movies rise or fall based largely on the merits of the characters it certainly helps that the avengers has quite a range of compelling figures in its arsenal leading the pack of heroes are a pair of dueling archetypes metaphorically and literally iron mantony stark a blithely egomaniacal playboy and renaissance man and captain americasteve rogers whose boy scoutish persona almost comes across like marvel comics answer to dcs superman they are accompanied by the mildmannered dr bruce banner who when roused to anger transforms into the terrifying green behemoth known as the hulk thor the norse god of thunder black widow a russian superspy and hawkeye a master archer and worlds greatest marksman this eclectic crew is led by nick fury director of a government military agency known as shield that is responsible for assembling the titular avengers to deal with crises once they become global in scale each of these characters is perfectly cast from robert downey jr as the inimitably sharptongued stark to samuel l jackson as the sullen but gravitasladen fury the standout here is almost certainly mark ruffalo as banner whose depiction of a man deftly controlling the tempest of his own emotions is memorable in its stirring poignance tying all of them together is a plot in which the heroes search for a macguffin known as the tesseract that must be kept out of the hands of loki the norse god of mischief and brother to thor who aspires to use that device to of course rule the world while the story itself is not particularly original it is utilized to its fullest potential keeping the narrative running at a smooth clip and causing its twoandahalf hour running time to fly right by all of this is spiced up by whedons distinctively intelligent and engaging writing style from witty lines tony stark introducing himself to bruce banner dr banner your work is unparalleled and im a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster to unexpected moments of physical comedy such as a scene in which one character receives a surprising but richly deserved humiliating beating the screenplay proves to be almost as much of a character as any of the protagonists themselves adding levity to prevent the story from being bogged down in its own sturm und drang while maintaining the proper dramatic perspective throughout the proceedings this isnt to say that the avengers is without its weaknesses while loki is an adequately detestable villain he hardly compares to comicdoms more legendary celluloid foes alfred molinas doctor octavius heath ledgers the joker and the storys intelligence is more surface than substantive causing it to lack the thoughtfulness of the dark knight or philosophical layering of watchmen nevertheless the avengers stands out as a practically perfect popcorn flick thoroughly entertaining even the most disillusioned moviegoers of which i am one from the opening frame to the second postcredits scene which i highly recommend audience members stick around to see when it comes to the traditional type of superhero movie its hard to do any better

Feb 14 2020,positive, for the past few years every product of the marvel comics film portfolio has been building to this captain americas big screen debut was subtitled prominently as the first avenger and nick fury samuel l jackson has been popping up in postcredits scenes for years looking to emulate the structure and crossovers of their comics avengers assemble brings together the separate franchises of captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth and the newly recast hulk mark ruffalo as well as previous supporting characters does avengers assemble deliver or collapse under the burden its not without its flaws but joss whedon has put together an immensely enjoyable film the best marvelbased one to date and one that is not in the least bit ashamed of its comic book roots the film opens with nick fury of shield at a facility attempting to harness an immense source of power the tesseract everything is promptly and rudely interrupted by loki tom hiddlestone the villainous brother last seen on the big screen having a bit of a siblings tiff with his brother thor making off with the tesseract the situation quickly spirals out of the control of us conventional mortals and fury looks to assemble the title ensemble in order to save earth or at the very least avenge it as downeys stark puts it the tone of the film has been pitched extremely well by writerdirector whedon who isnt afraid to have the films comic roots shine through there are often what appear to be cheeseontoast moments in the dialogue but fortunately the film earns itself enough good will to allow this to sit nicely within the tonal framework in addition the fantasy elements of the likes of thor have been married very well with the more realistic techbased world of iron man even if this wasnt the case the verbal ripostes between the various heroes all with their own issues and egos often sparkles with the sort of irreverent humour and wit one would expect from joss whedon as good as christopher nolans take on dc comics batman has been this marvel ensemble is an entirely different and more lighthearted beast although everyone is on generally good thespian form especially tom hiddleston as the villainous loki the film predictably strains a little under the weight of four established franchises in the end to set everyone up for the 3rd act requires a plot development that is dependent on a certain amount of familiarity with previous marvel films and could feel a little forced additionally new or previously peripheral characters such as jeremy renners hawkeye and scarlett johanssons black widow have little time to develop as more than action fodder or eye candy having said this its wrong to suggest it actively detracts from the film  but it is nonetheless disappointing given how avengers assemble exceeds elsewhere with these minor criticisms in mind its impressive that the majority of the film could work either as the distillation of the separate marvel franchises or an introduction for the uninitiated certain sequences and references will feel more at home and appreciated by those who have seen the solo efforts but the fastpaced and engaging plot keeps things bouncing along  just at the point the film could lose steam the pace and action picks up for a truly superb closing battle it is particularly admirable that avengers assemble is clearly the best bigscreen depiction of the incredible hulk  a character that has arguably defeated a talented director in ang lee and in a separate pseudoreboot an excellent actor in edward norton mark ruffalos affable turn as the witty but uneasy banner is underscored by edgeoftheseat tension over his alteregos eventual appearance one close shave in his lab is especially well handled by whedon when the inevitable eventually happens much improved special effects and an excellent fight sequence result in a terrific impact avengers assemble is an excellent piece of blockbuster entertainment much has been made of the fact that blockbusters dont need to be a brainless michael bay effort in order to attract an audience whilst brainless is a pejorative that shouldnt be applied to whedons cornucopia of superheroes the film certainly doesnt aspire to phds in psychology or philosophy either there is a lightness and wit to the character portraits presented whilst this means there maybe isnt the same obvious thematic depth to the film although there are broad strokes painted about the moral and immoral uses of technology this is not something that it needs or wants to aspire to when the characters themselves are drawn with enough depth humour and selfawareness and action scenes are choreographed engagingly the result is every bit as good there are legs in the oldfashioned blockbuster yet the superhero film doesnt need to be a gritty reboot in order to feel fresh with the phenomenal rise of christopher nolans batman films the marvel stable had to deliver something excellent but genuinely different in avengers assemble and with joss whedon behind the camera they have done so thanks to the excellent combination of humour characters action and intensity avengers assemble is the best marvel film yet
Jan 22 2020,positive, marvels the avengers is a comic book lovers ultimate fantasy witnessing several favorite superheroes together fighting evil and of course all while saving mankind from destruction yes its a superhero allstar meet up of sorts starring robert downy jr as iron man mark ruffalo as the hulk chris evans as captain america chris hemsworth as thor scarlett johansson as black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye all thankfully sharing equal screen time in a first rate comical nonstop action packed film with a bit of transformers scattered throughout the former film franchises of four heroes provided their introduction to cinema fans who may not have been familiar with the comic books thus delivering an extra punch  familiarity with their personas many know the hulk from the 1978 tv series and other major films starring eric bana and edward norton as dr bruce banner aka the hulk im pleased to reveal that avengers take on the hulk is my favorite so far hes the biggest hulk yet and overshadows all in size scope and strength even though black widow and hawkeye are less known director and cowriter joss whedon a self professed comic book fan does a fine job of developing each whedons writing credits are impressive toy story buffy the vampire slayer and cabin in the woods to name a few his direction here is pitch perfect as each superheros personality is developed not only through actions but also smart dialogue something generally lacking in action films the glib comedic tone is consistent throughout never appearing silly or contrived we believe all that is happening  these super heroes are essentially part of the worlds landscape even though we know they arent real in this film they emphatically are as so much care and detail have gone into their credibility a grandiose storyline is deepseated in humanity thats super cool and super fun for action fans and the archetypal comic book fan avengers covers both and unquestionably delivers the balancing act of the characters and their distinctive personas is certainly a dubious feat here requiring much perception and forethought to pull off the premise centers on six super heroes who are fetched by sh i elds director nick fury played convincingly by an eyepatched samuel l jackson fury gathers the heroes because thors evil brother the whiny god loki tom hiddleston who suffers from a dad liked you best complex has compremised the powerful cosmic cube the tesseract lokis digs are the interstellar world of asgard making his only access to earth through a space wormhole frankly the reason for the allstar superhero meetup doesnt really matter so much the interactions between the heroes themselves are at the heart of this tale comically when the superheroes are assembled they check each other out through dialogue and exhibiting their physical attributes the matchup creates very silly scenes of who can outdo the other downeys iron man states out of the gate im iron man and no offense but apparently im volatile selfobsessed and i dont play well with others the banter and eyepopping special effects are what makes this film tick all i can say is hold on to your popcorn as youre in for a riproaring roller coaster of a ride in this spectacle thats perfect for ages ten and above the films rating of pg13 is due to the violence and somewhat frightening situations which parents can ascertain for their own youngsters cast captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner nick fury samuel l jackson and gwyneth paltrow pepper potts
Dec 15 2019,positive, welcome to road to endgame where we revisit all 22 movies of the marvel cinematic universe and ask how did we get here in this edition the avengers changed studio filmmaking though not before ticking off the pentagonthe avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience few films before or since have resulted in such widespread global celebration something even the films third sequel avengers endgame may or may not match only time will tell but time has been kind to marvels first culmination despite the series overall fabric favouring entertainment over meaning in the realm of political outlookthe film changed the way movies were made and watched affecting everything from industry goals to the mainstream visibility of fandom and nerd culture its lasting legacy isnt just the sprawling marvel cinematic universe which drops its twentysecond entry into theatres soon  its impact can also be felt in almost every other studios failed shareduniverses it stands to reason that marvel was ahead of the creative curve even before its purchase by disney in 2009 kevin feige  co have been doing it right before anyone else was doing it at allwhile this plan understandably seemed in doubt during its buildup marvel studios marked its arrival with unprecedented financial success crystalizing onscreen during one specific moment you know the one you remember seeing the avengers assemble for first time as the camera circles around them and alan silvestris musical theme reaches its crescendo you may even remember cheering or applaudingthe film was shot in a narrower taller aspect ratio  1851 compared to the other films 239 and 235  to accommodate the eightfoottall hulk in group shots where in the team occupied the entire frame run a quick search on youtube and youre likely to find dozens of videos capturing live audience reactions to this climactic scene from all over the globe and in more languages than you knew the film was even dubbed intowhats more this nowiconic shot is sandwiched between two other major moments each of which hits similar highs in quick succession on one side the hulks im always angry and his transformation before punching an enormous leviathan on the other captain americas order of hulk smash after which the hulk lets loose on alien invaders it was clear from this onetwothree punch and the ensuing rapturous response that the marvel party wasnt going to stopwhats sometimes forgotten however is that this sequence arrives nearly two hours into the filmthe avengers is one of the rare mcu films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character the whole film is built around this rousing sequence answering the looming question asked by both the film and by the audience after a sixyear buildup can these disparate elements come together to become greater than the sum of their parts the answer was a resounding yes and what followed was marvels victory lap an explosive payoff to an entire movies worth of character dynamics and interwoven themes a feat that was replicated in avengers age of ultron the avengers is also the first marvel movie that takes place on an earth significantly different from our own the settings in prior entries felt distinctly familiar from caves to factories to tiny towns here the pretense that marvels superheroes exist in a realistic universe was finally done away with the world of the avengers is unequivocally the future of the series fantasy world war ii where nazi factions used an infinity stone to build weapons of mass destruction unfortunately this throughline also results in its own complications since the malformed politics of captain america the first avenger carry over as wellin prior films superheroes were unique elements in otherwise normal surroundings in the avengers nearly an hour of the film takes place on an floating invisible aircraft carrier transporting magicallypowered weapons the same weapons captain america once tried to get out of the hands of hydra red skulls diet nazis this is a world where some faroff unseen villain in space grants loki mystical objects  we now know all about thanos plan  and its a world where shadowy international councils have become necessary now that monsters roam the streets and gods fly through the skieshowever the film isnt as far removed from real world concerns as this setting suggests if anything the avengers is about fantasy clashing with reality to see which one wins out late into the films final act after the avengers have nearly fallen to alien invaders the world council makes an enormous decision it chooses to sacrifice millions of lives in order to save billions sending a nuclear warhead straight for new york its the kind of dark turn youd expect from a story like watchmen alan moore and dave gibbons 1986 comic classic that transplanted superheroes into a supposedly realistic setting but the major difference between watchmen and the avengers  and thus the difference in their outcomes  is the function of their characterswatchmen sees our worst selves  violent egomaniacal detached  being granted untold powers the fantasy of the avengers however isnt just that superheroes exist in concept but rather that these specific kinds of people exist people like iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson and the hulk mark ruffalo who are willing to put everything on the line going aboveandbeyond to save everyone they canthe dilemma captain america faced during world war ii becomes a dilemma for all the avengers to overcome no matter the scenario they arent willing to trade lives not in this film not in avengers age of ultron and not in avengers infinity war while this unwillingness to compromise is put to the test in future films its presented in the avengers as a bright alternative to the darkest parts of our reality where men in the shadows order airstrikes without care for collateral damage all for the greater goodin depicting us fighter planes being ordered to attack manhattan the film not only aligns the world councils methods with that of hydra in captain america the first avenger but with the spectre of global terrorism in a post911 word a bold conflation at least on the surface though one muddled by the fact that this film like iron man and iron man 2 before it and captain america the winter soldier and captain marvel since sought us military fundingthe avengers was almost government propaganda and it still retains some of this dna marvel films like iron man iron man 2 captain america the winter soldier and captain marvel were made with us military assistance and thus with militaryapproved scripts making them government propaganda the avengers however was actually turned down during its production because the pentagon couldnt reconcile the idea of the us military answering to a higher authority granted the production was lent humvees and other ground equipment regardless the f22 and f35 fighter jets in the film were digitally rendered so the conundrum here visàvis the avengers place as propaganda is noteworthyon one hand the production most certainly set out to appease the powers that be the world council a fictional consortium of international leaders embodied authoritarian overreach despite american military equipment being employed to bomb american citizens america itself is never really framed with any military outlook let alone one that could be held accountableon the other one might argue that the avengers is able to sidestep the propaganda issue given that it eschews realworld militarism unlike its earthbound predecessors the fighter jet sent to bomb manhattan while representative of us military equipment is ordered by an organization whose reach supersedes americas the council members arent given national designations until later in the series so its enough of a fantasy that the propaganda question doesnt really matterits a doubleedged sword narratively speaking the reluctance to contextualize americas place in the shield hierarchy turned the pentagon off subsidizing the film the us military could not given its relative absence in the story be presented as heroic and yet the world council a fictitious entity whose only realworld counterpart is the distinctly nonmilitaristic united nations is presented as villainous without ever framing americas place in its ranks despite shield being coded american throughandthrough in effect the us military cant be presented as having questionable motives eitherat best this incidental political apathy is an upgrade from prior entries like iron man in which us military occupation is the statusquo but its illeffects originate elsewhere at worst its the series continued failure to say anything of consequence hinting at statements about power without ever daring to actually make them the state of this world is twofold torn between reality and fantasy and the avengers must overcome this discrepancy in order to save the day in other words in order to make the film entertainingon one hand suited men with obscured faces order airstrikes to be carried out with familiar grey military machinery piloted by anonymous soldiers on the other our largerthanlife heroes with all their strengths and smarts and colourful garb have been locked out of the biggest scientific advancements of the 21st century the tesseract is a source of unlimited energy in world war ii hydra used it to make weapons in 2012 shield uses it for the same purpose rather than bringing minds like bruce banner and tony stark on board to further their work in medicine and clean energywar isnt won by sentiment the world council tells nick fury samuel l jackson who responds no its won by soldiers before recruiting steve rogers this exchange echoes captain america the first avenger wherein col phillips tommy lee jones tells abraham erskine stanley tuccy that war isnt won by kindness but by guts before recruiting rogers more malleable peer private gilmore hodge lex shrapnel in this moment in the avengers all fury seems to want is someone wholl follow orders rogers is told the allies won world war ii but he knows something is amiss they didnt say what we lostwhat was lost it would seem was conscience shield now divorced from america in the narrative recycles hydras plans the us government employing nazi tactics would have made for a more challenging story and a realistic one given americas hiring of nazi personnel after world war ii something captain america the winter soldier even touches on though one can hardly blame fourquadrant entertainment for stepping into the realm of fantasy however despite the continued separation of hydra from nazi ideology this setup functions well enough from a character standpoint especially in how it creates conflict between two of its leads fury  co are working on bigger more destructive devices than the ones dropped on japan upon discovering these secret weapons steve we have orders we should follow them rogers decides he can no longer follow blindly while questioning his own commitment to shield rogers also questions tony starks commitment to the mission stark is a man who tries to think his way out of every situation claiming hed cut the wire rather than laying down on it for anyone else the way rogers would and has in the paststark at this point in the series thinks mostly of himself he builds monuments unto his own image touching the skies with buildings bearing his name in fact he only figures out lokis tom hiddleston plan once he has his narcissism reflected back to him by the murderous demigod who plants his flag on starks skyscraper for all the world to seewhile steve rogers arc in this film forms a bridge between entries the winter soldier builds on his newfound skepticism the avengers concludes a major part of tony starks story in which he finally attempts to fight for something greater than himself it also sets into motion the next phase of his life in which he fails repeatedly to figure out the path to doing so instead stark creates newer bigger problems in the process escalations that rogers must eventually deal withdespite the tensions between them the two men also become linked by their experiences in a way few that other characters are starks major turn in the avengers involves flying through a wormhole its rather traumatic something iron man 3 eventually tackles head on in flying a weapon of mass destruction away from new york stark takes the same oneway trip rogers was forced to decades earlier a willing suicide mission as he tries to contact the woman he loves stark survives albeit barelyrogers and stark butting heads over loyalties is fun to watch but the films most enjoyable element ironically happens to be the character who mentions trying to kill himself while being cursed with the strength to survive the incredible hulk something the avengers understood about the hulk which neither of his prior solo outings managed to capture is that hes fun it seems so simple in retrospect a big green monster smashing disposable villains is perfect popcorn entertainment both moments on either side of the avengers assembling are hulkcentric action beats and regardless of whether the im always angry line fits his narrative it became instantly iconic because of what followedis bruce banner always angry mark ruffalo certainly brings a nervous energy to him but his actual anger is never the focus of his story its unfortunate that no marvel film has explored such a fundamental part of the character but what we get in the avengers is an arguably superior version of his arc in the incredible hulk a story in which banner at least nominally learns to embrace the monster withindr banner resents the hulk it prevents him from living a normal life a regret he expresses to natasha romanoff while rocking an empty crib a thread that continues in avengers age of ultron banner tries to steer clear of anything that might turn him mean and green its been a year since his last incident so having his isolation intruded upon understandably upsets him tony stark is fascinated by banner but the doctor believes no good can come of the hulk despite starks insistence on him having a higher purposewhen banner first transforms in the film its out of his control his face midtransition is stamped with fear  specifically the fear of what he might do to romanoff after this the hulk is presented much as he was in his the incredible hulk in shadow like a monster waiting to wreak havoc he even chases romanoff while knocking down walls recalling the first appearance of obadiah stanes iron monger in iron man as he chases pepper pottsthis hulk ought to be a villain hes trapped in a cage of banners making and letting him out unwillingly has disastrous consequences letting him out intentionally however is a different story its banner embracing everything he is on the inside always angry or not he uses this emotional momentum to take down a space serpent before leaping up the side of a building and smacking aliens into walls banner doesnt just embrace the monsters anger his smile before he leaps to cause more mayhem shows just how much he enjoys being the hulk by giving in to his baser instincts the mayhem becomes fun for audiences tooby the end the hulk even saves tony stark from falling to his death its a moment that builds directly upon banners story and its the first time we see the hulk use his powers for something other than destruction a higher purpose indeed at one end of the spectrum we have thor and loki figures of myth and legend who have the powers of gods at the other we have hawkeyeclint barton and black widownatasha romanoff assassins who use guns and arrows the latter duo ought to have no place within a cosmic scifi film in fact they replace superpowered heroes the wasp and antman from the original avengers comics yet its this very dynamic the contrast in the genres to which they belong that makes all four characters  thor loki hawkeye and widow  feel narratively vitalthey represent the extremes within which this world operates the asgardian princes embody the operatic grandeur of a story of armoured aliens and magical kingdoms barton and romanoff however ground the film in a human perspective reflecting the realworld effects of superpowered battlesby this point in the series thor and lokis arcs are admittedly at a standstill their story here much like captain americas story is connective tissue between entries their main function however is fleshing out what this mishmash setting feels like and their interactions with realistic elements like hawkeye and widow help dramatize this worlds fabrica spy working from the shadows romanoff is one of the teams most surprising members she fights shoulder to shoulder with the avengers not only to escape her bloody past but to atone for it shes also a foil to hawkeye whos hasnt yet had to contend with the kind of guilt romanoff lives with if anything bartons conscience is clear having rescued romanoff when he was sent to kill her but more recent events have forced him literally via lokis mind control to take innocent livesdont do that to yourself romanoff tells barton when he asks how many people hes killed romanoff is familiar with the emotional consequences of being a killer  another element carried over into avengers age of ultron  her very reason for joining the avengers neither black widow nor hawkeye take narrative precedence by any means but they flesh out the human stakes of this conflict in a way that endangering abstract billions no longer does at this point in blockbuster historysome say these characters are wasted in the film i disagree and not just because they get their own stellar action beats thor after a solo entry in which he faces up to his warmongering at least in theory finally accepts that asgardians may not be much better than humans he likens his brother and thus himself to mystical creatures that destroy everything in their path a perspective that plays a vital role in the avengers sequelthor black widow and hawkeye much like bruce banner see themselves as monsters with destructive capabilities thats four out of the six avengers people who according to loki lie and kill in the service of liars and killers hes not wrong which is exactly why the camera circling around the team in their moment of heroism works as well as it doesits the beginning of the avengers becoming more than their pasts   in fighting the alien invasion the avengers are also out to prove they can be more

Dec 10 2019,positive,overall marvels avengers assemble is fun funny and downright entertaining joss whedon did good
Nov 8 2019,negative, xrr rating1755my biggest fear going into the avengers the supposed culmination of the barrage of marvel universe comic book movies that have been bombarding us the past few summers was that it would be a frankensteinpastiche of characters fighting for screen time and therefore reducing each superheros part into a mere cameo while that preemptive fear was allayed by generous screen time for iron man captain america and company writers joss whedon who also directed and zak penn have transgressed in a way i couldnt have imagined before i witnessed it with my own eyes they made the avengers very very boring it is immaterial whether or not i read comics because as a film the avengers filled me with ennui not a good sensation for a popcorn movie loaded with explosions creatures from another dimension and a green behemoth determined to smash everything in sight sure the avengers accomplishes everything you would expect in a comics movie with the added spicy pizzazz of a whedon script but shouldnt a movie that costs millions to make reach for the stars rather than be merely serviceable thats a huge letdown whedon and penn decide to devote much of their script to the growing pains associated with the formation of the avengers wringing schmaltz from an ageold golden rule of team work egos clash muscles ripple rivals bristle but eventually the avengers figure out that working together rather than against one another is the key pretty fucking stupid when loki tom hiddleston and a cadre of interplanetary goons are threatening to destroy the earth but hey it gives whedon an opportunity to drum up superhero on superhero fighting porn as thor fights the hulk and iron man fights thor and nick fury fights hawkeye its the most expensive version of marvel vs capcom ever produced but even less exciting than watching your little brother play on your crappy 12 television so whats my problem there is absolutely nothing at stake here the avengers picks up the threads from a handful of prior films and tries to create a reason to bring all these superhero together in one place besides make a shitton of money for marvel and disney we all know that whedon is supremely talented when the skys the limit hell look at the cabin in the woods or serenity to see what the man can do when his imagination runs amuck but with the avengers he is hamstrung and leaves us with a story that lacks not only gravitas but no human element whatsoever peter parker and bruce wayne often succeed in their filmic incarnations because there is something tragic and human in their narrative arcs in this rancid amalgam we get nothing but explosions and long boring passages filled with sermonizing and stale dialogue that makes the most recent star wars trilogy read like eloquent theater so what is the gossamer of a story about nick fury samuel l jackson assembles the avengers after the banished loki steals the tesseract a glowing cube of energy that will allow him to open a portal and destroy the earth so fury calls in iron man robert downey jr the thawedout captain america chris evans natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson thor chris hemsworth and bruce banner mark ruffalo stepping in for edward norton to join the fight against the banished asgardian and his minions while the action sequences are dull the films extended sections where whedon tries to explain each and every backstory without pandering to the demographic too much feels interminable whedon must walk a tightrope of not saying too much and thus alienating the fan boys and saying too little wiping out the folks who dont know the difference between steve rogers and bruce banner also i hate to say it but loki really isnt a very interesting villain with all of these factors working against him whedon turned out reams of dialogue that not only feels flat but sucks the living joy out of a picture that should be about thrilling its audience however i think the problem is inherent in the format can comic books really successfully translate into a film especially one that packs in a lot of characters sure you can count the good ones burtons batman nolans dark knight films the second spiderman feature but often times comic book movies are lifeless or downright silly that is because comic book writers can suspend the drama and stretch it out over multiple issues creating a story arc that can be both exciting and resonant think of the stories by chris claremont and peter david and how they take multiple issues to sustain in a movie like the avengers you have to cram everything into two hours removing any sort of true peril to the characters or any real reason to care it would have taken balls to end with a frozen han solo moment but it didnt while researching for this article i found evidence of sequels to thor captain america and iron man all in the works maybe there is one thing these films have in common with the comics industry they keep going and going no matter how shitty the story as long as someone keeps paying for it you can rest assured we will see superhero films during the summer and if that doesnt work they will reboot the idea two years later early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Oct 11 2019,negative, the new ciarehab thriller as a genre is anticonspiracy unlike the domestic spy thriller of the 1970s todays cia apologist thriller does not reveal how official truth is an illusion an elaborate coverup constructed to hide abuses of power instead the newer sunnier cia thriller shows how failure in the intelligence community is merely the result of human error overthrowing the democratically elected mosaddegh government in iran in 1953 for instance and installing a corrupt puppet government headed by an absolute ruler is something that could have happened to anyone years later theres a little blowback sadly someone from the agency has to pick up the pieces ben afflecks argo shows that even movies that dont exist are more fun and possibly more real than the struggle of a nation argo is more like a 1970s heist movie than a paranoid espionage film if it were a robert redford 70s movie it would be the hot rock not three days of the condor disguising themselves as a film crew allows the cast of argo to put one over on iranians who are by turns wily and childish confronted by cartoon storyboards for the fake movie supposedly drawn by jack kirby they look more like the placemats in a big boy restaurant iranian guards react with delight when one member of the fake crew makes whooshing sounds and jetplane hand motions since this is the exact poststar wars position american filmgoers have been put in for decadesin fact beginning around the same time as the iranian hostage crisisits a little unnerving to find iranian soldiers standing in for the american audience like that argo puts into practice the cinemameetsmilitary theories of paul virilio in an unpredictable way we see the cia as a creator of fantasy here but thats all to the good american lives are saved no one gets hurt our enemies are fooled not killed the desire to believe in the movies affleck tells us is universal happy endings depend on the success of the ruse even when the ruse has geopolitical implications argo is a much better film than the previous two affleck directed and his performance in it is lowkey and selfeffacing the entire cast is good including clea duvall in black glasses and black hair here at least doing something worthy of her talent and adrienne barbeau wandering through the hollywood scriptreading scene as a cheeseball actress and producers exwife its noteworthy that the selection and reading of a film script plays such an important role in argo even if the whole point is that the script is derivative and lousy thats another comment on the era in which argo takes place the existence of argo which could not have been made back then because its story was classified by the cia is more proof that that era is over historical part of the fascination in watching argo is wondering whether this caper could work today the friendlier humanized cia of the carter era this film asks us to trust relies on fake mustaches not enhanced interrogation techniques all kathryn bigelows zero dark thirty asks us to believe in is the brute presentation of facts whether or not the film is a torture film is therefore the film implies beside the point torture happened the film says and heres how so of course zero dark thirty is a torture film but we are expected to understand that now we are beyond the moral question of whether torture is right or wrong the cia got various kinds of information from torturing various people regardless of whether that information was good or bad information is power you sift you put the pieces together just like the iranian schoolchildren in argo put photographs back together from documents the us embassy shredded in tehran eventually you get a clear picture and if youre lucky human error doesnt enter into it and you are allowed to act on what youve learned and kill the guy you need to kill the film is in three parts part one torture part two intelligence part three execution each is a separate film that struggles between being quality television and something more cinematic defined by jessica chastains filmhero poker face and goitalone refusal to succumb to backstory or do anything but work grimly at her job chastains maya we later learned from news stories about the film is a composite character meant to represent the hard work done by many women in the cia in its effort to find and kill bin laden at the same time she stands for every american woman today who can succeed if she works day and night if she stares into her computer for as long as it takes if she makes the mean face but doesnt complain when her boss doesnt understand shes right and is willing to relocate bigelow wrote a piece for the los angeles times in which she explained that when it comes to torture in zero dark thirty depiction is not endorsement but as always in the movies the problem is not in the what but the how how torture is depicted is more important than that it is depicted since bigelow used to work for semiotexte back in the day maybe some french film criticism will come in handy here in 1961 jacques rivette writing on the 1959 gillo pontecorvo film kapò which is about the inmates of a concentration camp singled out one shot that ended on the hand of a character played by emmanuelle riva emmanuelle riva who stars in amour as she died on an electrified barbedwire fence to rivette the preciosity of this shot was contemptible earlier in the piece rivette noted that this mixture of easy realism and spectacle was inherently immoral because that which the filmmaker dares present as reality is physically tolerable for the viewer    but ultimately not intolerable    at the same time everyone unknowingly becomes accustomed to the horror which little by little is accepted by morality and will quickly become part of the mental landscape of modern man who the next time will be able to be surprised or irritated at that which will in effect have ceased to be shocking the translation is david phelpss and jeremi szaniawskis this is the exact effect of the torture in zero dark thirty in 1983 kathryn bigelow played a feminist revolutionary working for a newspaper in lizzie bordens film born in flames which imagines a socialist america and ends with a bombing at the world trade center questions of depiction come down to whose side you are on if that seems too simple it is no simpler than saying that depiction is not endorsement an evasive notion that lets any film director off the hook entirely every time after the firsthand account of torture in zero dark thirty it is hard not to conclude that bigelow like maya is working for the man james bond has always been the man that is the whole point of james bond movies skyfall is a movie for a confused era a digital datadriven era where killing is done by remote control at first the film seems to admit it no longer makes sense to keep bond on the payroll in this new world the film starts with a radical move bond is shot and killed by another agent who happens to be a black woman naomie harris the story of skyfall is the story of this character first she kills bond later she seduces him but is thrown over for an asian temptress she comes back at the end as the new miss moneypenny bonds bosss secretary whose role is to lust after bond but never get him an underling he constantly teases she wears a tight dress and sits in an office looking at bond with big eyes while admitting she wasnt really cut out for fieldwork in the first placeshe accidentally shot him after all so much for empowerment the theme of skyfall is that the world must remain safe for white englishmen to run around shooting people who arent white and english the film ends in scotland the ancestral home of bond and the emotional heart of the upperclass great britain orwell identified in such such were the joys a domain of shotgun blasts and heritagebrand hunting togs where large stags still wander imperiously and symbolically like they did in the queen with helen mirren in 2006 it is here that the films one good moment emerges as daniel craigs bond and javier bardems panethnic but paradoxically ultrapale villain chase each other across the moors until bardem exasperated needles him do you see what comes of all this running around mr bond all this jumping and fighting its exhausting recruited into the secret agent game by samuel l jacksons nick fury agent of shield american superheroes in the avengers fight to protect new york from total destruction it is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems apocalypse must now enter into it this apocalypse comes in the form not of climate change the real menace to new york we witnessed firsthand in 2012 but in the form of mechanized aliens who must be standins for our new enemies the chinese because when they attack it looks like the sky is shitting endless orders of steamed whole fish tom hooper directs every scene and composes every shot in this bloated reactionary musical as if he were trying to express a new idea every time any actor moves a fraction of an inch at the same time this version of les misérables depends on absolute familiarity with the songs from the stage musical to produce the tears that are its reason for existing hugh jackmans performance eventually moves even the uninitiated to cry not because he is so movingoften he sounds like walter brennan singing old riversbut because he had to endure so much just so two insufferable teenagers could get married hoopers approach to revolution in the streets is to telegraph how doomed it is from the start but also to show that it is completely justifiedevery character in the film is so exploited that he or she is a clear argument for immediate radical change this sickly paradox puts the viewer on the side of getting the inevitable over with long before a little boy daniel huttlestone the mascot of the revolution is killed by soldiers his status as the most annoying cockney urchin in the history of cinema made me want to see russell crowes javert beat him to death with leonardo dicaprios hammer from django unchained daniel daylewiss animatronic performance in spielbergs film underscores how abraham lincoln is like et appearing among human beings to make things right before going back to the mysterious place he came from he is also the perfect contemporary dad reading to his little son about bugs while congress debates the thirteenth amendment lincoln performed the important function of getting americans to think about the terrible legacy of slavery in this country and to reevaluate the influence of the south on national affairs it is a political movie in every way and has a sciencefiction aspect it posits white people as alien oppressors white people are so white in lincoln which photographs them as grayish and pale under a winter sun that sometimes it testifies to the lack of tanning salons in washington dc in 1865 daylewiss pronunciation of the word righteous as righteeous left an indelible mark on me and it is no doubt historically accurate but as someone from a small town near hartford i resent the film for claiming that the abolitionist congressional representatives from connecticut voted against the amendment to end slavery that bothered me when i saw the film but i never bothered to check whether it was true and when maureen dowd wrote in her times column that it wasnt and that tony kushner dismissed his mistake by equating it to showing lincoln wearing blue socks instead of green socks i became doubly annoyed because now i was in the position of defending a state id be happy never to see again and admitting id learned something from maureen dowd theres another thing kushner left out of his screenplay that would have been good to include when lee surrendered to grant at appomattox a native american colonel on grants staff named ely s parker was there too parker who is played in lincoln by asaluke twocrow drafted and wrote by hand the terms of surrender delivered to lee and in the film we see him on the porch with grant as lee approaches this is not in the film but when lee saw parker he thought he was black and made some remark to that effect which he had to apologize for when told parker was a seneca indian well said lee i am glad to see one real american here parker responded by pointing out  we are all americans sir not including this great moment implies that there was something spielberg and kushner thought was too corny for this film django unchained is not so much the evil twin of the saintly lincoln as its nasty more clever kid brother fighting the favorite for recognition acting out if i prefer it to lincoln its because i prefer the tarantinian project flaws and all to steven spielbergs entire career lincoln may be the culmination of the spielberglucas reimagining of the american cinema as family entertainment a transcendent work beyond the blockbuster form that reimagines the official national myth of an official national father for current and future generations tarantino is more interested in a preconsolidated cinema that predates spielberg in which national myths were put to use in tawdry violent and grandiloquent ways and myth was open to interpretation by genre filmmakers outside the us so however tarantino has failed the actual history of slavery in the united states the way he has opened it up for discussion strikes me as far more remarkable than the storybook of spielbergs lincoln which closes with a thump and sends us off to bed people forget how sick not anemic but twisted and ugly the cinema had become before spielberg and lucas made movie theaters safe for families again tarantino looks to the minor glories of that era which were amoral and provocative and not designed to last forever on any storage medium other than film maybe if you were never dragged by an adult to see an endofhollywoodendofamerica movie like hustle with burt reynolds and catherine deneuve you cant truly understand how warped it was that film came out in 1975 the same year as mandingo a repellent brutal film about slavery that is a touchstone for tarantino spaghetti westerns questioned the underpinnings of civilization they examined sick societies through the eyes of tightlipped onedimensional antiheroes surrounded by manic cruel and jaded characters who played terminal games of catandmouse and growled dubbed insults at each other the tense dinner scene at the candyland plantation in django unchained captures their tone when christoph waltz as dr king schultz demands that the harpist sitting behind him stop playing beethoven tarantino shows us the hypocritical european elegance spaghetti westerns layered underneath their operatic gunfights that scene the one at the beginning with schultz holding his lantern looking for an honest man and the blood on the cotton are as original as moments in leone or corbucci certain liberalminded film critics judged beasts of the southern wild harshly were outraged by it describing it as racist shamelessly manipulative and like advertising that putting it mildly is a stretch the film is such a convincing fully realized and overpowering achievement that begrudging its popular and artistic success is feckless the film understands an america that is divorced from social services and beset by environmental collapse but understands those things at the level of fable its not a documentary of katrina and louisiana any more than the wizard of oz was a documentary of the dust bowl and kansas and expecting it to reflect the exact political reality of its time or any kind of progressive politics is like hating the wizard of oz because its not propaganda for the new deal quvenzhané wallis is beasts judy garland and her narration is as emotional and devastating as garland singing somewhere over the rainbow her hopes for the future and for the people in her community are no different from garlands at the end of the wizard of oz thats not a crime and shes not running for office anthony hopkins as hitchcock convinces us that he is not anthony hopkins without convincing us that the lumpy man he is playing is alfred hitchcock his portrayal lacks the sly charm of hitchcocks tv introductions and seems overly interested in telling us hitchcock was sad and weird it does succeed in reminding us that there was a time when film directors had different body types werent all at least sixfootthree didnt go to the gym and didnt all wear sweaters with zippers hitchcock also does two other noteworthy disservices to the master one is that it eliminates his daughter from his marriage to alma reville helen mirren since patricia hitchcock has an acting part in psycho which this film details the making of that is a pointed omission designed to further question hitchcocks marriage the second is that every time hitchcock takes a drinkand this film has him drinking wine and scotch frequently including on the setthe soundtrack accompanies his imbibing with impolite slurping sounds hopkinss prosthetic lips seem winestained throughout ive read a few hitchcock biographies some of which impugn him mightily but i dont recall reading this fastidious man was a slurper this lowkey but agitated antiauthoritarian film often comes off like a buddy movie about two very different men who like to get together to drink paint thinner and antifreeze the master is puzzling at all times ignoring our desire to decipher it as its unspooling if you saw it on film it creates a weird mood as if in a dream the shining got mixed in with altmans popeye it keeps verging on the horrible and the cartoonish without quite getting to either joaquin phoenixs performance successfully combines marlon brando with moe howard while philip seymour hoffman looks on occasionally getting irritated but indulging him all the same amy adams as hoffmans lady macbethish wife puts the brakes on the phoenixhoffman relationship by masturbating hoffman in front of a bathroom sink and uttering threatening nonexplanatory lines like this is something you do for a billion years or not at all when hoffman sings the entirety of the song slow boat to china to phoenix its clear the film is ending and that phoenix will now be free of his demons but why slow boat to china because phoenix was in the navy in world war ii because they met on hoffmans boat because the intense repetitive ad hoc and perhaps meaningless process hoffman has put phoenix through has melted his heart of stone flight is an excellent hardhitting sleazy movie about an alcoholic airline pilot denzel washington really great here who hungover and right after surreptitiously downing three vodka nips crashlands a malfunctioning plane during a storm saving everyone onboard except the flight attendant nadine velazquez hed spent the night with it is so good except for the syrupy last ten minutes that it is hard to believe robert zemeckis who directed it has spent the last twentyfive or so years since he made back to the future directing the things hes directed flight contains many riveting scenes but one with washington alone in a hotel room the night before he faces a hearing about the crash is especially riveting and does not sell out the film its climax comes on a shot of a nip bottle the kind he drank on the plane sitting on top of a minifridge one of 2012s best shots so to speak i went to the sunday matinee of life of pi in 3d at the regal union square stadium 14 and paid my 1850 to get in since it was sunday morning i had stopped on the way and bought a large coffee to drink while i watched the movie as i approached the escalator to get to the floor where the movie was playing a ticket taker stopped me and told me i could not go in with coffee if i wanted to see the movie i would have to finish it before i went in or throw it out i asked why he said it was the theaters policy i suggested that since the cineplex was almost empty because it was eleven in the morning he might just look the other way if i brought the coffee in no way he said they watch me on cameras so i went back downstairs and got my money back sorry ang lee that coffee was more important to me that morning than seeing a movie in 3d instead of seeing it i walked over to the strand which is nearby and looked at the discount books out front while i drank the coffee i picked one up and opened it randomly where i read something that seemed related to life of pi because the movie has a tiger in it reading it also had the virtue of being free and allowing me to drink the coffee while i read it rapti dwell in this thorn and my claw alightson the sweet breasts of poverty and crimemomentarily i considered stealing the book because it mentioned crime and i wanted to get back at the world for the movie theaters absurd policy i bought it though and that and the coffee together cost more than ten dollars less than seeing life of pi making a film featuring the music of benjamin britten and a biblical flood so you will get the chance to see a 12yearold girl dancing in her underwear is a perfect example of going the long way around the barn and the barn is the perfect color the impossible is too one or twonote to succeed as a prestige film it lacks subtext or metaphor or any subtlety at all and deals with climate change head on it is a horror film about western tourists directed by a horror director juan antonio bayona without any of the genre trappings of a horror film note one the first half of the film is the tsunami that struck countries on the indian ocean and the andaman sea including thailand where the film takes place at a pricey resort in 2004 note two is the aftermath of the tsunami during which a family searches for one another across a vast devastated landscape bayonas staging of the tsunami without seemingly without digital effects is relentless convincing terrifying nonstupid and without hollywood wonder the second half features naomi watts the mother in a hospital bed mostly unable to move mostly unattended and slowly dying the film has a message welcome to the vacation of the future fans of jacques rivette carlos saura robert altman and alan rudolph will appreciate geraldine chaplins outofnowhere appearance in the impossible as an elegant older woman also cast adrift by the tsunami who briefly and somewhat enigmatically shows up to speak to one of the two lost sons the impossible is a more trenchant and realistic film about the future of english people in foreign countries than skyfall the two films should play as a double feature the fate of african americans in the south the cia great floods and immobilized bodies these were the themes that got films nominated for oscars in 2012 michael hanekes crossover hit amour begins with the corpse of emmanuelle riva decomposing on her bed and surrounded by flowers through riva the star of resnaiss hiroshima mon amour one of the french films from 1959 that changed everything haneke freezes the european art film in history immobilizes it while delivering a poignant film about aging and dying that will please a mainstream audience somehow this comes off as typical hanekian perversity and slightly annoying last modernist pretentiousness jeanlouis trintignant who has worked with almost every great or even interesting european director from rohmer chabrol and truffaut to kieślowski corbucci and costagavras ends the film and with it haneke implies a whole world of film a whole era he does it in a way that will ensure viewers unfamiliar with haneke understand he didnt make amour for the hallmark channel i was prepared to feel awkward while watching the sessions a noble film about a poet john hawkes immobilized by polio who hires a sex therapist helen hunt to guide him through the first sexual encounters of his life i was not prepared for the combination of helen hunt nude plus a boston accent the fact that the poets first name is mark added to my discomfort mock mock its time to get stotted mock we should stot it was the first time sex in a movie made me want to cover my ears this shrill movie which features lots of yelling reinvents the screwball comedy for a postcollapse america by thoroughly deglamorizing its genre set in a lowermiddleclass philadelphia suburb it is a philadelphia story in which the female lead jennifer lawrence dresses only in black and the male lead bradley cooper no cary grant works out in a garbage bag the craziness of screwball is literalized in silver linings playbook both characters are to varying degrees mentally ill on meds or in therapy the story contains standard romcom elements but david o russell and cinematographer masanobu takayanagi shoot the film in a selfconsciously gritty shaky and underlit way that deflects any resemblance to say friends with benefits silver linings playbook is difficult to like and too long with a climactic dance scene that is filmically botched which is fine with the movie because according to the plot it did not have to be good to succeed the chatty exasperating qualities of coopers pathology which russell understood so well in the fighter are equally present here but cooper seems more violent and unhinged than christian bale did in that movie because hes nicer and closer to normal just as this movie is closer to the romantic experiences of many many people than the standardissue hollywood romcoms it has

Sep 18 2019,negative, i didnt really have any desire to see the avengers mainstream superhero movies arent usually great and the logistics of the teamup seemed likely to make this one even worse but then everyone told me it was awesome from my 10yearold to movie critics ive seen buffy so i know that joss whedon is hideously overhyped but i guessed he could make a superhero film that wasnt entirely wretched im a superhero expert of sorts i wrote a book and everything so with a sense of obligation and moderately high hopes i paid my three bucks and streamed the greatest superhero movie ever tm and having seen it i have to saywhat this is the greatest superhero movie ever seriously yes there are enjoyable bits robert downey jr is pleasingly sardonic and his screwball comedy moments with gwyneth paltrow are fun to watch mark ruffalo brings a lowkey professorial charm to bruce bannerthe hulk scarlett johansen in a formfitting body suit is scarlett johansson in a formfitting body suit and her stunt double does a fantastic job with that chair scene the special effects are fine things blow up the movie is not utterly worthless in every way ill grant that but does that mean its good or even adequate no the script is a farrago of pseudoscience gibberish stitched together with unmotivated interpersonal tension as various superfolk engage in pointless swaggeroffs using dialogue written by lobotomized chimpanzees leavened with the occasional moderately amusing injoke puny god and robert downey jrs ad libs which mostly serve to make you wonder why they didnt just have him write the thing chris evans utters immortal tough guy lines like youre not the guy to make the sacrifice play with the emotive range of a stuffed herbivore the best that can be said for chris hemsworth is that hes less awful the usually reliable samuel jackson seems marooned behind his eyepatch and his hardassed superspy ballbuster default he occasionally gazes with weary nononsense meaningfulness at the camera clearly seeing visions of being transported to some other movie that does not suck tom hiddleston has been much praised and he does give loki some sort of depth but the bythenumbers supervillain ranting is hard to overcome he ends up switching between megalomania and mild whining nobody who is forced to lose in a battle of quips with hemsworth can really be said to be lighting up the screen ive seen claims that the movie makes some sort of stand for feminism and the black widow does get to kick ass and is an integral part of saving the world theres not much else to it but sure its better than all those films where the strong female hero doesnt actually get to do anything on the other hand the overall ideological message is typical superhero halfassed vigilante fascism democratic institutions cant be trusted to keep us safe because milksop administrators lack the nerve so you need to rely on ollie north types to make the tough decisions and deploy the violent overmen youre supposed to give a super cheer at the end when tony stark dumps an atomic bomb on some distant city of twisted nightmarish alien others who attacked the homeland did he hit a military target a civilian one are there noncombatants over there eh who cares as long as downey gets back safely for the next installment not that the film is morally noxious unlike the dark knight rises little thought has gone into its ethics or its message we replay hiroshima just because no one could think of anything better not because whedon actually wants to make a plea for genocidal violence the real emotional energy goes into the postbattle celebration in which we see rows of screens each filled with bedazzled witnesses trumpeting the superheroes collective awesomeness  the spectators watching in the theater or on their computer screens are clearly encouraged to join in the film functioning as a naked advertisement for itself and its inevitable sequels on that level its marvelously effective the hype is still roping in credulous viewers however much they may regret it afterwards
Jun 8 2019,positive,tightly scripted and filled with enough moments of levity to balance the extended and spectacular battle sequences
May 8 2019,positive,gets everything right so entertaining when our characters gather to fight loki who is the best
Apr 18 2019,positive, loki wants to rule earth  theres really no other way to put it  after promising to turn over the tesseract to the chitauri they will provide him with an army  oh loki dont go making promises you cant keep  it probably will not end well back on earth dr selvig stellan skarsgård is continuing his research at the project pegasus facility  before you know it loki has both him and clint barton jeremy renner under some sort of mind control  while the avengers initiative had been discussed a few years earlier it was placed on hold  they dont really go into details as to why this is  this certainly doesnt stop nick fury samuel l jackson or maria hill cobie smulders from putting the avengers together  first its putting in a call to natasha romanoff scarlett johanssoncertainly one of the funniest bits in the film  natasha is ordered to retrieve bruce banner mark ruffalo  it takes some convincing after banners previous troubles  finally agent coulson clark gregg gets tony stark robert downey jr while fury gets steve rogers chris evans its not until the avengers capture loki that everything starts to fall apart  mischief is lokis way so this naturally makes sense  the last thing anyone wants to see is hulk running around on the helicarrier but sure enough it happens  again loki wants them to be in disarray  what pushes everyone over the edge is the supposed death of phil coulson  as we know now hes not really dead for good  on the ground everyone comes together to put a stop to lokis evil plan  seeing them gathered in the circle above photo is just one of those moments that one can only sit there and take in the visual effects here are phenomenal to say the least  its not just the character designs but the set pieces  its aweinspiring to actually get to see the helicarrier on screen  when you read the comics you never know what will and will not be on screen  but to see it on screen  its really awesome its not just this  in seeing how shield runs we get our first look at the world security council including gideon malick powers boothe and hawley jenny agutter danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them  she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
Apr 12 2019,positive, a movie five films in the making the avengers finally brings together a plethora of popular comic book characters pieced together with wit and style by writerdirector joss whedon the avengers begins with the earth threatened by loki tom hiddleston the brother of thor chris hemsworth this forces director of shield nick fury samuel l jackson to assemble the only team of crime fighters that can possibly stop loki a team that includes thor iron mantony stark robert downey jr bruce bannerthe incredible hulk mark ruffalo and captain america chris evans the film begins with a bang and builds from there a thrill ride peppered with whedons trademark selfaware humor its fun to watch all these egos clash especially downey who just owns the tony stark role evans has found his stride as well and in an added bonus the script manages to milk some unexpected humor out of hulk which proves to be a pleasant surprise the humor and witty dialogue are key elements to the avengers with the action being the other major portion it doesnt disappoint especially two extended set pieces the first takes place on a hover craft and the second a great sequence depicting the climactic battle in new york city working on a script from max landis son of john landis chronicle follows three high school students who gain superpowers after finding a strange glowing substance deep inside a cave in the middle of the woods the boys at first use their newfound gifts for jokes and fun but things take a turn for the worse when andrew dane dehaan  the bullied loner of the group  starts to use his powers for much more sinister purposes this is where chronicle separates itself from the rest of the superhero pack this isnt the nice and cuddly makings of a hero movie chronicle is more about the evolution of a villain  with andrews back story including an alcoholic and abusive father and lack of acceptance from most of the student body dehaan is really good at capturing andrews slow descent into the dark side while alex russell and michael b jordan are also good as the other two members of the teenage superpower trio trank keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace with some clever ways of making the found footage more than just a onecamera perspective and just when it looks like the film might start to lose a little steam trank introduces some pretty cool flying sequences that could have been cheesy yet work really well chronicle is rated pg13 for intense action and violence thematic material some language sexual content and teen drinking and will be available tuesday on dvd  to get sportswritermovie reviewer micheal comptons uptothe minute thoughts on all things movies visit his blog at mcomptonwordpresscom or his twitter page at twittercommcompton428 you can also email him at mcomptonbgdailynewscom
Feb 2 2019,positive, the avengers is spectacular in several senses of the word it is literally a spectacle with people flying up into the sky monsters plummeting out of it airships flying through it and so on however the real dynamism here is in the character interactions not something one expects of even a regular superhero movie let alone one where a bunch of different storylines have to intersect meaningfully followers of marvel comics characters in the movies have already seen robert downey jr star in two iron man films chris evans as captain america and chris hemsworth as thor the alien mistaken by the ancient vikings as a god although mark ruffalo is new to the role there have been two previous hulk movies in the last decade there have also been spiderman fantastic four and xmen movies but those dont come into play here scarlett johansson as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye clark gregg as agent coulson and the essential samuel l jackson as shield director nick fury have all turned up in one or more of the aforementioned features so the avengers comes into frame lugging a trainload of back story however the avengers hits the ground running more or less literally and finds deft ways to bring us up to speed on the various histories should we have missed or forgotten anything without boring those who know directorwriter joss whedon working from a screen story cocrafted with zak penn finds enormous amounts of fun in putting together people who are accustomed to being viewed as odd with new folks they cant help finding even odder the short version of the setup here is that something is stolen from shield and fury reaches out to his operatives  some less enthusiastic than others  when it turns out that the earth is imperiled by the object itself the entity who has stolen it and the allies he summons we know that ultimately all of the main characters are going to figure out how to work together to save the planet  they are after all super heroes not supershirkers  but see how they variously overcome their differences or revel in their similarities is much of the fun most films in this genre  the xmen series being the notable exception  have to focus on one awesome figure and make every other good guy a bit less awesome in comparison avengers cant shouldnt and doesnt do that here everyone has a tactical function but more each one of the avengers fills the screen in a way that none of the others can whedon directs the action kinetically and makes sure to give each characters unique abilities a proper showcase without having to slow down to underscore thats what hes doing there does seem to be a particular sense of joy when it comes to the hulk as well as some glorious physical stunt work by johanssons black widow and cobie smulders agent maria hill we get the sense that downeys stark is first among equals here perhaps because of the main characters he not only has the biggest arc but is the most mercurial his philosophical clashes with evans straightarrow steve rogers aka captain america are wonderful to watch because of their differences but even more memorable are his scenes of surprised affinity with ruffalos bruce bannerhulk theres something genuinely affecting in seeing these two men used to being misunderstood or not understood at all finding kindred spirits in the midst of thundering havoc all around a note of special appreciation about the hulk here  not only does ruffalo give us a man who is in a state of minor exasperation at all times the better to defuse his rage and major selfimposed loneliness but the visual effects department gives us the best iteration of the hulk since lou ferrigno went green we can still see ruffalos performance within the hulk rather than having cgi trying to impose a version of an actors face on something that looks like a badlyproportioned videogame avatar which has been the case with at least one previous iteration of the hulk hemsworth remains a delight as the slightly befuddled but utterly game thor and tom hiddleston is elegantly wounded as thors spiteful stepbrother loki one caveat  lokis horned helmet doesnt look any less silly than it did in thor this bit of costume design does not survive translation to live action well but hiddleston bears up under it nobly johansson is coolly capable and of course looks fantastic as natasha romanovblack widow and renner targets some emotional moments with understated precision the entire cast is terrific the 3d doesnt distract from the film although it seems unnecessary  the effects all look like they are satisfyingly dimensional enough without the extra process and it would have been nice to see the kind of colors those dark glasses inevitably tamp down in summation the avengers will appeal to fans of comic books fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue its a pretty awesome assembly
Jan 19 2019,positive, have you ever imagined what it would be like if the iconic superheroes shared a universe  the avengers turns that fantasy into reality  the avengers astounds its way through the hearts and minds of the geeks around the globe and kicks off the 2012 summer blockbuster into high gear catching a flash of the avengers logo and its star performers at the 2010 comiccon whet my appetite for a bigger treat  while dc has lagged far behind with its superheroes ensemble justice league clearly were in for something extraordinary with marvel  a culmination of superhero movies which started with iron man  and continued with the hulk thor and captain america  i was cautiously optimistic  director joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer firefly would attempt to go where no man has gone before and hes pulled it off with a superhero aplomb each of the main characters is unique in its own way and strong enough to carry a movie on its own so pulling them all together and bringing in more characters would be a gargantuan task  a lot could have gone wrong  fortunately a lot goes right loki tom hiddleston the disturbed brother of thor makes his appearance past the galactic portal steals the tesseract a source of infinite energy from the shield base an international peacekeeping agency and leaves the ground crumble and destructions behind director nick fury samuel l jackson who may also have a hidden agenda to regain the cosmic cube knows that its time to activate the avengers initiative a remarkable team of superheroes uniting forces to save the world  its hard to conjure up a villain who would pose a credible threat to the avengers but loki is not to be dismissed  he promises to unleash chiaturi an extraterrestrial army to aid him in conquering the earth and carrying on his vengeance against thor the eclectic ensemble of superheroes is made up of brilliant industrialist in armored suit tony starkiron man robert downey jr recently thawed from ice wwii allamerican patriot steve rogerscaptain america chris evans god of thunder thor chris hemsworth jekyllandhyde scientist bruce bannerhulk mark ruffalo superspy and assassin natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson and master archer clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner  they all gather inside a helicarrier an invisible flying fortress lifting up from the sea the team goes off to a rocky start  big egos and personalities mixed with superpowers clash  these largerthanlife characters are used to the be the center of attention and dont always play by the rules  the interactions among the alpha characters are the highlight of the movie  plenty of deadon fantastically funny oneliners  eventually they realize that they need to set aside their differences and work together as a team there are a number of memorable scenes  rdj is still a wisecrack standout and has the coolest entrance as iron man lands on the stark tower and unzips into tony stark and later skydives back into the suit  thors late appearance latching onto the aircraft amid thunders and lightning is pretty grand  captain america takes an integral role as a leader worthy of the captain title  hes more impressive here than in his own solo flick last summer  black widow showcases her combat agility by managing to escape out of an impossibly tight situation and toward the end utilizes caps shield as a springboard leaps into the air and pursues a flying alien  hawkeye falls down hundreds of feet shoots an arrow swings into a building and lands back on his feet if theres a surprising scene stealer its the hulk ruffalo replacing eric bana 2003 and edward norton 2008 plays the role to the hilt both as a nerdy human and monstrous beast there are outrageously hilarious scenes separately involving loki thor iron man and all that smashing as much as id love to see a deeper story its typically reserved for a singular superhero film xmen first class notwithstanding  the avengers forgoes complexity for spectacle by equally shining the spotlight on each character who serves a purpose spectacular set pieces and special effects amazing actions and rollingonthefloor humor  its incredible to see all of these superheroes heroically banding together in one scene  the final battle in manhattan concludes with a selfless act from an unexpected character at nearly 25 hours it doesnt feel like it  and its originally longer  its been said that a lot of captain americas scenes ended up on the cutting floor  id be interested in seeing more of his scenes as initially filmed coming to terms with his past awakening and adjusting to the modern world  stay past the credits for two additional scenes the first one as a spoiler for the geeks and the second appeals to the general audience nathalia aryani is

Jan 8 2019,positive, critics the world over will be scratching their heads and shaking nervously as they ponder their writeup of marvels avengers assemble 2012 previously titled the avengers following an average set of trailers and a suspiciously lowkey viral marketing campaign only chronic liars and eternal optimists will claim they saw this coming not only is avengers assemble the best comic book adaptation to date but also arguably one of the greatest action adventure blockbusters in cinema history up there with the likes of star wars 1977 raiders of the lost ark 1981 and ghostbusters 1984high praise indeed but in one fell swoop director joss whedon has not only reinvigorated the  marvel comic movie franchise but also thrown down the gauntlet at christopher nolans feet the unstoppable juggernaut that is nolans the dark knight rises 2012 might be destined for greatness but it will have to be truly exceptional to better this take on the earths mightiest heroes the balancing act whedon has pulled off is nothing short of aweinspiring as both  screenwriter and director he has brought together a bunch of iconic characters and created a film in which they shine not only as individuals but also dazzle as part of the avengers team fears that this would be the iron man show are quickly diminished robert downey jrs  effortlessly charismatic tony stark is at the centre of the action  but as any avid reader of the comics will tell you iron man and captain america are the teams prominent characters and their turbulent relationship is at the heart of most of the films best moments some critics will say chris evans that captain america is overshadowed by downey jrs iron man but they would be missing the point iron man is the wisecracking millionaire playboy and cap is the steadyboy scout soldier with evans underplaying the role perfectly despite his ridiculous costume all the heroes are great with perhaps the exception of samuel l jacksons nick fury but its more a case of jackson doing a good job with a fairly weak character chris hemsworths thor jeremy renners hawkeye and scarlett johanssons black widow all get some fabulous scenes and tom hiddleston is suitably impish and evil as main antagonist loki yet its mark ruffalos hulkbruce banner that really steals the show the eric banaedward norton angry mindless versions of the jolly green giant pale in comparison  finally we have a hulk we can all get behind whedons masterful avengers assemble deserves an essay and no short review could ever do it justice but if youre in the market for one of the most wondrous and entertaining cinematic experience you could ever hope to have book your tickets buy your popcorn and prepare to be amazed
Jan 4 2019,positive, its taken a long time  and a lot of money  to assemble the avengers marvel studios began developing the superhero superfilm seven years ago a screenwriter began work in 2007 the stars who played the eponymous characters from captain america the first avenger thor and the two iron man films  as well as a new hulk  were brought together for the first time their salaries and more importantly the special effects that turn movies into spectacles led to a reported 220 million budget    the result the avengers is an engagingenough film but with that kind of treasure talent and time youd expect more  a lot more than this completely conventional action flick delivers    director joss whedon takes his time establishing the plot  which seems silly given that its the same story weve seen in countless action films loki tom hiddleston thors badsheep brother steals the tesseract held by nick fury samuel l jackson director of peacekeeping agency shield the potential energy this cube holds makes it dangerous  and loki plans to hand it over to the other in exchange for an army of chitauri with which loki can conquer earth    freedom is lifes great lie loki declares in one of his frequent purpleprosed disquisitions the survival of humanity scarlett johansson in every sense  is at stake so fury brings out the big guns the avengers    youre going to leave the future of the human race up to a handful of freaks someone asks fury it turns out to be a good question loki didnt even need to come up with a plan to divide and conquer them they do it on their own what else would you expect when you put into a single room a huge egotist robert downey jrs iron man an earnest patriot chris evans captain america a demigod out of water chris hemsworths thor and a genius with an angermanagement problem mark ruffalo the new hulk    oh wait marvel realized there wasnt any eye candy in that group so theyve thrown into the mix the black widow scarlett johansson an agent not a superhero    you can predict how this bythebooks flick will go bad guy possesses item that will bring him immense power good guys are assembled to stop him good guys fight amongst themselves until a loss makes them realize who the real enemy is right before a final fight that uses most of the films big budget    dont expect it all to make sense though when bruce banner first turns into the hulk here he goes after the black widow whos been sympathetic to his plight the next time he becomes big and green hes totally on team avenger smashing only members of the alien army  with no indication of how he was tamed    that showdown takes forever to unfold too why did they bother theres nothing here we havent seen in any of the big summer flicks of the last few years how many shots do we need of thor taking his hammer to a collection of computergenerated creations    at first it seems like downey is going to get all the great lines but every character is given his chance to shine lets face it this is a bizarre group of people to assemble of course thered be roughandtumble hilarity thor wants a chance to talk loki out of his delusions of grandeur and tells the team his brother can be redeemed black widow points out how many people loki has killed in just two days hes adopted thor deadpans in response  
Dec 7 2018,neutral, as i continue down the roadtoinfinitywar i come to the pinnacle of marvel cinematic universe phase one the culmination of five films and the foundational worldbuilding that led to the avengers in 2012 we had never seen anything like it sure there were those old universal monster movies that paired up frankenstein dracula and company but never did we see such a wide range collection of disparate properties tied together into a cohesive narrative i remember much talk then of if something like this could even work from a storytelling perspective let alone into a crowdpleasing blockbuster to be honest when the first trailer dropped for the avengers i didnt know if it would all come together boy did this film prove itself to me and the world tasked with the job of making the film was joss whedon as director love him or hate him he has made a career off of writing and envisioning ensemble productions making him a nobrainer at least from a writing perspective handing him the keys to the kingdom as a film director was a creative risk in the eyes of many as he had only directed one theatricalrelease film prior 2005s serenity a fanpleasing conclusion of sorts to his abruptly canceled space western firefly still his credits on television as the creative lead run numerous and popular fans knew he could handle the storytelling demands of unique individuals working even begrudgingly together toward a common goal he had even written comics and wrote scripts for unmade comicbook movies like his muchstoried take on wonder woman years prior to it actually being made with this he had his work cut out for him taking iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america and supporting characters into a believable threat scenario and make them gel as a cohesive team as a survey of those films creates a list of similarities and differences the good news was that everyone was pretty impeccably cast coming in the reality though was that it all lives or dies by his script in this film we see the avengers initiative only hinted at and talked around prior to now coming into the time of greatest need the director of shield nick fury samuel l jackson enlists the assistance of tony stark robert downey jr steve rogers chris evans and bruce banner mark ruffalo replacing edward norton in supplement to the vast resources and agents he leads he knows that at a time when the earth is in supernatural and lifethreatening peril that an ordinary solution cant fix extraordinary problems each of these men is incredibly unique and gifted in their own ways stark patrols the world as iron man his technological marvel of a suit rogers is captain america a supersoldier military strategist brought back to life after decades frozen with impeccable character and the ability to lead others and banner is one of earths brightest scientific mind even if his rage brings about a destructive monster the hulk they as well as specialagent natasha romanov scarlett johansson must work together alongside the asgardian demigod thor chris hemsworth to stop loki from bringing an alien force to earth and destroying everything we know and love its a fairly simple concept that required every bit of the five preceding films to set up properly with all the pieces put in place this film gets to be the playground we get to watch our toys used to their fullest potential with whedon accompanied by zak penn who was well versed in writing comicbook films i can say that the script is what keeps us coming back over the years of all the mcu phase one films this is undoubtedly the most fun and i watch it often even after all these years you can tell whedon had a ball making this and surely he felt the amazement writing it that audiences got while watching it all play out the mere mortal shield agent coulson clark gregg the connective glue of a character that appeared in almost all of the preceding films acts as an avatarofsorts for the audience here showing the amazement we are all feeling by seeing the events take place he plays an incredibly important role in everything here from a storytelling perspective as well as making it all relatable is the film the most comicbookey of them all of course but why wouldnt it be its that aspect that it nails so well if you go back and reread the original avengers comic debut youll see that we could have gotten something far hokier than what they wrote those original characters are mostly here but the threat is more credible here and post911 the new york city setting resonated without feeling exploitative the threat faced here is one that can be understood globally and thats likely the reason the film was embraced worldwide with many countries rebranding the captain america film to only the first avenger for political reasons it was good to see this film embraced as the threat is not from earth but against us from the chitauri an invading alien force brought here by loki tom hiddleston was it necessary that we have a deep understanding of who the chitauri were to enjoy this film not at all they are cannonfodder at the behest of loki and its probably for the best that we only get shrieks and grunts from them it cements that them as a force rather than characters we need to fully understand it isnt a bad thing per se but with this compulsion to understand villains we feel in modern times it is a critique i have heard for any wanting to dig into understanding a villain they need only to look to loki arguably he is the central piece that makes this whole thing work as well as it does sure audiences myself included love to hear starks banter and the like but without a believable and investable villain it all fails hiddleston returns to his role in even finer form than he did originally its hard to put into words the entertainment that is experienced seeing this film play out even after multiple times of seeing it the incredibly crowdpleasing moments this film has in spades still hold their charm and thats rare for any film to do the comedy and exhilaration that comes from the perfectly peppered jokes and action setpieces are amazing to experience and even more so to ponder that it all works so well the film is supplemented by an incredible hero theme from alan silvestri the look and feel of the film feels an appropriate extension to each of the preceding films while still maintaining an identity of its own honestly this is the first of the films to cement an identity as a marvel style that really carries through to the most recent films crisp clean and colorful with zippy dialogue and a sense of fun throughout does it begin to feel derivative to many yes but here we see the reason for its appeal there is little darkness on display here with the lighting of the above picture showing about as dark as it gets the use of color is dramatic here and it keeps everything light and approachable this films boxoffice receipts prove just how approachable the final film turned out being perhaps the biggest strength of the film is witnessing the hulk truly come into his own as a star his films never seemed to fully resonate with all people but i have yet to find a person who didnt love everything about him here he quite possibly steals the show whenever he is on screen due to a much more relatable banner from ruffalo and his ability here to actually grin from time to time who knew the swagger that robert downey jr brings clashes headon with the oldschool heroics of chris evans the seeds of conflict are planted here as we know they eventually come to blows later down the line while its necessary to the story for clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner to be featured as a villain first it does feel weird to see him as mindless before we get to see him as fullon heroic still dont take that as serious critique all of the casting is so well done and natural that the strength of the cast is mindblowing visually there are so many setpiece moments and the liveaction helicarrier still takes my breath away every time much has been written about the sheer amount of destruction that takes place in the film and while we could debate the effectiveness of our heroes in saving the day its undeniably a thrill to watch the last hour or so transpire some of the films best comedy funny enough comes amidst the bombast of explosions and fighting that takes place all of the strength of these moments stems from the firm establishment of characters we know and love and it comes naturally and all just feels right it all results in an exhilarating mix of emotion that is like riding a thrill ride seeing it all in 3d back in the day was a highlight of that medium for me and the fun translates regardless of the format you watch it on contentwise there is mild language and action galore but i find it impossible to keep this movie away from kids there is so much fun to be had in enjoying it it is the wishfulfillment of kids everywhere regardless of their age i never thought id see the day that these heroes would share the screen but honestly it brought tears to my eyes in 2012 not because of anything deeply moving in the film but just in seeing how incredibly welldone the final product was i can think of nothing that would improve what we got its not perfect because what film is but it is likely the pinnacle of what the mcu can be for the broadest of audiences on the topic of spiritual matters there is little other than that great line from captain america about god its just a fun and character appropriate moment that felt good to see that being said i dont see anything here that is spiritually troubling allinall the film is about as good of a time one can have at the movies
Nov 21 2018,positive, let me just start off by saying i did not have high hopes for this film it was going to be a box office smash regardless next youve got six superheroes four of whom are used to having the spotlight all to themselves then youve got screen time issues character development and the challenge to develop a story with heartall while demolishing a city or two oh and lets not forget establishing that no one superhero is better or stronger than any other it seemed an impossible task well against all odds they pulled it off thanks in large part to writerdirector joss whedon our story begins or rather continues in the labs of shield where nick fury samuel l jackson receives an unwelcome visit from the god loki tom hiddleston loki is back for revenge after his brother thor chris hemsworth humiliated him the last time he tried to takeover earth loki steals a topsecret sustainable power source and hypnotizes hawkeye jeremy renner and professor selvig stellan skarsgård to assist him in his evil doings the mischievous god plans on unleashing an alien army to take over earth its up to nick fury to resurrect the scrapped avengers initiative he must unite iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo captain america chris evans black widow scarlet johansson hawkeye and thor if there is any hope of saving the planet make no mistake this is an incredible action movie from special effects to fights to explosions it hits every marker but the movie is so much more its hysterically funny charming and smart that was the first time in years i have been in a movie theater when the crowd on multiple occasions erupted in spontaneous applause i predict avengers 2 is in the works not to mention 3 and 4 you know what bring them on
Nov 18 2018,positive, synopsis exiled asgard prince loki tom hiddleston with the help of a sinister alien race is able to wormhole his way to earth by latching on to the tesseract energy source there lokis plan is to rule over earth but spy agent shield contacts round all the known superheroes to combat loki and retrieve the tesseract review avengers assemble does exactly what it says on the tin the avengers assemble and proceed to smash things up  a lot dont get me wrong its all highly enjoyable with joss whedons vision for the avengers coming very much in the lineage of jj abrams recent star trek reboot theyre both highly literate have a pleasing selfawareness and lightness of touch while always honouring the fanboy actionheavy element to the genre
Oct 31 2018,positive,the avengers shatters the last barrier separating the printed page and the celluloid image fully wresting the superhero genre away from the medium that birthed it
Oct 31 2018,negative,sounds kind of corny you say oh thats nothing massive cornshucking in this film corn piled everywhere cornpone corn fritters corn syrup corn as high as an elephants eye the feast of our great god corn
Oct 31 2018,positive, shield director nick fury samuel l jackson has come into possession of the tesseract a mysterious cube that could be a source of unlimited energy the tesseract activates a portal

the pinnacle of marvel studios output and a showcase for their biggest heroes who arent currently licensed to other studios like the xmen and spiderman marvels taken great care to set up their cinematic universe and a massive amount of time and effort have gone into bringing the avengers to the big screen to further up the stakes marvel turned the film over to joss whedon who has tremendous amounts of talent and fanboy good will but little experience in blockbuster spectacles of this size the gamble pays off however as the avengers is simply pure unadulterated comic book thrills a fourcolor 3d rush of adrenaline heart and wit the amount of talent in front of and behind the camera that marvels assembled is no less than staggering as writer and director whedon has a clear love for the characters as well as an eye for both crowdpleasing spectacle and visual beauty the script never panders to the audience nor does it try to deny or belittle its origins a story about characters who can fly hurl cars and fire energy beams cant take itself too seriously after all however whedon never tries to make the film too serious always maintaining a careful balance of light and dark dramatic monologues are broken up by witty asides or genuinely humorous moments that give the film depth and humanity whedons only feature film credit as a director prior to the avengers is serenity which proved he was more than capable of staging huge action sequences and juggling a full cast of oversized characters he certainly has his hands full here but he handles everything beautifully each character is given an opportunity to shine in heroics and in dialogue with particular attention paid to how they all interact as a unit one of whedons biggest strengths as he demonstrated on buffy the vampire slayer is showing how highly dysfunctional and damaged individuals can come together to form a coherent functional whole that benefits from both the flaws and the strengths of each unit the scenes of the avengers arguing about what to do next are just as interesting as seeing them take down a flight of alien bioships or seeing iron man and thor literally butting heads superhero films live and die on the strength of their action sequences and time and again whedon delivers them with flair and style his superfights are lessons in physics where impossibly strong characters hurl nearindestructible opponents back and forth uprooting trees smashing glass and digging trenches into the ground each bout is edited with very careful precision detailing the meticulous choreography and mastery of space present in each during one battle perspectives are constantly shifted between the heroes but its done in a confident assured manner that reminds us how all of these individual melees are connected and how the team is working for a singular purpose greater than their own personal aims its character depth through fisticuffs that avoids the things go boom mentality common in most summer action films likewise each character is treated as a fullyfleshed individual and not reduced to a single personality trait or to their individual abilities tony stark and steve rogers get the most screen time their personalities near total opposites in most ways with stark being the selfproclaimed billionaire genius playboy philanthropist and rogers being the good soldier struggling to maintain order downey has tony stark down perfect at this point and whedon hands him the majority of the films funniest lines all of them delivered in a selfsatisfied smirk that clearly hides starks own fears and doubts evans on the other hand portrays the good captain as more than just a soldier out of time his oldfashioned virtues are at odds with both starks freewheeling independence and modern warfares shades of gray and its how he handles the conflict between doing what needs to be done and following orders that makes rogers the heart of the team evans calm balanced portrayal makes him the most sympathetic of the team and the most dynamic rogers is never a blustering supersoldier or a boy scout with a shield evans also happens to have one of the finest rear ends in modern cinema history which is just extra spangles on the jump suit hemsworth and hiddleston continue the shakespearean dueling that made thor so compelling loki isnt a cartoonish maniacal laugh type of villain and hiddleston approaches the role as a genuine character and not a twodimensional image loki is a highly fallible creature just like his brother thor both asgardians wear masks of bravado thor to shield himself from emotional involvement and loki to hide an inferiority complex that drives almost every action the brothers are more alike than either one would care to admit and this comes out in the tense lovehate interactions between the two the avengers is a team however and the three biggest personalities dont get all the spotlight johansson gets much more to do here than look good and kick ass although she does both effortlessly at first glance the black widow seems an odd partner for characters like thor and iron man but her true strengths lie in the fact that she cant simply pick up a city bus with one hand or blast a warship out of the sky she has to rely on skill and wit more than perhaps any other character and watching her roughandtumble upcloseandpersonal luchalibreinspired fighting style is a genuine highlight of the film renner has perhaps the hardest job in establishing hawkeye in the universes firmament having only had a brief cameo in thor prior to this hes the least developed of the avengers but hes still a compelling personality and like the widow his strength lies in his relatively frail humanity mark ruffalo takes over for edward norton as bruce banner and he fully inhabits the role both figuratively and literally as banner hes a worldweary man constantly walking on eggshells with his own thoughts and plagued with selfhatred for his inability to contain his alter ego ruffalo also portrays the hulk through motion capture and he gives this hulk a distinct physicality and human connection that pure cgi could never match its a shame though that samuel l jackson doesnt give more life to nick fury although hes still perfect to play the role and whedon wisely reigns in jacksons inherent coolguy vibe fury is not the kind to spout obscenities about snakes on a shield helicarrier you may notice that ive not devoted a lot of time to mentioning specific scenes or moments in the film this is entirely deliberate there are so many great moments that it would be hard to list them all and it would be cruel to ruin the fun of seeing them for the first time theres more than one piece of action or line of dialogue that caused laughter so loud during my screening that i decided i would have to go see the film again just to catch the bits i couldnt hear theres a moment toward the end of the films climactic battle that not only ranks among one of whedons best visual gags ever but quite possibly one of the best visual gags in superhero films period its the avengers themselves who make the film as dynamic as it is its not their powers or their battles but them as individuals and as a family even if its a family not of their own choosing whedons signature is showing how outsiders and freaks are perhaps the most heroic of us all his characters all battle personal demons as well as literal ones and nobody has an easy time doing it still what makes whedons work so appealing is seeing how these jagged pieces can fit together in a way so seamless that its impossible to imagine them as separate parts buffy could never do what she does without the scoobies help and that shows fourth season quite literally showed them becoming one to battle an opponent that would be impossible to defeat without a bond that strong likewise the avengers may fight amongst each other and they might fall down more than once and quite spectacularly but they always succeed in the end by relying on each other much like how the xmen can inspire the outcasts to fight for themselves and the future the true strength of the avengers is their reminder that the world exists outside of ourselves and nothing is impossible if your friends and family are beside you will there be a sequel is the hulk green spoiler alert yes lets just say that the postcredit scene had multiple people in my audience myself included shouting holy shit and desperate for 2015 to arrive the avengers is on track to be one of the biggest films of the year and its by far the best superhero film in nearly a decade this is what a comic book movie should be thrilling exciting and surprisingly almost shockingly human

Aug 29 2018,positive,black widow has so much potential we hope they seize on it within the next 6 years a tumbleweed blows by
Aug 23 2018,positive, there has already been a great deal of praise for writerdirector joss whedons handling of the epic marvel mashup avengers assemble 2012 and its easy to see why drawing together a group of impressive marvel heroes  most of whom have had their own films over the past five years  is no easy task especially if you are also trying to appeal to a bigger market than simply comic book geeks thankfully whedon has successfully achieved this feat with humour action and sheer spectaclebanished god of asgaard loki tom hiddleston has come to earth in order to rain down terror with the aid of an incredible powerful artefact the tesseract which will allow him to open a portal for an invading alien race  fortunately the steely mind of shield agent nick fury samuel jackson has a plan to bring together earths mightiest heroes including iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner in order to thwart lokis evil master plan the problem is that heroes have big egos and they dont always play nice  but will they finally come together to save or avenge the earth central to the success of this hollywood blockbuster is its sheer simplicity whedon might be a selfconfessed comic book geek of epic proportions sometimes it isnt good to get what you want but the real reason he was brought in is that he understands characters a fact demonstrated in the much underrated firefly its bigscreen spinoff serenity 2005 and of course buffy the vampire slayer understanding characters means that he understands what makes for a tremendously enjoyable film jampacked with heroes that millions know and love  perhaps most satisfying of all is the way whedon has crafted the definitive bruce bannerhulk character expertly portrayed by ruffalo with the help of ilm motion capture who does well to bounce off the playboy wit of downey jrs tony stark the action in avengers assemble is simply breathtaking the final action scene which runs for over halfanhour is aweinspiring in its proportions with audiences able to witness manhattan brought to its knees as the halfdozen heroes desperately fight to save it these impressive final scenes along with some fantastic comic moments as the heroes squabble in the way only superheroes can make for a great popcorn action film avengers assemble is neither hugely sophisticated nor subtle but is all the better for it this is a backtobasics purists action movie that should leave audiences fully satisfied something that none of the previous marvel films has ever truly achieved  make sure you also stay in your seats for a mouthwatering postcredits surprise
Mar 5 2018,positive,for an action movie there are a lot of genuinely funny lines there were parts of this movie that had my laughing out loud
Nov 11 2017,positive,probably the best superherocomics movie of all time full review in spanish
Oct 23 2017,positive, if youre sitting there going i dont like comic booksuperhero movies so i dont care about the avengers well fine but just know youre passing up the most fun that can be had at the movies this year the avengers written and directed by whedon is not flawless there are some trouble spots but when stacked against the sheer pleasure derived in watching those issues ultimately dont matter because even with a couple squiffy points the avengers is not a mess it should be but it isnt it works on nearly every level and is a testament to a great director working with a great group of actors and a studio that knew when to get out of the way and let the creatives be creative we already know 99 of the characters in the avengers we know tony starkiron man we know thor and steve rogerscaptain america and bruce bannerthe hulk even if we are getting a new take on banner courtesy mark ruffalo we got an idea of natasha romanovblack widow in iron man 2 who here has a muchexpanded role and you wont hate scarlett johansson the only new avenger is jeremy renners clint bartonhawkeye of whom we only got the barest of glimpses in last summers thor so the movie assumes that we know these people and doesnt waste time with reintroducing them in renners case this is slightly problematic as we really do not know barton as a person and he spends the first half of the movie as lokis bitch so theres never a strong connection with him like if he never came back i dont think wed miss him still if youve missed any of the previous character movies you wont be left adrift by the avengers whedons script handles characterization in very compact increments so that we get a clear picture of each person and their relationships very quickly and with minimal fuss its a real accomplishment of writing the plot is similarly compartmentalized centering around the tesseract that glowy cube from captain america which if you didnt see it doesnt matter because one line establishes that this an important thing that everyone wants and a responding oneliner from rogers conveys that it is also very bad news the plot in barest form is that shield is trying to use the tesseract as a new energy source but they accidentally summon loki tom hiddleston war horse thors halfdemented little brother from whatever spacepocket he fell into at the end of thor loki immediately destroys everything mindcontrols hawkeye into being his bitch and absconds with the tesseract so nick fury samuel l jackson assembles his avengers and then proceeds two hours of straight ass kicking acts one and two are basically avengeronavenger violence and act three is loki and his space army vs the avengers leveling most of mid and lower manhattan in the process it will rock your face off what isnt working in this movie is the story structure of acts one and two it plays out more like a series of vignettes rather than a cohesive narrative although i really dont know how you do any better given that you have to get six different people in the same place whedon uses loki as his means of bringing out each avenger giving them all a scene opposite hiddleston who plays loki with a scary mix of confidence aloofness and insanity hes a great villain and hiddleston is clearly having a ball playing him which makes him incredibly fun to watch his best scene is easily the confrontation between loki and the black widow and damn if johansson doesnt really deliver as the uberspy natasha theyre clearly sowing seeds for a potential black widow movie and while i dont think we need it id watch it if whedon was in charge things even out in act three though as the avengers get to new york to try and stop lokis space army i cannot stress enough how amazing the assault on new york is each avenger has a chance to shine and everyone even the ridiculous bowandarrowwielding hawkeye contributes in a meaningful way and for all the chaos that is raining down the action is executed clearlyit isnt a headacheinducing mess like transformers act three is also when the two avengers who struggle most with characterization get their shit together and deliver that being chris evans as captain america and renner as hawkeye captain america is a challenge because hes so boring and such a dogooder that theres no internal conflict from which to derive drama evans does his level best through the first half of the movie but its only when cap begins clicking along with stark that he feels like a fully realized character theres just a hint of sarcasm in evans delivery when he deals with stark that serves cap well and should be remembered for captain america 2 letting the inner cranky old man out of cap makes him more interesting as for hawkeye when he is finally back in his right mind renner delivers as a stonecold assassin fueled by a well of cold rage i dont think id want to see a hawkeye movie but as a dude who lurks on the periphery hes very effective but as is always the case with rdj its tony stark who rules the roost he is at his sarcastic bitchy best and even manages a little character arc that sets up iron man 3 without being obnoxious and rdj was rightbringing in pepper potts gwyneth paltrow was a good call as she humanizes stark and makes him more relatable without her hed be an insufferable knowitall but at key moments stark turns to pepper and reveals the traumatized man underneath the armor both real and emotional his storyline is easily the most satisfying of the movie mostly because stark is one of those internalconflict characters that is capable of creating his own drama he doesnt need loki or anyone else to propel his actions stealing the show though is ruffalo as bruce banner like hawkeye and widow i dont think i need a ruffalohulk movie although im sure well get one anyway but as an ensemble player ruffalo is a standout the avengers is awesome its not perfect but it is damn good and is hella fun that this movie works at all is a testament to joss whedons skill but that it is also genuinely funny sincerely heartfelt and some of the best asskickery youll see on screen is what makes it more than just a superhero movie it is the superhero movie
Sep 11 2017,positive,the avengers is fastpaced funny thrilling and wellcrafted
Sep 8 2017,positive,the comedic timing coupled with his ability to maintain the authenticity of the characters is worthy of praise the avengers delivers a popcorn feast thats the perfect summer kickoff
Aug 30 2017,positive, a primo example of the varietypack approach to summer blockbusters the avengers lumps together a halfdozen superheroes in much the same way cereal companies stack grocery shelves with snackpacks of sugar pops special k cheerios coco puffs raisin bran and fruit loops well the avengers does not lack for action in fact new york gets smashed up pretty damn good as ironman robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner captain america chris evans and the incredible hulk mark ruffalo pool their respective powers to defeat loki tom hiddleston a badass from asgaard where the norse gods hang out to try to explain what each of these folks do im still not sure about black widow aside from johansson  surprise  looking great in black leather would take up half the review and im trying to make a point namely the banter is in its way as impressive as the cgi budget now i dont mean tennessee williams or tom stoppard have anything to worry about im just saying that director joss whedon  who seems to have been born with dweeby fanboy dna  understands the crux of superhero aggregations like xmen the fantastic four metal men justice league of america and yes the avengers like what would thor say to ironman if they were teamed up against the same villain can the incredible hulk be a team player mostly not to hilarious effect in its way the avengers is about as characterdriven as a huge summer comicbook movie can be and in just the right combination of affection and silliness saportareport founded in february 2009 is a trusted voice in metro atlanta through the years we have become atlantas authoritative civic website our readers are engaged in atlantas most pressing issues and want to hear directly from leading companies and nonprofits in the region we give those organizations a platform to share their messages and interact with informed atlantans
Dec 11 2016,positive,  nothing like the avengers has ever been attempted in hollywood history  no major motion picture has ever been the culmination of four different blockbuster franchises each with its own protagonist and crossing them over into one gigantic film  its bigger than a sequel or even a planned trilogy  marvel had to take pieces from their previous superhero films to assemble the avengers  the studio wedged setup into iron man 2 wove the covert government agency shield into thor and tacked bookends to captain america the first avenger  the plan for the avengers was audacious to the point of nearhubris but writerdirector joss whedon has managed to deliver an absolute powerhouse of a payoff thats truly worthy of marvels astonishing ambition   after being exiled from asgard the villainous demigod loki tom hiddleston makes a bargain with a shadowy malevolent entity  loki must go to earth capture the fabled tesseract a cosmic cube of immense power and use it to open a portal that will allow the alien chitauri army to invade our planet and make loki our ruler  shield has the cube but loki quickly takes it along with agent clint barton aka hawkeye jeremy renner and dr erik selvig stellan skarsgård by using a mindcontrolling scepter  barton has access to shield resources selvig has the science to open the portal and the only ones who can stop lokis plan are earths mightiest heroes tony stark aka iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson bruce banner aka the hulk mark ruffalo and steve rogers aka captain america chris evans   iron man iron man 2 thor and captain america all provided an essential ingredient in helping the plot of the avengers by allowing it to skip character introductions  thor and captain america get a couple brief moments to recap the key events of their movies but the avengers doesnt waste time with exposition  instead the film devotes most of its energy to bringing a bunch of superheroes together and expanding their individual stories   writerdirector joss whedon does a wonderful job of taking the characters other people built staying true to their personalities and then adding his unmistakable spin  captain america in the avengers is essentially the same purehearted unflappable dogooder from captain america the first avenger but through whedon we get a character emotionally struggling to adjust to being ripped out of 1944 and awakening over sixty years later  at the same time whedon still has the good comic sense to let the character get giddy at recognizing a pop culture reference   almost every character gets this strong blend of comedy and drama  thor provides the emotional grounding for loki who would simply be a moustachetwirling supervillain without his superhero halfbrother  black widow gets plenty of screentime to expand her individual story to the point where it feels like a heavy prep for a great spinoff  as for hulk the avengers manages to deliver the best onscreen adaptation of the character  in addition to having the hulk kind of look like mark ruffalo this is the first time the hulk is actually fun    whedon and ruffalo turn banner away from the brooding loner and turn him into a bashful nerdy guy who will only acknowledge the hulk as the other guy  in the avengers the hulk is chekhovs gun if chekhovs gun were a howitzer tank  when that blast finally goes off we see the hulk realized in the best way possible   however whedon cant quite shower everyone with this lavish attention and development  robert downey jr has so thoroughly defined the character of tony stark that no one not even a writing master like whedon can leave an imprint  shield director nick fury samuel l jackson has been a presence in all the previous marvel movies but he still doesnt get to be the allout badass weve been itching to see  as for hawkeye he spends half the movie being lokis slave so theres not much room to build a character   despite the varying levels of development the avengers succeeds on a character level because the story is about bringing these superheroes together  its an absolute joy to see these distinct personalities play off each other  when iron man fights thor its not just a geeky thrill to watch the showdown but to also see how each hero retains their noble intentions while having a genuine conflict  whedon operates with an understanding of how someone with the unshakable morality of steve rogers is going to handle a wild card like tony stark or how thors arrogance hasnt completely diminished since his solo movie  however one of the films few flaws is jumping into some of the conflicts without providing an adequate setup to the scene  the second act of the film lacks the flow to move from conflict to conflict so the arguments feel slightly manufactured even though whedon has stayed true to the characters   the movie may stutter a bit in the middle but when the avengers swings into the third act it becomes a blockbuster picture at its finest  joss whedon has absolutely realized the geek dream weve been waiting for since nick fury introduced himself to tony stark after the credits of iron man  the scope of the final battle makes it perfectly clear that no individual superhero could handle this challenge solo  more importantly the battle had to be constructed so each superhero was a valuable addition  the films climax needs iron mans speed captain americas onthefly tactics and hulk as the unstoppable weapon  every superpower is an instrument in whedons grand symphony of delightful destruction   the opening set piece raises doubts about whedons ability to direct action since its difficult to tell where characters are in relation to each other but after this initial misstep the action scenes are an absolute blast  whedon swooshes his camera around the battlefield embraces the magnitude of the situation and makes the audience feel every hit  the 3d provides a little bit of depth to the climactic finish but the effect doesnt add much to the overall picture  the third act of the avengers bears a resemblance to transformers dark of the moon and while michael bay has a greater mastery of 3d whedon has mastery over creating a coherent narrative featuring characters you care about   ill always take the latter over the former   leading up to the avengers every director had left a stamp on their marvel movie but not to the point where he was inseparable from the material  kenneth branagh provided a fantastical grandeur to thor along with superfluous canted angles and joe johnston imbued captain america with an oldfashioned patriotic vibe  these are styles and they can be recreated  but there is only one joss whedon and the avengers wouldnt be as strong without him  he understands how to develop meaningful relationships between his characters has a surprising talent for crafting epic action scenes a welcome surprise considering his only feature film before avengers was the modestly budgeted serenity and his humor is secondtonone  there are some oneliners and visual gags that still have me giggling when i think about them   the avengers is why we go to the movies  the film will work fine on a bigscreen tv but its the kind of gigantic blockbuster fare that sends us back to every summer we went to the theater and were absolutely wowed  by crafting a winning combination of wonderful characters brilliant comedy and spectacular set pieces whedon hasnt simply created the biggest superhero movie hes created one of the best  matt goldberg has been an editor with collider since 2007 as the sites chief film critic he has authored hundreds of reviews and covered major film festivals including the toronto international film festival and the sundance film festival he resides in atlanta with his wife and their dog jack
Dec 11 2016,positive, at my screening of marvels the avengers the audience couldnt wait until the end of the film before erupting in applause in the midst of a massive action sequence in the third act of the story the entire avengers team including iron man hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow assembled on screen and seeing them together was too amazing to ignore it was a tribute to how entertaining the film truly was a reaction to a wonderful payoff moment built up by wellcrafted characters witty dialogue and a thoroughly thrilling script and i wont be surprised if happens again and again once the movie is released worldwide a direct sequel that follows the events of the previous marvel universe movies the film begins when loki tom hiddleston finds his way back to earth and steals the tesseract  an alien source of pure energy  and threatens to enslave the human race with the help of his extraterrestrial army called the chitauri seeing no other option nick fury samuel l jackson the leader of the covert government outfit known as shield assembles the team of superheroes known as the avengers robert downey jr chris hemsworth chris evans mark ruffalo scarlett johansson jeremy renner to stop lokis plans rather than creating an uneven mix or trying to focus more heavily on any one specific character writerdirector joss whedon has constructed the avengers as a balanced ensemble in addition to everyone getting at least one great action sequence all of the characters are fully fleshed out and given an arc to work with whether its captain americas struggle to adjust in the modern world thors guilt about his brother iron mans ego and singlemindedness or hulks fear of his own power even black widow and hawkeye who were largely minimized in their previous appearances are fully fleshed out and provided with backstories that give us a better understanding of their characters as fun as the other marvel movies have been to this point the action sequences have operated on a small scale and the avengers does more than compensate seemingly taking on a philosophy of go big or go home the action is not only pure spectacle but perfectly paced and shot by whedon who makes frequent cuts so that we can see everything thats going on with the different heroes the final battle sequence between the superhero team and lokis army is better than all of the action in the other marvel movies combined and multiplied by ten it earns the buildup from all the preceding films by being the most epic title weve seen with these characters yet over the course of his career whedon has become well known for his smart characters quick wit and emotional gut punches and this film will only serve to bolster that reputation though never even coming close to spoof territory the movie is actually very funny both in dialogue such as captain america actually recognizing a pop culture reference from the wizard of oz and physical humor most notably a confrontation between hulk and loki though a tiny bit off towards the beginning the pacing of the film quickly comes together as the writerdirector is able to both tell the story he wants to tell and mix in multiple hightension fight and action sequences as a lifelong comic book fan i walked into the avengers with the highest hopes and deepest fears a little over two hours later as the credits began to roll i turned to the friend sitting next to me smiled and exclaimed they actually did it what whedon and marvel have created here is not just extraordinary but one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet eric eisenberg is the assistant managing editor at cinemablend after graduating boston university and earning a bachelors degree in journalism he took a parttime job as a staff writer for cinemablend and after six months was offered the opportunity to move to los angeles and take on a newly created west coast editor position over a decade later hes continuing to advance his interests and expertise in addition to conducting filmmaker interviews and contributing to the news and feature content of the site eric also oversees the movie reviews section writes the the weekend box office report published sundays and is the sites resident stephen king expert he has two kingrelated columns
Sep 3 2016,positive,robert downey jrs billionaire playboy inventor tony stark aka iron man gets the films selfaware tongueincheek tone spot on delivering whedons wisecracks with sardonic charm
Jul 7 2015,positive, joss whedon triumphs in marvels avengers assemble the superhero team up of iron man thor  captain america and the incredible hulk is in cinemas 26 april 2012 hollywood has turned into a bizarrely egalitarian place by yesterdays rules genre favourite joss whedonshould have had to slog through some wellreceived c and blist pictures before he was allowed anywhere near marvels flagship blockbuster yet here we are despite his sole big screen featurelength directing credit being serenity hes turned his knack for writing and directing wisecracking ensembles  honed on buffy angel and firefly  onto the stars of some of marvels biggest movie franchises all formidable toylines in their own right even with a movie universe created specifically to this end like marvels there are cracks where the slightly different worlds in which the characters operate dont quite line up the variation in tone and top trumps power level between the major players of iron man robert downey jrs vainglorious armoured billionaire thor chris hemsworths overlyliteral thunder god hulk mark ruffalos bemused doctor jekyll turned big green indestructible hyde and captain america chris evans sincere superpatriot  without even getting onto slinky secret agent black widow scarlett johansson steelyeyed marksman hawkeye jeremy renner and nononsense spymaster nick fury samuel l jackson  are too extreme for any reasonable fix as there is no reasonable fix avengers assemble just gets on with it and in doing so is perhaps the most faithful comicbook movie of all time not faithful in terms of boxticking its way through the canon particularly but in terms of being a big brilliant multicoloured romp that breathes life into the garish absurdity and silliness that endears us so gleefully to the world of superheroes theres a clunky opening sequence with tom hiddlestons brattish loki that kicks the plot off the starting blocks with a thump leading into a series of pitchperfect introductions in which every player presents themselves to the viewer and the plot  from black widow kicking seven shades of slayer out of some villains like buffy reborn to steve rogers pounding a punchbag and worrying about his place in this brave new world before nick fury turns up to offer him one like the very basic comicbook crossover avengers assemble sets our heroes against each other at the machinations of a common enemy loki and mindcontrolled minions plus some rasping ringwraithlike baddies from another dimension or something like that have a faceoff guaranteed to make fanboys squeal and sealclap bicker and trade whedonesque genresavvy punchlines before finding their place within the team and through teamwork defeat the big bad with this many characters  and even supporting characters as thors erik selvig stellan skarsgård the sardonic agent coulson clark gregg and iron mans pepper potts gwyneth paltrow all feature  to even get between that relatively unpretentious atob narrative would be near impossible to pull off compare this to bryan singers slickly ponderous first xmen movie in which theres a whole lot of scene setting and not much else whedon does it although that the dvdbluray will come with 30 minutes of deleted scenes proves that this is anything but effortless avengers assemble is big but it isnt bloated its just over two hours long but it doesnt feel like it as energy levels are ramped up and remain so for the duration theres an amazing economy of dialogue and motion with every line or gesture intended to bring us joy and not just drive the plot mechanically forward like the failed super teamups of old robert downey jrs iron man is obviously the stitch to this social fabric sparking the back and forth and setting the tone but everyone gets their moment  captain america gets to be more the moral and cultural conservative of mark millar and bryan hitchs the ultimates but without the xenophobia and selfrighteousness and the cgi hulk  voiced by the iconic tv hulk lou ferrigno and mocapped by ruffalo  is a gloriously funny and emotionally diverse brute capable of playful aggression and relish as much as the mindless rage that reduced entire segments of his solo outings into setsmashing tedium you could be forgiven for the merciless mocking of hawkeye  whose inclusion in 2011s thor was deeply contrived  in the runup but even he finds his place in the narrative and is sort of endearing with the exception of the way he flicks his collapsible bow out which he does far too often and a bit of pointless rappelling from a girder presumably renner invested in his own kit after mission impossible and insisted on getting some use out of it surprisingly captain america is next up in the uselessness stakes he gets some moving scenes that anchor his character to this new world but the power differential between him and three guys who can destroy buildings with their big green fists their repulsor blasts and their magic hammer is so great that come the climatic final battle hes reduced to being the leader of a redundant second tier of avengers with black widow and hawkeye its a brief lapse though and cap subsequently proves his worth  directing the battle and mustering civvies like the starspangled icon we want him to be the level of comicbook cheese and overwhelming nature of the cast and premise might confuse those unfamiliar with the earlier movies or source material for those whove been pressing the air out of acidfree bags since childhood or find themselves hiding the price tag on that impulse purchase of chris claremont and frank millers 1982 wolverine miniseries from their spouse avengers assemble is such a pure and unadulterated comicbook movie that it will bring you to tears
Jul 7 2015,positive,a lot of fun
Jul 7 2015,positive,downeys starkiron man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty but the cgi effects are amazing and despite its length the film is very enjoyable
Jul 7 2015,positive,infusing plenty of laconic wit into his role robert downey jr is impressive as ever
Jul 7 2015,positive,as tony stark rdj infuses that much needed spark and life into the movie with his superb oneliners
Jul 7 2015,positive,  joss whedons the avengers  not to be confused with jeremiah chechiks film of the same name where ralph fiennes wielded an umbrella and saved the world from evildoers in candycoloured teddy bear suits  is a mix of everything of superheroes of action and emotion and comedy of staging that careens between prestige theatre and vaudeville and of acting styles that span the spectrum from silent cinema to the modern day  to get an idea of the overall mood you have to imagine something starring buster keaton spencer tracy sylvester stallone and marlon brando and directed by michael bay and sidney lumet on a bank of giant green screens that gleaming cube at the centre of the screen could well be the kitchen sink  though its really the tesseract a fearsome energy source which loki tom hiddleston wastes no time stealing after which he proclaims i am burdened with glorious purpose for an instant there the film itself seems freighted with glorious purpose  is there a better conductor of electricity up the spine than plummy villainy played with a british accent hiddleston last seen in war horse vanishing into a puff of smoke creates such a devilishly theatrical character that we wonder not as we usually do in these movies whether the superheroes will be called upon to engage with a worthwhile supervillain but whether this supervillain will be dispatched by superheroes worthy of him  and those heroes come in all shapes and sizes theres hawkeye jeremy renner the master archer and black widow whose prime power appears to be that she comes in the form of scarlett johansson hulk mark ruffalo whod retreated to kolkata to lead a stressfree existence this is how we know were in the comicbook universe returns with greying hair and a rumpled suit thor chris hemsworth reappears with his hammer and captain america chris evans shows up with his shield and a demeanour that could only come from being raised on a diet of apple pie then theres iron man robert downey jr the magnetic core of the entire enterprise not since harrison ford slipped into indiana jones has an actor so memorably ingratiated himself with a playful part  he is introduced alongside pepper potts gwyneth paltrow and their banter has a screwballcomedy vibe that sets the tone for the rest of his scenes downey jr reminds us that special effects mean nothing unless the character inside the suit is a character a fully formed human entity distinguished not just by a formidable superpower but by say the black sabbath tshirt on his person and of course black sabbath recorded a song named iron man downey jrs iron man has the distinct attitude that most other superheroes lack and its tempting to imagine a movielong contest between him and loki the winner being the actor who scarfs down the most scenery he even punctures the pompousness of other superheroes dismissing for instance thors grandiloquence as shakespeare in the park even as he soars iron man keeps the avengers grounded whedon takes a leaf from iron mans manual and infects his film with a sense of mischief where eric bana and edward norton played glumly into the bifurcated angst of hulk ruffalo locates a vein of slapstick comedy there may even be a splash of unintended humour in watching cobie smulders from the sitcom how i met your mother as a secret agent on what looks like the deck of the starship enterprise its too drastic a change of image  we expect her to trip over thors cape and rush redfaced to johanssons side to whine about the embarrassment over a glass of canadian red but nick fury samuel l jackson the director of shield is left with little to do were promised an inscrutable character even his secrets have secrets but hes content to blend into the wallpaper as the avengers save the world from lokis minions who arrive from outer space on ships that snake through manhattans airspace like sluggish alligators after a noonday meal  captain american wonders at one point if his starsandstripes costume isnt oldfashioned hes told that sometimes people might just need a little oldfashioned that the avengers certainly is resisting the modern impulse to peel back tormented layers of superhero psyche what you see is what you get  comments have to be in english and in full sentences they cannot be abusive or personal please abide by our community guidelines  for posting your comments  we have migrated to a new commenting platform if you are already a registered user of the hindu and logged in you may continue to engage with our articles if you do not have an account please register and login to post comments users can access their older comments by logging into their accounts on vuukle
Jul 7 2015,positive, director joss whedoncast robert downey jr mark ruffalo chris evans chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner and samuel l jacksonquick take blockbuster of the yearits that time of the year when air conditioning and pop corn assume a larger role in our lives come summer cometh the time for blockbusters the avengers is easily as epic in anticipation as avatar was two years ago and just like the james cameron magnum opus this ensemble superhero saga packs a big mean punch on visuals and setup but is as thin as hot air in its storymarvel superheroes have gained steam over the past few years the hulk iron man captain america and thor have all made successful movie debuts the culmination of all their success is one big movie franchise and its called the avengers to a comic book geek thats the equivalent of drinking from the holy grail to an action movie buff thats like arnold schwarzenegger teaming up with sylvester stallone for everybody else its a chance to experience 200 million well spent whatever is your calling fact is the avengers is a film a large part of the movie going populace would want to watch it has all the trappings of a feature that entertains its got heroes by the dozen its got a wealth of comic book wit and punchy oneliners and most importantly 75 per cent of its runtime is big booming actionwhy does the world need four superheroes and two heroes teaming up because the problem at hand is cataclysmic aliens are opening a portal and planning a hostile takeover and they are being led by a demigod that is the number one and only problem with this mammoth of a film the core idea of the story is not very novel what makes up for that is some fine dialogue apart from super powers sexy girlfriends and other miscellaneous benefits the other reason we loved superheroes in comic books was for their wonderful sense of humour and ability to charm with witty dialogue the avengers is a winner on the front the writers also do well to weave in continuity as they compile parallel storylines from different superhero sagasthe first half of the film is all build up and youll find yourself either amused with the juvenile humour or clutching your fist in elation at the various comic world references and then in the second half the film gets a big green vaccine of chaotic energy the hulk makes an angry entrance and throws the proceedings into a state of maddening frenzy the relentless action mixed with some potent 3d makes for some jaw dropping viewing  by the end youd have enough endorphins kicking in your system to make you jump with joy when the superhero dust settles youd have long forgotten any subconscious need for story the film will sweep you off into a world where youd be wishing for muscles and a cape thats a win win situation we tailor your experience and understand how you and other visitors use this website by using cookies and other technologies this means we are able to keep this site freeofcharge to use
May 3 2015,positive,a big splashy movie in which stuff blows up a lot yet you go home talking about the actors
Feb 6 2015,positive,shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness
Aug 24 2014,positive, iron man thor the incredible hulk and captain america come together for the greatest gathering of superheroes of all time or rather the greatest gathering since the last xmen movie and with this many marvel crimefighters on the same screen its little surprise this is largely a terrifically enjoyable experience  one thatll please both fanboys and the public at large following on from last years thor flick the demigods evil brother loki tom hiddleston is now intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an allpowerful energy cube thatll allow him to bring his alien armies to earth all that stands in his way is nick fury samuel l jackson the head of the peacekeeping shield who sets about uniting the worlds superheroes to avert the threat rounding up iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the arrowslinging hawkeye jeremy renner and the catsuitclad spy black widow scarlett johansson given how most of the characters have had their own movies over the past few years avengers avoids the usual superhero trap of spending too much time on back stories instead throwing us straight into the action that initiative involves bringing together a team of superheroes  iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans and the hulk mark ruffalo as well as human heroes black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner who must find a way to work together to save the planet the first two films impressed fans which was pretty hard to do given that the mutant team are real cult favourites the third xman film was less than impressive while xmen origins wolverine offered occasional entertainment a new wolverine film is set to film in australia christopher nolans reboot of career of the caped crusader proved to be a massive hit with sequel the dark knight proving even more popular mainly thanks to heath ledgers version of the joker his trilogy ends with the dark knight rises which opens this summer i have a sneaking fondness for tim burtons batman  which controversially starred michael keaton in the role  though the less said about george clooneys stint of batman the better the first in the series which started in 1978 and ran through the 1980s starring christopher reeve showed that superhero films could be popular they got less and less impressive as the years went on and the fourth reeve outing was pretty awful the 2006 reboot superman returns was a modest success and zac snyder who made 300 and alternative superhero movie watchmen is having another go at the concept with henry cavill slipping on the tights for man of steel which opens next year a smart and clever bit of disney animation that really get the superhero mythology spot on as well as having a whole lot of fun along the way cult hero spiderman aka mildmannered photographer peter parker arrived on the big screen in 2002 in the first of three fantastically popular films though the character will be relaunched this year in the amazing spiderman starring brit andrew garfield in the lead role a wonderful bit of dark and dangerous superhero action with ron perlman spoton as the demonic superhero hellboy who has appeared in two films directed by guillermo del toro other strong contenders might include iron man blade the fantastic four the incredible hulk the crow darkman and even the wonderfully camp swamp thing likely bottom on any list though will be the likes of green lantern constantine and daredevilall of which failed to set fanboy hearts racing
Aug 24 2014,negative,this will be loved by genre fans when all is said and done but at two hours forty you may find it numbs your bum seriously more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun and now i have said all that i believe my poem is done
Aug 24 2014,positive, avengers assemble is the long awaited big screen teamup of marvel superheroes iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner avengers assemble is the long awaited big screen teamup of marvel superheroes iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner our heroes are brought together by shield agent nick fury samuel l jackson when the evil loki tom hiddleston and his alien army threaten to bring about the end of the entire human race since the first iron man movie in 2008 this is what marvel studios have been building towards and im delighted to report that this film has been more than worth the wait buffy the vampire slayer director joss whedon is the brave man to take on this colossal project and the creative visionary strikes a perfect balance between action storytelling and tugging at various emotions downey jr is hilarious but also shows his heart when the going gets tough evans captain impressively takes charge of the team third big screen hulk ruffalo is the best yet and the charismatic hemsworth picks up where he left off in thor johansson is as good as shes been in a long while and hiddlestons villain is deliciously chilling particularly in a verbal assault of black widow whedons action sequences are first rate its hard to pick out a highlight as there are so many lokis early attack on shield the assault on the shield helicarrier the nearly halfhour long manhattan set finale hulk v thor nice extra touches include classical music playing over lokis strike on a high society ball in stuttgart and whedons swooping camera during the climactic battle showcasing every avenger in action one after the other the film is quite actionheavy and the climax a bit transformers dark of the moon but weve had the buildup in previous individual character movies if you havent seen those films then you might struggle to follow certain story elements but lets face it why wouldnt you have treated yourself to watching them sorry that may just be my comic book head being all presumptuous whedon also wrote the story in collaboration with zak penn and fantastical it may be but they never lose sight of the threat posed lots of use of the word war is avengers assemble the best comic book film ever thats a tough call but its certainly the most exciting and a true epic moment in cinematic history the comic book movie has definitely reached dizzying new heights and nothing can possibly wait hang on the dark knight rises is out on july 20
Aug 24 2014,positive, thats why marvels the avengers is so immensely satisfying we want our heroes to be smart quickwitted and saying interesting things we want them to be courageous and confident and complicated a balance of internal conflict and external bravado we want to see them test the limits of their extraordinary abilities and save the world in spite of their flaws whedon a longtime reader and writer of comics gets all this right giving him a 220 million budget and the freedom to direct and write zak penn also gets story credit this megablockbuster conglomeration of marvel comics superheroes was a wise move four of his heroes  iron man thor captain america hulk  were previously established by directors who generally know what theyre doing behind the camera but only whedon has truly demonstrated what tickles a legion of funnybook readers not that avengers is for diehards only whedons ability to pen sharp dialogue develop character and construct clear consequential action sequences including one doozy of a thirdact battlemageddon assures inclusivity the cult of whedonites who have for years worshiped his whipsmart tv work  buffy the vampire slayer firefly etc  will surely gloat that they expected cinematic greatness from the guy all along given the opportunity and the right project avengers feels perfect for him its a lively vibrant colorful and wildly entertaining piece of pop filmmaking yes he brings the action hard fast heavy and often but he manages to prove that an abundance of personalities on screen need not be the cluttered messes of spiderman and xmen and batman features past whedon gives each avenger a convincing character convolution iron mantony stark robert downey jr ever the sparkplug learns to set aside ego to work with a team captain americasteve rogers chris evans is a man lost in this era a former world war ii hero recently thawed from a block of antarctic ice after decades of stasis bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo replacing edward norton from 2008s the incredible hulk constantly contends with his doozy of a jekyllandhyde syndrome and calls the big green beast inside him the other guy thor chris hemsworth is more compelling here than in his headlining feature dealing with the guilt of unwittingly leading his powerhungry brother loki tom hiddleston to earth loki whos dastardly and cackling and as arrogant as 1000 housecats warps to earth from asgard and steals the tesseract an artifact that will facilitate the delivery of an alien army across the universe to conquer andor destroy like everything his plan dovetails with that of nick fury samuel l jackson who as established in the preceding marvel films intends to bring together the aforementioned superdudes hoping theyll be greater than the sum of their parts fury is the head of shield the worlds most powerful and covert collaboration of spies headquartered on of course a flying invisible aircraft carrier whatever plot contrivances matter not as long as the avengers assemble right problem is theyre a dysfunctional outfit with differences of opinion and troubled pasts and one of them is a very big green loose cannon complicating the dynamic are two skilled shield agents hawkeye jeremy renner a deadeye archer whos initially brainzapped and made one of lokis drones and black widow scarlett johansson despite seeming puny in comparison to the laser guns and unbreakable shields and sacred hammers and raging ids of her teammates is an espionage artist as skilled at interrogation as she is at filling a tight outfit but years of skullduggery and assassination mean she and hawkeye have more blood on their hands than their brightly costumed compadres fury is the whedon analog here  its a monumental task to bring many disparate elements together into a cohesive and functional whole and thats why avengers feels like such a victory is it perfect no the first act finds whedon struggling to find his tonal footing and a couple of plot holes are shall we say hulking but when revved up the film is an exhilarating blend of comedy thrills and wonderment to meet the demands and slake the desires of millions of fanboys of all the comicbook movies in the modern era avengers is the comicbookiest if you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site we may receive compensation by using

Aug 24 2014,positive,if we must have these boxoffice behemoths then at least the writerdirector joss whedon creator of buffy the vampire slayer is a lively controlling influence
Aug 24 2014,positive,of course its about one hundred times brighter than transformers and michael bays imbecilic spinoffs and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip but i didnt love it
Aug 24 2014,negative, unhappy the land that has no heroes someone remarks to bertolt brechts galileo no unhappy the land that needs heroes galileo replies and if superheroes are multiples of the ordinary variety the world as perceived by hollywood is currently in as dire straits as it was during the great depression when the comicstrip masked avengers were first created joss whedon a major hero to tinseltowns accountants and marvel comics movie division have come up with the wheeze of bringing together six of marvels superheroes iron man the hulk thor captain america and the lesserknown hawkeye and black widow to confront loki tom hiddleston the evil trickster of norse folklore hes slipped through a crack in the universe and stolen the allpowerful cosmic cube in the course of defeating his megalomaniac schemes much of midtown manhattan is destroyed along with several thousand people though happily the chrysler building survives the special effects are impressive but not especially imaginative and the film is unduly protracted the superheroes and supervillain loki get all the jokes which pop out of their heads like bubbles in a comic strip this leaves stellan skarsgård the inventor of the cosmic cube and samuel l jackson head of the international peacekeeping agency shield to do solemn and serious which they deliver in a suitably straightfaced manner karl marx could have been anticipating 911 and this movie when he said that history repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce
Aug 24 2014,positive,for all who have hotly fanticipated this allstar collection of marvels superheroes you have reason to be excited you can officially geek out now
Sep 8 2013,positive,the avengers does have is a solid gold structure that doesnt buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast
Aug 2 2013,positive, smart witty funny actionpacked and surprisingly cathartic marvels the avengers joins the rarefied company of spiderman 2 superman 2 iron man and even tim burtons batman as contenders for the title of greatest movie ever based on comic book superheroes six superheroes their oneeyed boss and a super villain vie for our attentions in the avengers and uberdirectorwriter joss whedon never allows them to pile up in a muddled mess here comes the first movie since steven spielbergs raiders of the lost ark to begin where many movies end and to move with such alacrity that theres no time for restroom stops and concession counter visits i caught marvels the avengers the proprietary title is to distinguish it from the 1998 british spy bomb the avengers with uma thurman and ralph fiennes monday in a packed house of franchisefriendly fans burbling with euphoric joy at every comic putdown and triumphant act and those are legion in this movie remember that blue energy box found in the ocean at the end of last years captain america of course you do its called the tesseract thors megalomaniac halfbrother god loki tom hiddleston recalling too much of alan rickmans eurotrash villain from die hard steals the tesseract as part of his plan to lead an invasion of earth to subjugate all humans the storys real conflict involves shield leader nick fury samuel l jackson struggling to get six superheroes to work together and save earth as part of his controversial avengers initiative these guys fight each other so often we almost forget about loki lurking around theyre a bunch of suspicious infighting misfits ruled by ego resentment and good oldfashioned american individualism iron man aka tony stark robert downey jr is the sassiest avenger quick with an insult he refers to thor as shakespeare in the park and proud that he doesnt play well with others bruce banner mark ruffalo superb as a control freak is a key member because of his experience with gamma rays  the same ones that turn him into the raging hulk when agitated curvy russian assassin natasha romanoff aka black widow scarlett johansson the single fem in the bunch moves like a leopard although she appears to be the only superhero here who like batman has no discernible super powers the sixth avenger the archer hawkeye jeremy renner has fallen under the control of loki and his mystical spear this handy weapon works not only as a blade but as a rocketlauncher machine gun truth serum and stylish personal accessory the avengers jets along with a zippy 142minute running time with whedon in complete control of this impressive movie a worthy payoff for marvel fans whove patiently waited through mediocre films thor captain america iron man 2 hulk for a truly super superhero experience just as a diverse and divided american populace became a unified force following the assault on new york city more than a decade ago the six avengers likewise drop their petty differences when faced with a deadly attack against the big apple thats why the movies most emotional moment occurs not during the final battle but just before when the divided superheroes come together to fight for a cause more important than themselves
Aug 2 2013,positive,the bigger and goofier it gets the more fun it becomes
Jun 30 2013,positive, after a series of films that introduced many of the marvel characters to moviegoers worldwide search  the longawaited blockbuster that brings the crew together is in theaters now featuring beloved comic book characters like thor check  captain america iron man and the incredible hulk the new film brings the superpowered team together to battle thors evil brother loki tom hiddleston and his alien army the movie begins where many of the other films end with the individual heroes living their own separate lives but on the brink of coming together to form one unit fate and nick fury samuel l jacskon the director of a secret agency known as shield eventually bring this disparate team of dogooders together thors evil brother loki is planning to use a cube of energy for his diabolical plan for world nomination and fury is eager to stop him as the storys menacing monster loki speaks like a supervillain in waiting i am burdened with glorious purpose he says followed by freedom is lifes greatest lie fury knows that such a nemesis is more than just what one superhero can face so he recruits a team known as the avengers this alliance includes several characters who have previously been introduced in their own individual films thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans and iron man downey jr are here along with the black widow scarlett johansson and newcomer hawkeye jeremy renner also on the crew is the incredible hulk mark ruffalo whose story was introduced in two previous films which featured different actors in the main role theres a lot to enjoy about this new film including the invaluable input of joss whedon the buffy the vampire slayer creator directed the avengers and the screenplay with the help of zak pennxmen the last stand  for fans of whedons workhes the creator behind angel firefly and others his touch is evident throughout the story from witty oneliners to the great climactic action sequence viewers will recognize whedons strengths throughout the films nearly two and a half hour running time but the avengers despite its many positive attributes never achieves greatness loki for one often feels like an unworthy opponent this sour sibling simply seems to want revenge against his brother and despite some of his memorable never really stands out as a memorable opponent hes more fleshedout here than he was in thor but the character still leaves a bit to be desired despite a few great scenes showing him locked in capitivity admittedly the avengers never offers a great plot or a strong story the cube of energy at the center of the fighting leaves a lot to the imagination what it does offer though will appease fans of summer films many of the action scenes are great and the main charactersespecially iron manare fun to watch plus theres a sheer joy in seeing these marvel characters join forces to defeat a bad guy when the team stops destroying itself they inevitably come together as one and the scene where they stand as one unit on the street almost gave me chills thats more than i can say for most summer blockbusters but i did expect more from the avengers despite a noble and noteworthy effort this film never fulfills all of its potential and never achieves the status that superhero classics like the dark knight and spiderman 2 have already achieved

Jun 20 2013,negative, a superhero movie for the super pac era the marvel comics allstar revue the avengers reminds us that theres still strength in numbers at least where the fortunes of the walt disney company which is distributing the film as part of a longterm deal with marvel are concerned even before opening in the us the avengers has already racked up an impressive 300 millionor roughly 30 million more than the beleaguered john carter earned in its entire releaseand far be it from me to begrudge this superhero smorgasbord its success it also arrives on a tide of enormous fanboy expectation and enthusiasm and the early reviews have suggested that the fans are indeed pleased but is that the sound of genuine excitement or merely relief cowritten and directed by joss whedon the wunderkind behind tvs buffy the vampire slayer and firefly the avengers is a slickly entertaining package that manages to keep a lot of balls in the airminisequels to iron man thor and captain america plus yet another reboot of the incredible hulkwith agility if not exactly flair occasional flashes of wit and a modicum of charm after twoandahalf hours of worldthreatening chaos and worldsaving derringdo you leave the theater satisfied but without so much as a single memorable image or idea lingering in your mind as hulksized tentpole movies gothose that have all of hollywoods resources at their disposal and the fates of entire studios in their handsyou could certainly do worse maybe im just being overly nostalgic for the bygone days of summer movies past like the summers of 2008 and 2011 when the first iron man and captain america pictures surprised with their genuine comicbook panache anddare i saylyricism though more modestly scaled than the avengers both were supremely enjoyable pop entertainments featuring a lot of oldfashioned movie craftsmanship bold primary colors action delineated into crisp clean widescreen panels courtesy of directors jon favreau and joe johnstonand moreover characters you could actually care about the marvel universe has always been rich in superheroes who remain decidedly flawed vulnerable humans beneath the fancy getups and genetically enhanced musculature and those movies managed to translate them to the screen along with a lot of hightech wizardry and lofi genre love  you didnt have to be a comics fan per se to share in tony starks euphoria and faint terror as he tried to get the hang of his rocketpowered super suit for the first time or to mourn with steve rogers over the death of his best friend in the avengers the characters are the same as are the actors playing them but you dont care about them as much because the movie itself doesnt it doesnt reveal new layers to the characters or deepen our understanding of them in the way of sequels like the empire strikes back superman ii and the dark knight this time its mostly all business the tesseractthat allpowerful glowing cube last seen nearly winning wwii for the nazis in captain americahas resurfaced in presentday new york where none other than loki the nefarious frost giant last seen falling into an interstellar abyss at the end of last summers execrable thor hopes to harness its energy to amass a drone army and open a portal between our world and his meanwhile that suave superhero headhunter nick fury samuel l jackson sets about rounding up his elite troops and briefing them on their mission of the lot only the hulkbruce banner mark ruffalo needs any real convincing and its ruffalostepping into the shoes vacated most recently by edward nortonwho gives the the avengers what personality it has perhaps because hes new to the role ruffalo is the only actor in the film whos allowed any significant scenes that dont serve simply to keep the plot chugging along and he makes the most of them to create an endearingly awkward banner who seems perpetually uncomfortable in his own skin whether white or green the rest of the movie cries out for some quiet characterbuilding momentsor at least more crazy cameos on par with the great polish auteur jerzy skolimowski as a russian heavy who meets up with the wrong side of scarlett johanssons black widow what for example does captain america who has recently awoken from a decadeslong slumber make of this whole big crazy mixedup modern world television has always been hailed as a writers medium driven by storytelling as opposed to visual grandeur with the director on hand mainly to execute the writers wishes never deviating too much from the established style of a successful series even in recent years as television screensand budgetshave grown larger the writer has generally remained the master of this domain and as audiences have found these series more consistently intelligent and entertaining than most of the movie studios commercial product its no surprise that their creatorsjj abrams judd apatow whedonhave been courted to write and direct movies next up david chase this may ultimately prove to be a good thing but for now it is bringing us a lot of movies that look and feel like bigscreen television it was only with his third feature last summers super 8 that abrams finally seemed fully in command of the new medium the avengers is rife with scenes that can be deemed spectacularnot least the climactic superhero rumble on the streets of midtown manhattan during which that aforementioned portal in the sky opens up and unleashes enormous winged serpents that look like the love children of the alien from alien and the spaceship from alien hell appears to have quite literally broken loose and yet for all his technical skill as a director or at least his skill in surrounding himself with toptier artisans whedon never really thinks in terms of imagesthe visuals are secondary to the story and since the story itself is subpar you notice this all the more the avengers has the polished professional but completely flat anonymous look of a mideighties james bond picture throughout i couldnt stop wondering what an inspired creative force like brad bird might have done with this material then i remembered that hed already done it its called the incredibles in one of those strangerthanfiction tales from the hollywood front lines the legendary indian director satyajit ray once wrote a script for columbia pictures entitled the alien about a gentle extraterrestrial who strikes up a friendship with a  young boy in a rural bengali village after his spaceship crashes there although the film was never produced ray himself saw more than a few lipstick traces of his scenario in steven spielbergs et the extraterrestrial a movie that began life as a columbia production though he declined to press any formal charges there are no aliens in the best exotic marigold hotel only indians but judging from the reaction of a cadre of british pensioners newly arrived in jaipur there isnt much difference an avengers for the cocoon generation this postcolonial cultureclash burlesque stars maggie smith judi dench and assorted other acting treasures of the realm as the latest tenants of the titular bb a familyrun resort whose reality turns out to be considerably less than the sum of its carefully photoshopped parts they include dame judi as a widow forced to sell her london apartment to pay off her husbands debts a couple bill nighy and penelope wilton whose daughter invested their retirement nest egg in an internet startup that never started up an old playboy ronald pickup looking for one more fling and a retired high court judge tom wilkinson searching for the india he knew as a young man can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses dench asks in one of her characters narrated diary entries well definitely not in the eyes of screenwriter ol parker adapting deborah moggachs novel these foolish things and director john madden shakespeare in love their india is a nonstop barrage of blaring sitar music screeching horns chattering street urchins blinding sunlight and enveloping dustto say nothing of the obligatory spotty plumbing and electricity and stomachchurning cuisine at the center of it all is none other than the slumdog millionaire himself dev patel shucking and jiving his way through a truly embarrassing performance as the hotels harried quixotic proprietor who comes complete with a domineering mother and an unwanted arranged marriage by the time the resident racist spinster smith makes friends with an untouchable servant girl i felt certain that the esteemed mr ray was spinning in his grave like a lot of movies that pitch themselves to supposedly underserved audiencesblacks women the elderlythe best exotic marigold hotel traffics in the very hoary stereotypes it ostensibly sets out to debunk its a movie about finding purpose in life late in life that makes its point by first subjecting its characters to the most reductive grumpyoldmenwomen shenanigans these characters arent just oldtheyre defined by their age imprisoned by it seemingly unable to talk or think about anything else and yet the actors on screen are themselves vibrant evidence that life doesnt end at 60 70 or even 80 theyand indiadeserve better
May 26 2013,negative,joss whedon empties everything at his reported 225 million disposal to assault the eyes ears and intelligence with one of the stupidest comic book tales ever put to film
Apr 12 2013,positive,whedon must balance the competing storylines and screen time of the actors he does it nicely injecting humour and a touch of drama into the action  and all without so much as a tesseract to his name some assembly required and delivered
Jan 27 2013,positive,one of the ten best films of 2012
Jan 8 2013,positive, yesterday was a redletter day in my mailbox next to an invite from american express and a copy of leslie feinbergs drag king dreams ordered from swapabookcom lay a netflix redandwhite envelope that i quickly ripped open inside the avengers dvd that i had forgotten id requested eureka my evening had unexpectedly become free an hour before and here was a cinematic event i had missed out on what true joy from what i had heard on this 412inch silver platter was imprinted the super heroes event of the decade well at least the best one not helmed by christopher nolan after all it had a 92 rating on rotten tomatoes beating out fellinis amacord by two points and pasolinis teorema by six i immediately elevatored upstairs then prepared a major salad and a huge teeccino settling in front of my 24inch mac along with my edibles i inserted the disc and mentally prepared myself to be transported by marvel marvelousness to a realm where good conquers bad where there are copious amounts of inventive destruction and where the visuals will employ the latest developments in special effects wizardry all will be laced together by an unbridled intelligence witty dialogue and some sort of underlying philosophy that will set tenyearold viewers on the path to becoming fortyyearold peacemongers for example john f kennedys mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind well after five minutes of irksome ads for marvel goodies the feature began  with a limp over some ominous music by alan silvestri the other alexis denisof announces like a darthvader wannabe the tesseract has awakened it is on a little world a human world they would wield its power but our ally knows its workings as they never will he is ready to lead and our force our chitauri will follow a world will be his the universe yours and the humans what can they do but burn not forewarned i had no notion that the avengers was the sixth installment in the marvel cinematic universe and i or any viewer really should have viewed the previous five to be up to snuff plus read a few dozen of the comics on which they were based but i was up to snuff having seen all previous entries and most importantly thor 2011 to which the avengers is basically a sequel  and i was still discombobulated you see in thor prince loki tom hiddleston the brother of thor chris hemsworth discovers he is adopted a revelation that aggravates him to no end and causes the young man to commit patricide then when he doesnt become king of asgard apoplecticwould really best describe his demeanor especially after his sibling defeats him in an epic battle to prevent this from occurring iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans dr bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo the black widow scarlett johansson thor and eventually hawkeye jeremy renner will have to join forces under the leadership of nick fury samuel l jackson the director of shield and coordinator of the avenger initiative of course we all know there will be a happy ending but why does getting there have to be so generic theres nothing basically new in the avengers nothing that hasnt been done much better elsewhere take the early car chase scenes where the villains are escaping with the tesseract if you want to see thrilling highway escapades check out the terminator series or any jason bourne offering is this not simpler is this not your natural state its the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation the bright lure of freedom diminishes your lifes joy in a mad scramble for power for identity you were made to be ruled in the end you will always kneel angela merkel might start bristling when she views this scene but have no fear gnadige frau neonazi supervillains have nothing on captain america and iron man and german honor is revenged but one of the most fascinating moments in the picture occurs after thor grabs loki out of a plane from the clutches of our heroes iron man immediately pursues and captain america gets ready but is warned by black widow to be cautious ah monotheism versus paganism can they exist side by side clearly thor is a god which proves capn america wrong or can we have an existence where both gods and a god rule side by side metaphysics aside is the avengers a great film or just one more pea in the comicbookindustry pod and why have iron man thor and captain america the first avenger all seemed so slight to me when ive watched them over the past year on my computer quite possibly these event pictures need a huge screen and a pounding sound system to convince viewers of their worth after all the folks at marvel would hardly deny that these movies are basically products created to sell more marvel products but some films work really quite well on a screen of diminished proportions including last years arbitrage with richard gere and even the more visual moonrise kingdom they hold the viewer because there is more meat to chew on their bones even dustins hoffmans quartet which could use a tiny bit more bite warms the cockles of ones heart because the grand foursome of maggie smith tom courtney billy connoly and pauline collins let loose from beginning to end with their wellseasoned actors chops and a masterpiece such as chantal akermans jeanne dielman 23 quai du commerce 1080 bruxelles works sublimely on even an iphone all of which comes down the fact that with in the next few weeks im purchasing my first really humongous flat screen tv im going to be prepared for iron man iii 
Jan 4 2013,positive,whedon has delivered that rare actionpacked specialeffects spectacle that is relentless in its eagerness to please and successful beyond its goal
Jan 4 2013,positive,its summers mightiest movie nuff said
Dec 28 2012,positive,when all is said and done avengers is all sound and nick fury signifying nothing
Oct 2 2012,positive,  marvels the avengers is not just a film  its a cinematic event the culmination of half a decade of moviemaking five different films introducing us to characters stories and worlds of marvels shared movie universe  not to mention the lifelong hopes of fanboys and fangirls all over the world who have been dreaming to see their favorite superheroes onscreen together long before marvel studios began making it a reality   now that the avengers is here the question is does writerdirector joss whedon serenity deliver a film that lives up to fans massive expectations and functions as a great summer blockbuster for causal moviegoers   we are thrust right into the story at the point where the respective leadin films  iron man iron man 2 incredible hulk thor and captain america  left off by learning just what has befallen thors brother loki tom hiddleston after his plunge into the abyss at the end of thor we find loki holed up in a strange netherworld or realm hosted by a dark and mysterious ally who promises him reentry to earth and an alien army in exchange for securing the tesseract the cosmic cube seen in captain america from the humans who have claimed it ie the covert peacekeeping organization shield armed with a new weapon that can fire energy and brainwash unwilling subjects loki heads for earth    the only thing standing in the trickster gods way shield leader nick fury samuel l jackson and the various superheroes included in his avengers initiative fury manages to gather captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr dr bruce banner mark ruffalo and super spies black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner through otherworldly machinations even thor chris hemsworth is able to return to earth charged with capturing his sibling and the tesseract for return to asgard   but loki isnt called the god of mischief for nothing before furys new super team can find its balance loki is in their heads sewing seeds of doubt distrust anger and conflict can earths mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet  or is their coming together an even bigger threat than loki himself   the avengers is very much a joss whedon product  and is much better off for being so if youre not familiar with the geekcentric writerfilmmaker he was the mind behind the 90s buffy the vampire slayer tv series the shortlived but muchloved scifi show firefly its movie spinoff serenity famous internet musicals dr horribles singalong blog and even some acclaimed comic book series astonishing xmen   whedon was chosen to head this project primarily for his love of comic book culture and its characters speaking as a comic book fan its clear from watching avengers that whedon is in tune with every single one of the superheroes and villains in marvels stables and knows how to arrange those personalities into a wellbalanced ensemble  like a perfectly assembled puzzle no pun he also accomplishes the impressive feat of tying all of the plotthreads of the solo films together into a semicoherent story while briefly acknowledging various dangling threads whereabouts of certain supporting characters etc without allowing them to strangle this teambased story   through those various solo films weve gotten to know smarmy tony stark oldfashioned idealist captain america arrogant thor sultry black widow and the uncontrollable hulk  avengers takes things a step further by showing us how these characters are growing and evolving  and better yet growing and evolving because of their interactions with one another   for all of the impressive action more on that later the best moments in avengers are arguably the slower characterdriven scenes whedons penchant for snappy dialogue is on full display and its a great experience to see for example tony stark and dr banner talking in highscience dialect no one else in the room understands  or debating the value of the traumas that made them both into tragic heroes small touches but moments that feel true interesting and rewarding in a way that few people fan or nonfan will likely expect   equally unexpected but just as rewarding is the humor in the film we get the usual smattering of oneliners and overlydramatic monologues and dialogue that can only come from a comic book  but there is also sharp wit and total selfawareness woven into whedons script avengers strikes a tonal balance similar to that of iron man  ie light and fun for the most part understatedly serious in the heavy moments and avengers does have some heavy moments rest assured   the best humor comes out of welltimed tongueincheek winks   ie how strong certain characters are how these characters behave the context in which we find them ex cap and thor being fishoutofwater types in the modern world acknowledgement of how the real world is juxtaposed to the concept of superheroes  and other great insights that work as sly winks to comic book fans and generally fun moments for casual viewers to enjoy in between action sequences   speaking of action avengers has some pretty impressive sequences  especially the climatic final battle against lokis invading army which is definitely the best boss battle that has been featured in any marvel movie since incredible hulk those worried about marvels track record for underwhelming climaxes need not by the time the battle is won you will have been exhausted by the combination of iconic comic book imagery the avengers assembled or working together in battle and impressive bigscreen eyecandy the film has about four big set pieces its still somewhat rigid and obvious in its structuring but all of them deliver the goods and keep the movie exciting from start to finish   as far as characters go avengers is the best rendering of marvel superheroes on the big screen since rdj let his charisma carry iron man to success whats surprising about the film is who ends up standing out the most black widow and hulk are the characters best served by avengers and audiences will almost certainly walk away with greater appreciation for both johansson even gets a few chances to mock her detractors robert downey jrs tony stark schtick is as entertaining as ever if not overly familiar by now and he handles the difficult task of keeping things fun whenever they threaten to get too serious or comic book silly without that cog in the machine no pun avengers wouldnt function nearly as well captain america and thor are given moments to shine but their presence is much more reserved and understated in this film  though we do finally get to see the power that makes thor worthy of being called a god   supporting players like nick fury and his assistants agent coulson gregg and maria hill cobie smulders are just that support jackson and gregg are wellexperienced with making the most out of a little in these marvel films but smulders is mostly just window dressing hawkeye renner is the one member of the actual avengers team who is somewhat underserved  though that is something of a necessary evil given how he factors into the story as a villain tom hiddleston makes loki even more compelling than he was in thor this time infusing him with psychotic rage hidden behind a veneer of charm smooth words and dimpled smiles think hannibal lector with super villain aspirations of course as a physical threat loki isnt that intimidating  hence the endless leagues of indistinguishable aliens who are thrown into the third act for the avengers to beat on   now for the downsides because there are a few the story is very flimsy and predictable in terms of its overarching plot and the big reveals in the film are likely to confuse those who havent read a ton of comic books note there are two extra scenes during and after the credits  make sure to stay for both for all the satisfying action avengers demonstrates that whedon still has something to learn about space and angles when it comes to movie direction a lot of the sequences still have a very tv feel to them  and on the whole avengers plays like several episodes of a very wellbuilt tv series rather than a feature film that has truly cinematic moments in it there are a few but only a few   however the few drawbacks and criticisms arent enough to stop the avengers from delivering a fun and satisfying time at the movies whedon leaves the characters in some great places for their upcoming second or third round of solo adventures  with the door to the larger marvel movie universe left wide open for some interesting and risky developments down the road im sure fans will be debating those points all along the way   the avengers is now playing in theaters everywhere it is rated pg13 for intense sequences of scifi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference   if you want to discuss the film in detail please head over to our avengers spoilers discussion to avoid ruining the movie

Sep 27 2012,neutral, when it comes to superheroes cinema spent several decades playing catchup to the boundless imaginations of stan lee jack kirby steve ditko and the other legends of the comic book universe the film studios could buy up the rights to all the characters and storylines that they wanted but technology often let them down what could be inked on the page by the artists at marvel and dc could not always be matched on the movie screen however good the resulting film turned out to be and there were a few winners it would normally entail some poor actor looking faintly ridiculous in a costume whilst hanging from wires or lying on their belly in front of a back projection the leaps and bounds in computer technology changed all that and has meant regular raids on the comic book back catalogue over the last fifteen years or so caped crusaders of all forms became increasingly important weapons in hollywoods summer arsenal if you were to continue this analogy then the avengers is a wmd of a movie from an fx perspective this ultimate hero teamup represents some of the best work done by weta since they breathed life into middle earth at the turn of the twentyfirst century the effects in the avengers are simply astounding this is not just a case of believing that a man can fly but that he can don a suit of mechanical armour whilst plummeting from the top of a skyscraper or level a forest with one blow of a mighty hammer all this magic is rendered so real that even the hardened cynics out there would find it hard not to be impressed the avenger had little choice but to be great the buildup to it has been immense since the release of the first iron man in 2008 since then each of the core avengers has stepped up to the plate with the incredible hulk thor and captain america each taking their turn their eponymous adventures all had varying degrees of merit but for audience members who risked the withering looks of cinema staff by staying behind to watch the postcredit teasers there was a hint of things to come the avengers is not strictly a sequel but having had the back stories of several characters already established allows director joss whedon to plough straight into the action believe me we are talking about some serious action barely ten minutes into the film and the headquarters of shield  the military organisation run by monocular badass nick fury samuel l jackson  is obliterated by the power of a device called the tesseract this is the cosmic cube which cropped up in both thor and captain america depending on which side of the good guybad guy divide you happen to be on the tesseract either represents a new source of sustainable energy or a key to unlocking a door to the other end of the universe and letting in alien nasties loki tom hiddleston the grinning wicked brother of thor falls firmly in the latter camp he plans to use the tesseract to take over the world with the assistance of an extraterrestrial army with loki on the rise it is time for fury to roll out the avengers initiative and bring together the greatest heroes on earth subject to contractual obligations in order to save the human race how desperate are you enquires loki of his opponent you have made me very desperate growls fury in response the talent roster is impressive there is the norse god thor chris hemsworth wartime poster boy captain america chris evans human shaped shrapnel iron man robert downey jr and dr bruce banner mark ruffalo aka the incredible hulk but thats not all they are joined by black widow scarlett johansson who does not really have any super powers other than looking amazing in a lbd she can kick butt with the best of them though and plays a pivotal part in saving the day there is also the super slick bowman hawkeye jeremy renner who makes for another great character this is a mission movie without the need for a training montage as the team members are already match fit what they do need to learn though is how to get along with each other after initial meetings result in a clash of enormous egos as well as fists in an act of fidelity to the source material the avengers do not just fight the enemy they also battle each other the dustup between iron man and thor is especially impressive billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark the man within the iron takes particular pleasure in needling his fellow heroes and only really clicks with likeminded technical whizz banner the placid mumbling doctor who normally looks like he has slept in late or perhaps that is just mark ruffalo is the big green elephant in the room wind him up just that bit too much and you might unleash the hulk and then you have real problems the generally strong cast helps to install human hearts in the supernatural bodies these are tough guys but they also experience guilt grief and even fear admittedly downey jr gets to steal the show a bit as the smarttalking stark but each actor does well with what they are given thor is a trickier role to make believable thanks to his shakespeare in the park dialogue but this allows the opportunity for some fish out of water humour the real danger of the film that there would not be enough room for each character to make an impact is happily avoided plus there are welcome returns for gwyneth paltrow as starks long suffering lady friend and clark gregg as shield agent phil coulson look out too for nice cameos from a couple of older but familiar faces from other fantasy classics the race to find the tesseract is the chord on which to hang some superb action setpieces including an attack on shields flying fortress and a climatic showdown on and above the streets of manhattan this gloriously destructive mayhem in which our heroes seem severely outgunned by a legion of terrors from outer space is deftly handled by whedon and is hugely exciting stuff the smirk on the hulks face when he is finally given permission to smash is a moment to savour needless to say he does not have to be told twice the avengers also has some very funny moments several playing on the slightly absurd predicament of being a super being on an ordinary planet yet though everyone here is clearly having a lot of fun the film never stoops to cheap mockery or camp silliness thanks to an overall respect for spirit of the original comics if you are a committed hater of all things comic book then this film may do nothing to change your mind if you like comics then you will no doubt love this unless you are one of those types who arrive at a film with a detailed check list of expectations and consider any deviation to be a crime against the genre anyone else even if you have never read a comic in your life should really enjoy the avengers the film certainly sets a challenge for the dark knight rises later this year although that will be much more down and dirty of course the big question now is what the avengers could possibly do for an encore there is a suggestion midway through the credits of who their next opponent might be but in the meantime the avengers is terrific stuff and should be seen by anyone who loves a good time at the movies
Sep 26 2012,neutral, the avengers is a kickass summer movie and one of the best superhero movies of all time which version should you buy well for just a few bucks more than the standard 2d bluray you can own the bluray the 3d bluray a dvd a digital copy of the film and the films original soundtrack spend the cash and get the complete set its worth it
Sep 24 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is a visual comic book and it doesnt aspire to be anything more than that as a film version it succeedsone is tempted to saymightily
Sep 14 2012,positive, examinercom has transformed into a major player in financial news think stocks crypto banks  if its about money its on examinercom our address 2785 east grand boulevard unit 350 detroit mi 48211 united states
Sep 13 2012,positive,it really is an astounding achievement  a film that juggles an unenviable number of elements combining what weve seen before slotting them together and then adding enough depth action and humour to make this a remarkable standalone film
Sep 10 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is the superhero movie to end all superhero movies why joss whedon

Aug 22 2012,negative,after years of buildup and prequels the avengers is merely average
Aug 22 2012,neutral,the first great superhero team movie and a film that captures the essence of what makes the marvel universe great
Jul 13 2012,negative,the filmmakers play a conservative game not setting out to make a great movie but simply making sure not to screw it up an entire franchise
Jul 3 2012,positive,feels like actual marvel comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream its simply jawdropping
Jun 30 2012,positive,while it reflects a movie culture that has traded originality for scale  one wonders if theres a shred of originality anywhere in the film  the avengers is grand throwaway fun
Jun 23 2012,positive,its as big funny shiny explosive expert riproaringly entertaining an action movie as weve seen in a long time
Jun 23 2012,positive, yeah its all that a tentpole cash cow for the studio a dream come true for fans and treat for action aficionados the avengers comes at you as the first true summer movie spectacular of the 2012 season through the individual films focusing on the characters here fans have watched and waited until they could see all the characters assembled they wont be disappointed to top it off screenwriter and director is joss whedon of buffy and firefly renown whose instant cult favorite cabin in the woods still is drawing in crowds the first issue that the avengers must address is the arrival of loki tom hiddleston who reprises his role of thor and whom you may recognize from war horse the jealous adopted brother of thor chris hemsworth straight from the cabin in the woods and from his first portrayal of thor loki breaks into shield headquarters to steal the tesseract a hub of extreme power and he also takes with him professor selvig stellan skarsgard and hawkeye jeremy renner nick fury samuel l jackson cant stop loki by himself so he calls in the troops black widow scarlett johansson iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans and dr bruce banner mark ruffalo the successor to the role after edward norton in the 2008 movie and eric bana in the woefully underseen hulk from 2003 and of course thor but loki has a major trick up his sleeve and it makes loki himself look puny in comparison to the destruction that is to follow iron man and thor dont exactly hit it off most of the crew members are just plain leery of banner whose hulk persona is dangerous and unpredictable captain america continues to try to find his place in contemporary times and egos continue to clash the action is pulsepounding and all the more so if you see it in 3d this is the stuff for which welldeveloped 3d is made inyourface movement and amazing battles and there are two extra scenes one during the early credit roll and another at the very very end thats a nod to something iron man says earlier in the movie
Jun 22 2012,positive, and if dr bruce banner can come out of selfimposed exile to join marvels the avengers than i really ought to be able to review some movies again lets go after roughly four years of movielength commercials for the avengers formerly known as iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger earths mightiest heroes have finally assembled to fans of the superhero genre this probably feels like an impossible dream realized to nonfans of the superhero genre this might play like the perfect time for a showstopping climax take a bow and give mere mortals some movies again the latter group should brace themselves this particular blockbuster is lively enough to greenlight an even bigger movie family of men and hopefully some women in tights more after the jump marvel wisely handed the reigns over to writerdirector joss whedon who is still best known for creating one of the greatest tv shows of all time buffy the vampire slayer and who has only directed one previous feature serenity though im a big whedon believer the opening moments worried me  the film starts with a brief but dull outerspace prologue designed to tell us that the earth will soon be threatened duh the superheroes have to protect the world from something without context this unfortunately brings green lanterns information overload opening to mind though its happily the last completely useless scene in the film once loki tom hiddleston steals the glowing cube of power known as the tesseract from nick fury samuel jackson at shield the story is jolted to life loki also steals jeremy renner but who wouldnt i dont want to spoil any plot details but lets just say that joss whedon is basically the worlds greatest fanfic writer he finds numerous clever ways to pit the superheroes against one another throughout the course of the action even though theyre on the same side hero vs hero has always been a staple however convoluted in the details of both comic book narratives and fan fiction but we rarely get to see it onscreen like most modern blockbusters that supersize themselves the avengers at 142 minutes long has its duller patches the heroes spend an awful lot of time on minor bickering and self doubt on an invisible floating ship that doesnt have quite enough character to sustain a third of the movie lokis outsourced alien army is also depressingly personalityfree and derivative but thats a minor quibble as theres plenty of big personas around waiting for their turn to shine the avengers multiple character introductions arent as gracefully swift as serenitys remarkable opening scene but whedons dependable talent for finding the humor and fissures and alliances within group dynamics is put to fine use somehow they made an avengers movie without any of earths mightiest egos demanding the spotlight even the black widow scarlett johansson merely extraneous eye candy in iron man 2 is used about as well as you could possibly hope for whedons bravest gambit in the storytelling might be the way he handles the hulk eric bana ed norton mark ruffalo he pins much anticipatory weight on the where and the when and the how quickly bruce banner might hulk out confidently assuming the audience will beg for it ignoring the fact that hulk has a reputation for boring them on the big screen mark ruffalos wonderfully mellow screen vibe makes for a nice bit of counterintuitive casting yet you still believe him when he says hes angry all the time whedon and ruffalo through motioncapture acting make the hulk so entertaining in fact that he gets the single biggest laugh in the movie its a blink and youll miss it comic beat in the middle of the finales mayhem and what glorious mayhem though the avengers never reaches the pop iconography heights of spiderman 2 my choice for best superhero film and it doesnt even attempt the majestic gravitas of the dark knight most peoples choice for best superhero film preferring to keep it light and quippy its final act is so big and crazy and superpowered that you leave on a true high im still thinking of its most eyepopping moments thors hammer meeting captain americas shield iron mans unusually vertiginous costume change a billion dollar complex sinking into the earth lokis sorcery and tom hiddlestons equally magic acting the hulk sliding down skyscrapers chris evans ass in sweatpants that sound you hear exiting the theater is not just the aftershocks of multiple geek orgasms but the crying jags of warner bros executives they famously gave joss whedon the boot on the still languishing wonder woman movie damn but she would have lassoed the world anew with whedon guiding her  grade bboscar hopeful given the cold shoulder the academy gave hulk the incredible hulk thor and captain america 0 nominations between the four of them id say its unlikely even in the craft categories unless they like the team as much as the iron man movies in which case theyve got an outside shot at visual effects and sound categories i basically agree with all of this it was nice for all the heroes to have such distinguished personality traits without making them seeming flat and it really does amaze me how much more stuff scarlett had to work with here really does redeem her just standing around looking hot in iron man 2 totally agree with so much of this the first hour kind of drags in places but i guess thats to be expected when youre waiting for the big scenes really enjoyed ruffalo but i always do but why was evans covered in so much makeup he looked so waxy you could practically mistake his entire performance as a cgi effect i felt bad for johansson everyone has magic powers except her and renner but at least renner gets that cool bow she just gets what a little gun lame omg how did i never hear this wonder woman thing joss whedon doing that would be fantastic buffy is amazing spectacular legendary etc so im sure hed do great with another female hero thank you for articulating my feelings on the opening scene with loki and the aliens it really did remind me of green lantern anyway i gave the movie a b also its not on the level of spiderman 2 the dark knight or x2 my favorite superhero movie but its good fun and the best marvel studio film yet i havent seen thor or captain america or the hulk or iron man but im interested in watching this one for some reason to i have to watch those first or can i go in without watching them and still get itenjoy it you used to be an observant reviewerportraying bruce banner as incapable of controlling whats inside him and the hulk as an ugly gorilla is a gambit indeedthor is certainly not demanding the spotlight robbed of the moods and shades he showed in his own film he basically only shows up for fighting and you dont even dare to mention the desaster that hawkeye was zombified played by a babyfaced midget and armed with a bow thats apparently coming from kmartworst of all though was the man you call threatening and magical loki is barely recognizable as the comparatively complex character from thor by abandoning lokis more complicated character traits whedon has flattened him into the stereotype powerseeking hollywood sociopath with supernatural powers and to make matters even worse joss foists way too many oafish moments on loki and therefore undermines the threat that the character is not supposed to beyou dont spoil any plot details by saying that whedon is basically the worlds greatest fanfic writer in fact he has a peculiar tendency to reduce major plot points to simple throwaway lines and i guess we have different takes on thor which i think is a much weaker film than this though obviously with the entire movie to flesh it out it does have a slightly more complex  brother vs brother psychology alex  i dont think you need to have seen the other ones youll miss a few things but they were basically commercials for this one man this movie was awesome i can understand to a certain extent some of the reasons why people dont think its that good but since i have been a comic book fan since 1981 this is a moment i have dreamed of for decades and i think the avengers got it right everything you could want in an entertaining movie busting with visuals action dialogue humorcould go on and on i for one didnt think it was too long say when you compared to the length of freaking transformers 3 which was like 2 hours and 40 minutesoverkill avengers is right on the mark cant wait for the sequel great writeup nathaniel enjoyed reading this loved the movie this is what i want from my popcorn films  humor action fun very few times i want to cringe whedon is finally being noticed on a huge scale this is definitely a fluff film  the dark knight and x2 are doing something entirely different comparing them would be like comparing a tasty main course to cotton candy and honestly why not have both b suggests a nearmasterpiece but now its a bbyou even said bravest gambit and i dont know if people dont like the hulk in general both recent hulk movies have ardent supporters actually i thought that the casting of a new and wellrespected actor as banner was a natural advantage for whedon one that he totally ruined by making it all about banners inability to control the transformation and the way he behaves as the hulk only to finally turn things upside down with im always angry or whatever it was i cant remember all those throwaway lines i dont have distaste for renner but for renners desperate desire to become an action star he simply does not look itbut i admit that the avengers promoted thor from a movie i could live with to a movie i kinda like the scale of these epic marvel movies always seem kind of pathetic to me loki marshals an interdimensional force barely big enough to destroy 5th avenue ho hum people if youre not going to give spidey a cameo just stay out of manhattan nevertheless the superstar enable animates the snappy dialog marvelous plot contrivances and animation into a solid a blockbuster  however given whedons penchant for strong women characters the black widow intro and backstory was a letdownt instead of johansen delivering an oscartrite monologue they should have just left her mysterious and kickass eg ruffalos hulk and it would have been a better film having now seen renners five biggest hits i still dont get it hes being groomed for cruise damon and wahlberg caliber assignments but at his best he seems like a barely memorable supporting character case in point hawkeye willy and vern  its interesting to me that willy thinks b means near masterpiece while vern thinks b means middling while i think b and b mean solid to quite good and c is middling grading is such a werid practice with art and always has been i usually adjust back and forth with grades between one small step only rarely does something jump or plummet a lot in grading i agree with you nat it was a solid spandexbuster but when i started thinking about why it wasnt masterful i figured it needed a bit more umph in the character and plot development plus all the baggage willy trots out or better yet for me to suddenly be 20 years younger vern well the comics great cant give the movie anything close to an a though too hermetically sealed and malin akerman is terrible overall b its better than 300 but thats not a high compliment next superhero film im looking forward aside from the two in this years crop is edgar wrights antman film i remember the idea was to make a film about the antmen hank pym and scott lang im unsure yet whether hell try to incorporate eric ogrady as well but id hope so considering weve waited this long i thought the movie was very enjoyable i liked it the audience i saw it with seemed to like it a lot too there was a lot of laughing and clapping and applause at the end of the movie  you definitely dont need to see the previous movies to get anything thats going on in this one though you may have a better understanding of the lokithor relationship if you see thor and what the deal is with tony stark if you see iron man i havent seen iron man 2 or captain america myself and while there was clearly a background to captain america that i wasnt up on i didnt need that background to get the gist of what was going on with him in the avengers i havent seen the avengers yet because i was unable to get to the movies this weekend i will see it but im not happy about it im sure its good and i liked the iron man movies thor and captain americaand really applaud the choice of directors and cast for all of them but the law of diminishing returns with all these superhero movies has been in full effect and its not necessarily due to their quality its overload i just cant work up the excitement for these movies anymore because its just constant it feels like there isnt a month that goes by without a new superherocomic bookfranchise movie coming out sigh ill see it im sure ill like it im sure ill forget about it the next day i dont really care about all that i just wish i could feel the excitement that everyone else seems to feeling about it another thing did anyone else notice that despite the budget and impressive effects random things here and there looked cheap im think specifically of lokis kind of ridiculous dualhorned costume and even during the final manhattan battle the closeups of the streets and stores looked strangely cheap and cheesy very articulate review nathaniel both gushing in joy and knowledgeable of the movies handful of flaws agree with you on spidey 2 as the reigning king of superheroes still a fact that seemingly everyone tends to forget ive seen all the movies and each one lasted better than the other especially the hulk films seen the avengers 5 times already and it never gets old in my opinion the storyline was good but yet it had great oneliners especially from rdj and mark ruffalo brought a new light to being dr banner but with all seriousness its not the greatest visual effects movie but if it doesnt get nominated on at least the costumes than the acedemy should be ashamed if they could nominate avatar than the avengers should have a shot at it i think that this movie was super awesome for the most part but like someone said it did kinda drag in some places i just wonder if it will be better than the new batman movie i made a comparison between the two in this article ive written and would like you to check it out let me know your thoughts thank you
Jun 15 2012,positive, caution the following review was written by a moviegoer who has been suffering from superheromovie fatigue since xmen 3 back in 2006 you have been warned dont worry  i get it my review of the avengers wont make a dollars difference in the box office results the best stunt youll see now that the film has opened is its rocketblast rush toward breaking all records and busting all blocks its faster than iron man in a hurry and im not going to bother with a detailed plot summary about a thousand plot summaries are being posted today and you are welcome to read as many as you like besides the cards in the superhero deck are so easy to shuffle you could have told pretty much the same story with a completely different cast of characters no doubt we will see the same movie with different characters soon so why bother with particulars suffice it to say theres a magic cube and its a portal and theres a bunch of nasty aliens on the other side what can save the world god love no a bunch of guys who once theyre done fighting each other will join forces and demonstrate that theyre better at violence than the villains in the name of goodness and america and oldfashioned somethingorother im also not inclined to spend more than a few lines considering the themes of the movie why bother it would be like writing an essay on the nutrition you will glean from a box of oreo cookies or telling the crowd at a monstertruckandtractor pull that the guys behind the wheels are patriots who really love their families and that 10 of the profits will go to charity how inspiring and besides if youre really interested in what the avengers selects from the five or six basic flavors of comic book superhero movie themes what honorable notions it pins like accessories to its flamboyant costumes i can point you to plenty of reviews like that those reviews will applaud the movies simplistic stories of undisciplined egomaniacs who humble themselves to become a team who get over themselves and put aside their differences for the greater good who risk their lives to save others who overcome fear and set aside grudges etc its like a cagefighting tournament for peace it will serve up sermonillustrations for mancentric pastors across the country for the next several months but it would feel like a waste of time to rationalize my enjoyment of what is essentially a twoandahalfhour demolition derby lets face it while the avengers gives good lip service to such american virtues as democracy teamwork courage and sacrifice ultimately it exists to fulfill the fantasies of adolescents  adolescents of all ages for every admirable alliance established between temperamental champions several city blocks will be destroyed dont worry the movie wont stop to shed any tears over human casualties unless we happen to lose a member of the team  this is a joss whedon film after all or consider the consequences of urban devastation everything has been carefully calculated to restore the fun we used to have watching terrorists destroy skyscrapers before we were taught what such a thing really costs bored of movies in which a superhero seemingly outmatched by a supervillain manages to come through like rocky and the karate kid in the end saving the world with violence that the movie has carefully prepared us to embrace as justified and reasonable well boy do i have the movie for you the avengers brings not one not two but a crowd of superheroes together and before theyre drawn into war with their supervillain of the month they have to fight each other so we can see their powers going off like fireworks on the fourth of july once were convinced that theyre all pretty much equally invincible and were feeling exhausted from the time and energy spent in such collisions then we can watch them coordinate their efforts against a madman who is clearly in over his head and were right back in the thick of the melee we came to see an exquisitely complicated and violent ballet that will save the world from a familiar mayhem made of aliens and guns and sharp pointy things and lasers and fast flying vehicles and big nasty teeth but believe it or not it is not my intention to condemn the affair i enjoy a good superhero movie the way i enjoy a bowl of ice cream and this is a sixscoop sundae covered in toppings im just here to point out that its not a particularly healthy form of entertainment it is calculated to give us what we want rather than what we need and its full of artificial ingredients to put it another way its basically historys most expensive itchy and scratchy cartoon and it so focused on fulfilling adolescent fanboy fantasies that it makes xmen first class seem like shakespeare in the park still while i may be 41 im also 14 ive always enjoyed ice cream sundaes just as ive always been thrilled by blockbuster fourth of july fireworks shows since the movie isnt so much a work of storytelling as its a marathon of wishfulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts  punches peppered with punchlines  here it comes a movie review made of comicbook style exclamations from my inner 14yearold which should easily fit into dialogue balloons ive even put quotation marks around a bunch of outbursts for your convenience and ive included exclamation points since no movie has ever made them so necessary like i said you can find a few nuggets of meaning in the melee but im more concerned about what moviegoers will learn from entertainment like this as opposed to what we might hope they learn read the comments section for any avengers review that dares to point out the movies weaknesses and youll see that hordes of devoted marvel fans will hulkout at the slightest provocation even samuel jackson is throwing fuel on the outrage avengers fans ny times critic ao scott needs a new job lets help him find one one he can actually do the target audience for this movie is wired to react with thoughtless rage spectacular violence and barely any evidence of the restraint that bruce banner would do anything to regain and why not theyve just been cheering for a movie that treats the hulks temper tantrums as if theyre a religious experience hulk thrills audiences by unleashing relentless destruction and makes us look forward to moments when his curse is at its worst and his superfriends are a bunch of overly aggressive egomaniacs who like fiveyearolds act like its some kind of herculean feat to quiet down and cooperate on a task isnt it fair to say that what these heroes might yearn to be what they might learn to be gets drowned out in the thrills of the supremely impressive violent spectacles that theyre assigned to provide for our pleasure so with all of that in mind yes i enjoyed these fireworks i enjoyed this super sundae but now i have an ice cream headache and i think ill stick to salads for a while for better or worse the avengers is the biggest funniest most relentlessly entertaining superhero movie so far only god can save us now
Jun 13 2012,positive, review  the era of the fanboyasdirector has produced some of the finest genre pieces in recent memory for years it took stylists like tim burton to wring anything remotely watchable out of comic book adventures but today you just have to point one of a handful of hip helmers at any property they love and youll end up with a film that is as satisfying as you could have imagined the avengers is the perfect example of this a culmination of four years of setup and bravado the avengers has an aboveaverage pedigree of precursor films setting up this ultimate teaming of some of marvels most acclaimed stars beginning in 2008 an ambitious studio decided to take a new approach to setting up its blockbuster franchise by taking the parts of the futureplanned avengers and turning them into individual features xmen took the opposite approach to mixed effect by spinning off an origin film for its popular wolverine character marvel and disney started out with iron man starring robert downey jr and proceeded to the incredible hulk with edward norton thor with chris hemsworth and captain america with chris evans whod already made a name for himself in the genre by playing the goofoff playboy in the fantastic four films bringing these four characters together with mark ruffalo replacing norton as bruce banner and his alterego hulk the idea was that getting setup and origins out of the way would make for a more interesting and actionpacked film thats almost what they got director joss whedon who made a name for himself on television with his highly popular longrunning genre series buffy the vampire slayer and angel would have seemed like an odd choice to rein in the monstrous responsibilities of big screen spectacle if he hadnt already proven his capabilities with serenity six years ago serenity based on his popular but shortseason cancelled fox series firefly displayed a cool sense of perspective in his feature film adaptation serenity was witty fresh and energetic showing he was more than capable of balancing performance plot and action without relegating any of them to the periphery whedon didnt rest on his laurels with the avengers sure he had five films iron man 2 included to establish his characters for him but knowing who they were wasnt enough whedons film introduces the interpersonal dynamics these four headstrong superheroes engender devoting as much time to getting the characters in focus and working together as it does exploring the winding plot of thors brother loki tom hiddleston has hatched on behalf of a conquestminded alien species with rulership of earth as his reward whedon has seen from the failures of a number of other films most notably the servicable but forgettable green lantern that focusing on a galactic moblike villain without a focus for the audiences ire creates problems on the viewerengagement front with loki as the frontandcenter threat you have a chance to jeer the most visible threat while having a larger mass of enemies on the doorstep opting to drop norton for ruffalo was an unusual choice but hulks uneasiness at his own powers and his inability to control them comes through crystal clear with ruffalo behind them he may not have the badboy charm norton could bring to the role but with downey jr more than cornering that market having a meeker more respectable bruce banner helped leverage the films cast into a more cohesive and believable group downey jr hemsworth and evans carry over the same appeal they generated in their first and in downey jrs case second outings that their performances seem almost stagnant but work rather well wholly within the framework of this unified film our primary quartet isnt alone several prominent actors fill out the large ensemble in roles that are frequently pivotal and no less important to the film foremost of these is scarlett johansson who plays the interrogation master black widow she was first introduced to the franchise in iron man 2 and to an extent was far more interesting in that film but being the sole woman in the cast forces her to stand more effectively against her male counterparts and when it comes to physical chutzpah she is more than their equal yet from a performance perspective some of her scenes come off a bit flat thats not to say that she doesnt mostly nail the performance but she is certainly one of the more inferior elements to the film not more so than jeremy renner who plays eagleeyed archer hawkeye most of his scenes seem mired in his dualnatured role in the film renner is a very talented thespian so seeing the end result here is disheartening this may largely be attributed to hawkeye being only tangentialy introduced in thor where he had no backstory or creative development the same goes for johanssons black widow had either character being highlighted more significantly or in their own films we might be talking in more detail about where they succeeded or went wrong but as mostlyperiphery characters its all supposition that they would have otherwise been better that leaves two characters who didnt get much development in prior films but have been featured more frequently in the leadup films the most frequently seen of these is samuel l jackson who as nick fury has been present in each film even if only in the bumper at the end of the film giving him a unique development strategy his personality was well defined by the time of the avengers though a background story is still forthcoming the film on nick fury is still in development but has been for a number of years which may mean it never gets made jackson hasnt changed a bit since his first appearance as the head of shield the uss leading protection authority one of shields agents phil colson clark gregg is the other character showing up in both iron man films and thor gregg has been one of the true emotional centers of the franchise his is the kind of character that sews the entire quilt together and as the avengers plays out we come to know just how integral he is to the film and to the franchise and this is thanks to greggs natural charm and wit he may not have the history nor the paycheck of his costars but he is the mvp of the production the avengers will no doubt appeal to the fanboys who have made the previous films varying degrees of successful but its how it plays to nonfans of the franchise that will be most central to its success as of the writing of this review the film has already passed the 400 million mark in the us a number once thought reserved only for wideappeal films and franchises after all even the lord of the rings films and harry potter films never managed to reach that number is it a broad appeal or are there other factors at work here the films success is equal parts both without knowing much about these characters its not hard to relate to them for even when they don their spandex and battle armor they remain humanistic characters evincing frailty and emotion we frequently explore and understand in ourselves superheroes represent that dynamic in all of us wanting to leap beyond our terrestrial bodies to save the world we desire to live vicariously through these adventurers in hopes that we will learn more about ourselves and our ability to accept those who are different than we are while the film is bound to be compared financially to the dark knight the more fantastic elements of the avengers make that comparison a tad tenuous christopher nolans film is far more rooted in the realistic nature of humanity after all its protagonist is physically and emotionally human with the avengers there is a superhumanity to the characters that make its success all the more interesting both are heavily driven by comic book fans but theres a measure of nonfan general public in those mixtures that explains a good deal of both films successes in the end the quality of the entertainment and the writing is what makes the avengers and even the dark knight successes they may be mass appeal movies on the level of transformers but they have bucketsful of the qualities that have prevented michael bays films and their ilk monumental successes they are heartfelt richly written character pieces with boatloads of action and adventure in support instead of as foreground distraction do you think this movie has a chance of getting the best picture nomination nod at the academy awards in my opinion it should just wanted to hear what you have to say about it i doubt it the dark knight rises is far more likely to land in the best picture race than the avengers and academy voters arent likely to make room for two comic book movies in their top 6 to 10
Jun 1 2012,positive,its the humor thats the avengers strength
May 31 2012,negative, the avengers directed by joss whedon screenplay by whedon and zak penn based on the comic book by stan lee and jack kirby dark shadows directed by tim burton screenplay by seth grahamesmith based on the television series by dan curtis since its release in the us in early may the avengers has brought in nearly 500 million at the domestic box office setting a record for the speed with which that mark was reached worldwide the movie has exceeded the 12 billion mark joss whedons effort based on the marvel comics original is one of hollywoods biggest spectacles to date at a cost of 220000000 it involves a group of superheroes the avengers combining to help save the earthmanhattan in particularfrom an alien supervillain his demonic agent and an army of mechanized gargoyles nick fury samuel l jackson director of the global peacekeeping agency shield is charged with retrieving the tesseract a powerful energy source and potential weapon of mass destruction that has opened a portal to outer space it has been taken by the asgardian demigod loki tom hiddleston a luciferlike figure on behalf of his alien overlord in order to subjugate the human race fury gathers his superhero squadron that eventually includes iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner if we cant protect the world well avenge it becomes their motto marvel comics rise to prominence had a certain association with the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s marvel prided itself on presenting the characters complexities and even serious failings in opposition to the more stolid onedimensional superman and batman of dc comics thus each avenger in whedons film has his or her individual dilemma the black widow wants to make up for past misdeeds thor has to settle accounts with his fallen evil brother loki after being encased in ice for decades captain america wonders whether there is a place in the 21st century for him and his oldfashioned patriotic gungho iron man tony stark needs to prove that he is more than a selfish billionaire playboy dr bruce banner who when angry becomes the hulk is ministering to the poor in india when we first meet him an undertaking he reluctantly abandons for the planetsaving mission and so on none of this character development however goes beyond a few introductory lines of dialogue or bits of action the audience quickly learns what to expect from each and every character even taking into account the plots inevitable twists and turns the avengers also have their internal conflicts as a group the revelation that fury and shield were developing their own weapons of mass destruction creates divisions the team members also differ and bicker over what strategy to pursue against loki moreover one of their number hawkeye initially falls under the sway of loki and threatens to help enslave the planet will the avengers come together in the end with all their strengths and weaknesses to save humanity the film primarily a series of individual and largescale combats is a spectacle of contemporary film technology and special effects one impossible feat follows rapidly on another separated by interludes of largely clichéd dialogue pieces of plot exposition and rather labored attempts at humor one hundred and fortythree minutes of headpounding bombast the avengers is an exhausting experience the filmmakers make certain that the viewer has as little time or space as possible for reflection and critical thought the story and characters flow inevitably toward an allout war with loki and the aliens as the only alternative to the destruction of the human race the creatures with whom the superheroes do battle are the embodiment of pure unreasoning evil negotiations are out of the question and if loki engages in conversation it is only for the purpose of manipulating one avenger or another or malignantly stalling for time the movies final segments are saturated with 911 imageryfirefighters and policemen to the rescue of wounded and sootcovered civilians followed by collective mourning captain america a world war ii veteran brings a little oldfashioned stars and stripes to the party and tycoon tony stark demonstrates that the top onehundredth of one percent can be a force for good whedons film omits the fact that stark industries is a weapons manufacturer and starks past nemeses have included arabs and persians arranged in westversuseast combat in the wake of 911 and the proclamation of the war on terror and in the midst of a relentless drive to war with iran what is the overall message and impact here there is no reason to impute to the filmmakers deliberately retrograde political motives but have they thought at all about the implications of their work the avengers does contain an elegant seductive performance by hiddleston the deep blue sea a very talented performer and a few comic though increasingly stale quips from downey unquestionably whedon is more gifted than some of the other blockbuster directors as foolish as it often is the story in the avengers has a certain coherence and many of the effects are eyecatching marvels those who maintain that the population gets what it wants selfservingly forget that audiences have no say in the production of the mass entertainment inflicted on them giant conglomerates make all those decisions and work at every point within the framework of their financial and ideological interests the resurgence of superhero films in particular is the result of various factors and really deserves its own special study economic social and artistic issues come together here if it could presumably each hollywood studio would make one or two colossal films a year that would earn billions intriguing human stories and artistic presentations of life are inconveniences for studio executives which they dispense with as much as possible in an effort to get to the business of emptying their customers pockets as numerous commentators have pointed out film adaptations of comic books have the advantage of builtin popular familiarity and bases of support in addition a successful adaptation may generate a vast amount of cash in terms of product tieins clothing games fast food restaurant items toys and so forth for the fortunate entertainment giant in question taking no chances the filmmakers have made sure that the avengers is starpacked and in numerous cases johansson downey hemsworth ruffalo jackson and even gwyneth paltrow in a small part clark gregg and cobie smulders the performers have a genuine following or popular appeal again a number of critics have pointed to the manner in which superhero films dress up american reality brutal american imperialist reality in particular a 2008 article for example at the cleveland indy media center opines that these superheroes have been harnessed in support of our dying imperial project promising a renaissance through which our superior strength and unrivaled human wisdom are finally and fully unveiled for the worlds adoration and humble acquiescence along these lines a blog by tom hiddleston on the guardian web site is highly suggestive superhero films he writes offer a shared faithless modern mythology through which these truths can be explored in our increasingly secular society with so many disparate gods and different faiths superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out we have no desire to pick on hiddleston as noted an excellent actor in any event one suspects that the comment reflects the thinking of the filmmakers and sections of the film industry insofar as they care to articulate their thoughts however this is a terribly wrongheaded conception how can significant truths be explored through comic bookbased films cartoons childish dreams if someone thinks about this for an instant surely it must produce misgivings the very nature of the form operates against although it does not make impossible the working through of the intensely complicated problems of modern life in a mass society why is it not possible to present an accurate picture of the world and its complexities without legends superheroes and superheroines this genre is not working through any serious issues in an honest way it mythologizes in dishonest ways moreover hiddleston makes no reference to the social and class issues but the avengers so to speak does its view of humanityat a time when wide layers of the population are beginning to return to the global political arenais that of a helpless faceless horde clearly film industry executives in general and the politicalmedia establishment have a less than selfless interest in skewing social reality and diverting peoples attention from it decades ago superhero movies and television shows were tongueincheek todays films present their comic book characters with a high degree of selfseriousness they have a different tone and mood than their cartoonish ancestors even though it has a certain playfulness and allows all sorts of physical mauling to go on the avengers still treats its characters with undue reverence the rise to prominence of the superhero comic book trend in film putting aside for the moment the question of its artistic value has an objective significance it coincides with the global economic decline of the us and the deteriorating social conditions of the population unwilling and intellectually too impoverished to look reality in the face hollywood increasingly resorts to solving americas and the worlds problems through simplistic fantasy it makes up for the military fiascos and social disasters it cant and wont represent by inventing cartoonish successes and triumphs that should convince no one such films insofar as they have a major impact which is questionable tend to reinforce and exacerbate the wishful thinking and illusions of a somewhat stunned population that has not yet for the most part consciously grasped the real causes of its predicament and there came a day a day unlike any other when earths mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat on that day the avengers were bornto fight the foes no single hero could withstand through the years their roster has prospered changing many times but their glory has never been denied heed the call thenfor now the avengers assemblefrom the prologue to the marvel comic book based on the gothic television soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971 tim burtons dark shadows is an erratic movie without core or conviction although the film is not as poor as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street 2007 or alice in wonderful 2010 burton is largely going through the motions here as well almost entirely lost are the humanism and sympathy that made edward scissorhands 1990 and ed wood 1994 endearing dark shadows relies heavily on the talents of johnny depp as well as a soundtrack of familiar 1970s songs to cover over the identity crisis of its lackluster screenplay confusion about whether its a comedyhorror or horrordrama with a bit of comedy produces a few casualties among whom michelle pfeiffer is the most prominent depp plays barnabas collins born in liverpool in the 18th century whose family moved to new england and became rich in the fishing industry a jilted lover and witch angelique eva green turns him into a vampire and buries him in 1972 his coffin is uncovered by a group of construction workers and barnabas is set free the films quasicomedy stems from barnabass encounter with the 1970s including a discussion about the vietnam war with a vanload of hippies who soon after become the victims of his bloodlust not amusing while burton can resurrect barnabas no amount of dark burtontype visuals can resurrect the cheesy but enjoyable original barnabas jonathan frid who died in april and the silly television series
May 28 2012,positive,whedons clear fanboy glee is irresistibly contagious to the audience whether the heroes and villains go at it with fisticuffs or sharp witty dialogue
