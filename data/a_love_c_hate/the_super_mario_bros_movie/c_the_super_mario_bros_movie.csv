Dec 22 2023,neutral, ever since the success of lara croft tomb raider making 275 million at the box office back in 2001 it has felt that hollywood has realised that the gamers buck is one worth chasing the only issue during that time is that good movies based on video games have been incredibly difficult to make while some  like resident evil and unchartered seem to have one people over  there have been a myriad of lovers that have been universally caned for either not capturing the game properly or even just being a bad film with that in mind you have to consider that nintendos move to make the super mario bros movie is a pretty brave one on one hand you have one of the most popular video game franchises which should ensure an audience for the film but the other hand that means there are a lot of gamers out there expecting perfection from this film and they already had one false start with the woeful 1993 film adaption of the games which only manage to save face because it has slowly become a cult favourite over the years directed by the team that brought us the brilliant teen titans go to the movies  aaron horvath and michael jelenic  the super mario bros movie begins in new york with mario voiced by chris pratt  the guardians of the galaxy and luigi charlie day  the lego movie trying to set up their own plumbing business  despite everybody including their parents telling them they should give up on the dream when a major sewer emergency suddenly occurs mario leaps into action deciding that this is the moment where the brothers can prove their worth however instead they find themselves sucked down a supernatural pipe and find themselves in a strange new land however while mario finds himself in the beautiful kingdom ruled by princess peach anya taylorjoy  the witch luigi finds himself in the badlands and soon a prisoner of the evil bowser jack black  school of rock who is planning on world domination even if that means crushing everyone in his way there is a lot to like about the super mario bros movie it is bright it is flashy and it has some pretty decent action sequences mixed in with humour but the film does have an obvious weakness  it feels like it is aimed at a younger market which might make some of the older games who have grown up playing the mario bros games feel a little awkward in the cinema to be honest there is a lot more to like about this film than what there is to dislike the story although thin does hold up and the screenplay written by matthew fogel minions the rise of gru brings in some really important lessons for the younger audience members plots revolving around things like never giving up on your dreams and always being their for your friends are never a bad thing to have in a movie there are also plenty of laughs to be had throughout the movie especially once mario meets up with donkey kong seth rogen  superbad and to be honest it is the relationship between those two that holds the audiences interest once the action pieces begin to become a little mundane one of the things that matthew fogel does need to be congratulated about though is the fact that he turns the story around a little this could have easily have become the stereotypical mario and luigi are sent to rescue the damsel in distress plot but instead fogel reimagines that with luigi being the character in danger princess peach becoming a kickass heroine determined to not only rescue him but to save her kingdom  it is a nice touch that works well by now you have probably heard the buzz online about the voice cast attached to the film while chris pratt and charlie day may not have been the ideal choices to voice mario and luigi they do an okay job with what they have been given to work with the big winners though in that department are seth rogen and jack black rogen takes the character of donkey kong and runs with it  not only does he have fun with it but it feels like he totally becomes the muchloved character likewise it seems that jack black was given free reign with the character of bowser and the result is something kind of special  with some songs thrown in to make use of blacks musical talents as well  is the super mario bros movie a great film no is it worth going to see yes while it is obvious that the movie is aimed for the younger gamers out there those older members of the audience that have grown up playing the games all their lives will find enough easter eggs throughout the film to keep them happy but they may find themselves wishing there was a little more to the plot at times one hot tip though  make sure you stick around to after the credits because one of those easter eggs hints at something pretty special for the sequel
Dec 19 2023,negative,scientifically designed in a lab for the broadest possible appeal and the least offense that could possibly be made
Dec 8 2023,positive, there were a lot of animated films this year while that seems to be the case every year this past decade 2023 has a lot of bigname titles and despite having caught up with most of the nonhollywood titles nimona suzume etc i needed to catch those others elemental last week mario tmnt and wish this week and theres still the boy and the heron robot dreams the monkey king and chicken run dawn of the nugget to go add the liveaction screeners to that list and it really is impossible to see them all were less than two weeks from the gwnyfca vote so ill be focusing on englishlanguage most since the group doesnt generally watch many foreign films then ill pivot to the international oscar submission before the ofcs voting window that starts 1124 theres always a strategy the order of watching does matter i only hope that searchlight hits my inbox with poor things and a24 hits my mailbox with the iron claw soon both open buffalo on 1221  two days after the nominations cutoff it really is wild that a major hollywood studio and multibilliondollar toy company allowed something like barbie to be made the selfawareness and selfparodying on display is of the sort that would normally be quashed via legal jargon in whatever contract director greta gerwig had to sign before starting to write the script with noah baumbach if that doesnt show you the power of sitting at the table whether it comes to box office take or oscar nominations i dont know what will gerwig took her clout and turned it into that rare productplacement tiein that actually has something valuable to say dont call the result a message movie though it never stands on a soapbox or demeans one side in order to champion another id honestly argue it could have done a lot more to skewer mattel executives with purpose rather than merely jokes it simply allows its characters to naturally evolve by way of providing necessary conflict because none of these dolls have ever faced that sort of existential crisis before theyve all maintained their pristine utopian forms in barbieland as they were passed from child to child so their innocence could become a personality trait so throwing a curveball like depression or fallibility proves to be a monumental adjustment youre going from zero a record loop of routine complacency to sixty questioning the very fabric of your reality in an instant no wonder it throws barbie margot robbie off enough that her body chemistry shifts give a perfect imaginary ideal a whiff of the cesspool that is human biology and everything falls apart because it also falls apart that fast for us one setback can spiral into years of torment that yoyoing ruins lives because we crave normalcy to start over to realize weve never actually begun thats too daunting to even consider whats ingenious about gerwig and baumbachs story say what you will about the whole but you cannot deny the best part of barbie outside its immaculate production design is its script is that they kill two birds with one stone via their conceit not only is the idea of barbieland being a literal manifestation of a childs imagination allow them to dig into a barbies potential to empower connecting each doll to the many youngsters who have indelible memories of them but it lets them comment on the ways in which the toys reductive nature in a patriarchal capitalistic world is problematic for those gains too barbie awakens to the fear and anxieties of being a woman in a mans world just as ken ryan gosling opens his eyes to the possibilities of having autonomy after a lifetime of always being relegated as the plusone we begin to see that neither end of the spectrum is perfect although we should all be able to agree that barbieland is much closer and that the real lesson is realizing empathy and originality is key and that its not always external forces that delude us into thinking conformity is better oftentimes our worst enemy in that regard is ourselves can dolls made real who bring back what they learned to their fictional existence teach that lesson alone no they get halfway with some wonderfully witty humor capped off by memorable turns from michael cera as allan and kate mckinnon as weird barbie but we need someone on the other side to complement and bolster that journey enter sasha ariana greenblatt and her mother gloria america ferreratwo women fighting for their place in a world that treats them like second class citizens two women who can educate the barbies about reality and reclaim a bit of magic by remembering what it means to dream the result is inspiring its also heartbreaking yes ferreras monologue is that good and hopefully turns her into a dark horse oscar pick for all the great things robbie and gosling are doing on a comedic level of committing to the bit their brilliance lies in the ability to also bring pathos to a narrative that never shies away from the complicated nature of listening to understanding and ultimately accepting anothers lived experience and desires because we all deserve to exist as our own person outside the shadows of utility ownership or conditions we all deserve the opportunity to love ourselves and have that be enough for those who dont understand that the walking dead is about the living monsters rather than the undead ones director taehwa eom and cowriter lee shinjis concrete utopia might be able to drive the point home why because the living monsters are the only ones available in their webtoon adaptation kim soongnyungs pleasant bullying the horde of murderous outsiders looking to take over apartment complex delegate yeongtaks lee byunghun home arent zombies theyre desperate men and women just like those inside the walls they simply werent lucky enough to reside within the only building spared from an apocalyptic earthquake so is it really a utopia or a fortress under siege are the inhabitants worthy of the comfort and security fate let them retain while the rest of the city freezes amidst the rubble or are they tyrants monopolizing their fortune and using delusions of grandeur as the chosen to steal and kill with impunity it truly is the same central question behind robert kirkman tony moore and charlie adlards comic books is rick grimes really any different than the governor or negan or whomever else his band of survivors happen across or is he merely benefiting from his position as our protagonist eom and lee deliver the end of days for these koreans and let us watch whether compassion or greed rules the day the residents coexist with the outsiders soon to devolve into the label cockroaches at first not necessarily by choice since they storm the doors out of necessity for shelter but well enough to be civil until a food shortage starts turning everyone feral suddenly its us vs them a residentonly meeting is called to vote on what to do and yeongtak becomes their unanimous leader after selflessly running into a fire to protect them all cue the inevitable evictions what follows is the usual chaos this archetype produces it didnt quite mark me as effectively as highrise or aniara but its slow descent into hell as tensions and betrayals mount is effective credit the de facto leads in minsung park seojoon and myunghwa park boyoung as a young couple that isnt quite as easily swayed to the side of cutthroat tyranny as most shes a nurse who wants to help from the beginning he doesnt but his conscience stays intact to ensure his many mistakes supply sufficient guilt will they be able to stop this outofcontrol locomotive once it gets going i wont spoil things by answering that question just know concrete utopia doesnt shy from the dark depravity we know the actions of ordinary people in such extraordinary circumstances will reach not that this choice isnt without complexity though eom and lee dont have a season or more to play with the duality of violent good and violent evil via separate factions with character development so they portray it through one man yeongtak lee byunghun is up to the task hes a very determined and very impassioned leader with a strong personality hiding his secrets hes hero and destroyer both how the film plays that conflict out isnt surprising in its overall arc or demand that we question whether loyalty and protection negates the opportunism and deceit that allows it to flourish the specific things that occur however can be quite shocking theres one moment towards the end that made me gasp as loudly as myunghwa despite being totally in character and believable in the moment you dont want to accept it you still want to give these people the benefit of the doubt because youd hope others would give it to you in the same situation sadly it doesnt take a long time looking outside the window onto our own turbulent reality to admit that these days the benefit of the doubt is a luxury few if any deserve despite the very sharp turn towards dissent that caused me to forget to even put gareth edwards the creator on my watchlist i found the film to be both exciting and affecting my favorite science fiction works are those that mine down from their high concept conceit to provide characterbased drama instead so where you might think this is a story about war between humans and ai its actually a potential redemption arc for a man who lost everything as a result of his fealty to a government wielding fear as a means to control its citizenry joshua john david washington had a choice though while the events of the prologue quick hits of humanity creating ai ai evolving into humanlike simulants and the inevitable rubicon crossing that was a nuclear blast in los angeles inspire him to fight for his species years undercover gave him an out tasked to follow maya gemma chan daughter of the socalled nirmata or creator of new asias free race of simulants joshua falls in love the two marry maya becomes pregnant and it seems all is well until an unprovoked attack reveals hes been playing both sides cue tragedy pain regret edwards and cowriter chris weitz flashforward five years to find joshua broken and alone when the real plot begins the us army led by allison janneys howell and ralph inesons andrews still wants to find the nirmatanow more than ever since intel says hes created a weapon that will give simulants an unequivocal victory so they recruit joshua to lead the mission back to his old stomping grounds they promise him he might even be able to reclaim what he lost what none of them could guess however is that hell actually get the opportunity to find even more how via a young simulant girl madeleine yuna voyless alphie the us calls her a weapon his old new asian allies including ken watanabes harun call her their savior joshua simply sees a means to an enda way to find maya again whether or not its just because shes a child his old rhetoric about simulants being programming gradually fades he feels something for her maybe its pity at first but it blossoms into respect and perhaps even acceptance because her innocence somehow renders her real in his eyes and watching humans try to kill her renders them into the monsters theyve always been the result is thus less about the dangers of artificial intelligence and more about americas growing lack of empathy for those it deems foreigners abroad and domestic alike its about our ease at projecting our own violence and aggression onto our victims in order to justify our increased vitriol towards them as if it was us who was harmed by their very existence the messaging and themes become closer to colonizers versus colonized its americans going to distant lands under the auspices of protecting home murdering with impunity and bloodlust in response to a tragedy they refuse to acknowledge their own complicity in igniting sound familiar so much talk tried to connect the creator to the hollywood strikes and the risks of ai displacing artists when its narrative more closely aligns with the current palestinian plight against the globallybacked zionist state of israel when do we finally recognize whats happening when the body in the crosshairs is no longer an adult we can imagine as the enemy the same happens here joshua has extenuating circumstances as far as not putting a bullet in alphies head straight away but her being a child quickly becomes as much a deterrent as the possibility that she might take him to maya ill leave why that duality means more in the context of the whole to the film itself since elaborating would create spoilers all ill say is that it hit me exactly how edwards and company hoped despite what i had read about it being a cold emotionless affair i will even disagree with comments about washington being an unfeeling protagonist too since this might be his most threedimensional and human performance yet add the gorgeous production design breathtaking special effects on a relatively tiny budget compared to its ilk and a pitchperfect ending and this thing is firing on all cylinders heres hoping more people watch it sans expectations to discover just how good it really is its a new beginning for mom jodie comer and dad joel fry their home is set in the heart of london and they have a baby on the way unfortunately this chapter starts for them just as another ends for the entire world relentless storms and flash floods become so destructive that i thought the beginning of mahalia belos the end we start from was a metaphoric hallucination about childbirth for its main character only after young zebs birth is crosscut with water crashing through a window do we realize its really happening london is gone adapted by alice birch from megan hunters novel the narrative moves to its logical next step a parents house luckily dads parents mark strong and nina sosanya are borderline survivalists living high above sealevel with a stronghold of provisions but even those must deplete at some point eventually those who were privileged enough to ride out the early chaos become the ones unprepared for what the world has become in the meantime the story shifts to one of protection delusion nightmare and fantasy some can push through others cannot belos film is slowmoving as a result what began with a rousing couple of scenes with some real electric drama settles into a series of ordeals that want to be more confrontational than they are actually shown to be more than once mom and dad get into a disagreement that ends with a jump cut to her having to fend for herself eventually she meets an ally in o katherine waterston another mother with a toddler and we follow them as they move between shelters and chase the pipe dream that is an island commune seeking to forget the past while building a future comer is very good in the lead its easy to underestimate the performance since the whole turns into a onewoman survivalist show for long stretches so while it feels like were just watching the same thing in different forms over again there is nuance if youre willing to look even so its the supporting characters that stick to your memory since their impact is more explosive waterston is fantasticespecially in her final scene strong too even benedict cumberbatch steals a moment via a brief cameo they each shape moms decisions to move forward by either allowing herself to look back or rejecting the urge those who can take something more from the themes of motherhood and separation will surely come away with a lot more to say and like about the overall film i personally found myself appreciating the journey more than taking anything away from what ultimately proves to be familiar tropes within the postapocalyptic genrealbeit much quieter and more introspective than usual its a solid story that looks and sounds great but i wouldnt be surprised to discover it works better on the page insofar as digging further to unearth the weight of emotion thats ravaging moms heart you cant really blame the filmmakers for going full fan service with the super mario bros movie i would have liked a story but loosely connected action setpieces within nintendos sprawling marioadjacent universe is still fun and thats what the young kids in its target pgrated demo want anyway because this isnt for nostalgic millennials and genxers this is an advertisement for new generations to board the bandwagon so we get a mushroom kingdom obstacle course complete with every powerup imaginable a battle royale with donkey kong mario kart race on the rainbow road dungeons water boards and even brooklyn with varying camera shifts to make the screen look like a sidescrolling platformer add a decent classic rock soundtrack some interesting remixes of the original score and a mostly passable voice cast and this low stakes romp excels at superficial entertainment does it also disappoint you bet especially on the level of being a real movie rather than episodic introduction with more loose ends is peach human then concrete mythology the whole multiverse angle has been played out too but  whatever thats the easiest way to juggle multiple stages the real headscratcher though is an end stinger that epitomizes this mixed results weirdness by teasing a character yoshi whose world they literally showed an hour beforehand two things love a reboot of a known property that doesnt default to origin story even if mutant mayhem is the origin story of the teenage mutant ninja turtles coexistence with humans it keeps their first fifteen years postooze a fun flashback montage and love that director jeff rowe producers seth rogen and evan goldberg and that trios other cowriters let the heroesinahalfshell be teens what a great young voiceacting cast to make it believable too the story itself is a nice entry point into this new tmnt world very reminiscent of the grunge animation popularized by the spiderverse films it introduces the idea of ooze throws a bunch of mutants that havent been in previous films onscreen and gives the leads a trial by fire confidence boost to prepare themselves for the fights ahead watch the credits for a shredder tease the action is slapsticky and kinetic with great choreography and the tone never falters in large part due to making april oneil ayo edebiri a teen too jackie chan as splinter and ice cube as the big bad superfly are both inspired choices and the needle drops are memorable give four non blondes their royalty check but i will say that the joke construction gets very grating rogen and company went heavy on the name dropping and pop culture references that seem to scream hey were hip in the kind of way aging dudes who arent hip anymore would i kept waiting for one of the turtles to actually turn to the camera and wink thats how cringey it became hopefully they can shore that up with the inevitable sequel a people duped into believing their once benevolent king still has their interests in mind despite falling prey to ego and avarice must rise to defeat him by following the one person able to see through the deception because of her selfless heart directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn along with screenwriters jennifer lee and allison moore pretty much deliver everything youd want from an old school disney filmcomplete with overthetop villain chris pine is having lots of fun as magnifico and talking animals and objects alan tudyk is great as valentino the goat but nothing beats the mushrooms its big on emotion and message yet very short on plot ariana deboses asha leads a rebellion of the soul to take back the wishes her neighbors volunteered to magnifico under the auspices that he was protecting them and not just hoarding them for loyalty once he loses himself to fear neither is necessarily a bad thing i would have liked better songs though since they range from catchy knowing what i know now to obvious this wish to mostly forgettable this is the thanks i get the real draw is the animation its like wish took 2d cell paintings and modeled them in 3d the backgrounds are simultaneously flat watercolors and 3drendered rooms with perspective depending on the cameras angle same with the clothing hair and faces the duality can be jarring at first but quite beautiful the more you sit with it moshfegh and oldroyd reach a point with the climax where the curtain must be lifted to show the scars this world has etched upon the bodies of those wed like to believe still maintain a semblance of innocence  full thoughts at hhys coon and kozak show that the star wars holiday special truly exists on an island alone as an unwitting cautionary tale never to be repeated again  full thoughts at the film stage scorsese understands he cant truly tell the osages story as a white man in a way that gives them the voice they deserve so he tells the tale of their oppressors instead and he does so with zero sympathy for even their most sympathetic members  full thoughts at hhys the result is entertaining and not without its dramatic reveals but while a good time was had i cant shake the sense that there was potential for so much more  full thoughts at hhys some of what results can be confusing but all of it is dramatically potent and its mostly due to a wonderful performance from zalopany  full thoughts at hhys
Sep 20 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is a dream come true for lifelong nintendo fans and perfect down to the last pixel with gorgeous animation and unforgettable music nintendo and illumination have made a delightful family film filled with heart
Aug 23 2023,positive, its the summer of 1983 and i am on my bicycle in the seminole high school parking lot having been summoned by fellow students for a business proposal they soon arrive at the prearranged rendezvous point and i follow them down 86th avenue to a singlefamily home on a culdesac in the bay harbor estates neighborhood i am taken to an upstairs bedroom  the walls of which are completely obscured by countless rush posters  where three computer whiz kids unveil their handiwork they have created a series of video games remember this is 1983 these games are barebones at best by todays standards they are hopelessly low tech visually crude and thematically derivative but for a bunch of high school kids in the early 1980s they are an absolute triumph that afternoon i became part of their ambitious cooperative they needed someone to create artwork for them so they could package the games and sell them in local computer stores over the next few weeks i delivered cover art for games such as popcorn and dim sammath the whiz kids found a business willing to add the games to their inventory on a trial basis we were on our way to entrepreneurial success even though i did contract work for an independent video game company it would be another five years before i finally bowed to peer pressure and started playing video games regularly sure i spent time watching friends play various games at aladdins castle  the preeminent shoppingmall arcade chain of the era  across from the movie theater at tyrone square mall i even joined in an occasional kings quest marathon at the home of another high school friend who owned an amiga and who coincidentally bore a striking resemblance to the kid on rushs power windows album my first video game addiction was super mario bros for the nintendo entertainment system except i quickly realized i wasnt any good at it so i moved on to other games such as the legend of zelda and metroid in terms of commercial success in the mid1980s super mario bros reigned supreme the classic 8bit sidescrolling platform game pitting mario and luigi against king koopa  later renamed bowser  sold more than 58 million copies worldwide it resurrected the flagging video game industry at the time and spawned a multimedia franchise that is still going strong almost 40 years later the most recent manifestation of that franchise is the new computeranimated feature film the super mario bros movie released in theaters april 5 by universal pictures directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic the film is a partnership between nintendo and illumination the computer animation studio behind films such as despicable me the secret life of pets and sing the super mario bros movie is exceptionally unexceptional for a film based upon a classic video game it delivers exactly what fans of the franchise expect without pushing any genre boundaries and without any serious attempt at innovation or improvement the target audience is twofold its action color and silliness will appeal to kids while adult fans of the franchise will enjoy all the nostalgic connotations it manages to tell a coherent albeit forgettable story with ample charm thrills and humor it is undeniably entertaining but it doesnt feel like it is likely to become a cherished component of a beloved media empire then again it is infinitely better than 1993s abysmal super mario bros not even dennis hopper could save the 1993 liveaction feature film based upon the nintendo game from insipid mediocrity the new adaptation is lighter more faithful to the source material and refreshingly familyfriendly the super mario bros movie follows brooklyn plumbers mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day when they find themselves mysteriously transported into a magical world separated mario meets toad keeganmichael key who warns him that his brother luigi is in the dark lands ruled by the evil koopa king bowser jack black mario seeks the help of princess peach anya taylorjoy ruler of the mushroom kingdom who is preparing for war with bowsers forces by seeking an alliance with kongs led by king cranky kong fred armisen and his son donkey kong seth rogen while most of the films voice actors dissolve into their characters with little eloquence or distinction blacks bowser and taylorjoys princess peach both stand out as solid examples of adding layers of complexity through outstanding performances blacks bowser may be a tyrannical bully but he is also a hopeless romantic taylorjoy delivers a princess who is the antithesis of the damsel in distress no need to overthink a pgrated playful predictable immersive adaptation of the muchloved video game the super mario bros movie is brimming with delicious eyecandy and evocative nostalgia yes it is formulaic but it doesnt really need to take many risks to charm audiences no pratt doesnt seem like the best choice to voice the protagonist but other members of the films cast more than make up for that weakness its fun its faithful to the franchise and it makes me want to break out my nes classic edition console and play the classic game
Aug 16 2023,positive,simple but effective for anyone who grew up with mario in their lives
Aug 8 2023,neutral, bakersfield calif kget  ten minutes into the super mario bros movie there will be an overwhelming desire to pull the plug on seeing the production there really is no reason to stick around and keep watching a  movie that only exists to promote nintendo games and toys after dungeons  dragons honor among thieves showed how cleverly a game could be adapted to the big screen there was hope for the efforts to do that with mario bros any chance of that happening fades quickly as directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic have opted to merely take sections of the video games and bind them together with a plot so thin you could read the instructions on a cereal box through it heres what to expect the majority of the movie is made up of sequences of mario or princess peach jumping from blocks to girders to floating items and then back to blocks and girders when this isnt happening the group speeds across the rainbow road on carts both are key elements of the video games and should be part of the movie there are just too many of the lifted moments in the film devoted to these scenes making a movie that is nothing but a bigscreen version of the game takes away the major element of what has made the mario bros games so popular  interactivity it is a lot more exciting to be guiding the colorful heroes through multiple gaming adventures than to be sitting back and passively watching the tales unfold the film opens with a television commercial featuring mario voiced by chris pratt and luigi charlie day pitching their new plumbing business they are speaking with very stereotypical italian accents this section exists to explain why the characters dont have an accent throughout the rest of the film and why plumbers wear white gloves the action picks up while they are trying to fix a water main break that threatens to wipe out brooklyn it seems like it would have been a better joke if they were trying to save flushing a neighborhood in queens mario and luigi are sucked into a magic pipe under the city that takes them to two different video game worlds luigi ends up in the dark lands and gets taken prisoner by power hungry  and lovesick  bowser jack black mario lands in the world ruled by princess peach anya taylorjoy where he tries to enlist her to help him save luigi she has her own problems as bowser plans to wipe out her kingdom that is as complicated as the script by matthew fogel the lego movie 2 the second part ever gets there is an obligation by the production team to keep in mind that there will be young audience members seeing the film it is the fact that they went to such a simplistic level with the story that it ended up with only a marginal amount of entertainment value efforts to appease older audience members include a soundtrack that along with a variety of versions of the mario bros theme music includes songs by acdc thunderstruck aha take on me and bonnie tyler holding out for a hero those are great songs but just dont fit the vibe of this production thats also the problem when it comes to the voice casting there was an explosion of negativity online when it was announced pratt was the voice of mario they were justified in their concerns as he doesnt have a distinct enough voice for the role day is much stronger as luigi taylorjoy is a topnotch performer but her voice is not her strength the star of the queens gambit and the menu has an expressive face that should always be seen in her work it is obvious that in an effort to appeal to a wide demographic the movie fails on all counts because of a weak script an over dependence on elements lifted directly from the video game and several voice casting mistakes it is game over very quickly with the super mario bros movie to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Jul 25 2023,positive, illumination entertainment isnt exactly an animation studio i appreciate that much from their animation style to their various movies made before this year i was never really convinced by the company especially when it comes to being able to make some of the best animated flicks of the year that said my expectations for the super mario bros movie remained incredibly high during all of these months of anticipation leading up to its release neither the divisive critics reception nor the permanent doubt surrounding the voice cast reduced the enormous excitement i had for this film and i was right to stay true to my feelings for those who have been following my writing for some time already you know that i always begin by trying to place any readers in my own shoes regardless of the type of film i argue that any critic should make this effort otherwise they risk losing the readers understanding its impossible to write something about the super mario bros movie without first explaining my connection to the source material in the case of this adaptation its not just a mario game but countless nintendo games characters and worlds ive noticed a more repetitive use of the expression remove the nostalgia glasses especially to bring down movies and in many cases invalidate and diminish more positive opinions the truth is that nostalgia is a term associated with the past but in my particular situation mario and nintendo are still in my present every year without exception my brothers and i pull the nintendo 64 out of our parents basement blow the dust off and spend hilariously unforgettable hours playing super smash bros mario kart and more in addition to this experience new games featuring mario and his friends continue to be developed and released for modern video game consoles therefore criticizing the super mario bros movie for being a film that heavily relies on the nostalgia factor is such a predictable cheap negative argument that for many viewers just wont make any sense another issue commonly associated with this type of adaptation is related to misleading expectations in my 29 years of life ive never played a mario game for its story not me not anyone because it was never a series with that purpose the super mario bros movie contains a generic formulaic story that brings absolutely nothing new to the world of animation the messages for kids are simple and fairly straightforward none of which will change anyones life the narrative structure follows the most obvious path without major surprises focusing on the typical adventure of an unexpected hero against a cliched villain with worlddomination motivations all of these are more than valid reasons for someone to not enjoy the movie my question is what did you expect directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic and screenwriter matthew fogel didnt deceive anyone delivering precisely what was asked of them an entertaining flick with characters and worlds that marked and continue to mark multiple generations bashing a movie as vehemently as ive seen critics doing when it accomplishes all that it promises is to say the least strange obviously no one expected a masterpiece and the super mario bros movie is far from being one but that was never its purpose the main mission was to please the target audience which as the box office numbers prove was more than successful claiming the super mario bros movie is generic is something that could be written even before watching the film like many other superficial easy criticisms thrown at an adaptation that at no time planned to be more than pure entertainment for children of all ages and families of all sizes as well as for all those who consider mario and nintendo important parts of their lives personally removing the nostalgia glasses means erasing a large part of my life past and present as well as my personality its simply not possible illuminations animation style turns out to be one of the highlights initial concerns are quickly forgotten due to the visual quality that surrounds the entire movie the worldbuilding is phenomenal with reference after reference to so many nintendo games worked into every frame but anyone who thinks these are forcibly thrown in the viewers faces is entirely wrong its all part of the narrative and the way they insert the various elements from the games is to be commended the super mario bros movie is undoubtedly a love letter to all of nintendos immersive playful worlds from action set pieces to leave viewers grinning from ear to ear  the donkey kong fight scene mario kart racing sequence blocksobstacles training montage  to the iconic music that brian tyler mixes brilliantly into his wonderful score the super mario bros movie left me astonished and sent chills all over my body during several moments especially in the more energetic second half this kind of humor is precisely what makes me laugh the most with marios classic expressions being used in quite a hilarious manner the cast was another aspect that resulted in division at the time of its announcement which is yet another thing ill never understand complaining about an actors casting before even knowing how they will play the character it doesnt make any sense and the truth is that the cast is even better than i expected personal favorites are charlie day as luigi and jack black as bowser but everyone delivers excellent performances anya taylorjoy has a lot of screen time as peach and proves to be up to the challenge and i dont understand why there was so much buzz around chris pratt the actor is perfectly decent as mario ignoring people who dont want the actors success for external reasons i understand those who might be disappointed that mario doesnt have that original recognizable voice from all four corners of the planet however one must be aware that mario was never a dialogueheavy character in the games mario rarely speaks expressing himself only through his overlystereotypical italian reactions i imagine that having to listen to this voice for an entire movie wouldnt be that pleasant as it could easily become insufferable therefore i believe the super mario bros movie made the right decision in the end to choose actors with normal voices to play all of the characters marios classic expressions are taken directly from the games so these moments wont be ruined in any way as mentioned before the story isnt a problem for me at all in fact i believe it has a lot more heart than many people have been conveying what did affect me were some pop music choices that left me baffled  i dont think they belong in the nintendo universe  and the first half has some pacing issues wasting too much time to get to where it needs to go by this time the super mario bros movie has already broken dozens of box office records and will become one of the most successful animation flicks ever made personally i couldnt be happier as the chances of watching other nintendo stories in the big screen have increased exponentially  ill be the first in line to see an adaptation of the legend of zelda may they continue to conquer audiences all over the world the super mario bros movie delivers everything i wanted packed with fantastic references that will warm the hearts of those who lived and still live with nintendo and mario up close along with energetic action dazzling animation and worldbuilding and iconic music  brian tylers score goes straight into my spotify playlist mario and co marked my childhood and still today continue to offer me wonderful memories for life as a viewer clearly belonging to the target audience i couldnt have left the cinema more joyful yahoo
Jul 25 2023,positive, maine usa  editors note this article is a critical analysis of a film and does not represent the views of news center maine but that of the author nintendo teamed up with illumination the animation studio behind despicable me to bring the popular video game franchise to life in theaters chris pratt stars as the titular character in the super mario bros movie much like the video games that started this massive franchise and helped put nintendo on the map the super mario bros movie starts off with mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day beginning their plumbing business in brooklyn  theyre optimistic and energetic but things dont seem to be going their way after a sewer pipe breaks while theyre trying to help repair a massive leak the brothers find themselves sucked into the world fans recognize as the mushroom kingdom  well mario ends up in the mushroom kingdom luigi appears in bowsers kingdom and is soon imprisoned by the giant evil turtle bowser jack black is moving across worlds destroying everything in his path on the way to the mushroom kingdom ruled by princess peach anya taylorjoy  mario meets toad keeganmichael key who introduces him to peach in hopes she can help him find luigi of course peach has her own crisis with bowser on his way so after giving mario a quick rundown on how powerups and platforms work in this strange world peach leaves with him and toad to find help  for decades this series has made its fortune and fame off a repeat formula bowser abducts peach and then mario and luigi rescue her  and the story here doesnt get any more creative than that  the pacing is a little awkward until donkey kong shows up injecting more fun and humor into the film of course with donkey kong comes the most enjoyable moments of the movie the kart racing previewed in the trailer along with all the chaos of the mario kart games from there the super mario bros movie becomes more entertaining the characters find their rhythm and the film transforms into a love letter sent directly to fans of the games  by far the best performance in the super mario bros movie comes from black who was the perfect casting for bowser fans worried about pratts mario impression can relax knowing he certainly does a serviceable job  illumination brought the movie to life with shiny and colorful worlds lifted straight from the games the animation is where this film excels along with a wonderful score and sound design thatll feel instantly familiar toagainfans of the games  and thats really what will determine how much viewers enjoy the super mario bros movie if folks grew up playing the games or still do and already treasure everything mario this is a mustsee movie for everyone else the mileage in their kart will vary 
Jul 22 2023,positive,phenomenal animation  short  simple too short if im honest chris pratt is honestly perfect as mario yes im as shocked as you jack black might steal the show as bowser but brian tylers score is so good
Jul 11 2023,negative, since its release the super mario bros movie directed by aaron horvath michael jelenic pierre leduc and fabien polack has assumed a divisive position in the modern zeitgeist critics were quick to lambast the feature while fans were equally as swift in lionizing it as a lifelong fan of mario having played nearly every game in the franchise i was curious about where my opinion would land i did not expect to disagree with both critics and fans the super mario bros movie is not terrible far from it it is a visually vibrant adventure that is also unexpectedly funny but its certainly not great its not even good strictly speaking screenwriter matthew fogel created derivative characters and a paperthin plot this fantasy action film is utterly generic a cinematic blank space that neither offends nor thrills brothers mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day are two plumbers living in brooklyn one day while attempting to fix a broken water main they are unwittingly transported to a fantastical realm in their descent through the magical portal the siblings are separated lugi lands in a lavaladen land filled with scary creatures mario ends up in the mushroom kingdom and must aid princess peach anyajoy taylor in her fight against the nefarious bowser jack black in order to get his brother back in commissioning illumination to produce the super mario bros movie nintendo inadvertently opened a pandoras box of americana in some aspects this was beneficial the animation is wonderful with a surfeit of resplendent candycolored environments further the voice acting is reasonably well done with black serving as a genuine revelation as bowser however some of the creative choices are inexplicably poor the decision to integrate commissioned music into the proceedings rather than relying fully on an orchestral score awkwardly distorts the experience while such a choice has worked for tonally irreverent movies like shrek it proves awkward in a film that while it has humor takes its story seriously on a certain level and yet the worst aspect by far is the hollow narrative the feature exists exclusively to satisfy an endless list of referential checkboxes for instance donkey kong shows up but his presence is wholly incidental to the plot another section is inconsequentially devoted to mario kart while tips of the hat are welcome and a few land with poignancy they are no substitution for an actual story illumination has contrived from the most visionary video game ever made something strictly superficial for their part fans have rhapsodized the dizzying volume of easter eggs as an indicator of quality but that is akin to considering the movie a success simply because mario is in it in fact the titular brothers are somewhat redundant in their own features luigi is mostly absent from the proceedings and mario is rendered superfluous by peachs unerring selfsufficiency ironically the one reference most vital to the video game is the one absent from the film mario never actually saves peach all of these elements when combined make the super mario bros movie a rather forgettable affair almost impossibly this is a flick without inspiration while the 1993 super mario bros is remembered for how laughably bad it was this 2023 adaptation though less egregious than its predecessor will barely be remembered at all now in theaters spiderman across the spiderverse directed by joaquim dos santos kemp powers and justin k thompson would be a great film if it now in theaters pixar is back with its first original story to hit theaters in a long time director peter sohn and writers john hoberg kat likkel and movies based on beloved gaming franchises are a hot trend in the entertainment industry due to the everincreasing popularity of video games we have a film threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information visit our full length privacy policy to get informed on our policies regarding the collection use and disclosure of information we receive from users
Jul 8 2023,positive, lets face it the majority of videogametofilm adaptations have been garbage the list of these adaptations read like the programme of the hell international film festival with house of the dead doom max payne and pixels which manages to ruin several games rather than just one all proving consoles and cinema dont always mix but when a new super mario movie was announced there was cautious optimism maybe it was because it would be an animated affair allowing the aesthetics of the beloved game franchise to translate to the big screen maybe it was the fact that sonic the hedgehog had shown that game adaptations could still be  if not worldbeating  fun maybe it was the knowledge that there is no way it could be as bad as the infamous 1993 liveaction film with bob hoskins in the lead role and dennis hopper playing a lizard given that 2023s the super mario bros movie is currently the highestgrossing video game adaptation of all time  and one of the highestgrossing animations of all time  it seems that the cautious optimism was founded brothers mario chris pratt who does a fine job albeit one where he is basically chris pratt and luigi charlie day prepare to strike out on their own with their own plumbing business in their native brooklyn but after a massive water leak threatens the city they find themselves transported to a mysterious new world and are promptly split up searching for his brother mario ends up at the colourful mushroom kingdom where he meets princess peach anna taylor joy who reveals that the evil bowser jack black  now in possession of a powerful super star  will destroy everything in his path to gain her hand in marriage the two head off to stop bowser and find luigi meeting donkey kong seth rogan and a whole host of others on the way some films trade in nostalgia this film trades it puts it in a bank account lets it accrue in value and then trades it in again for even more nostalgia from the very beginning the film is reference after reference to the franchise and related games a jump man console jump man being one of the original monikers of mario a punch out diner referring to the classic nintendo boxing game a sequence showing off marios athleticism which mirrors the classic first level of the original super mario bros game charles martinet the original voice of mario showing up twice with one of his roles as marios father and all that is in the first 10 minutes of the movie its manna from heaven or mushrooms from blocks for fans looking for nods to the games they grew up with one cant help feel that the nonstop fan service pushes some important elements  such as character development  out of the way compared to other animated movies that are entertaining and emotional the super mario bros movie sometimes feels a bit thin there are basic beats  marios desire to be taken seriously peachs search for belonging  but they are never really fully explored the film lurches from one setpiece to another without much time for reflection were never really told how this world  full of blocks that float in midair and mushrooms that give magic powers  has come into being or who the inhabitants really are thankfully those sequences are done really well capturing the exhilaration that one gets from playing the mario game a sense of freedom and discovery found in both the 2d and 3d games as well as the thrills and spills of mario kart with plenty of gorgeous visuals and plenty of sight gags the plentiful setpieces shine while perhaps not a richly satisfying as it could have been the super mario bros movie is still a barrel load of enormous fun that does the worlds most famous plumbers  and the video game pantheon  some much needed cinematic justice as mario would say woohoo images on vodzillaco are authorised and subject to restrictions permission is required for any further use beyond viewing on this site remote control icon created by bjoin andersson from noun project vodzillaco is partly funded through affiliate marketing which means that clicking some links on this page may generate income for the site however this is an independent publication we take care not to let commercial relationships dictate the editorial stance of content or the writing staff
Jul 3 2023,positive, happy fourth of july weekend wow cant believe were done with the first half of the year honestly june was such a blur and this recap is late as i went on a weekend getaway to my neighboring state ive lived in mn for 3 decades and for some reason never visited door county wisconsin it was a charming place and ill definitely be back one day probably in the fall season i wasnt planning to see this but got sent a screener via email so i decided to give it a watch im not at all familiar with the game so i definitely have no clue about any references made in the movie i do enjoy animated movies and though the visuals are great with astounding details and eyepopping colors the plot is pretty simple playful and ultimately predictable i remember people complaining about chris pratt whos not italian being cast to provide the voice for mario which i think is just absurd i think he did a pretty good job as did anya taylorjoy and charlie day overall though its pretty average and forgettable definitely not as innovative as other illumination studios but then again im far from being the target audience paris is always a good idea and that applies to the movies as well ive been wanting to see this for some time as i always enjoy romain duris in pretty much anything here he plays gustave eiffel in a mix of historical drama about the building of the famous eiffel tower and the forbidden romance between him and adrienne emma mackey in her frenchlanguage debut while i dont think it was the best idea to mix the two storylines duris and mackey have feverish sexual chemistry together ive since learned that the romance is highly fictionalized which is hardly surprising but the two actors sure look convincing as starcrossed lovers my biggest issue is with the editing which makes it so utterly confusing when things actually take place even with the use of super director martin bourboulons way of jumping back and forth between timelines isnt very seamless overall it was worth watching for the cast and im even more convinced mackey has that star quality just like her twin margot robbie i started watching this in midmay on a plane but didnt time it right so the flight landed before i could finish watching well i probably dont need to bother despite having big names like diane keaton william h macy richard gere and susan sarandon this talky movie wastes all of their talents playing unsympathetic characters the script couldve originated from a play which couldve worked better in that format but here it feels pointless and boring emma roberts and luke bracey who i learned was in netflixs holidate which i havent seen have absolutely no chemistry at all and i often find roberts to be annoying in romcoms ie little italy she certainly doesnt have that same winning charm as her famous auntie julia i think the only saving grace was the scenes between keaton and macy the only moment offering a semblance of warmth and humor i read a review that says that if the filmmakers were to film all of the cast members sitting around and talking about scenes from their previous movies which they collaborated on this wouldve been a more entertaining movie i couldnt agree more i dont know what compelled possessed me to watch this movie when it popped up on netflix i guess i was curious since i saw a clip of this very scene not too long ago without context the scene seems ravishing but cant say the same about the movie itself i had seen a few excellent good romcoms lately isnt it romantic always be my maybe rye lane among others but the wedding date is one that gives this genre such a bad name completely riddled with clichés implausible unfunny situations and an awful plot that puts a sour taste in your mouth i dont normally like to say a movie is rubbish especially one directed by a woman but this one is a real travesty boy debra messing and dermot mulroney deserve so much better oh not to mention the talented amy adams yikes avoid at all cost if you havent already this doc is fascinating to me as i grew up listening to david fosters music both my hubby and i are fans of his work foster is certainly a musical genius when it comes to composing and arranging music interviews with superstars like barbra streisand celine dion natalie cole michael bublé and josh groban offer interesting tidbits about his influence in the music industry dion bublé and groban whom foster discovered at age 17 undoubtedly owe their massive success to him having just seen the whitney houston biopic recently i was most curious to learn about fosters collaboration with her on the movie the bodyguard there are fun tidbits from clive davis as well on the project the soundtrack ends up winning record of the year for and the song i will always love you that foster rearranged went on to be 1 on the billboard chart for 14 weeks foster was also responsible for the innovative unforgettable virtual duet of natalie cole and her father nat king cole what i wasnt aware of since i dont follow frivolous celeb gossip is that foster was once married to the mothers of the kardashians and the jenners which apparently makes him more famous for being a reality tv star than for his music ahah thanks to elemental i was in the mood to revisit some of my favorite pixar movies boy its been ages since i saw walle and that movie still holds up amazingly well the environmental message is pretty potent but yet it doesnt feel preachy at all that one and the first toy story are definitely top tier pixar and delightfully rewatchable i finally finished the entire season of silo which is one of the best scifi series ive seen lately its such a great pairing with the hilarious mockumentary jury duty ill do a double review of both of these later this month but both are definitely worth watching so im continuing the 52 films by women challenge i started on international womens day a few years ago per women in film wif organization the basic rules are simple watch 52 films directed by women within the course of one year and share what you watched on social media using the hashtag 52filmsbywomen to spread the word and get more people talking about the women filmmakers that dont always get attention ill be doing a halfyear tally of this challenge later this month but im feeling optimistic i will complete all 52 movies by end of the year another strong month in june as i got to see five movies directedbywomen the colour room the mother past lives you hurt my feelings and the wedding date this was an easy clear winner of the month i have nothing more to add except to say go watch this film in the theater i sure hope this film will keep its traction all the way through award season next year because it so deserves sooo many nominations since i finished my home theater and havent traveled at all last month i watched quite a bit of movies and shows on netflix i watched arnolds new show fubar extraction 2 the mother and blood  gold only saw one movie in theater the new transformers rewatched 2001 a space odyssey xmen days of future past 3d avatar 2 3d and fast five im almost finish with picard season 3 on paramount once im done with that ill start on silo its so weird that ive only seen one movie in theater and its summer season but there arent that many movies in theater that im interested in ill probably see mission impossible 7 and thats it this summer ive been wanting to check out fubar is that worth watching im thinking of watching that in between jack ryan s4 i still havent seen the first extraction yet somehow just never muster enough interest silo is a good one ted and the ending makes you curious about the expanded dystopian universe the story is set in rebecca ferguson is amazing i see fubar is sort of an extension of true lies its a lot of fun and arnolds great in it but the real revelation is monica barbaro she and arnold had great chemistry and i hope she becomes a super star soon her character in top gun maverick phoenix was supposed to the lead had tony scott was still alive and made the film i watched the first two episodes of jack ryan s4 kind of boring so far hopefully the story gets moving soon i like that they finally introduced chavez i assume hell appear in the recently announced rainbow six film extraction is basically netflixs john wick and i think you enjoyed most of those those films right so youll probably like extraction other studios are still looking for their john wick so far only netflix found theirs ok yeah i was curious about fubar because of monica barbaro shes awesome in tg maverick boy she would make an intriguing lead if they had stuck to that script the first two eps of jack ryan 4 are slow but i wouldnt call it boring michael peñas casting is interesting so hes a prominent character in the books then sadly i dont think barbaro wouldve been cast as the lead in top gun 2 had they stuck with the original idea if i remember correctly jennifer lawrence was on the studios top list of actresses to be the lead yeah chavez is a regular character in the jack ryan and john clark novels he and john clark michael b jordan are the muscles to ryans brain in most of the novels ryan never took part in any of the action scenes its all clark and chavez really i somehow thought youre a fan of hemsworth since youre into thor right but if i remember ill write a review of extraction 2 after im back from my trip yeah i suppose barbaro didnt have star power ugh glad they went with cruise as the lead again jlaw wouldnt have been a good fit for it im looking forward to more chavez this season what do you think of michael peñas casting hes not someone i normally associate with action thrillers but maybe thats the point i like the thor movies mostly because of taikas direction hemsworth is only fun to watch in the mcu and maybe in the small comedic roles like the allfemale ghostbusters but im not fond of him generally i might give extraction a shot when im bored lol and yes please do write the review of the sequel when you have a chance thanks ted its cruise that stalled top gun 2 for years he didnt want to play a side character the project was announced in the late 2000s when cruise was in the middle of box office misfires he waited until he gained his box office power again before the went into production of course tony scott passed away and cruise became a box office powerhouse again im not a fan of michael peña casting hes way out of shape in the show i thought the actor that they cast in clear and present danger was the perfect chavez unfortunately he only appeared in one film hopefully michael peña gets in better shape for the rainbow six film lol for sure you wont be bore if you watch extraction ha ha im back home on sunday ill send the review to you sometime next week i kinda liked the wedding date just for how ridiculous it is  my pick of the month is spiderman  across the spiderverse as its just a grand work of art i have no interest in that david foster documentary as i saw clips of it and why would i waste my time watching some asshole sucking his own dick  i saw the clips comedians talk about and he comes off really smug  i read reviews where people trashed the fuck out of it and he is like hey look at all of the grammys ive won  im like oh wow who fucking cares  greatest music producer my ass  i can name 2030 who are better than him ahah i hear ya about david foster he is totally smug in the way he describes himself in the doc i kept saying to my hubby that this guy needs a huge dose of humility that explains the kind of women he married i mean the mothers of the kardashians and jenners produce the worst kind of people in our world today having seen the doc makes me want to learn more about clive davis now he seems like a much more gracious man on top of being a phenomenal producer and here is another thing  bruce jenner married elvis former girlfriend linda thompson and a had a few kids with her but he left her for kris and she was with foster for a few years  hollywood  what a shithole  film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Jul 1 2023,positive,this second bigscreen adaptation of the popular video game series after the illfated 1993 film is vibrantly colored speedilypaced and not too long and pleasantly diverting if rather unremarkable in the long run 
Jun 27 2023,neutral, the bridges at tokori 1955 while samuel fullers 1951 the steel helmet was the first hollywood film about the korean war and the 2022 jonathan majors starrer devotion was the most recent the bridges at tokori can count itself among the most commercially successful william holden yet to attempt to blow up the bridge on the river kwai that would come in 1957 here takes a crack at five such structures  he plays harry brubaker a wwii vet naval reservist and civilian lawyer whos incensed that hes been called back to active duty to fly fighter jets during the korean war his upcoming assignment involves destroying the titular bridges a dangerous mission he initially keeps hidden from his wife nancy grace kelly some of the speeches delivered by a wellmeaning rear admiral fredric march could stand to be less patronizing and the comic relief offered by mickey rooney as a quarrelsome flyer and robert strauss as a landing signal officer known as beer barrel only interferes but look closely and an antiwar message emerges  less jingoistic than many of the eras wwii flicks this one doesnt shy away from taking a dour look at the pointlessness of the conflict the excellent aerial and combat scenes earned this an academy award for best special effects with the film also picking up a nomination for best film editing beaten by an even bigger holden hit that year picnic the covenant 2023 the covenant is also known under its official title guy ritchies the covenant although i suppose a more accurate moniker might be guy ritchies the killing fields like that magnificent 1984 feature this one also centers on the relationship between an american in a wartorn foreign land and the local man who assists him unlike that earlier work though this one isnt based on a true story which means theres more maneuverability to include an actionpacked finale set toward the end of the war in afghanistan this centers on the relationship between master sergeant john kinley jake gyllenhaal and his afghan interpreter ahmed abdullah dar salim more bullheaded and independent than the other interpreters ahmed tests kinleys patience on more than one occasion yet when the taliban sets its sights on the pair their shared loyalty and mutual respect are what lead them to take turns saving each others life the second and superior of ritchies two 2023 releases the first was operation fortune ruse de guerre the covenant often plays like a peter berg picture minus the simpleminded nationalism eg the kingdom  while it generally steers clear of politics it does acknowledge via closing text and a few scene fragments americas failures when it comes to its afghan allies above all this is an actionlaced drama and it works just fine within these parameters with gyllenhaal and salim both delivering excellent performances in between several intense setpieces insidious 2011 while its long been time to call a moratorium on both hauntedhouse thrillers and

up and move out but when strange things start happening at their new abode they realize it wasnt the former house itself that was haunted rather than relying on gore director james wan and scripter leigh whannell manage to conjure some genuine tension by keeping characters and viewers offkilter for much of the running time but the film slips drastically with the introduction of two paranormal investigators angus sampson and whannell himself whose unfunny comic relief were not talking bill murray or kate mckinnon here disrupts the unsettling mood late arrival lin shaye is excellent as the two clods allknowing boss but her elaborate  and exceedingly daft  explanations regarding the otherworldly occurrences further deflate the project and the frantic finale is simply overkill and the

super mario bros movie 2023 well at least its better than that godawful liveaction bomb from 1993 the one that featured a bewildered dennis hopper as king koopa and its certainly a mustsee for present fans of the video game for nostalgists with fond memories of endless playing and for small children three factions certain to award it four stars without hesitation for most others however its an alarmingly flat endeavor that dutifully gets the job done and not much else its basically easter eggs the movie providing so much fan service and brand stamping that very little genuine wit or

roles of plumber siblings mario and luigi and princess peach chris pratt charlie day and anya taylorjoy are so colorless and bland that the filmmakers might as well have hired elon musk jeff bezos and

recover the magical map they stole and the evil genius david warner whos hoping to claim said map for himself gilliams films tend to be either aweinspiring or overbearing and this one manages to dip into both columns with some brilliant bouts of fancy occasionally undermined by inane overkill incidentally this was one of the first films produced by george harrisons handmade films which had

marijuanavan or when pedro explains that his undocumented relatives purposely called immigration so they could get a free ride across the border into mexico to attend a wedding rampart 2011 dave brown the corrupt cop at the center of rampart is described by one of his own daughters as a dinosaur  a classic racist a bigot a sexist a womanizer a chauvinist a misanthrope homophobic clearly why stop there hes also a bully a thief a murderer  and one of the most compelling cops seen on screen in some time dave brown is played by woody harrelson who earned a welldeserved oscar nomination for his supporting stint in writerdirector oren movermans 2009 drama the messenger whereas that film found harrelson playing a decent man grimly doing a dirty job  an army captain tasked with informing families of the deaths of their loved ones who were off fighting for god and country  this moverman movie finds him cast as an indecent man happily tackling a dirty job serving as a soldier his word in an effort to cleanse the los angeles jungle ditto with a reallife 1999 la police scandal serving as the backdrop rampart follows dave as his life begins a downward spiral caught on camera savagely beating a civilian and later involved in a highly questionable shooting that leaves a hispanic man dead dave becomes the poster child for everything thats wrong with the police force with a supporting cast that includes sigourney weaver steve buscemi and ice cube and a rare screenplay from la confidential novelist james ellroy that he cowrote with moverman rampart is more of a character study than any sort of crime procedural and its all the better for it let me preface by saying that i think that you are one of the best film critics writing today your depth of knowledge and breadth of appreciation both in decades and genres covered are massively appreciated my personal watchlist has grown tremendously by following your from the couch posts its one thing to talk about how politics inform decisions about which movies are made how those films are perceived then and now and how these politics reverberate through the storytelling for good or bad but no one cares about your politics its clear that you think your political positions are just humane and unimpeachable good for you but harping on these debatable positions in an otherwise cogent critique is obnoxious condescending and pedantic politics in the modern era is poisonous party candidate platform makes no difference in the lives of the vast majority of americans nothing ever changes for them except that things look more hopeless every year  real clear politics has been tracking direction of the country surveys since january 2009 in that time 2884 surveys have been conducted across a variety of polling organizations during this 14 year period the average percentage of americans who believe that the country is moving in the wrong direction is 61 only 22 polls have shown americans feeling positive about the direction of the country of those only 8 polls have shown positive feelings above 5     ripped from the headlines of today leftwing zealots who would corrupt the process in order to win the oval office zuckerbucks a corrupt career political hack who often acts like he has lost his mind completely to alzheimers we have plans to build a railroad from the pacific all the way across the indian ocean to pick one quote at random a liberal party that uses fear tactics decisiveness and corporate media stooges to keep a nation on edge if you had more people likely would have agreed with you although they and you would be dismissed as conspiracy theorists and you would be demonetized by the elites hi ignatz thanks for writing and thanks for the very kind words plus its always nice to hear from someone else who appreciates all manner of movies before film frenzy i spent the entirety of my decadeslong career as the film editor  critic at an alternative newsweekly i dont know how familiar you are with the alternative press  current and former weeklies and websites like the village voice the boston phoenix the stranger slant etc  but it is expected and encouraged heck maybe even required by some that their critics bring realworld politics history issues controversies etc into their arts coverage not just movies but literature theater music etc yes its a more irreverent and often inflammatory brand of criticism than whats offered in mainstream media although roger ebert was notorious for injecting leftist politics into some of his reviews and he won a pulitzer but its whats in my blood and movies dont exist in a vacuum instead reflecting the world around them even if their sociopolitical slants are usually unintentional a romantic comedy where the heroines best friend is a gay guy probably isnt trying to be political but just that inclusion makes it so after all do you think those gop monsters passing  supporting all those grotesque antilgbtq laws would include such a sympathetic homosexual character if they made a movie and if movies dont exist in a vacuum then neither can coverage  criticism of such be expected to do so kyle smith to name one gives me a headache with his political digs at liberals in his film reviews but thats his right and i wouldnt want him to change at any rate from a political standpoint theres no critic as obnoxious and foamingatthemouth not even me as one on the right armond white who compounds it by having often terrible taste who could forget that week in summer 2010 when he mercilessly trashed toy story 3 while raving profusely about jonah hex yikes hey thanks for the thoughtful reply i must confess i was unsure that you would reply i am used to writers and publications on the left simply shutting down conversations rather than engaging with someone who veers even slightly from the formally accepted narrative so thank you i grew up in la during the 70s and 80s and witnessed all that was on offer until i moved shortly after the turning of the new century i spent years reading the la reader and la weekly as a huge repertoire film and small venue music fan they were required reading i even worked for the la weekly for a few years as a couriermessenger shuttling print ads to and from advertisers i met a lot of great people i also met harlan ellison what a piece of work good writer though good times i was born very liberal but in recent years ive found that the left has become extremely illiberal also as i have grown i have learned that not all the values of the right are completely suspect i might have also been influenced by witnessing the brutal fall of portland oregon i had hoped to make that distinction in my comments politics and culture infuse all works that proport to examine the human experience what i was trying to call out was the gratuitous point scoring against political boogie men antivaxxers mask refuseniks maga americans it seems that despite the elite lefts love of all things nonbinary they are absolutely catholic in their approach to politics even if you acknowledge the miraculous boon from vaccines for small pox measles mumps etc even if you share that you and your children are fully vaccinated against these scourges the moment that you confess serious doubts about the covid jabs they are not vaccines and i refuse to call them that you are branded a backwards science denying troglodyte same thing if you say you know it appears that all the real scientific research suggests that wearing masks at best makes no difference and at worst poses serious heath risks same thing if you say i am all about equal rights for enthusiasts of all manner of human coupling but perhaps we should not race to irreversibly mutilate children who may just be experiencing the pangs and confusion of well being children no just by saying that i and people like me are declared irredeemably evil and the only right and good thing is to shut us down thats the feeling i get when you parenthetically take me down for a difference of opinion in a richard mathesonvincent price review is that really politics nuance packages left halfwrapped sentences that trail off a vague sense of moral ambiguity these are things of effective storytelling they can be richer still if the themes of politics human politics is worked into them what they do not need is pure partisan politics thats just propaganda dogma oh and i completely agree with you about armond white i am not convinced that he even likes movies i am even less convinced that he is a writer of any quality  if a critic uses their platform to issue political screeds with movies as a mere launch pad for their agendas id be sure to avoid that critic but to me a wellwritten wellreasoned reviewanalysis isnt spoiled by a few pointed political pokes of any stripe for the record ive always loved reading armond whites pieces back to his ny press days though he and i exist on near opposite ideological poles i cant imagine a review of michael moores movies or dinesh disouzas that didnt focus largely on their makers politics thats the entire point of their films of course any good critic is also going to focus on whether those movies work effectively as the agitprop they were clearly intended to be and a really astute review would try to zero in on whether their creators were bending the truth or in the case of disouza waterboarding it to death but even criticism of mindless escapist flicks destined for the summer multiplex could maybe do with more politics rather than less i was struck by author david sirotas take on the original ghostbusters as largely buying into the reaganite hatred of government with government employees portrayed as officious bureaucrats who are trying to lord their power over the heroic entrepreneurs granted this was a lightweight comedy that was likely not intended to advance any particular partisan agenda but it seems odd for critics not to interrogate the movies takenforgranted assumption that public servants are by definition the bad guy most works of art andor culture are a product of politics either conscious or unconscious it is a political statement in itself to not comment on politics or to avoid it as being inappropriate in a certain situation or to comment that someone is being too political in their writing politics is avoidable but at our peril
Jun 13 2023,neutral, after thirty years countless games and even a few films mario and luigi get the animated hollywood treatment with the super mario bros movie 2023 its evident right away that writer matthew fogel and directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic are huge fans of the property theyve adapted the super mario bros movie is packed to the gills with all of the characters major and minor kingdoms and power ups that fans of the beloved franchise could hope forfor better and for worse after a cold open in which bowser jack black attacks the penguin king to claim the ice kingdom the movie opens with struggling brooklyn brothers mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day trying to get their new plumbing business off the ground their family doesnt support them an ambitious but terrible and expensive tv promo isnt helping and their first gig ends in comically predictable disaster  all of these insecurities are fairly typical setup en route to a journey of discovery and selfactualization the inciting incident occurs when the stoplight coloured plumbers discover a secret pipe that warps them into a whole new world theyre separated en route with scaredycat luigi sucked off to the darklands where hes immediately captured by bowsers henchmen and imprisoned for the remainder of the film that leaves mario to go off on a heroes quest with his new selfproclaimed best friend toad keeganmichael key and princess peach anya taylorjoy the latters mushroom kingdom is under threat from bowser because the turtle king is determined to marry her and conquer her land in equal measure  from there its a race  sometimes literally  against time to prepare for war the intrepid trio must travel to the jungle kingdom to recruit an army from its fickle leader cranky kong fred armisen and his warrior son donkey kong seth rogan who doesnt lack for vanity or hubris the resulting arenastyle battle between mario and donkey kong is appropriately epic and highly enjoyable if only because it best exemplifies the films capacity to balance its action comedy and nostalgia in equal measure  other notable sequences include a mario kartstyle chase on rainbow road and a final battle set aboard bowsers floating castleship the former is curiously stilted and lifeless while the latter is so frenetic it feels like the visual embodiment of adderall  both contain amusing moments and tips of the hat to the games extensive mythology but theyre also reflective of the films weakness the super mario bros movie is too desperate to pack in game references combine this with the films breakneck pace and the whole enterprise feels entirely too frenetic and amped up there are barely any moments of levity where the characters or the audience can simply catch their breath and enjoy the experience the film operates at a 10 the whole time the speed of the narrative combined with its short runtime and the humours emphasis on physical pratfalls and slowmotion confirms that this is a property aimed predominantly at children thats not a bad thing but it differs from most contemporary animation which appeals equally to kids and parents 
Jun 3 2023,negative,if you are a parent or guardian dragged to see the super mario bros movie be like lumalee and abandon yourself to a nightmarish experience
May 23 2023,negative, video game adaptations are having a bit of a moment in the last few years weve seen beloved franchises brought to the big screen with irreverent flair in detective pikachu and the sonic movies weve seen actionpacked scifi worlds hit the small screen with impressive scale in showtimes halo series most notably earlier this year hbos the last of us gave us the first prestige tv series adapted from a popular game not to mention a few forgettable empty action vehicles along the way uncharted theres even a tetris movie out right now yes fine that ones a drama about the making of the game but i just wanted to include it okay enter the super mario bros movie based on nintendos smashhit game sensation the 3d animated adventure brings our favourite floatingbox jumping goldcoincollecting plumbers to life directors aaron horvath and michael jelenics film follows the fantastical origin story of brothers mario chris pratt whose voice thankfully doesnt attract too much attention to itself and luigi the far more capable voice actor charlie day who should be the lead of this movie but more on that later we open in brooklyn new york where mario and luigi are actual plumbers who actually call themselves the super mario bros having opened their own plumbing business the two struggle to make a name for themselves this quieter nycbased opening leg of the film is dangerously at risk of being more interesting and enjoyable than any of the magical fantasy stuff that follows the misadventures of two wacky sincere plumbers trying to be taken seriously in the big city give me that movie while trying to fix a burst pipe under the streets of brooklyn true to the game our two italian plumber protagonists discover a secret gateway to a magical world where they must defeat the evil turtlebadguyleader bowser jack black whos threatening to take over the place seriously who first came up with this stuff what were they smoking and where can i get some right on queue as if the movie was preempting my question mario lands in the mushroom kingdom but hes been separated from luigi who got lost on the way and landed up in bowsers territory to save his brother mario must find princess peach anya taylorjoy to help him rescue luigi and defeat the evil bowser theres no lack of visual flair in the super mario bros movie the vibrant colour the familiar whimsical world full of floating blocks powerups and secret tunnels it also has the right level of kinetic energy to keep things constantly in motion jumping from one gag andor action sequence to another but its far less imaginative and encouraging on paper everything that takes place between the initial setup to the mostly fun final battle which takes us from a mario kart race to a climactic fight on the street of new york plods along with little personality we get mario and princess peach going on an adventure across different landscapes made up of shoddy worldbuilding that can only be described as blurrynondescriptmuchwowmagicalstuff while the pointlessness of a tired 30yearold film critic writing about a harmless cosy kids movie isnt lost on me  we also happen to live in the golden age of kids movies that are just as appealing to adults granted the super mario bros movie was never going to have the heartbreaking sincerity and emotional ambition of a pixar film but what it is missing is the zany selfaware comedy that has made the madeforchildren genre so enjoyable in recent years we live in a postshrek world in the twenty years since our favourite ogre dreamworks animation has given us the likes of madagascar kung fu panda the croods the delightful and sorely underrated gem that is monsters vs aliens and a whole lot more even illumination entertainment the studio behind this marios movie has mastered the art of funny fuzzy feelgood flicks with the despicable me and minions movies but we see none of that here the super mario bros movie is lifelessly low on laughs in its staunch refusal to poke fun at its inherently ridiculous world writer matthew fogels script is desperately in need of what hollywood calls a punchup  getting comedy writers in to funny up the proceedings and theres so much untapped comedic potential here with many inherently funny ideas that are lightly danced around but barely explored fred armisen as the lovably theatrical leader of the apes seth rogan as the selfobsessed showboaty donkey kong keeganmichael key as the wonderfully weird desperateforcompany toad or the fact that what the evil bowser wants most is to have a fairytale wedding with princess peach for what its worth i do appreciate the films attempt at making the princess a badass warrior with plenty of her own asskicking to do rather than just another damsel in need of saving instead the damsel duties here are awarded to luigi hes the far more interesting endearing character with the more touching arc  stumbling constantly nervous plagued by fear and forever relying on his brother to back him up that is until hes forced to rise to the occasion and find his courage but here hes sidelined by his blander more uninteresting brother i cant believe i have a hot take on the the super mario bros movie of all things send help a harmless generic blur of kids content i hate that word but it feels painfully apt here the super mario bros movie isnt one to enjoy with your kids as much as it is one youre forced to sit through because of them do children not deserve better than a 90minute blur of cotton candy action i guess the bajillion dollars this movie will no doubt do at the box office suggests otherwise
May 20 2023,positive, as we get ready to officially kick off the summer months its worth asking what good movies there are to watch in theaters and at home while its easy to know about the latest marvel film its sometimes hard to really dig into the wide array of movies past and present we here at for the win want to give you a weekly opportunity to get 10 quick movie recommendations of movies that have just come out and movies that came out long ago you might like our suggestions and you might scroll right past them all the same we hope that you find something on this list that piques your interest blackberry made me want to run through a wall and scream about the beauty of movies for adults until i was hoarse this really is one of the years best movies its truly the canadian spin on the social network so you know theyre going to nail the ah no shouldnt have done that pal parts better than we did this is an electric cocktail of christopher nolan mindbending and troublemaker studios exploitation ridiculousness youve had this concoction in better forms but the ice cubes light up in this drink and there is sugar on the rim ben affleck knows exactly what kind of movie hes in one that just relishes in trying to pull out the rug from under you every 510 minutes this one just moves without much concern for spending too much time on an exposition dump even if that is like half of the dialogue the other half is just affleck and the cast quipping wise with each other and giving each other tough guy looks you cant really say this film isnt riffing on better movies because it absolutely is but its still got a silly streak thats really exciting its a film untethered to anything but whatever would be the next insane twist you couldnt see coming robert rodriguez still knows how to give the audience a good time and hes in enough control of the material here to make it stick the opening bank heist is as good as advertised with real explosions real explosions i had a great time with this you have to be willing to suspend your disbelief a bit and embrace the corniness of the dialogue but rodriguez knows what hes doing he always has its rough around the edges but dang it it still tastes great even if its just a diy imitation of whats come before guardians of the galaxy vol 3 is going to have the same effect on todays kids that indiana jones and the temple of doom had on kids in the 80s and i mean that as the highest compliment if james gunn really is the heir apparent to tim burton this is his edward scissorhands and his batman returns all rolled up into one big messy heartwrenching hug from a rocket raccoon also this is chris pratts best performance since parks and recreation all about this movie the rare biographical documentary that seeks to understand the subject rather than showcase them it makes smart decisions with how to tell blumes story and the stylistic flourishes dont distract in the slightest the interviews are all worthwhile and the modern ties feel relevant and urgent i was quite impressed by this im glad mrs blume got the quality documentary she deserved its basically a gen z spin on stanley kubricks the killing its a much more complicated film than it might seem and its all the better for it this is one of 2023s best taron egerton is a darn movie star even if by textbook definition hes not this is just a good midbudget adult drama about an optimistic american entrepreneur racing against the clock and against the ussr and shady business guys to win a tetris contract so its miracle with video games rights which heck yeah man it might be a wee bit too cutesy for its own good but its also a stunning testament to just picking a good story not a lot of people know about and telling it seriously with a imaginative director a rocksteady script and reliable actors its a darn good time at the movies on my tv harmless it amounts to a burger king kids meal and night of nintendo 64 im not sure illumination will ever take one single risk but i do think their cheery colorsplosion style for 7yearolds works for a movie about super mario bros jack black is really the only voice actor who goes the full mile even if i think chris pratt is doing more than youd expect i had much more fun watching this than i am thinking about it but im not going to sit here and act like i didnt take that 90whatever minutes i spent in this and put it into a nintendo switch for my house am i stooge for commercial intent sure but i also had fun playing mario kart for the first time since college so whos the real loser exquisite filmmaking were all going to die one day and your spouse is quite literally one of the only things you can cling to while youre here to grapple with that mortality the secret to a happy marriage going to italy and being pushed to the brink of divorce and then at the last minute finally realizing that a small conversation about how you actually feel wouldve solved everything years ago its only fitting that chris pratt honors his place among the schwarzeneggers by doing the kind of scifi action movie arnold wouldve done in the 90s is pratt miscast here sure but so was arnold in kindergarten cop being miscast is okay if you kind of know youre miscast and pratt is good enough to realize that and just do his thing anyway this isnt a great movie but its a pretty good one its got some really intriguing ingredients the aliens the plot the family dynamic but its also never compelling enough to really make that leap into the next echelon however its technically original and its trying to go for some grander emotional beats chris mckay is a solid liveaction director and while i preferred renfield to this i dont think he missed the mark at all some of the alien fight sequences are pretty engaging and much more cerebral than your typical transformers fight i didnt see this two years ago because i heard it wasnt good and now i kind of wish id watched it then its solid id watch another tomorrow war i wouldnt want to be in a tomorrow war and maybe thats the most effective thing about it its good enough at the world building and the action that its worth your time holes still rocks all these years later its thorny emotionally resonant young adult storytelling with a good filmmaker behind the wheel and a deep cast we really didnt know how good we used to have it
May 17 2023,positive, the gist we get the ball rolling in another world or dimension or something where we meet bowser jack black a very large imperialist turtle who enslaves a race of small penguins and conquersdestroys their icy lands and then he finds a  box and smashes it and takes control of the super star inside of it which is this movies macguffin cut to modernday brooklyn where plumber brothers mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day have just launched their own business with a tv commercial that makes the ghostbusters ad look like la dolce vita but it works because they get their first call and rush out to fix the leak their sidescrolling journey accompanied by slayer guitarist kerry kings shredding guest solo on the beastie boys no sleep till brooklyn proof that what was edgy and cool several decades ago will eventually be tamed by the popcultural blandification machine and assimilated into the deathless nostalgia borg and pad the musical artists bank accounts with passive income not only do our guys wrestle with persnickety pipes but they have an encounter with an aggressive dog a sequence that has nothing to do with anything whatsoever but hey at least we have something amusing to look at with the bright colors and goofy characters and zany action right  then mario and luigi go home theyre two adult men still living with their parents and everyone doubts their ability to maintain reasonable selfemployment here we learn that mario thinks mushrooms are yucky and wont eat them which is what you call an inside joke suddenly an opportunity for our boys to prove themselves pops up when a brooklyn water main breaks and they rush off to help  but they end up being sucked into a magic pipe and deposited into a strange world chockfull of spinoffable intellectual property luigi finds himself in the dark land where bowsers minions scoop him up and imprison him mario drops into the mushroom kingdom where he meets a little weird guy named toad keeganmichael key who takes him to his leader princess peach anya taylorjoy whos shocked to see another human in what exactly is this place called anyway mario world it cant be not yet because ive just realized this movie is insert deep sigh here an origin story i digress mario wants to find luigi which dovetails with peachs desire to vanquish bowser before he lays waste to the peaceful and benign mushroom kingdom but first she has to train mario in the art of platform gaming which involves leaping on little blocks and ducking under things that wallop you and busting  blocks that give you extra powers and all that she zooms through the training course  in heels even  licketysplit while mario trialanderrors his way through it failing and starting over and failing and starting over and failing and starting over like hes in a a what do you call it time loop is that right maybe not anyway before they face bowser peach determines that they need to get help from the kongs a conglomeration of apes who include cranky fred armisen donkey seth rogen and diddy although the latter only makes a brief cameo and is probably being saved for the sequel and then comes the super smash bros part and then the mario kart part and then the big boss battle which occurs during bowsers attempt to force peach into marrying him meanwhile where the hell is yoshi i could answer that but you know no spoilers what movies will it remind you of is it sacrilege to say wreckit ralph kind of its definitely sacrilege to say wreckit ralph is the better movie but the truth cares not for context  memorable dialogue praising the mario bros tv ad luigi makes a probably unintentional thoudostprotesttoomuch metajoke about the movie itself that is not a commercial that is cinema our take allow me to push past the mario movies obvious crowdpleasing nature and cheery escapism for some typical filmcritic pedantry this thing feels like it was written by a calculator its less a screenplay and more of a loose outline a list of interfranchise references strung together by the flimsiest of plots and hitsofthe80s needle drops theres a nod to an old tv cartoon theres a recognizable character making a cameo theres holding out for a hero theres some action inspired by one of the video games and hey is that seth rogens voice i hear it dashes along licketysplit and only slows down for a brief intermission in which blackasbowserbutmostlyasblack croons a torch song for princess peach which is one of the movies rare moments of inspired comedy its all so transparently mechanical in its structure and thats the issue with longstanding franchisesslashintellectual property  it once was the product of inspiration now its just a product  but its easy to be of two minds about the movie because its lively expertly animated energetic lightly amusing and modestly ambitious if theres anything resembling a message here maybe its the portrait of mario as a man of perseverance although youve already learned that lesson if youve been tempted to wing your 80 joycon through the window after being killed by bouldergeist for the 116th time in a row nobodys trying to change the world here or invoke the tragedy of the human condition its not pixar its the company behind minions delivering a bullseye for eightyearolds who will giggle and whoop for 92 minutes then go home snug their plush shy guy in the crick of their arm pick up the nintendo controller and launch a campaign to spend 60 of their parents money for a new game its perfectly fine with adhering to the relentlessjokefactorywithcelebvoices formula and executing it for maximum appeal as for the controversy over pratt voicing mario  did you really want to hear an obnoxious fauxitalian stereotype voice itsameing in your face for 92 minutes that was the smartest calculation of all our call stream it the super mario bros movie is entirely acceptable family entertainment it also leaves plenty of room for improvement when the inevitable sequels spinoffs and series are launched in a quest for the next billion dollars 
May 8 2023,positive,i think it did a good job of appealing to both older and younger fans of the mario video game franchise it hit all of the points and gave you all the ip that a viewer could have wanted thats why its such a huge hit
May 8 2023,negative,i didnt have high expectations but do feel like it could have gone a bit deeper beyond eye candy and easter eggs however it is enjoyable as a kids movie meant to hit all expected illumination tropes 
May 4 2023,positive, everything fans complained about sonic the hedgehog 2020 not having is on full display in the new universalillumination movie the super mario bros movie 2023 but if youre not a fan of the video game series theres not much left for you the first 15 minutes establish mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day as loveable lugs with big hearts who want to do the right thing at the expense of common sense and property damage the mario brothers have left their former employment of the wrecking crew to branch out on their own as plumbers in brooklyn their new commercial has aired and its as cringeworthy as you could imagine but in that fun way that says we know their first official call certainly doesnt make them any friends but sets up some basic gameplay such as jumping to avoid obstacles and the brothers helping each other out when the city experiences an unexplained water main break mario and luigi leap into action and insert themselves into a situation being mishandled by dps shortly they find themselves inexplicably sucked through sublevel tunnels and the brothers are separated into different parts of the same world luigi the lesser brave of the two has been sucked to the koopa kingdom ruled by a giant spikey turtle named bowser jack black mario lands in the mushroom kingdom a place full of toadsmushroom people kinopios whatever your mariokink and ruled by princess peach anya taylorjoy a human this is briefly explained later mario implores princess peach to help him save his brother and she needs him to save their kingdom from bowser bowser has recently come into possession of a super star that will help him defeat the mushroom kingdom and marry his crush princess peach no one wants this with me its a lot if youve never played or are expecting something different but on the surface despite the paperthin story no deeper than the cut scenes normally seen in video games its not terrible our heroes have to make alliances gather an army and defeat the boss there are powerups jumping running while battling kongs penguins koopa troopas and shy guys if it was an npc nonplayable character youre probably going to see it for a movie aimed at kids a lot of people are threatened with open murder perhaps this is part of regular gameplay and maybe im overreacting but it was jarring in a movie so big and bright oh there is a fatalistic blue luma lumalee juliet jelenic who due to its longterm incarceration over lava is either terribly pragmatic or quite insane if there is a sequel heres hoping we get more on that backstory because holy toledo keep that one clear of sharp objects the super mario bros movie is beautiful and illumination never fails to bring spectacular animations and eyepopping imagery to its films its as immersive an experience as you can get in 2d and the action is smooth and engaging if youre a fan of walkthroughs on godmode this is definitely the movie to see it really is like watching a skilled player work through the levels that said super mario bros is light on actual plot and story and most of the humor is only really funny if youre 10 because the super mario bros movie spans several storylines across 20 games fans will find easter eggs throughout i am not a player so i cannot point them out but if you take a gamer you may hear occasional squeals of delight for how its presented which is honestly nothing more than promised the super mario bros movie might be a worthy way to spend an afternoon the super mario bros movie 2023 is rated pg for videogame action and violence such as getting repeatedly punched in the face tumbling off rainbows violent cart demolitions explosions dangerous romantic obsessions and the forced captivity of penguins
May 3 2023,positive,the movie accomplishes the main goal of being entertaining for the whole family  not super but definetfly its a go full review in spanish
May 1 2023,negative, the super mario bros movie is now playing in theaters to packed audiences its animation and based on the popular 80s video game of two brothers mario voiced by chris pratt and luige charlie day from the nintendo game corporation in japan wow the film is colorful and eyepopping especially with the rainbow speedway track although i cant recommend the movie as its too dark in tone for kids and has way too much violence id say skip it in theaters  mario bros unfortunately borrowed guy ritchies playbook from his disaster of a movie aladdin yep theres torture in  mario bros just as in aladdin it mirrors electric shocking toad until princess peach anya taylorjoy agrees to marry bowser jack black or king koopad just as the sultan ruler of agrabah princess jasmines father is tortured until she agrees to marry jarfar physical bullying to get your way is never okay hmmwhat does that teach kids ill tell youit teaches kids to bully to get their way nope not on my watch
Apr 28 2023,positive, i respect an actor or actress putting it all on the line for a role even if its just sitting on a chair naked while it helped that alison brie is a nudistfavoring lady in real life playing one on screen and showing it all for the rewindable world to see is quite a feat  thats the part that will grab the attention of most movie lovers when they scroll across somebody i used to know on amazon prime dave francos latest follows through on many methods used in the julia roberts favorite my best friends wedding in fact a character here actually references that movie to bries ally in the movie when it comes to stealing her fiancé jay ellis top gun maverick ally and him have history the kind that can ruin weddings hinthint etc  thats the hook of francos film who once again has chosen to point his cinematic lens towards his longtime wife brie they couldnt deny the fact that theres a lot of them in this movie having written it together with the lead characters name being the name of the actress playing her and the nudist link the director and star are giving us a glimpse anyone not see that hilarious full monty sprint down the hotel hallway from brie  the relatable ties work for the film and also against it in spots if somebody i used to know has a weakness to contend with its witty dialogue and free spirit cast work its a predictable thread that becomes apparent halfway through its memorable from other movies moments that hit the nail too straight on the head instead of standing out more like his recent film the rental francos latest disappears into that late night streaming service pile of goods brie kiersey clemons hearts beat loud danny pudi haley joel osment and the always good julie hargerty enliven the material pudi and brie played together on community making their dialogue exchanges ping and pong naturally osment gets to unplug a little here ironically in the shoes of a character who likes to make constant movie references and puns it speaks to my heart actually serviceable in a general way with some intuitive parts somebody i used to know isnt a bad way to spend your time but i think there was something more there stay until the very end for proof that franco didnt just ask his lovely partner in crime to embrace her inner nudist that ones for parents after the kids go to sleep or into their games and controllers the next one is what you do a few hours earlier on a weekend take the family to see the super mario bros movie thankfully improving on the atrocious live action take from the 1990sless said the betterthe animated adventure film is a nice 90minute diversion the adults who once were kids and loved this game will get a kick out of this muchbetter game adaptation their kids will like it too  were in easytoplease territory here with onthenose voice choices of chris pratt and charlie day as our principal heroes the additional pleasures of seth rogens laugh and anya taylorjoys princess peach round out an impressive voice cast for the record keeganmichael key could show up in anything physically or even just a voice and be great that continues here there wasnt a real urge to rush out and see this one when it came out two weeks ago but my arm didnt need to be twisted when little buffa asked to see it watching movies with your son especially in the speedoflight time warp we seem to be stuck in these days is a thumbs up experience before the movie even begins  he loved the super mario bros movie i thought it was fine there were a boatload of game references he caught that flew over my head by last night the wife and vinny were playing take a guess super mario bros on nintendo movies and their effect its a real thing also pratt has to be printing money at the moment good for him having arnold schwarzenegger as a fatherinlaw cant be easy  cinderella man is still a classic film wrongly released in the summer why dont you hear more about ron howards underrated 59 on rt true story boxing drama it came out in june amongst a sea of blockbuster dummies got torn up by critics and reminded people of the not so great depression making max baer more of an antagonist for jim braddock was a risky move but it worked with the dreary backdrop russell crowe renee zellweger and paul giamatti are absolutely phenomenal too the power of release dates  bob odenkirk joining fxxs the bear for season two is excellent news no matter who he plays the better call saul master player will elevate one of the best television shows to come along in a good while succession and barry are rhythmic sensations but christopher storers raw and lucid kitchen drama is something else odenkirk will only enhance the goodness give this man good writing and its like watching a delicious cocktail being mixed in real time heres the thing about the flash and all the spoilers rolling out on twitter after the first screening at cinema con this week dont act surprised if you show people a movie that isnt coming out for seven weeks and release them to their smartphones plot twists and points are being distributed quietly warner brothers loves this the ezra millerled superhero film needs all the good vibes it can

wiser batman 
Apr 27 2023,positive, after his onetime rival sonic became a box office hit it seemed inevitable that nintendo mascot mario would get his own movie illumination the animation studio behind minions will be hoping this animated adaptation fares better than the 1993 live action disaster with bob hoskins taking inspiration from 40 plus years of gaming history the super mario bros movie centres on mario and luigi voiced by chris pratt and charlie day the brooklyn plumbers embark onwhat seems like a routine job only for luigi to be sucked into another realm known as the mushroom kingdom mario arrives soon after learning that luigi has been kidnapped by bowser jack black the maniacal leader of the koopa army teaming up with princess peach anya taylorjoy he must fight bowser to save the kingdom and his sibling the casting of pratt as the traditionally italian character was controversial but the film builds in a reason for his american accent while still throwing in the odd lets ago along the way this will no doubt enrage purists but  this wacky quest is aiming to please audiences born after mario had already become a console favourite the colourful creaturefilled world of mario is perfect for the animation genre with potential for numerous spinoffs and sequels but the script plays it safe with an unsurprising 90 minute romp whether its racing down rainbow roads or facing haunted mansions there are lots of nostalgic moments that will make gamers smile it doesnt elevate the subject matter but the target audience of families on easter holidays wont mind  pratt makes for a dependable lead who allows his supporting players to do a lot of the heavy lifting taylorjoys peach is a tough leader who stands beside mario against blacks villain who is surprisingly menacing the alwaysentertaining keegan michael key as sidekick toad and the unmistakable tones of seth rogen as donkey kong both give well known characters a fresh coat of paint  its a shame days luigi isnt featured as much given hes fun than his costar the super mario bros movie is ultimately a film intended for kids and in that regard it provides enough laughsto make this another success for illumination older fans might be disappointed in the surfacelevel storytelling but its hard not to smile at the affection shown for the games legacy
Apr 26 2023,positive, everyone is familiar with super mario bros in some capacity so its no surprise the super mario bros movie is banking at the box office itsa time to dig into all the discussion surrounding this one right here with your friends at mam
Apr 24 2023,positive, if you didnt have a nintendo game boy with super mario brothers or tetris automatically installed you were not one of the cool kids  andbefore that you had to hit the video arcade and play hoping you didnt run out of change before beating your own record or someone elses  in the world of video games you were your own personal hero  so when illumination studios announced they were bringing super mario brothers to the big screen this girl over here was beside herself while working underground to fix a water main brooklyn plumbers mario chris pratt and brother luigi charlie day are transported down a mysterious pipe wandering into a magical new world but when the brothers are separated mario is on a mission to find luigi with the assistance of a mushroom kingdom resident toad keegan michaelkey and some training from the strongwilled ruler of the mushroom kingdom princess peach anya taylorjoy mario taps into his own power baby you are not ready when first five minutes put you right back into the game and being 12 yearsold while illustrating a love letter to brooklyn however i will say that most of these video game movies have a tendency to run a little on the long side while providing beautiful animation  not to mention that with this one there are s few inconsistent screenplay slip ups  like princess peach proclaiming to not know mario then moments later treating him like an old friend  for adults this was confusing  for the kids watching i doubt they will notice or even care bruiser jack black and his ballad for princess peach not only made me giggle out loud but stuck in my head on a loop loved the talking toad and the whole moby dick vibe with a bit of smash gorilla mixed in for measure many critics will lament about how this film didnt resonate with them  they might have to duke it out with the gang of kids sitting behind me at recent media screening who repeatedly howled with laughter throughout just saying with its message to siblings everywhere of nothing can hurt us as long as were together  the super mario brothers movie is endearing great fun for families to ingest and enjoy
Apr 24 2023,positive,mario delivers on looks and nostalgia and whilst there is enough for adults and kids to enjoy here a deeper story seems to have been kept in another castle
Apr 22 2023,positive,im not sure what highart some of these critics are looking for but the super mario bros movie works for both fans of the longlasting game franchise and people who want an entertaining escape this is the best video game movie yet
Apr 21 2023,positive, when the super mario bros movie opened in theaters earlier this month the experts were ready to count out the computeranimated film as another disposable videogame byproduct like the colossally awful 1993 liveaction take on the 1985 nintendo game not so fast critics jeered but audiences came in droves having already cleaned up with more than 700 million worldwide the super mario bros movie is now the biggest boxoffice hit of 2023 setting records for the largest global opening ever for an animated film how far can it go do i hear a billion easy what happened parents starved for family entertainment thats what happened theres also the fact that the super mario bros movie is way more fun even for nongamers than skeptics predicted repeat business is off the charts so get over your hesitation and jump aboard dont expect miracles even at 93 minutes the movie can drift into dull and derivative still i think its an asset that the super mario bros movie is aimed at 5yearolds of all ages meaning the child in all of us look elsewhere maybe dungeons  dragons honor among thieves for winking adult references its the dedication to silliness that makes mario such an impish delight as directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic from a script by matthew fogel the film doesnt even try to reinvent the genre it only wants to capture enough of the joystick energy of the game to cover the sins of merch pedaling and thin plotting and characterization fears about ethnic stereotyping emerged from the voice casting of nonitalian chris pratt as mario relax pratt uses his own voice to play the mustachioed italian plumber in overalls ditto charlie day as his shy brother luigi both put on exaggerated italian accents in a tv ad for the bros brooklyn plumbing business then revert to normal problem solved pretty much trouble starts immediately as mario and luigi go underground to fix a manhole leak and are sucked into a warp pipe that sends them into two separate universes mario lands in the mushroom kingdom ruled by princess peach anya taylorjoy in fine frisky form poor luigi is zapped into the dark lands controlled by the evil king koopa bowser a kind of demonic turtle with red eyebrows who finds the perfect verbal pairing in wild man jack black bowser yearns for princess peach and will destroy her kingdom if she refuses to marry him mario who is also hot for peach cant have that plus he needs to rescue luigi from bowser and form an alliance with the kong family of gorillas by showing that he  even in a cat suit  can win a fight with the kings son donkey kong seth rogen doing a great seth rogen got that no matter the plot is just a flimsy excuse to have these characters mix it up one more time on the big screen live action cant cut it the first mario movie proved that by staying rigidly earthbound the real secret behind the unexpected and staggering success of the super mario bros movie is animation which niftily catches the anarchy of gaming it creates the illusion that anything is possible its also the next best thing to playing the actual game which continues to thrive and multiply
Apr 21 2023,positive, super mario bros is one of the worlds most beloved video game franchises so its somewhat surprising it took 30 years for mario and luigi to return to the silver screen after their disastrous liveaction film from 1993 now nintendos signature characters are back starring in a beautifully animated feature film from universal pictures illumination  the action starts in new york city where mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day attempt to start their own plumbing businesswithout much success the hapless brothers get sucked into a magic sewer pipe that deposits them in the fantasy world first introduced in the classic nes game from 1985  the two brothers are separated and the evil king bowser jack black captures luigi mario looks for friends in this strange land to help him rescue his brother toad keeganmichael key acts as marios guide and princess peach anya taylorjoy whos trying to defend her kingdom from bowsers koopa army decides she and mario should work together throw in donkey kong seth rogen and some gokart racing to juice up the gaming nostalgia the super mario bros movie will appeal to many parents and kids through a shared attachment to the characters adults with fond memories of dodging turtle shells in the 80s and 90s wont mind watching the movie with their children many of whom have dodged turtle shells in updated versions of those classic games the studio should be applauded for keeping the story sweet and family friendly the most progressive thing about this movie is that mario and peach must rescue luigi rather than the boys needing to rescue the princess theres no attempt to grab adults attention with edgy humor instead grownups can focus on identifying the countless easter eggs packed into each scene despite its delights the movie has its pitfalls the script is paper thin seemingly written to hit certain videogame environments rather than create a satisfying story and sometimes one scene jumps to the next without much sense of connection the film also indulges in the clichéd admonition to believe in yourself even when no one else will the cast contains numerous stars but the voice work from pratt and taylorjoy falls flat on the other hand keys toad offers a couple of inspired moments and blacks bowser has a couple of showstoppers its hard not to compare the super mario bros movie to the lego movie both star chris pratt and both feature internationally beloved intellectual property the lego movie is inventive clever and exceedingly funny but the super mario bros movie avoids risks playing it safe and allowing nostalgia to do all the heavy lifting  collin is worlds arts and culture editor he is a graduate of the world journalism institute the southern baptist theological seminary and louisiana state university and resides with his wife and four children in sugar land texas
Apr 20 2023,negative, the super mario bros movie hits the ground running from its first frame throwing video game and pop culture references at you with such relentless abandon that youre left gasping for air it whizzes by at breakneck speed so much so that it neglects to slow down and find an identity of its own it wont take long for viewers to notice that the animated new release which universal pictures plopped into thousands of multiplex screens on wednesday to take full advantage of easter weekend family crowds is less a movie than a string of callouts and easter eggs its engineered to elicit pavlovian glee from multiple generations of viewers who grew up playing the video games featuring the titular siblings first in video arcades and later on decades worth of game consoles but despite its compact running time 92 minutes a throwback to a time when family films clocked in way south of the twohour mark the frisson of pleasure from catching all the nintendo shout outs goes from amusing to grating pretty quickly viewers looking for a little narrative meat or at the very least characters worth caring about will likely walk away disheartened and dissatisfied memo to directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic seeing corporate symbols go through the motions of a halfbaked story isnt much fun and it really didnt have to be this way illumination the animation studio behind the despicable me and sing movies seemed to be a good fit to bring the adventures of spunky plumber mario the voice of chris pratt his fragile and nervous baby brobusiness partner luigi charlie day nononsense mushroom kingdom ruler princess peach anya taylorjoy comicrelief sidekick toad keeganmichael key and simian adversary donkey kong seth rogen to the screen with the kidfriendly pizzazz the material begs for chris pratt is mario a struggling italianamerican plumber and anya taylorjoy is the voice of princess peach in the super mario bros movie photo courtesy of universal pictures sadly the end result is trapped in an aesthetic tug of war between the cartoonish character design and the more photorealistic action that undermines the movies appeal over and over again it boggles the mind that the filmmakers took a look at this intellectual property and said yep mindnumbing destruction porn is precisely what this material needs to make it pop super mario bros makes its first mistake right out of the gate with a prologue that tips its hat to tolkien while draining the mystery and sense of wonder the movie could have possessed if it had allowed viewers to discover its magical realms through mario and luigis eyes wizard of ozstyle the very first shot shows chunks of lava falling on the ground like embers with the texture of feces a harbinger of things to come bowser jack black a firebreathing destroyer of worlds and as screenwriter matthew fogel keeps reminding us the king of the turtlelike koopas razes the ice castle of some cute anthropomorphic penguins to the ground in seconds allowing the powerhungry antagonist to grab a star think of a horcrux in the harry potter movies that could potentially deliver the colorful mushroom world with its shades of emerald city into his paws jack black is the voice of bowser and charlie day is the voice of luigi in the super mario bros movie photo courtesy of universal pictures super mario bros then sends viewers to brooklyn where mario and luigi struggle to find customers for their plumbing services to onedimensional derision from a local bully and underdeveloped disappointment from their father the joke here is that the stereotypical italian accents are an act something the brothers play up in their tv ad alas like most of the movies stabs at humor it lands with a dull thud the sole bright spot in this section is a sequence that shows mario and luigi dealing with an entitled dog while attempting to fix a leaky bathroom faucet in an upscale home the canine in question is reminiscent of illuminations successful but somewhat underappreciated the secret life of pets and some of the sight gags here suggest the movie that could have been if horvath and jelenic werent so hellbent on jamming their reference checklist down viewers throats wandering into what seems like an abandoned building in an attempt to fix a water main rupture mario and luigi are whisked into an alternate dimension via what looks and feels like a wormhole the inseparable brothers are split up in the process and its up to mario to save the day the vertically challenged new yorker with the paintbrush mustache seeks help from princess peach and embarks on a journey that will bring the ultimate test of his character problem is the movie zips from one scene to the next without leaving much of an impression prioritizing its parade of artifacts over the brothers fierce bond and the characters respective arcs viewers impressed by how closely the characters look to the way they do in the games may not mind how the movie squanders its potential at just about every turn maybe they should care because the word that comes to mind when reflecting on the artistic commitment on display is lazy and the void at the center of this shiny fanservice trinket is pratt a woefully uninspired choice to voice mario the guardians of the galaxy star is just as generic as he appears in the trailers and is an all too appropriate representation of how unremarkable this movie is day by contrast acts circles around his costar but his character is given short shrift sidelined for far too long joy and rogen do what they can but the writing simply does not give them much to work with leaving black to chew the scenery while neglecting to flesh out his lust for domination and unrequited feelings toward peach a widely lambasted 1993 liveaction adaptation of the games unseen by me starred bob hoskins as mario john leguizamo as luigi and dennis hopper as bowser it was dismissed as bizarre and nonsensical at the time of its release but its clear the older films directors annabel jankel and rocky morton opted against playing it safe the way the new production does but credit should be given where it is due and for several enjoyable minutes the super mario bros movie comes to life when it pays tribute to super mario kart instead of a race track mario and the other drivers glide across a rainbow speedway with visual cues from the mad max movies and for older viewers blake edwards the great race the sequences dayglo hues stand out in sharp relief to the dearth of creativity to which the film frequently falls prey this synthetic and halfhearted concoction made a killing at the box office this weekend to the tune of an estimated 2046 million in its first five days of release in north america but it fails to fire up the imagination hobbled by waferthin characters a shell of a boilerplate narrative and cringeinducing needle drops it settles for giving mass audiences of various age groups what they want and thats just depressing it amounts to insipid gamer catnip with nothing to say when it could have been so much more can i have my quarters back theater the actor nominated for a tony award for his portrayal as mrs doubtfire in the broadway musical comes to fort lauderdale in the national tour michelle f solomon has the review
Apr 20 2023,positive,encapsulates charming classic video game characters within a fun yet generic plot that has a cultclassic worthy song stuffed in the middle and doesnt overstay its welcome
Apr 19 2023,positive, ever since mario the overconfident plumber from brooklyn and his dopey brother luigi made it big in 8 bits back in the 1980s the world of video games  and the mushroom kingdom  has never been the same but few video games have taken the world of film by storm the super mario bros movie the new collaboration between universal pictures and illumination is a beautifully animated and amusing but mostly empty film that will provide catnip for hardcore gamers and nintendo devotees but not much in terms of a story for casual fans when the adventure begins mario is struggling to find a purpose at home the mustachioed plumber is voiced by chris pratt and that is the films first problem pratt is funny as far as animation goes but when mario first learned to speak it was when he turned himself into 64 bits in super mario 64 and was voiced by charles martinet its ame mario may have been the single most important phrase in the history of video games and while martinet appears in various supporting voice roles in this film the choice to give the lead to pratt exposes what the studio really cares about  profits instead of fans accordingly the rest of the familiar characters from luigi and princess peach to toad and bowser himself are also voiced by hollywood heavyweights  charlie day anya taylorjoy keeganmichael key and jack black respectively this starstudded voice cast is meant to appeal to mainstream audiences rather than fans of the games which would be fine if the approach wasnt totally at odds with the rest of the movie in screenwriter matthew fogels version of the story mario and luigi head down the wrong pipe and find themselves lost in the mysterious mushroom kingdom where princess peach rules anthropomorphic creatures like donkey kong seth rogen abound and the evil bowser wants to take over with the help of his wizard adviser kamek kevin michael richardson this is similar to the story told in the original cartoons featuring these famous characters which is fine as far as it goes as is the conceit of luigis disappearance which is the plot of at least a couple of the mario games that dont put the princess in peril the more original plot element here is the concept of mario having to find his power  his firepower his raccoontanooki power and other abilities he has gained throughout the decades and the consoles though even that device is wellworn within the modern comic book movie soon mario guided by peach and toad is off on his multilevel adventure to stop the evil bowser at every stop fogel and directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic make sure to insert easter eggs tis the season and cute references to plot points in the dozens of games that the devoted mario bros disciples have played to exhaustion the whimsical playful score by composers koji kondo and brian tyler is a definite highlight almost from the getgo considering that the former is the brilliant creative talent behind most of the music in the console versions of this colorful world as well as the legend of zelda franchise mario and his buddies encounter a bevy of characters that range from cute the little penguins that showed up in mario 64 to menacing and there are minigames and vignettes like the mario kart racing scene that make the movie feel at times like an extended round of mario party as in the mario games you know the outcome even if they do the whole the princess is in another castle routine for a while but it feels more satisfying to get even to a predictable resolution when you have to work hard for it and the reward is in the journey when you are being spoonfed the steps to get to the finale in a multiplex it seems infinitely duller if it sounds like im down on the super mario bros movie it is only because im a tremendous lifelong fan of these characters and the various products that bear their names mario always finds a way to reinvent and reassert himself via new adventures stronger challenges and more textual worlds the film by contrast appears lost amidst a sea of superhero adventures and never quite finds its footing as something anyone except the diehards should care about in fact even the video game can actually end in game over for a player whos unable to surpass a certain obstacle in hollywood by contrast the only thing that actually signals the end is a postcredit scene which of course this film features too ultimately the super mario bros movie is a terrible exemplification of a studio resting on the laurels of the popularity of a brand rather than expending any real creative effort this approach is a startling and disappointing one to have connected to a franchise that has been persistently and rightfully successful because of its indelible work ethic and endless creativity after the colossal failure of the 1993 liveaction movie nintendo was understandably reluctant to go back to the well of feature films after all it didnt need the money nor the boost to marios core product  video games  which are already wildly successful the companys skepticism was proven correct in this instance for however wellintentioned the super mario bros movie is and no matter how much i sincerely hope for a sequel the films ultimate execution makes you wish that someone at universal or illumination had taken out the cartridge blown on it like a hot pizza and pressed the reset button at some point in the process

Apr 19 2023,positive, those genz brothers from brooklyn mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day plumbers in this world superheroes in the mushroom kingdom star in their own big screen adaptation the super mario bros movie directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic teen titans go to the movies which will appeal most to fans of the video games and young kids the animation is so true to the nintendo franchise that you may feel lost without a controller and for the grownups the soundtrack features acdc aha bonnie tyler and of course beastie boys no sleep till brooklyn what about the accents when the films trailer arrived fans were concerned with chris pratts casting as mario who up until this point was known for saying mama mia and itsame mario in a heavy italian accent good news the brothers accents are there kind of at least for their television commercial as they try and attract customers by using exaggerated accents to highlight their heritage fyi its not working so pratt and charlie days luigi speak in their regular voices in the film perfect casting as far as day is concerned while trying to repair a broken water main in the city the brothers are sucked into a pipe that jettisons them into an alternate universe mario lands in the fantastical mushroom kingdom filled with colorful pipes golden powerup blocks floating brown bricks and humanmushroom hybrid citizens called toads their unofficial leader also named toad is voiced by keeganmichael key however the kingdom is ruled by the very human princess peach anya taylorjoy who lives in a disneylike castle meanwhile luigi ends up in the scary dark lands which gamers will associate with luigis mansion the video game that helped launch the gamecube in 2001 luigi gets captured and is held prisoner by the films villain bowser a fierce godzillalike turtle with firebreathing capability who intends to destroy the mushroom kingdom unless princess peach agrees to become his bride jack black gives 110 in a vocal performance that includes hammy songs written by bowser to woo the princess the actorcomedians personality comes blazing through as the leader of the koopas as news of bowsers imminent attack reaches peach she and mario enlist the help of the kongs ruled by cranky kong fred armisen who agrees to lend his army to the cause if mario can defeat his son donkey kong seth rogan in a battle rogan by far delivers the funniest vocal performance and the battle scene with mario is one of the best moments in the animated film as mario becomes cat mario a powerup that gives our hero catlike reflexes plus he looks adorable in what looks like kitty pajamas the films best scene is the exciting mad max race sequence straight from the mario kart games as the characters race in customized soupedup gocarts which will have you scrambling for a controller it feels like youve rented out the theater to play the gamethe super mario bros movie is primarily for fans of the nintendo games or young children who may become new fans of the franchise its a safe family film with nothing risqué no adult humor or too violent if youre not familiar with video games theres little here that will spark your interest older moviegoers may compare it to the 1993 liveaction film super mario bros which stars bob hoskins and john leguizamo as mario and luigi its cheesy over the top and many fans of the games consider it an abomination i enjoyed it in a so bad its good kind of way plus dennis hoppers outrageous performance is entertaining still it had little to do with the franchise created by japanese game designer shigeru miyamoto mailing address 2003 8th ave 300 fort worth tx 76110phone 8174059318email hellofortworthreportorgour missionwe pledge to produce highquality objective local journalism that informs public decisionmaking addresses the quality of life of our communitys citizens holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood in all that we do earning the trust and respect of our audience is paramount our reporting will be free to all who access our primary digital channels
Apr 19 2023,neutral, one of my favourite childhood memories is growing up playing the classic super mario bros game back in the 90s it was a fun video game that allows me to navigate mario through different stages running and jumping over the terrain knocking down enemies goombas and koopa troopas are some of the villains that quickly come to mind and of course hitting the coin blocks that may give the player coins or a mushroom powerup the latter gives mario a temporary special ability to transform himself into a bigger size so when hollywood decided to adapt super mario bros into a bigscreen adventure i was looking forward to seeing whether they can pull off the firstever liveaction video game movie the 1993 movie of the same name boasts the right casting decision of enlisting the late bob hoskins and john leguizamo to play the iconic brooklyn plumbers of the mario brothers but the husbandandwife directing team rocky morton and annabel jankel made a colossal mistake of reimagining the video games otherwise bright and colourful vibes into a surprisingly bizarre and gritty version the word faithful was certainly thrown out of the window resulting in one of the worst video game movies ever made that hoskins himself labelled super mario bros a f nightmare a few years later for those who have seen the 1993 movie you may or may not recall the ending where samantha mathis princess daisy shows up at the front door of mario and luigis apartment asking them to help her on a new mission that new mission would have paved way for a sequel if it wasnt for the first films critical and financial debacle it would take the popular nintendo video game series not a few years but rather almost 30 years later to finally come up with a new super mario bros movie after the notorious 1993 flop made its debut back in may 1993 so here we are  the super mario bros movie which arrived in a computergenerated animated form rather than a liveaction take just like the 1993 version or even a liveactioncgi hybrid seen in the first two sonic the hedgehog movies at the time of writing the super mario bros movie has already made over us700 million in just two weeks and still counting but as usual the mammoth size of its boxoffice earnings this far doesnt always equal quality and i hate to say that the super mario bros movie happens to be one of them i have high hopes for this new movie after seeing how faithful it has shown in the trailer which successfully captured the look and feel of a super mario bros video game the story  credited to matthew fogel who previously wrote the formulaic minions the rise of gru last year  however falters the most i get that the movie may have been designed for kids and as familyfriendly entertainment and i understand the story shouldnt have to be complicated or something that resembled oscarwinning material considering the video game series itself is a straightforward fantasy adventure keeping it simple and accessible is the way to go and while it does strike a chord among many audiences who have already seen it i wish i could share the same sentiment but this is a movie we are talking about and not a video game i have a joypad in my hands to control the player mario that is throughout the journey without the interactive nature of a video game it has to rely entirely on the actors screenwriter and director  in this case of the super mario bros movie we have codirectors aaron horvath and michael jelenic of the sadly underappreciated teen titans go to the movies fame  to bring the movie to life problem is the super mario bros movie plays it too safe for its own good we first see brooklyn plumbers mario voiced by chris pratt and luigi charlie day has been struggling to start their own business even after they made a commercial then one day their opportunity arises when a broken water main made the headline prompting the mario brothers to fix it while working underground in the sewer they find themselves sucked into the mysterious green pipe that leads them into a fantastical realm mario ends up in the mushroom kingdom while luigi got separated and captured by bowsers jack black minions as mario tries to make sense of the mushroom kingdom he met a few characters along the way namely toad keeganmichael key and princess peach anya taylorjoy the latter turns out to be the ruler of the mushroom kingdom where mario and the princess agree to help each other to save luigi and also her kingdom from bowser well thats about it the entire movie is basically about saving luigi and the mushroom kingdom and of course defeating bowser and his minions aaron horvath and michael jelenics overall direction is more dutiful rather than bringing a sense of creativity and inspiration into the movie i dont mean something as misguided as the one seen in the 1993 version but at least it helps to step up a few notches above in terms of storytelling fogels screenplay is as utterly predictable and banal as it gets i find it hard to care about mario and luigis fates throughout their treacherous journey into the unknown since these characters are more like charismafree walkingandtalking avatars than someone with distinct personalities unlike hoskins and leguizamo who actually did a better job nearly thirty years ago it also doesnt help when chris pratts voice performance as mario who barely sounds like an italian while charlie days luigi is mostly undermined throughout the movie there are a few things i do like about the super mario bros movie though the animation is vibrant and colourful as it should be and i love how everything looks gameaccurate from its character designs to the various backgrounds reminiscent of the super mario video game worlds fans in the meantime will have a field day spotting plenty of easter eggs and references covering punchout pizzeria to the super mario veteran charles martinets recognisable voice acting and the brief sight of donkey kongs brother diddy kong from donkey kong country just to name a few credits also go to horvath and jelenic for painstakingly recreating some of the familiar moments from the game this includes the super mario bros 2 training montage revolving around princess peach and mario the oneonone mario vs donkey kong battle and the rainbow road chase setpiece straight out of the mario kart game interestingly enough the supporting cast steals most of the show here with anya taylorjoys feisty turn as princess peach and keeganmichael keys hilariously deadpan role as toad both deserve equal mention jack blacks scenerychewing antagonist character bowser is a spoton casting choice and we even get to see him performing the nowpopular pianoladen peaches song not to mention the familiar sound effects and musical motifs from the super mario video game that can be heard throughout the movie dont forget to stick around for the midcredits and particularly the postcredits scene overall the super mario bros movie has a few worthwhile moments but it wasnt enough to overcome the sheer banality of its storyline heres hoping the inevitable sequel can improve better in this area
Apr 19 2023,positive,the script may be thin but getting to spend 90 minutes in this world of mario certainly put a smile on my face and made me feel like a kid again
Apr 18 2023,positive, the super mario bros movie is smart and emotionally nostalgic its also a simple and easily digestible animated film that will entertain viewers young and old with a fresh adventure   chances are if youre a gen x or millennial parent then you have some familiarity with two italian overallwearing brothers who collect coins eat mushrooms and fly through green pipes like theyre slick as water mario and luigi were a staple of many prey2k childhoods now they are returning to the big screen with an animated film that bundles up every iconic turn the pair have taken into

Apr 16 2023,neutral, universal and nintendos animated collaboration brings the venerable super mario bros videogame series to cinemas for the first time since 1993s abortive liveaction effort starring bob hoskins directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic teen titans go the film presents a mishmash of popular characters and situations drawn from nintendos longrunning franchise of games animated by chris meledandris hugely successful studio illumination despicable me the film has certainly struck a cord with a mass audience since its grossed more than half a billion in its first two weeks the critical response has been less enthusiastic of course it is easy to dismiss the critics since the super mario bros movie is clearly not made for an adult audience going by the preteen viewers with whom i watched the film today it is hitting its target pretty well familiar characters behave in familiar ways and there is a pleasing consistency in watching mario jump between platforms donkey kong throw barrels and luigi cower in fear in a haunted mansion bottom line if youre a kid who spends half your time on a nintendo switch and the other half watching cartoons there is plenty in super mario bros to satisfy if youre the parent of such a kid who are you to tell them what they should and shouldnt be enjoying ultimately however is it fair to dismiss critical opinion on the one hand there is a tendency for many film reviewers critics and academics to either ignore or underrate childrens cinema on the other some of the very best feature films ever made were produced with children in mind the super mario bros movie is bright and colourful wonderfully animated and amusing in fits and starts and a perfectly reasonable way to spend 90 minutes entertaining a child during school holiday time does it stand up against a childrens classic like the wizard of oz the dark crystal the lion king or my neighbor totoro of course not but then again how many films do as might be expected  mainly because this is almost always the case  the faults lie in the screenplay it is credited to matthew fogel although like most animated features the storyline was almost certainly developed by committee it does not adapt an existing story so much as a style and a character set mario is one of the most lucrative and widelyknown pieces of intellectual property from the past half century but what actually created his success was innovative gameplay and not plot or character there is a pleasing simplicity to nintendos characters and a valuable superficiality that removes a need to explain a human princess being kidnapped from mushroom people by a fire breathing lizard and a pack of anthropomorphic turtles so how do you explain it in a narrative feature two choices are clear either warp the existing characters into a narrative and world that makes some kind of internal sense or warp a narrative and world to accommodate a disparate set of characters the 1993 super mario bros movie which was directed by rocky morton and annabel jankel definitely took the former approach and that partially led to its commercial failure the other part being that it is so jawdroppingly poor that some film enthusiasts are actively trying to bestow it with cult status horvath and jelenics take goes the opposite way and is perfectly satisfied to take the shortest most superficial routes to justify its string of videogame tribute sequences there is a third option a much more complicated middle route that carefully stitches together disparate elements and instills them with depth and heart in 1979 james frawleys the muppet movie managed to take popular varietysketch series the muppet show and establish them for the first time in a real world context it not only honoured the anarchic humour of the muppet characters but successfully wove them into a threeact narrative for the first time and gave them an emotional resonance that their tv escapades never required entirely by coincidence i recently rewatched this film and was struck all over again by just how effectively its key elements were adjusted to shift from one media to another the care taken in its development and production is why the muppet movie is still a fivestar masterpiece and the super mario bros movie is at best a threestar diversion there is clearly a mass audience for whom mario works and honestly good for them and i suspect it works via a pleasing recognition of and nostalgia for the original videogames when mario runs along a twodimensional obstacle course it has a pleasing effect because it reminds us of how great the original super mario bros and its sequel games were when an army of koopas descend on the heroes in a frantic kart chase it reminds us of the fun we have had played against one another in super mario kart mario kart 64 and their various followups this carefully engineered nostalgia is emphasised by brian tylers loud emphatic score that cribs relentlessly thankfully with onscreen credit from original games composer koji kondo as a creative work the movie honestly disappoints it fact it positively flounders as a carefully engineered piece of corporate ip it is difficult to fault it is so bright so energetic and so completely and cynically manufactured the difference between art and commerce is vividly clear in the films english language voice cast which includes jack black anya taylorjoy and  most divisively  chris pratt as the titular mario to be clear no one sounds bad or distracting but at the same time no one particularly stands out they have been cast for their names and prestige rather than their talent they are a dot point on a middle managers marketing summary designed to hook an audience quadrant in to giving the film a chance the emphasis in casting is not on what works but what sells to be completely honest its not the film itself that disappoints me but rather nintendos coproduction of it for the past 50 years or so nintendo has been among the highest echelons of videogame design its reputation for quality has been the result of rigorous quality standards the company has a wellearned reputation for delaying releases until they are in the best possible shape they are in based on designer and mario creator shigeru miyamotos oftquoted claim that a delayed game is eventually good but a rushed game is forever bad when morton and jankels super mario film failed nintendo famously pulled any chance of hollywood adapting their properties on an indefinite basis that this new attempt even exists is down to a personal encounter between miyamoto and meledandri and their mutual agreement to take another crack at mario on the big screen their end result is certainly more competent but given the standards of nintendo the gaming company competent really should be exceptional nintendo design and release some of the highest quality games in the world given they are listed alongside universal pictures on this film and miyamoto is a credited producer not executive or associate  an actual ontheground producer it is on nintendos brand that the film should be just as good given the commercial success here its as good as certain that we will be seeing spinoffs and sequels for many years to come not to mention similar attempts at the legend of zelda metroid and nintendos other key franchises it seems equally inevitable that they will be very successful and to put in plainly not very interesting did i go and see this movie because chris pratt and jack black were in it no i didnt i saw it because it was a mario movie im 44 years old am i outside the target audience absolutely am i alone in my opinion not even close i am a realist though and i had real concerns for this for many of the same reasons as you video game movies are often very bad so with some hesitation and my expectations being slightly better than the original mario bros movie i took a chance here is my assessment of your review you focus too much on who is in it and why they were cast as well as piddly things like nintendo being an executive producer  for a mario movie of course they are producers are you daft you didnt like it oh its fine and you think nintendo movies are uninteresting then stop reviewing my favorite movies this movie had so many fun easter eggs specifically designed to call out the great history of mario that people for generations love a true legend of zelda movie sounds fantastic a movie adaptation of metroid could be amazing you think this movie was meh at best look at the audience score you are a bit out of touch dude we fans want this and at the end of the day fans will make this a thing and if nintendo doesnt deliver that will be one thing this was an amazing movie and for you to have missed that means you are just another critic who hates movies do me a favor and fade into obscurity you make movie critics look bad honestly its great that you enjoyed it and clearly with box office approaching a billion dollars its clear many others do and as i noted upfront its a perfectly fine movie and does its job im just very surprised that with nintendos huge reputation for quality it wasnt better and i promise you there isnt a critic alive that actually hates movies no one goes into a cinema for two hours actively wanting something to suck the trick to reading critics is to find the ones who like what you like and keep reading them heres the problem with that lately critic have been dumping on great movies like this saying it is lackluster for one reason or another and making movies and series fail as a result im not saying that you have to like a movie but look at the score 96 audience score says its great in this case we likely will get a sequel or another in the nintendo franchises despite critic like you pooping on it i was being a little facetious about the critics hate movies comment but i was trying to make a point im tired of seeing movies and series fail as a result of movie critics claiming it isnt a good movie when the audience says its great im also tired of crappy movies getting critical acclaim and succeeding as a result when the audience hates the movie you happen to be the first rotten tomato that i saw and i wanted to see what you wrote you were surprised the quality wasnt better audience score of 96 disagrees with you there this is why moviegoers are starting to hate critics you give our favorite movies crappy reviews you say it was not the movie that you were disappointed in  but you are reviewing the movies you say you were upset that it wasnt higher quality having nintendo involved if you actually look at the movie you will see the opposite is true nintendo gave illumination the green light to go with it sure they probably had a hand in suggestions as they do but after the flop that was mario bros 1993 can you blame them your statement destroys from your review the actors were picked because of popularity and not talent i say again 96 disagree the voice acting was pretty great i was unsure how i felt about jack black as bowser but he pulled it off all the other voices were great too chris pratt wouldnt have been my first choice for mario but he did well enough you werent the worst critique of the movie just the first one i clicked on when trying to find out why the critics hated this movie when the audience loved it you say that you are happy i enjoyed it but we still have the issue of criticism destroying the possibilities of the future think about wether it delivers to the fans and does a good job at it the answer is yes it does 100 this movie doesnt deserve a low critic score anything below a 7 doesnt make sense your critique tells me you werent vested in this movie and were already judging it before you sat down to watch it you were already uninterested before it started if you are uninterested in a movie it wasnt made for you and you shouldnt criticize it because you will have a skewed view nintendo isnt exactly known for publishing games with innovative stories eg mario kart or any super mario bros game i mean you even mentioned it yourself animationquality wise the film is undeniably perfect so clearly youre just looking for faults because you think the film is just a cashgrab or a calculated nostalgia trip for fans  rts binary rottenfresh system only takes you so far its why i dont assign scores or stars to movies in the actual reviews because i think theyre ultimately unhelpful this one is a 510 film in my opinion which is therefore rotten  but its a fair way more enjoyable than a 210 movie i believe you that youre not just the target for this movie which is fine but that is having you be biased towards the review hence giving it a bad score what is sad about it is that when you look for scores online is that your review will stand out more than others even if is just subjective like in this case couldnt the superfans here accept the fact that some peoples might criticize this movie without being monstruous being this is getting ridiculous none of you actually adress actual elements of the critic made here instead you are complaining about the fact that a child movie shouldnt be badly rated because it is for children what a laughable argument when you consider the diversity of pixar ghibli and other kids movies that actually can adress grownup problematics and create somptuous setting without burrying themselves in nonending goofiness nor by throwing cultural references at the face of the spectator for an hour and half the movie has some great ideas but is so fastpaced and willing to show us his comitment to the videogame that it ends up being disappointing the kartcentric kong society the struggling mario brothers and their relationship with their family and themselves the antagonistic relationship between mario and donkeykong the hopeless love of bowser for peach the exploration and wonder one could have discovering this strange new world so many possibilities that could have been deepened to create a tounching movie but who were ultimately leftaway because we absolutely have to show everything from the game in a short amount of time and all of it shall be goofy as hell and no we fans dont want this dont pretend you can speak for a whole base of player while dismissing the critics as exogenous to this same playerbase i myself are fond of the mario galaxy franchise and the marioluigi rpg franchise i have played numerous game from super mario bros to mario 64 to mario party and so on yet i still consider that a movie have to be a movie not a fanservice mess deep as a puddle
Apr 15 2023,positive,okay for the adults and a pure delight for the kids
Apr 15 2023,negative, its a sacred text but not one with any depth the saga of super mario told through dozens of video games over roughly four decades should not be plumbedyes thats right plumbedfor richness that does not exist in its surfaceonly fairy tale is a perfect simplicity regularly used as framework for interactive platforming adventures that are since theyve existed some of the most broadly shared experiences of joy on earth as a movie the whole mario thing will probably never work but it would be interesting to see a version that makes no effort to explain what everyone already knowsthat hes a fast little dude in an inexplicable psychedelic hollow earth called the mushroom kingdom jumping his way to jesus status as he topples monsters and restores innocence among the many errors of the super mario bros movie screenwriter matthew fogel formerly of minions the rise of gru and the lego movie 2 repute plops him and his brother luigi into a milquetoast brooklyn family that doubts them and disrespects their smallbusiness dreams who cares boring stuff get to the action dont try to make these guys more real because that was never the point the more human the brothers and their princess peach are made to be the more dull let em fight let em fly when the movie focuses on this its funa movie that only focuses on this closer to youtubeable speedruns than paintbynumbers ip origin story chum would be better  the lone exception to its failures at cramming in charisma jack black as bowser he gets to sing lovesick incel ballads mewling about how peach doesnt love him enough angry that the tiny courageous italian has her heart instead black remains a performer who no matter the stakes brings the full experience bless him for doing that when no one else could pg 92 min 
Apr 14 2023,positive,ive been wanting a super mario brothers movie like this for a long time i was smiling the entire time i was watching this movie
Apr 14 2023,positive,is this the greatest movie that is worth all those years of hype and anticipation honestly no is it still a fun adventure to see the beloved games adapted to the big screen oh absolutely
Apr 14 2023,neutral,crisp animation mostly strong voice acting and fun for the entire family no doubt mario is a juggernaut franchise for illumination and universal but overall the super mario bros movie is nothing groundbreaking and can be very generic thematically 
Apr 14 2023,positive, eight years after the idea was originally discussed the animated super mario bros movie is finally in cinemas and after the unusual absurdity of the 1993 live action film i was sceptical of this adaptation right up until the trailers were released since then my excitement has been high but was it worth the wait the super mario bros movie stars chris pratt and charlie day as mario and luigi two brothers who start up their own plumbing business only to get accidently sucked into the mushroom kingdom once there mario is tasked with working alongside princess peach anya taylorjoy  the queens gambit new mutants to help stop the koopa king bowser jack black  kung fu panda school of rock and save his brother after seeing the film my scepticism was pushed aside completely the super mario bros movie is an extremely enjoyable adaptation even if it has one or two issues illumination studios and nintendo are behind this adaptation whether you like the minionsdespicable me or not it cant be denied that illumination are amazing when it comes to their animated visuals and the super mario bros movie is no exception the animation looks incredible and is very detailed eg bowsers hair or the fabric on marios clothing are incredibly detailed to the point where individual hairs can be seen on bowser plus various locations within the film looked gorgeous the introduction to mushroom kingdom was wonderous and amazing to see while bowsers castle looked creepy and rainbow road looked bright and vibrant its clear that care was taken to make sure the locations characters and overall settings were accurately portrayed and illumination studios have done an incredible job at bringing the world of the super mario bros to life after hearing the announcement that chris pratt was going to voice mario reception was less than positive especially since charles martinet who has voiced mario since 1989 was only going to have a small cameo but while chris voice wasnt anywhere near the resemblance of the video game voice i didnt dislike his performance as the red plumber his voice actually worked for the film and fit the character comfortably as the film went on plus i liked how the film did incorporate the brothers italian accents the brothers only use the accent during the commercials for their plumbing business which was a nice inclusion and helps push the plot along to an extent but charlie day was perfect casting as luigi and gave the fearful character a likeable personality the moment he appeared on screen both of these actors had fantastic onscreen chemistry with each other making what couldve been a strange film to watch a delightful one while the casting may have appeared strange when first announced chris pratt and charlie day worked perfectly together and the brothers relationship was convincing straight away the rest of the voice cast were also great when casting announcements were made it seemed that an unusual choice had been made especially with bowser being voiced by jack black and donkey kong voiced by seth rogen but these performances are just as great too seth rogen was the biggest surprise personally because just like with mario his voice fit comfortably with the character not only was it a surprise because of the choice in casting but its the first time donkey kong has spoken proper sentences so while rogen had a blank slate to work with it was uncertain to fans whether giving the ape a voice would really work but it does and it works really well he gives the ape a humorous performance but is also able to showcase the characters rage and short temper when needed and when there is a sombre moment involving him seth rogen is great at giving donkey kong an emotional or heartfelt moment  but the character that stole the show was bowser voiced by jack black the actor fully embraced the role and was perfect casting as the koopa king he made the villain surprisingly terrifying when the narrative asked for it but was also able to bring in his comedic talent too this is especially the case given that bowsers character arc is him wanting to rule the world while being in love with princess peach a couple of sequences revolving around the latter called for some very funny moments and there was even a sequence where the actor was able to showcase his vocal range yes really with bowser being my favourite character in the mario franchise i was highly sceptical of how this character was going to be portrayed but bowser was perfect he was shown to be a terrifying foe when needed but also brought some humour into the film when his love for peach was revealed  and it wasnt until i watched the movie that i realized how strange the plot of the mario franchise actually is but unlike the 93 adaptation the super mario bros movie doesnt try to ground anything into reality instead it tells the story of the game accurately for the most part with the only exception being the plot detail of peach being kidnapped and the story is very well executed because of this even when the film is packed with various references to different mario games the story is easy to follow and the references dont intrude on the plot  this review wont be revealing all of them purely because it will spoil some of the film but the film was packed with references from various mario games as well as a couple from the spinoffs these were delightful to see and blended into their environments brilliantly an example is when mario and toad are travelling through the mushroom kingdom and fans are shown how the city is laid out which includes floating platforms and even a shop thats selling a snes game cartridge not only were the references fantastic to see but im convinced i didnt see all of them throughout the film giving it a rewatchability factor  but the score for the super mario bros movie did include some strange choices which felt jarring throughout a couple of scenes a random 80s song will suddenly appear but would only play for under a minute these all felt out of place even if the actual scene itself was fun to watch compared to the rest of the score it felt very strange to have these songs appear out of nowhere i wouldve preferred the musical score to play throughout without the need for these songs like previously mentioned the plot detail of princess peach being kidnapped has been removed a choice i am happy with because this gives peach time to shine as well as properly develop a relationship with mario however the damsel in distress detail instead is given to luigi who spends the majority of the film in a cage i wouldve liked more scenes involving luigi and mario working together in mushroom kingdom especially when the start of the film emphasizes mario and luigis sibling relationship really well i wouldve preferred it if luigi had been rescued earlier and the brothers had worked together to defeat bowser  however these issues aside the super mario bros movie is a very enjoyable and fun film the cast though it may have seemed strange at first are fantastic and fit their characters comfortably the visuals are incredible and the references both visually and musically are aplenty its clear a lot of care has been taken to create this film and it shows even if some of the music choices were strange  along with sonic the hedgehog arcane and the last of us to name a few it really feels like the filmtv industry has finally learnt how to do great and enjoyable video game adaptations and with more on the way im very excited for the future of this genre furthermore with charlie day interested in a luigis mansion film and seth rogen wanting a donkey kong film it looks like this wont be the last animated nintendo adaptation something i am

Apr 14 2023,positive, i remember being in 2nd grade 1992 my brother was visiting and walked me down to our local subway for a sandwich we used to order our hero then play as a hero on the arcade while we waited for our order that hero was mario in super mario world a few months later i wouldnt have to go outside to see mario  luigi they were in my living room on the super nintendo i remembered how big a difference the game looked compared to its predecessor super mario bros on the nintendo entertainment system thirtyone years later i think the same thing again while watching the super mario bros movie  before i get into this review lets give respect to where its due the first mario bros related movie was the 1993 liveaction super mario brothers the movie feel however you want about it good or bad it happened but thirty years later universal pictures said gentlemen we can rebuild them we have the technology  and that they freaking did the super mario bros movie does an incredible job of translating the lore from the super mario franchise on screen while also knowing when to deviate the movie is filled with homages easter eggs and most importantly a great time for friends and family  we meet the not yet iconic mario chris pratt and luigi charles day as two plumbers in modern day brooklyn buk buk  fire flower sfx x 2 trying to strike it out on their ownn they put out a very campy but earnest commercial for their plumbing business and we see their old boss mike laughing in their freaking faces from jump we see the courage and love mario has as he defends his brother from mikes insults its established early on that both brothers are underdogs mario for his small stature luigi for his fear and both of them for dreaming big  when the brothers get their first client we see them navigate through the busy streets of brooklyn mario been out here competing in red bull parkour tournaments cause that man can freaking move while luigi careful and less gracefully trails behind him things get messy with the client which leads to our protagonists feeling down their family aside from their mom doesnt do much to help either a major leak on the news is what gets the events of the movie underway in trying to fix this leak that threatens to flood brooklyn mario and luigi get sucked through a warp zone pipe into a whole new world and then separated mario lands in the mushroom kingdom where he befriends toad keeganmichael key while luigi lands in the territory of the big bad bowser jack black it is here where mario learns of bowser trying to take over mushroom kingdom which means hes gotta find a way to rescue his brother i mentioned earlier how things are different from mario lore we grew up with the princess peach anya taylorjoy we meet in the super mario bros movie aint no damsel in distress from the video games shes super smash bros gang gang princess peach got hands like you wouldnt believe and here she is the one that trains mario for survival in this world we see mario trying to platform in a tester course and coming close to getting it but not quite as opposed to peach who grew up in mushroom kingdom lets put it this way if there was an olympics in mushroom kingdom then princess peach is carl lewis and flo jo peach is shown to be a great leader an ambassador for her people  through the movie princess peach is really in her kuvira the great uniter bag just without the fascisism and locking people up mario is the main protagonist of this movie but we see princess peach legit getting busy throughout the film of course mario is going to have his moments of triumph but i am very happy to see that princess peach who is from the mushroom kingdom was raised in the mushroom kingdom is portrayed as a strong  character that has mushroom kingdom tatted across the belly metaphorically as a leader that rolls up her sleeves and gets to work for her kingdom this was a great pivot from the lore we know and a liberty for all the right reasons i mean the absolute same can be said for bowser as well because looooooooooooooord i mean jack blacks bowser what cant i even say man bowser doesnt really speak much until mario sunshine so its not only funny but cool to see jack black use his comedic range with this character but also show that even when being funny bowser is still a sinister problem bowsers whole motivation for getting a certain item and seeking peach out for a specific reason may feel like a deviation from the lore or as if fan theory is coming into play but nintendo never truly specified why bowser kidnaps princess peach in the game the only deviation here is that bowser isnt a one note evil villain i see that as a good thing who doesnt love a villain with range if anything bowser displays  some low key elements of that 80s villain toxic masculinity in a funny way this bowser sees princess peach as a damsel gets jealous at her walking round with mario believes an item and his show of power will win her over all while in a diddy all white part suit and top hat you gotta loveem man i keep focusing on his range but when he sings when hes practicing how he will approach princess peach all these humorous things that get dropped at the drop of a top hat when bowser shows folks whose really in charge here  i love a villain that can switch in an instant between goofy and i am a whole threat to you bowser is as big and as bad as we remember from video games and this is a final boss that will beat the plumbing outta ya this is a villain that is a threat aint no redemption for him i mean maybe in later movies and aint no qualms about it bowser is here to take what he wants consequences and mustached men be damned  there are a lot of faves from super mario that appear in the movie as well i aint even get into my guy donkey kong seth rogen my primates entrance was spectacular and im so happy that he and mario were beefing on sight toad is such a fave cause he is really here and bout that action and thats all hes got to say about that oooooh and how at first i felt bad for luigi but by the end with his own lil arc i was screaming for the  player 2  younger sibling gawd the easter eggs and homages didnt feel forced in this movie to me at least one of my favorite things was seeing the boxers from super punch out as celebs in the punch out pizzeria at the beginning of the movie  which brings me to how the background and environment feel like their own character in the movie as well the way mario peach donkey kong and luigi interact with moving around their surroundings is already dope but to then see the camera move out then reposition itself so that the screen becomes a 2d side scroller come on man little intricacies like that kept me engaged and also just lemme know when we reached an it aint sweet moment visually this movie is just amazing and dont even get me started on rainbow road i mean the mario kart folk know what it is im just saying fast  furious is a cool franchise but mario and the gang were catching bodies on a whole rainbow ithrows hands up theres levels to this racing and i live my life one dropped banana peel at a time  listen this is a movie for adults children teens and anyone that ever rocked with them mario bros this movie was some thirty plus years in the making and worth the wait if you got the time i think this is a movie you should see because the amount of fun in it is ridiculous this movie had to go hard but damn man i didnt know it was going to go that hard but i am big glad that they did

Apr 13 2023,negative,the super mario bros movie is the illumination style done at its absolute worst
Apr 13 2023,positive, you cant expect a lot out of a mario movie especially right out of the gate aaron horvath and michael jelenics the super mario bros movie stays true to the games in the narrative meaning there really isnt one simple amusement is what gamers go to mario for and thats exactly what the film is but as it transitions into a new medium there are both expectations and opportunities the expectation is a good story because no movie can succeed with window dressing while mario has never been about its story that doesnt translate well to film and this offers the opportunity to expand upon its lore and characters in new ways the directors and writer matthew fogel didnt grab that opportunity this time around but if it has its audience yelling yahoo on their way to the video game store it did what it came to do the film opens with bowser jack blacks fury powerhungry and lovestruck over princess peach anya taylorjoy hes on the hunt to find the super star with its invincible powers he hopes to not only take over the world but impress peach enough for her to agree to marry him if she doesnt agree hell have no choice but destroy her home mushroom kingdom knowing that bowser is a threat to her and her precious toads peach seeks to form an alliance with the kong army she also finds an unlikely ally in a short overalled brooklynitalian plumber named mario chris pratt who is propelled into this world through a warp pipe its all very simple but its also mario as said theres nothing much to expect in terms of narrative when speaking of the games franchise creator shigeru miyamoto has even stated that story and mario never really mixed in reference to super mario galaxys plot wireds chris kohler remarks in a 2009 interview with miyamoto that its more than the window dressing we were used to in response miyamoto explains that he likes to go with as little story as possible ive always felt that the mario games themselves arent particularly suited to having a very heavy story whereas the zelda series is something that lends itself more naturally to that idea he says in that respect the super mario bros movie is very much the way miyamoto likes it however a barebones story doesnt translate well to film like video game cut scenes when you skip over dialogue it moves quickly so quickly that it all feels rushed the film sticks to the simplicity of most of the games that just follow bowser repeatedly kidnapping peach and attacking her kingdom while the latter is still true here the film can be lauded for the fact that it takes a departure from the classic rescuetheprincess formula but thats really the only thing the film does to spice things up as peach is the one who drives the story or lack thereof and propels the action forward mario hasnt always just been about defeating an enemy and saving the day either some plots of the games do have narrative heft to them take the poignant story of fatherhood between bowser and his son in super mario sunshine or super paper marios meta take on gaming culture with a complex journey into heaven and hell for the characters and dark twists and turns mario hasnt always been just silly lighthearted fun and while the film does incorporate the franchises darker elements  the mushroom kingdom is the poptastic side of bower castles metal tracklist  it doesnt do anything plotwise to impress the film does manage to stand out most with its characters especially in the introduction of mario and his brother luigi charlie day we see them out in the human world brooklyn to be exact their italian accents are only put on for a commercial to promote their new plumbing business when fans heard the lack of italian flavour in chris pratts voice for the first time it caused a big uproar like sonics teeth some even went so far as to dub marios original voice over the trailer surprisingly pratts voice acting doesnt turn out to be a distraction at all and he does a fine job the same goes for day in the luigi role their voice performances make the characters easily recognizable mario is cheerful and courageous while luigi is still timid and scared in most situations but shows great bravery in the end our introduction to the film versions of these iconic characters finds them struggling to get their plumbing business off the ground and make a name for themselves when we finally see them get a gig it serves as an excellent bit of slapstick with everything turning to chaos like paddington in a bathroom seeing the brothers working together in the real world results in a desire to explore their bond more deeply their life more deeply we are given brief glimpses of them with their family and them as their baby versions but theres a missed opportunity to bring more depth to their characters as we are quickly propelled right into the mushroom kingdom and the subsequent action  despite a narrative that could have used a powerup or two its still very much a mario movie it has more easter eggs than the easter bunny has supply and even if youre just a casual fan who has only played mario kart youll still find so much to love in its charming humour and firstrate animation like the games themselves illumination creates an expansive visual feast that makes you wish you lived in that world its stunning work with some cool camera tricks up its sleeve with certain scenes being filmed like the sidescroller games the production design and character movements mimic that classic style of gameplay impressively theres tons of action and an epic mario kart sequence that not only shows the mechanics of picking your kart but racing as well shells and all while the film is plagued by a random overused selection of 80s hits that dont fit their scenes very well its score with integrated themes and retro music and game cues add to its overall goal of just trying to be a fan crowdpleaser for a general audience its proving to be just that and thats fine a first entry in a mario franchise can afford to meet the expected but if it doesnt take a super mushroom for the potential sequel this franchise wont stay fun for long the spiny shell is ready to launch
Apr 12 2023,positive, when the liveaction super mario bros movie came out in 1993 i was twelve i remember being excited to see it but feeling highly disappointed when i walked out of the theater it was almost nothing like the games i adored as an adult i appreciate this film for how campy and bizarre it is taking the source material and transplanting it into an edgy cyberpunk aesthetic that being said i hoped the newest attempt at a super mario bros movie would be more faithful to the source material produced by illumination universal pictures and nintendo this had some big bucks and players behind it thankfully this new adaption is excellent and captures the fun and whimsy that nintendo is known for the story follows mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day two brothers trying to get their struggling plumber business off the ground in brooklyn there is a catastrophic flood in the middle of the city and when the bros investigate the issue they are sucked into a warp pipe and end up in the colorful and magical mushroom kingdom mario and luigi get separated during the warping process and on top of that the mushroom kingdom is being invaded by bowser jack black a giant firebreathing turtle who will stop at nothing to take over the entire world now mario has to find his brother and help princess peach anya taylorjoy the ruler of the mushroom kingdom defeat bowser the mario games have never had deep narratives outside of paper mario and super mario rpg and often the only lore available was a paragraph in the instruction manual in comparison to that the story here is quite fleshed out but if you compare it to other contemporary animated films it feels sparse the pacing is also breakneck and the movie runtime is just over an hour and a half so there is little time to spend on character development its clear the writers depended on the audience to fill in some of the blanks with their familiarity with the source material while it doesnt ultimately ruin the film it could have used a little extra room to breathe aesthetically super mario bros is gorgeous and its exhilarating to see the mushroom kingdom rendered in all its surreal glory there are visual references everywhere from almost every single mainline mario game and easter eggs all over the place one fun little connection is that although nintendo does exist in this universe mario is seen playing an nes instead of mario games they have jumpman an early name for marios character back in the donkey kong arcade days this attention to detail is all over every design aspect and its nice to see the directors and writers respect the source material there was a lot of internet chatter about chris pratt doing the voice of mario and the lack of the accent but it sounds natural and not as flat as it sounded in the trailers the original voice of mario charles martinet plays a different character and its nice to see he was included because his mario performance is truly iconic jack black as bowser is inspired casting and he hams it up at every opportunity its apparent black had an absolute blast and he even gets to use his singing pipes once or twice the soundtrack in general is excellent mixing koji kondos melodies with new material from brian tyler overall the super mario bros movie is a light affair that doesnt add much to the established mario canon but is a delightful lowstakes film that adults and children alike can enjoy
Apr 12 2023,neutral, thirty years ago disney subsidiary hollywood pictures produced a big screen adaptation of the popular nintendo game super mario bros taking the sparse existing story content and extrapolating it into a bizarre and outrageous urban fantasy that ultimately bore little resemblance to the source material this wasnt all that unusual at the time when film adaptations of novels comics and tv series commonly retained only the broad strokes of their parent works still people hated it critics found it a weird and disjointed commercial cash grab and fans of the games found it unrecognizable in the years since however as film adaptations have become more slavishly loyal to their plots and established iconography big weird swings like that 93 mario bros have been reevaluated within millennial film crit circles directors rocky morton and annabel jankel brought a great deal of imagination to their take on the portly italian plumbers adventures through the mushroom kingdom the kind of oddball creativity that by and large studios do not permit anymore especially when it comes to adapting established properties the super mario bros movie  24 stars directed by aaron

much familiar imagery as possible while adding practically nothing for the mario fan in your household young or old its likely exactly what they want it to be however if youve somehow managed to go through life without having any attachment to the character there is absolutely no reason for you to watch it mario chris pratt doing a voice but not the voice is a friendly but scrappy plumber from

theres a throwaway joke about a mini game from mario party called toad scramble if none of what i just said makes any sense to you then you are not the audience for this movie thats not to say that little kids wont have a good time even if they dont recognize that peachs castle in this film is exactly as it appears in super mario 64 the super mario bros movie is a totally functional animated kids movie its silly it moves fast it has a million little guys in it whose toys are on shelves now i saw this film in a theater packed with kids albeit the kids of parents who felt motivated to bring their toddlers and preschoolers to the earliest possible screening of the new mario movie on the thursday morning of its release they all had a terrific time the kids pointed excitedly at the screen and said thats luigi each time luigi appeared the adults chuckled when one of peachs royal guards said your princess is in another castle its fundamentally the same experience for either age group the more familiar you are with mario the more little coins of recognition youre going to collect and the higher the movie will score with you that is unless youre like me a curmudgeon who dislikes being pandered to see my reviews of star trek picard the mandalorian the last of us etc of course i recognize the dozens of musical motifs from the 35year history of the mario franchise that are scattered throughout the film and of course i love those tunes and of course i jotted them all down in my little notebook i appreciate that even newer characters like mayor paulina and the lumas make appearances alongside ubiquitous classics like parakoopas and shy guys but thats most of what the super mario bros movie is a massive assemblage of things you already like arranged into a coherent order for digestion as a single 92minute product it is the laziest possible version of a mario movie and for most viewers young and old thatll be totally acceptable hang onto your joycons because i a film critic am about to say something nice about those sonic the hedgehog movies and here it is theyre movies both the 2020 sonic film and its sequel have their own story that is unique from any of the games cartoons or comics that make up the sonic franchise introducing their own characters settings setpieces and ideas theyre not a total reinvention like the 1993 super mario bros but they do have a spark of originality to them they are distinct products from the works that inspired them and they have a reason to exist outside of the context of sonic fandom and cumulatively they have grossed over 700 million the super mario bros movie is not so much a movie as a speedrun through the history of mario from the donkey kong arcade cabinet to the nintendo switch a crash course for people who by and large do not need it theyve either already lived it or are currently immersed in it will they enjoy the experience sure even i had a pretty good time and im busy here constructing a rant protesting it will it make a billion dollars almost certainly and you can look forward to seeing a new one of these every two to three years and a legend of zelda movie and a metroid movie and a kirby movie until the bubble finally bursts in 2038 and we start getting movies based on tiktok memes instead what im saying is we can and should expect more from a movie than a recital of things we already love im not asking for children of men i know ive just bought a ticket to the cartoon plumber movie i only ask that you add something to the recipe youve inherited it can be done look at into the spiderverse look at the goddamn lego movie hollywood has given you a blank check you dont have to write it out to cash we get it you like to have control of your own internet experience but

Apr 12 2023,positive, mario stands up for himself and his brother when it comes to villains and those who bully others and he doesnt let teasing or mean comments get the best of him when it comes to achieving his goals he puts in hard work and never stops trying he also shows great courage when it comes to taking on a new world and obstacles princess peach is brave proactive and relentless when it comes to defending her land and the creatures in it putting their needs before her own mario and peach have different goals but work together to achieve them mario and luigi are white of italian descent the movies take on their overthetop italian accents is that theyre just for show but marios time with his family reinforces some italian american stereotypes though most of the actors who voice marios family are of italian descent mario himself  chris pratt  is not the movies magical worlds feature almost all nonhuman creatures but three black actors voice key characters princess peach is a skilled brave female leader who leads an army to defend her kingdom but as fierce and courageous as she is shes the only female character in any of the lands and is portrayed as a love interest for both bowser and mario in brooklyn a wealthy black couple hire the mario bros for a plumbing job the creator and some film executives are japanese fantasy animated action violence missiles being shot fingers being crushed in a piano talk of ritual sacrifices chases in which characters are in peril extreme falls character put into intense pain through magic theyre never physically touched one scary sequence plays like a horror movie with skeleton zombies that have glowing red eyes chasing a terrified character crawling out from the ground and eventually capturing him dog attack spaceship has horns and glowing red eyes a menacing villain burns down a kingdom and threatens or attempts to kill positive andor adorable characters mean bullying behavior explosions adorable character is the voice of doom making dark comments with the voice of a young child bowsers onesided interest in marrying peach is at the heart of the plot and he uses violence against another to coerce her to agree to marry him insulting bullying language used to humiliate and put down main characters includes idiot shut up stupid worthless and youre a joke the ableist term crazy is used to describe a character based on the hugely popular nintendo video gameentertainment franchise the story weaves together various iterations of the video game and is essentially a commercial for the property extensive merchandising in conjunction with the film parents need to know that the super mario bros movie is based on the hugely popular nintendo video gameentertainment franchise mario voiced by chris pratt and princess peach anya taylorjoy team up for a quest that involves elements from several of the games including donkey kong mario kart super mario 3d world and more the movie is a bit edgier than the games when it comes to cartoon violence scares and bullying expect missiles explosions a welllanded punch and a plan to make ritual sacrifices while mario and peach are brave they and other characters are often visibly panicked and are in constant peril from villain bowser who burns down the walls of a kingdom and issues deadly threats to those in his way some kids may be frightened by a scene in which luigi is chased by zombie skeleton turtles with glowing red eyes that creep out of the ground en masse and eventually capture him the mario bros also hear a lot of insults and are the targets of bullying behavior by a former employer and get teased by family members idiot stupid shut up etc and of course there are those magic mushrooms but ultimately themes of perseverance courage and teamwork are clear to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails in the super mario bros movie brooklyn plumbers mario voiced by chris pratt and his younger brother luigi charlie day fall down a mysterious portal and wind up separated inside a magical world mario lands in the mushroom kingdom which is ruled by princess peach anya taylorjoy whos strategizing how to prevent her land from being conquered by the nefarious bowser jack black when mario realizes that luigi has likely been taken prisoner by bowser he and peach team up to save his brother and her people nintendo fans will feel like they grabbed a super star while watching this brightly colored magical adventure which mashes several mario games up into a full storyline but for viewers who are less familiar sitting through the super mario bros movie may feel like watching a second grader play a mario game its cute but you cant help thinking about all the other things you could be doing with your time making movies based on video games that have beloved characters and a builtin fan base seems like a natural choice but not many do it well exceptions include sonic the hedgehog and detective pikachu and the super mario bros movie doesnt depart from that norm while it is fun to see the brothers in their real life environment in brooklyn  working as plumbers and living at home with their big italian family  as well as how the filmmakers incorporate elements of the games the film isnt funny or creative enough to satisfy most teens or adults moreover the childfriendly animation style is a tad misleading as directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic up the scare factor making bowser and his minions more terrifying than they need to be theres plenty of excitement nonstop action and colorful images but this project as a whole doesnt exactly level up families can talk about how the cartoon action in the super mario bros movie compares to that of others youve seen does this kind of violence have more or less impact than whats in liveaction movies what moments did you recognize from the games if youre a fan of the games create your own story about mario luigi and princess peach talk about the behavior mario and luigi experience in brooklyn is spike bullying them is there a difference between that and how marios family speaks to the brothers whats the difference between bullying and razzing if there is one what should you do if someone is trying to put you down how do mario and peach demonstrate perseverance courage and teamwork

Apr 11 2023,negative, your digital subscription includes access to content from all our websites in your region  access unlimited news content and the canberra times app premium subscribers also enjoy interactive puzzles and access to the digital version of our print edition  todays paper this bigbudget animated family film inspired by the nintendo characters that harkens back to the earlier days of computer gaming has strong appeal for a younger audience with big expensive actors  chris pratt charlie day anya taylorjoy  doing the voice work and with a handful of generations having now grown up on these characters it should also have strong appeal to those gens x y millennial and centennial who played mario in his various forms from 8bit to hd many of those folk now the parents or grandparents taking their kids to see something at the movies across the easter school holidays  the missing ingredient for those adult audiences is any kind of wit or clever dialogue in the films screenplay penned by matthew fogel  i mean the witty banter between characters in pixar films like ice age or toy story with layered characters and with emotionally charged stakes  for those living under a rock since the first mario bros computer game was released in 1983 players of this nintendo game use the characters of moustachioed plumbers mario and luigi to walk punch and swing their way through different worlds swinging on vines jumping on mushrooms and bricks and travelling through pipes to rescue a princess in later years the brothers were also available in gocarts and other vehicles  what fogels screenplay does is honour that simple approach constructing a simple narrative to get mario to bashing bricks and jumping on mushrooms quickly and for much of the film  as the film opens brooklyn italianamerican plumbers mario pratt and luigi day are showing off the tv ad theyve shot for their new business and this is the one moment that feels like an authentically cheeky nod back to the games early days it also addresses some of the online criticism the filmmakers received casting the very anglo pratt and day for the voice work neither being particularly italian as the plumbers put on the thick brooklynised italian accents of their parents for their quirky tv ad they also don ridiculous coloured overalls caps and gloves for the ad giving context for these realworld human characters to look like video game characters  heading into the subterranean levels under the brooklyn streets to get to the bottom of some localised flooding the brothers are sucked into a portal to an alternate dimension but are quickly separated with luigi trapped in a cage in the world of evil turtle emperor bowser jack black while mario is in the kingdom of princess peach taylorjoy at my session of the super mario bros movie i sat in front of a school group on excursion probably grade 4 or 5 and absolutely the demographic for this film those kids giggled the whole way through this film and they loved the absolute heck out of it particularly blacks two musical numbers so critical interpretation aside kids will love this film and what the heck do i know but that screenplay is particularly disappointing and will be to older audiences who are looking for a little nuance visually though the film is glorious and colourful and directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic set up fun and familiar action scenes those kids in my audience responded positively to 
Apr 11 2023,positive, the years first buzzworthy tv show was hbos excellent first season of the drama series the last of us based on the sony playstation hit last week brought us the apple tv film tetris not an adaptation of the enduring puzzle game  thankfully  but instead a dramatization of the wild race decades ago to secure rights to the soviet unioncontrolled property fastpaced and entertaining if also lacking any real emotional substance it works best as an homage to the games starting with 1981s donkey kong moving through all the super mario bros titles that came after it on various nintendo consoles and racing into the era of all the mario kart fun after introducing us to the bigandbad bowser jack black kung fu panda  a turtle and king of the koopas who efficiently turns a snowcovered kingdom into the lavafilled dark lands  mario shifts to brooklyn new york where brothers mario chris pratt the lego movie and luigi charlie day horrible bosses have just debuted the commercial for their new plumbing business they really ham up the italian accents in the ad a la itsame mario clearly as a way to acknowledge this part of the franchises past soon theyre off to a job directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic creating a sequence inspired by sidescrolling games such as the early mario entries its well done after mario and luigi are sucked into a pipe and set to the magical realm now endangered by bowser the myriad nods to the games continue as things become threedimensional the brothers are separated with the notasbraveashisbrother luigi finding himself in the dark lands and mario in the mushroom kingdom hey this is no pleasure cruise for him either like any sensible person mario finds mushrooms disgusting with the help of new buddy toad keeganmichael key the lion king mario gains an audience with the benevolent princess peach anya taylorjoy the queens gambit who fears her peaceful land soon will be invaded by bowser and his forces the two team up to rescue luigi and stop bowser peach putting mario through a bit of training and teaching him about powerups that can help him be a magically enhanced version of himself before they venture forward the adventure that follows also brings into the zany fold the titular figure from donkey kong seth rogen the lion king a big gorilla who doesnt exactly hit it off with mario horvath and michael a tandem best known for the teen titans go animated series work from a screenplay by matthew fogel whose credits include last years solid minions the rise of gru like that movie and the entire despicable me franchise mario is made by animation studio illumination this time in collaboration with nintendo as with the despicable mes the minionss and illuminations the secret life of pets flicks mario is interested in showing you a good time and not in giving you a case of the feels unlike with say the best efforts from disneyowned pixar animation studios mario isnt likely to have you reaching for a tissue and as the directors suggest there is a message about the value of perseverance  mario is not a quitter  but its little more than a bit of seasoning while pratts reasonably entertaining mario is the star of the show  and has some enjoyable interactions with rogens kong  the filmmakers get a lot of comedic mileage from blacks bowser especially after his true motivations are revealed part of that is making use of blacks musical abilities in one particularly nice scene and then theres the delightful toad  delightful in no small part to key  and the other cute citizens of the mushroom kingdom one of whom suggests theyre too adorable to die theyre certainly this movies answer to the little yellow minions if not quite that interesting by no means a classic the super mario bros movie should help rid the moviegoing world of any lasting bad taste from 1993s liveaction super mario bros a commercial and critical failure and sure it can feel like one big metaheavy commercial  mario even plans an nes game early on in the affair  but that was to be expected ultimately the super mario brothers movie boasts enough smileinducing moments expected and otherwise that both young viewers and those old enough to have a history with the games can expect a pretty good time
Apr 11 2023,positive, the super mario bros movie is a little too afraid to stray from the brothers origins for its own good but delivers an entertaining adventure all the same the super mario bros movie is the first time nintendos frontman has jumped onto the big screen since 1993s disastrous liveaction outing in this new version directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic have delivered a fun fastpaced but overly familiar adaptation that could have been a little bit more inventive along the way mario games arent exactly renowned for their plots so if youve any experience with the games primary objectivebeat bowser save princess peachyoull pretty much know what youre in for in the super mario bros movie the only major change this time around is that our damsel in distress is not peach but luigi  our duo of plucky plumbers arrives in the mushroom kingdom after being sucked down a green warp pipe after attempting to save realworld brooklyn from a burst water pipe but get separated during the journey into this strange new world big bad bowser is off plotting how best to win princess peachs heart and captures luigi for info on marios whereabouts so he can put a stop to his new rival from then on its all familiar familyfriendly fare mario teams up with the princess to prove his heroic credentials and save his brother from the king of the koopas the plot certainly wont win any awards for complexity but it sure does zoom along at a breakneck pace across the films 92minute runtime were barely given a moment to breathe between marios arrival in the kingdom and his final battle with bowser this helps the movie serve up plenty of action but it wouldve been nice to spend a little bit more time with some of the supporting characters especially as most of the voice performances are pretty solid  jack blacks turn as bowser is the most magnetic presence onscreen his version of the villain is a goofy lovesick titan who yearns for peachs hand in marriage to the point he ends up crooning out a power ballad about the princess in one of the films funniest moments charlie day also embodies marios scaredycat brother with aplomb which is a shame given how hes chained up and absent for a lot of the action by comparison chris pratts mario is serviceable but he remains the weakest of the lot and doesnt really do much to distinguish between himself and his character even if his delivery isnt nearly as catastrophic as the internets reaction would have had you expecting back when the mario movie cast was first revealed illuminations animators certainly made the most of marios history bringing the super mario bros movies world to life the films colorful and crisp and the kingdoms we explore are packed full of easter eggs and nostalgic nods both to mario lore and nintendos wider history ive no doubt youll find deeper and deeper cuts lurking in the background of scenes on a second or third viewing  that visual density is matched by composer brian tylers charming interweaving of koji kondos iconic mario themes and sounds into the score that being said the obvious needledrop moments to tracks like bonnie tylers holding out for a hero and the beastie boys no sleep till brooklyn get it theyre plumbers from brooklyn had me rolling my eyes  there are certainly some wellstaged sequences peppered throughout marios training montage and an early rush through brooklyn ingeniously ape the sidescrolling platforming action of the games and the mario kartmad max mashup that sees mario peach and the kong army taking on bowsers forces on the open road is a thrilling end to the second act  ultimately the biggest complaint is simply that whilst fun the movie is too safe flipping the switch on princess peach making donkey kong and co expert mario kart engineers and having bowsers minions be genuinely bemused by their kings ultimate desire is about as daring as things get and it wouldve been nice to see a little more willingness to poke fun or play around with elements in the mario universe ultimately the film felt more like an exercise in laying some solid foundations for a new movie franchise and ensuring that the mushroom kingdom made its way to the silver screen in a recognizable way in short everything is competently put together but it wouldve been great to have seen some more creativity from the team plenty of signs point to a sequelstick around for a postcredits scene teasing the arrival of one of marios best palsand id wager the super mario bros movie has introduced us to a world that definitely has the potential to build into a bigger and better second outing even if the first could do with a powerup or two of its own  some of his favorite shows are what we do in the shadows bridgerton gangs of london the witcher doctor who and ghosts when hes not watching tv or at the movies martins probably still in front of a screen playing the latest video games reading or watching the nfl
Apr 11 2023,neutral, an impressive hollywood alist voice cast and a script filled with nods to the video game series adds to the appeal although by about the hour mark you might well feel this is just one long chase movie the razorsharp wit of say the lego movie is largely absent here with a story that seems more geared towards pleasing youngsters than their accompanying adults at least the film directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic is a vast improvement on 1993s notoriously bad liveaction super mario bros which starred bob hoskins as the titular mario here chris pratt voices mario joined by charlie day as luigi theyre introduced in amusing fashion  a tv commercial in which these brooklynbased brothers adopt fake italian accents to promote their new plumbing business it feels like a sly wink to the criticism pratt received when the trailer landed with many complaining about the lack of authenticity in his voice work after mario and luigi are separated following a detour into an alternate universe the sliver of a plot sees them butt heads with the turtlelike villain bowser jack black the most evil wretched creature alive he is plotting to rule the world and  if shell have him  marry princess peach anya taylorjoy the leader of the mushroom kingdom desperate to rescue his brother mario has to join forces with peach to fend off bowser the films best moments come when it emulates various mario game iterations early on the siblings are rushing to a plumbing job leaping over obstacles on a building site much like a classic platformstyle video game later mario kart features and theres even a nod to that other nintendo classic donkey kong  the character voiced by seth rogen  with iron girders and barrels included theres clearly a love for the games here right down to the familiar chimes of oldschool sound effects and lessons in how to power up for all the inspired moments  like bowsers piano interlude as he repeatedly croons peachs name  theres a lot that feels lazy too the soundtrack is peppered with obvious 80s hits  take on me holding out for a hero and so on theres also a distinct lack of real jeopardy and by the end the seizureinducing array of primarycolour visuals just gets tiresome this is a film for kids  and mario obsessives  but nobody else
Apr 11 2023,positive, video game adaptations currently find themselves in a interesting place back in the 1990s and 2000s they were often mined for quick cheap schlocky action or family films there was a bit of a lull in terms of game adaptations coming out of hollywood in the late 2000s and earlytomid 2010s but now we are experiencing not just a renaissance but practically a golden age for so long theres been this talk about there being a curse around video game adaptations and thats largely been built on the back of those poor quality films from the earlier era to be fair even back then there was still some good mixed in with the bad films like mortal kombat resident evil and tomb raider were overall mostly met with positive receptions and for the most part actually did accurately adapt if not their respective games correctly overall they at least captured their vibes even the much maligned street fighter film from that time seems to have found a more positive spin as time has gone on and people warmed to the odd campy charm of it and rightfully praise an incredible performance from raul julia as m bison despite this even to this day you have people asking if the next video game adaptation will break the so called curse in the wake of great adaptations like netflixs castlevania series hbos the last of us series pokemon detective pikachu and the sonic the hedgehog movies i think it is fair to say that there was no curse beyond the previous eras being cursed with a lot of bad directors and writers getting into the wheelhouse behind those adaptations so instead when sitting down to write this review i decided to task myself with answering a new question does illuminations the super mario bros movie continue the golden streak i say it ultimately does the super mario bros movie does what many of the other successful adaptations do it captures the spirit of the property to a ridiculous degree it also helps that the mario franchise is not one particularly steeped in deep mythos or multifaceted narratives and complex characters as long as you have mario coming into conflict with bowser in some way you are roughly eighty percent of the way there already the particular story this film goes with is mario and luigi are sucked into the world of the mario franchise via a warp pipe that just happens to be chilling out underground beneath brooklyn thanks to inconvenient warping shenanigans mario lands in the mushroom kingdom while luigi finds himself in the dark lands ruled over by the tyrannical giant dinosaurturtle bowser mario teams up with an adventurous toad namedtoad and princess peach the ruler of the mushroom kingdom to save luigi bowser for his own part has a side story running concurrently with the main story about wanting to marry princess peach as he often wants to do in the video games not exactly shakespeare i know but it doesnt have to be for the most part the story is coherent and flows along just fine if a bit briskly at times the film hops from scene to scene so fast that often nothing really gets a chance to breathe or marinate it breezes through its nowadays abnormal one hour and thirtythree minute runtime so fast it almost feels like watching a speed run of a mario game the characters are by and large in line with their depictions in the games luigi is spot on with his combination of cowardice and bravery when the chips are down it makes sense for there to be a brave and thrillseeking toad as toad has been a playable character in multiple mainline mario games as well as his own spinoff title captain toad and donkey kong is the chestpuffing bravado machine he is often depicted as bowser peach and mario arent as accurate but for the most part the changes to their characters work peach has been more than the stereotypical damsel she has often been ridiculed as being in the games for a long time since the game super mario bros 2 came out and made her playable for the first time in fact she however hasnt usually been this brash badass action girl either thats usually been the role princess daisy has found herself in the overall mario franchise the super mario bros movie taking bowsers obsession with peach and turning him into a full blown simp for her is honestly an inspired choice and leads to many of the films funniest moments by far the biggest change in characterization in the film and one im still not sure im actually fully positive about is that to mario himself hes presented as a bit of a schlub who constantly messes up and appears to be more confident in a way that sometimes borders on cockiness that his abilities cant back up this was arguably the one big risk the film took by deciding to give mario and luigi fish out of water stories in the games the two of them are justthere they are part of that universe and marios confidence is wellfounded because hes very reliable and extremely competent in the games however in the end i dont think that negatively drags the film down at all and they get so many things right that i feel they earned some leniency in some of their missteps one such example of them getting things right is the sequence where luigi lands in the dark lands they nailed the atmosphere and luigis mannerisms so well that i really want to see them tackle a luigis mansion film moving along to the audiovisual aspects of the film ill tackle the elephant in the room the voice acting performances from the cast much ado was made about the cast particularly chris pratt as mario overall i feel the cast did an incredible job pratts mario voice is fine but also just never really felt mario to me outside of a couple lines at the beginning of the film where he does an exaggerated accent as a bit jack black as bowser and charlie day as luigi stole the show for me as i expected them to do when the casting was first announced keeganmichael key seth rogen and anya taylorjoy do great jobs embodying toad donkey kong and princess peach respectively for my money though the biggest surprise voice performance in the film for me was julliet jelenic as lumalee an absolutely darkly hilarious fatalistic luma charles martinet the long time and beloved voice of mario and luigi in the video games did great with what little he ended up getting when they announced he would be involved in the film i really was hoping it was going to be more than the basically glorified cameos we got from him it kinda felt to me like they gave him the absolute minimum bread crumbs they could get away with though they did at least have the foresight to put some respect to his name by giving him a prominent placing in the films credits musically is probably where some of my biggest praises and negative marks for the film lie on the plus side for the movie they use a lot of musical tracks from the greater mario metafranchise and this includes the donkey kong subseries some of the tracks are used straight up as they are in the games while others are fantastic remixes or medleys of multiple tracks spliced together there are also some original music in the film including an absolute ear worm of a track that i just dare you to get out of your head however one big issue with the music in the film that i cant ignore is its abundant use of licensed songs licensed songs being used in animated films is nothing new and is honestly basically a crutch all of the nondisney studios use even when a film can musically stand on its own two feet but in the super mario bros movie not only is it using licensed music but it is using it in all the wrong ways for starters not a single licensed track used actually matches the scene they are put in not a one it is almost impressive how badly they were chosen there are admittedly tenuous connections but you have to tilt your head ninety degrees and go crosseyed while all the planets align during the solstice to see them more egregiously than that they apparently removed at least one ost medley from the donkey kong series that was to be used during the introduction to the kong kingdom to slap a licensed song in its place this makes me wonder how many ost tracks had to be carved out just to spend more money on acquiring these illfitting songs the visuals in this film are fair and away the strongest thing in it without question not only is the film just from an artistic and technical standpoint just gorgeous by every measure possible there is an absolute overload of references and easter eggs to not just mario games but other nintendo properties as well you will legitimately exhaust yourself spotting something you recognize and then doing the famous leonardo dicaprio finger point meme one particularly inspired scene that had my eyes glaze over in pure fanboy bliss was early in the film where mario and luigi traverse the streets of brooklyn stylized like it was a stage from one of the 2d sidescrolling mario games while the mario characters have widely been some of the most expressive characters in nintendos vast stable illumination have gone above and beyond the call of duty giving them new expressions never seen before on them this is the best nintendos flagship characters have ever looked from a visual fidelity standpoint and makes the wait for the successor to nintendos switch platform all the more painful i cannot say that the super mario bros movie was devoid of flaws there are certainly multiple ones to point out but despite any issues i had with the film they just couldnt overcome the pure sense of joy i got from this movie watching this movie transported me back to the turn of the millennium when i first entered the colorful mushroom kingdom myself on my game boys wahoo
Apr 11 2023,neutral,it is when all is said and done intensely mediocre prettier than a lot of animated mediocrity but pretty only takes us so far
Apr 10 2023,positive, im just going to cut to the chase  the super mario bros movie is one of the most divisive video game movies in recent memory with a 56 critic score and a 96 audience score on rotten tomatoes at the time of writing this so i went into this with no concrete expectations just curiosity about what to expect  as a fan of the mario games myself i couldnt hide my excitement of course i was apprehensive but video game movies have been getting better over the years  an impressive feat considering the genres flopridden cinematic history but with films like sonic the hedgehog detective pikachu and werewolves within sweeping the box office these movies have been changing the game  sorry bad pun intended this is something ive always said about childrens movies most critics have forgotten who the audience is the super mario bros movie was made for children not for you and yes ive heard the argument a thousand times from a thousand critics with mushrooms stuffed up their bums that this movie is purely a vessel to push the marketing for universals nintendo world theme park forward and honestly i dont care im so excited to visit that theme park and this movie made me even more excited good marketing sure whatever good movie absolutely and thats all i care about  i had an absolute blast watching this film its fan service at its best and it isnt forced down the audiences throat not to mention the incredible casting i really didnt expect to like chris pratts voice but it was perfect and jack black as bowser literally the best decision hollywood has ever made its all there its awesome and as a mario fan its so much fun i mean honestly what did you expect a deeper dive into the stories of mario and luigi mario has never been deep  its not supposed to be its a game its fun its silly we love it and yet this movie supplies a solid plot with exciting twists and turns that make the whole experience like a thrill ride down the rainbow road  most importantly i went to see this with my boyfriends 9yearold brother  and watching the pure joy on his face made me fall in love with this film he was laughing cheering and gasping every time he recognized a power up or a shy guy and everything in between he loved it so much that he wanted to take a picture next to the poster afterwards while sporting his bright red mario hat with pride to me all a movie needs to do is bring us joy and the super mario bros movie succeeds in every way 
Apr 10 2023,positive, hugh grant seems so much happier now that hes playing the villain as a romantic hero he seemed fantastically ill at ease indeed he turned that unease into the motor of some of the most beautifully calibrated comic performances we have seen in the romcom  even if his pairings with andie macdowell in four weddings and julia roberts in notting hill also won the award for the relationship you least believed would last beyond the closing credits does anyone buy that robertss anna scott would have put up with all that bumbling what chance the long haul of a relationship for a chap who cant get through a sentence
Apr 10 2023,positive, here is a video game adaptation that quite literally stays true to the source material the super mario bros movie is the most accurate cinematic depiction you may ever get of the famous nintendo title if you were born in a timeline beginning with the 1980s then mario and luigi are there in your popular entertainment memories even if you never played the game youve seen the two plumbers somewhere this movie has a particular at times fleeting charm that derives from how it simply imagines the games creations as a palpable digitally possible world in a way its an example of how animation is truly the only way to make a super mario movie talking mushroom people warlord turtles and cocky gorillas wearing ties all make sense when illustrated forget the story because its completely ludicrous switch off the need for narrative and this is a trippy experience full of absurd vistas bursting with color its recommended you dont sit too far away from the screen so as to truly soak it in like the hippies who used to drop lsd  during showings of 2001 a space odyssey there is a plot however mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day are italianamerican siblings and plumbers trying to get their business going in 1980s brooklyn no one takes them seriously least of all their family with the exception of mom when a water main break sends the pair rushing to prove themselves something goes wrong and they are sucked into a portal after traversing some colorful wormholes they are separated but end up in another quite sunny dimension mario finds himself in the mushroom kingdom ruled by the sweet princess peach anya taylorjoy her realm is currently being threatened by the koopa troop army of bowser jack black a snarling turtle warlord who wants to marry peach and rule the world bowser has captured luigi becoming very irritated at the prospect of his prisoners brother snatching away his bride despite the older audience members who will be attending the super mario bros movie brimming with nostalgia it should be made clear this movie is more of a roller coaster for elementary schoolers it doesnt have the sense of overall lessons you get from captain underpants or the angry birds movie but there are some easily digestible themes bowser is a deluded thug who wants to force peach into marriage mario and luigi need to find the courage to believe in each other no matter what others think the deepest character is a talking blue star in one of bowers dungeons who cheerfully issues depressing observations about despair death and how time is an illusion like hope mario tends to inspire such ideas the last feature film featuring the character was the now forgotten 1993 super mario bros starring bob hoskins and john leguizamo in a grimy liveaction take it was a goofy dystopian vision with messages about totalitarianism thats how it was done in the 90s directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic with a team of brilliant animators are really just using the story as a way to then dive headlong into nintendo world were taken on the trip of inhabiting the super mario environment made so vivid with a rather astounding palette the mushroom kingdom is bathed in blinding sunshine and cascading waterfalls bowser sits on a throne surrounded by rock and lava mario traverses the mushroom kingdom through pipes that crisscross forever then battles donkey kong seth rogen in a stony arena where we can feel gravity slipping away when he needs to punch those famous power boxes from the game granting him mushrooms that can either bulk his size or make him tiny theres a thrilling chase over a rainbow that feels like mad max fury road meets tron  what the filmmaking team does is essentially transfer the experience of playing the game into something to be viewed tied together by a sparse story mario jumping from box to box evading piranha plants is turned into a real action scene  while the cast has some notables their presence is barely felt considering the movie truly just exists as a visual delight jack black is the one real standout as bower he has a moment of genuine comedy when playing a demented elton johnstyle serenade for peach on his piano fred armisen is cranky kong who sees his son donkey as a showboat and screw up theres nothing else to them bowers own wedding scheme is as bad as any concocted by a lonely person with serious autonomy issues his minions like the sorcerer kamek kevin michael richardson are just there to make funny squeaky noises the real entertainment is in the exciting grand action scenes where mario and luigi attain powers and do a lot of punching gliding spinning and setting off colorful explosions these sequences have such impressive artistry it is fun to just marvel at them or consider some calmer moments full of operatic overkill like bower attacking a kingdom of penguins emerging from the flames like something out of lord of the rings brian tyler scores the movie with some grandiose sounds combined with koji kondos original nintendo themes  for naysayers the question might be how else could you make a super mario bros movie video game adaptations have had poor reputations because of filmmakers trying too hard to adjust the game to a movie plot recent standouts like the last of us on hbo are an exception because the original game itself is essentially a film the super mario bros movie is a worthy take on its source material because its absolutely true to it the recent sonic the hedgehog movies were hits yet as stories they suffer from dumping the endless creativity of live action and attempting to find logic in its blue sneakerwearing hedgehog walking around the real world the super mario bros movie is designed to be looked at with goofball humor that kids will like they will at least also get a lesson in how forcing someone into marriage when they dont like you and your rampaging armies is unacceptable if you cant accept this somewhat successful bit of movie candy on its own terms you may have just grown out of it
Apr 10 2023,positive,a simple fun story i was a fan
Apr 10 2023,negative,the whole package is a deranged mishmash of overstimulating elements
Apr 10 2023,positive, after 30 years of waiting fans of the super mario bros can see their plumber protagonists get a shot at cinematic redemption the all new animated adaptation promises greater respect to the source material that will somehow condense decades of games into one simple narrative a narrative that includes mushroom people ruled by a human princess seeking the aid of talking gorillas in the fight against the wrath of a giant spikeshelled firebreathing dragon turtle  making the world of mario accessible to the outside world is a tall order thankfully the creators of the super mario bros movie have found a way forward starting of course with mario himself whos given a relatable downonhisluck backstory to get audiences on his side when his plumbing business becomes more of a laughingstock than a success he and his brother luigi make a last ditch attempt to save the city of brooklyn from a disastrous busted water main in their attempts to shock the world with their pipe skills theyre sucked into a portal and whisked away to the mushroom kingdom the hows and whys of the super mario bros movie will likely have you head scratching to oblivion which is a fact the film is keenly aware of the movie moves through plot points at a clip barely giving you a chance to pick them apart in contrast is the films treatment of its characters whose motivations couldnt be more clearly defined an emphasis on character through action makes marios wizard of ozesque adventure an easy pill to swallow even if viewers might find its nonsensical plot development a little disorienting  the voice actors in play give those characters justice with jack black as the films shining star giving it his all as the villain bowser charlie day and chris pratt pull off the brotherly bond of mario and luigi anya taylorjoy as princess peach is relatably regal keegan michaelkey finds a way to make the annoying sidekick of toad more endearing than irritating and seth rogens donkey kong sounds like seth rogen not that theres anything wrong with that  the film is chockfull of easter eggs for eagle eyed fans but never at the cost of the movies momentum the plot is simplistic but rooted in character that makes you care why its all taking place the animated action is exhilarating with a clever twist on marios two dimensional origins fans of the mario bros can take to the streets and cheer as justice gets done to the characters they covet 
Apr 10 2023,positive,the super mario brothers movie is a sweet funny action packed and beautifully animated film with a touching underdog story some fantastic world building that honors the game and great vo work from this cast especially chris pratt and jack black  
Apr 9 2023,neutral,its fan service above all else regressively so structuring a threadbare story around iconography linked to source material just isnt enough
Apr 9 2023,positive, super mario bros has been one of the most popular video games for nearly 40 years and watching the joyous colorful new film concoction its easy to see why its not just that the story of two brothers getting trapped in a portal is fun for kids its the added notion that two brothers can stick together no matter what obstacle is in their path even if its a villain named bowser directed by aaron horvarth and michael jelnic super mario bros gains a lot from its message of brotherly love those who play video games know how bad these updates can be do we even need to mention the live action super mario movie from 1993 fans are tired of seeing their favorite ip ruined on screen at this point but this one stays true to the source material visually and narratively and its packed with so many easter eggs that one has to wonder if the easter release date is some sort of meta joke anyone who has played the game will recognize the callbacks from the title card to the intro of mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day who arrive on screen to koji kandos original score against a backdrop of brooklyn apartments the pair set out on their very first plumbing gig which suitably lands them in hot water when luigi falls down a pipe and disappears mario embarks on a mission to save his brother from the clutches of bowser jack black the turtle intent on taking over mushroom kingdom with the help of princess peach anyataylor joy he learns to navigate this terrain which has been made to look like a floating obstacle course the animated levels are brought to life by nintendo and illumination entertainment best known for the despicable me and minions movies along with the characters mario encounters along the way theres a fight scene with toad keeganmichael key a showdown with kong seth rogen and a finale with bowser all of which come together in a wonderfully appealing mashup as it turns out if you write a funny script and hire talented actors to voice it it doesnt really matter if the movie is a bunch of people running around in overalls saying things like game on as long as the wowfactor is there were happy to watch mario deliver lines over a busy screen pratt turns in a winning wonderful and whimsical performance as the titular hero with his spry voice he brings a sense of humanity to the proceedings which would not have been the case had he stuck to the games italian accent when he discovers his brothers location the character sounds like hes going to cry instead of bake a pizza super mario bros plot is simple and its emotions are easy to understandits clearly geared toward kids but its also a wily adventure for all when mario eventually reconnects with luigi its a moment that lands with the intended emotional bang instead of the thud seen in other cartoon movies its a rarity in animation and hovarth brings the right amount of depth to make us really believe in the brothers relationship as for the special effects theyre winners too editors note the disclaimer below refers to advertising posts and does not apply to this or any other editorial stories la weekly editorial does not and will not sell content
Apr 9 2023,negative, kids will probably love this scattershot dash through nintendos most popular properties but then kids rarely the most discerning audience members at the best of times will routinely mistake familiarity for fun  something that this lazy picture exploits extensively musical motifs from beloved games minor characters nods to the mario legacy all were greeted with shrieks of excitable recognition at the screening i attended the super mario bros movie is a frantic easter egg hunt of a film that does the bare minimum to please its loyal existing fanbase those less enthralled by the antics of the moustachioed italian plumber will wonder which of donkey kongs weaponised barrels this joyless noisy mess was scraped from
Apr 9 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie was made for the fans if you love the mario games or nintendo in general youll have a lot of fun
Apr 8 2023,neutral,the super mario bros movie is supernostalgic but not superfun  granted i havent regularly played home video games since nba jam circa 1995
Apr 8 2023,negative, if i were younger or less secure in my position as a film critic i would probably spend more time trying to emphasize that i went into the super mario bros movie with the socalled open mind while the nes and super nes platforms had their heyday while i was in graduate school meaning that i dont have the same fond memories of them that i do for the atari 2600 or arcade versions of donkey kong they still elicit deep nostalgia in me i spent hours playing dr mario on the gameboy and i cherish the recollections of vacations i spent getting through donkey kong country 2 and 3 and mario kart at my own brothers home  that openness lastedten minutes maybe the super mario bros movie doesnt sink to the level of outright badness but only because it never even tries to rise above the level of a ninetyminute commercial criticisms such as they are probably begin and end with the story mario and luigi live in either our world or a multiverse animated version of it either way they are magically transformed into the land of toad princess and bowser which has no backstory beyond that bowser wants to marry peach  mario and luigi are affable losers but losers nevertheless theyve just spent a bunch of money on a television commercial that nets them one plumbing job they are to fix a leaky faucet it is a pedestrian plumbing job at which they fail miserably validating the criticism of their scoffers including their family that advertising their services was a colossal waste of money one might expect  i know i certainly did  that the purpose of making them put down and put upon in the real world is so that the magical world would be a welcome transformation reminding kids of the escape value of video games where anyone who is not valued in the world around them can still be the hero but when they get to nintendoverse or toadland or princessville or whatever it might be called luigi is immediately captured and mario is shown to be equally incompetent in this world peach has an obstacle course that he has to complete to prove that he is worthy to accompany her but after the obligatory montage even rocky had a montage he still cant do it  one might expect  i know i certainly did  that this failure would be the setup for a more satisfying success when the stakes are on the line but no peach continues to channel her inner lara croft and mario continues to channel his inner scott pilgrim a word too about luigis capture hes banished to a hanging cage for most of the movie making the films first and thirdact messaging about brotherhood and teamwork being the key to success oddly pointless i suspect the creative team feared that a traditional plumber rescuing the princess from a monster story might alienate a 21stcentury audience but the movie doesnt so much deconstruct the sexist parts of the game and fairytale mythology as ignore them and really is a beauty and the beast reconstruction where a feisty princess agrees to marry so that an allpowerful dictator agrees not to kill her people really any more egalitarian confusingly the only one seeming to even try is jack black as bowser and while he does draw the occasional chuckle for channeling his school of rockhigh fidelity charming doofus persona that makes the sexual predation at the heart of the storyline less sinister but no less gross its hard to take him seriously as a threat so maybe little kids wont be scared but absent any real menace there are no stakes and the heroes seem that much lamer for not being able to outwit or outfight a doofus  i wasnt expecting pixar but the heroes end where they started not having been transformed by their experiences or learning anything from them if the goal was to remind us how much fun some of these games were back in the day mission accomplished i guess if the goal was to make us want to play them again or play their descendants on new platforms the film is an epic failure 
Apr 8 2023,positive, the curse of the video game movie seems over a string of successful hits turned around the genre in the past few years pokémon detective pikachu uncharted and mortal kombat all landed positive praise the last of us just dominated television however none of these hold a candle to the worldwide appeal of super mario thirty years after the original film the worlds favorite plumbers return to the big screen leaning heavily into nostalgia the super mario bros movie delivers fun action sequences however an overreliance on easter eggs and pop music dampens the fun  directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic the super mario bros movie follows the titular brothers as they begin an unusual adventure trying to kickstart their fledgling business mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day dive into the sewers their local brooklyn neighborhood is flooding and when they get down to the pipes they are sucked into another world when the nefarious bowser jack black captures luigi mario learns how to beat the king koopa with the help of princess peach anya taylorjoy their adventure takes them throughout the mushroom kingdom and kong kingdom  the animation from illumination takes a giant step up from the minions films the mushroom kingdom bursts to life with effervescent colors these designs help sell us to the world at times the super mario bros movie overuses the side scroller blocks however the settings usually make sense too much time is spent in our real world which ultimately hurts the movie these designs while loaded with easter eggs are far less visually intriguing the visuals do an excellent job of helping to build out the world luckily the super mario bros movie opts for show rather than tell for most of these moments as characters gain new powerups and skills the directors communicate the changes through action set pieces and montages even showing a horde of yoshis run through the background helps the world build  however the constant use of easter eggs undermines some of these moments accents costumes and tech all comes straight from the games the super mario bros movie often becomes too selfaware for its own good undermining the feelings of its characters becomes somewhat commonplace even mushrooms catch stray bullets from the protagonist  simultaneously illumination returns to an odd problem theyve developed across their films simply labeling a character as cute and using that as a joke feels more like a formula than a genuine comedic moment the super mario bros movie takes that issue to the extreme with at least three characters using cute or adorable as the punchline it might not be so glaring if this issue did not cross franchises including despicable me the grinch and sing  the vocal performances greatly vary in quality but overall the ensemble keeps us engaged taylorjoys peach feels off at times but also steals the film for stretches this comes in part because of how the screenwriters clearly use super princess peach as inspiration black easily wins the movie with his growling comedic and menacing bowser he will and should be the takeaway for most pratt and day get to drop the caricature accents but even then pratt struggles day brings chaos to luigi which undeniably works  perhaps the most glaring issue that stands out in the super mario bros movie comes in the form of source music boasting a soundtrack with a half dozen extremely well know pop hits makes little sense super mario long established the best soundtrack in the video game world the tracks are iconic in their own right its odd to go this route with the music 
Apr 8 2023,negative, it has been 30 years since audiences were treated to a bigscreen iteration of the beloved nintendo video game series super mario bros with bob hoskins and john leguizamo starring as the titular brooklyn siblings and plumbersturnedheroes mario and luigi that liveaction adaptation however was at the time universally loathed by critics and audiences alike and ultimately failed to recoup its hefty budget resulting in nintendo ceos refusal to license out the property in fear of another gargantuan boondoggle it was only upon meeting with chris meledandri the head of animation studio illumination  otherwise known as the house that despicable me built  that nintendo had a change of heart leading to this weeks release of the fullyanimated the super mario bros movie  it was always a curious decision why disney decided to go the liveaction route all those years ago as the property had generally catered to a younger demographic and the derringdo involved in the franchises action seemed nearly impossible to replicate in the real world  especially when you have a 50yearold actor playing the bouncy lead character traversing a fantastical world made up of giant talking turtles and mushrooms 1993s version was indeed an undeniable shitshow on its face but it also had something resembling a point of view and clear personality elements sorely lacking from 2023s exercise in brand extension the definition of art by committee even to dub the final product soulless wouldnt be quite accurate as that would imply there were ever aspirations for something greater than nostalgia make no mistake while the candycolored animation and emphasis on kinetic action sequences suggests that the film is intended for children its really a ploy for those 25 to 55yearolds who have nothing but fond memories of playing the original series and its various spinoffs wistful in their longing for a simpler time even as a good percentage of that demo still spend their current free time playing video games the snake is indeed eating its own tale resulting in a movie that is nothing but callbacks and easter eggs to the video games themselves allowing its older viewers to furiously masturbate with one hand while highfiving their bud with the other a selfcongratulatory chorus of i know what that is filling auditoriums across the country  its predictable then that the super mario bros movie has only the faintest wisp of a plot koopa baddie bowser jack black plans to attack the appropriately named mushroom kingdom in a lastditch effort to woo his beloved princess peach anya taylorjoy meanwhile mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day have just started their own plumbing business after enduring constant harassment from former boss spike sebastian maniscalco a move which seems both entirely understandable and healthy but one which causes marios father to call him both a bum and a loser because animated films are seemingly only a vessel for daddy issues these days its while trying to stop a massive line break in the sewers of brooklyn that the two brothers are sucked through a magical warp pipe and transported to another dimension one with a giant anthropomorphized turtle monster who desperately wants to make love to a human they inadvertently get separated on their journey with mario winding up in the aforementioned mushroom kingdom while luigi is forced to endure various tortures at the hands of one king bowser mario ultimately teams up with princess peach in an effort to save both the kingdom and his little brother relying on some help from raging narcissist donkey kong seth rogen along the way and there we are so much of the action in the super mario bros movie is predicated on the gameplay itself which certainly makes sense in theory but is rendered here with all of the subtlety of a barrelthrowing gorilla consistency be damned the end result feels as though someone threw the entire series in a cuisinart and pressed pulverize a car race a la mario kart yep marios raccoon suit from part three you bet princess peachs floating dress from part two yes its all here but incorporated in the most facile ways possible the animation is as obvious as the films desperation for audience approval a combination of photorealistic backgrounds and characters with bulbous overexaggerated features that stick out like sore thumbs the voice work is likewise generally uninspired with pratt spitting out a mamma mia every couple of minutes and speaking of his brother with a passionate reverence that brings to mind not a beloved sibling but a particularly successful grindr hookup black tries his hardest and predictably fares best even getting to perform an 80sera pop rock power ballad that recalls some of the lesser works of his own tenacious d but even that is presented in a way that feels more spring breakers and less music video which sounds awesome in theory but really just reminds audience members that they could be watching that masterpiece instead of this dung heap  props however are due for composer brian tyler who takes the various themes of the original games and gives them a wholly appropriate and energized 21stcentury spin that captivates more than anything else on screen indeed tyler succeeds where directors michael jelenic and aaron horvath completely fail  specifically in delivering a modern update that feels simultaneously singular and reverent the only thing this super mario bros has admiration for are the contents of the audiences wallets all in the name of hollow nostalgiabaiting and while also delivering a message that to those unfamiliar with the series basically amounts to you will need performanceenhancing drugs to defeat your enemy and get the girl on second thought maybe this really is a movie for our current time letsa go
Apr 8 2023,positive,the creative team seems to rely heavily on the nostalgia and the silliness of it all over taking this in a bold and new direction like the lego movie 
Apr 8 2023,positive,the super mario bros movie is bombastic silly and full of energy driven by spectacular voice work provided by an alist cast the film gets props for both being able to appeal to fans of the game and just regular viewers its a very fun watch
Apr 8 2023,positive, on september 13th 1985 the world of video games and entertainment changed forever with nintendos release of super mario bros while the character first appeared in 1981s donkey kong this was the first game that would feature mario and his brother luigi not only did the game save the video game industry after the crash of the early 80s but it was also critically acclaimed the game sold over 58 million units throughout its run and created two giant pop culture stars in mario and luigi it rose nintendo to become one of the most prominent companies in the world over the past 38 years numerous games and increased popularity culminated with the first attempt to bring the famous plumbers to film 1993s super mario bros has become a cult classic but upon initial release was both a critical and commercial failure as it grossed only 389 million that put the plumbers back into the video game world until 2023 when illumination and universal released the super mario bros movie aaron horvath and michael jelenics the super mario bros movie warps you back into childhood with nostalgia and dino eggs impeccably animated with a score thats an utter delight the film captures the charm and appeal the game has evoked for decades the super mario bros movie follows brooklyns favorite plumbers mario and luigi labeled by their old boss as failures and offered little to no support by their family the brothers spend their life savings on advertising their business with an 80s stylecommercial which also homages the old super mario bros cartoon that starred the late great captain lou albano with little to no luck on their side mario takes things into his own hands when an overflowing water main is uncontainable what starts as two brothers trying to do whats best turns into a descent for mario into the mushroom kingdom while luigi falls into the dark lands while his brother is stuck in the dark lands mario enlists the help of princess peach and a lovely toad before bowser gets his hands on him matthew fogels screenplay track record can be considered widely acclaimed as it has included the illumination sequel minions big mommas house and the lego movie with the super mario bros movie fogel maintains a simplicity to his script that followed the same formula as the game which leads to the ultimate success of the films intentions as a result fogel horvath and jelenics goal to create an actionadventure rich with easter eggs for gamers worldwide was successful the super mario bros movies animation is sensational in an era where most animated films are immaculately animated the film offers some of the most stunning and visually engaging animations in quite some time beautifully capturing the essence of the games speaking on the nature of the games its hard to ignore brian tyler and koji kondos nostalgic score which fully engrosses you in the world of mario and is one if not the most iconic video game scores of all time on the performance side of things the elephant in the room that was chris pratt as mario can be laid to rest as pratt is quite good as mario lending his voice to create a new iteration of the iconic plumber while charlie days luigi is welcomed he unfortunately takes a back seat in the film anya taylorjoys princess peach and jack blacks bowser are the standouts joy is fierce as the princess of the mushroom kingdom at the same time black is downright hilarious with a musical moment that will warrant a future bowsers musical selections drop on apple music and spotify the super mario bros movie does fall into the illumination tropes with overuse of modern music that often leads to cringeworthy moments however the totality of the super mario bros movie is a high score and one that will lead gamers across the country to scream wahoo in unison
Apr 8 2023,negative, the most positive praise that can be bestowed on the super mario bros movie is that its not as bad as 1993s super mario bros unless this film was an unfocussed mess of plotlines and motivations its a better picture almost by default the illumination animation studio doesnt screw around when it comes to developing animated movies aimed to please general audiences they also dont add much flair to make them stand out amid the tougher competition of pixar and dreamworks whereas other animated studios always felt like they were developing complete stories illuminations features always felt like a patchwork of funny vignettes that rarely culminate all that well the super mario bros movie is not that much different it tries to find many fun things to do with the mario franchise coats it with frenetic animated slapstick sequences plops on a jukebox soundtrack and unleashes an onslaught of popculture references i can only assume many nintendo fans will be too busy counting all the citations to various mario games to notice how little the characters are explored in this overstuffed lostworld fantasy crammed into 90 minutesmarios many mini arcsthe characters have

and youll probably be rightsource universal picturesthe other problem with illuminations films is that they always feel like more of a series of set pieces that overshadow most of the script this film succumbs to the same difficulties resulting in character arcs that are either treated like bookends or fall off the map amid all the fastpaced action this makes the film all the more frustrating considering it works in bits and pieces but doesnt come together by the end at least in terms of developing its ensembleconclusion the super mario bros moviemarios animated movie debut is too safe and passive more content with referencing its source material than playing with it i kept waiting for the film to take off and find that special powerup to make this video game icon shine bright sadly it mostly just gives the italian plumber the illumination makeover treatment dressing the character up in a flashy animated film fit for families familiar enough for box office success and routine in its vignettes of good ideas that never amount to a great movieif youre a hardcore mario and nintendo fan id probably recommend the film on its surface levels of slathering so much nintendo product into its animation but much like nintendos previous commercial movie the wizard theres only so much nintendo one can take before the productplacement strings become visibly distracting its fans will likely revere it for its passable presentations bringing the format of platform gaming into movies and once more breaking the longdebunked myth of the video game movie curse as for everyone else itll likely

Apr 7 2023,positive, the pitch okay there are these two brothers see and theyre plumbers in fact the mario brothers chris pratt as mario charlie day as luigi have just opened up their own plumbing business though despite marios natural agility business could be better thats why when a massive water emergency shakes up their home borough of brooklyn they leap at the chance to save their borough  only to stumble upon a mysterious pipe deep within the sewers that transports them away to a wild new universe good news moms and dads ill just cut to the chase here for any parents reading this  it might not be the best film of the year but youre going to be able to watch the super mario bros movie more than once without losing your dang mind cant say for sure how many repeat viewings itll hold up under but the new animated film clocking in at a tight 93 minutes is a fastpaced visually appealing and overall loving tribute to the nintendo games enjoyed now by multiple generations thats games plural for a reason the pretty thin narrative somehow also manages to feel a little overstuffed in order to incorporate both another iconic nintendo character donkey kong voiced by seth rogen as well as an extended sequence bringing the beloved mario kart franchise to the screen the sequence is done well but real talk the wachowskis did it better the needle drops are sometimes fun but wielded with brute force  were talking beastie boys no sleep till brooklyn blaring as the brothers run through the streets of brooklyn fortunately theres no attempt at dated topical humor no grating musical numbers blacks bowser gets all the songs leaning hard on his heavy metal chops and theyre pretty good plus any opportunity directors aaron horvath and michael jelenic have to include a nintendo easter egg youd better believe they use it
Apr 7 2023,negative,its emotionally bland and yet garish enough to psychologically sedate the preteen easter audience
Apr 7 2023,positive, is the nintendo world the most untapped piece of ip mario luigi and the rest of the crew have dominated video game culture for over 40 years yet a theatrical feature film has not been attempted since the illfated 1993 campfest starring bob hoskins john leguizamo and dennis hopper gone are the steampunk influences and live action hamminess universals new foray into the mushroom kingdom is a bright glossy and impressive animated tale that bears appropriate semblance to the game while also having the zany plushness of an illumination tale while the super mario world is wellrendered through animation is the movie good enough to warrant going to theaters rather than playing the video game at home when we meet mario chris pratt and luigi charlie day they are brooklyn plumbers looking to start their own business much to the chagrin of their family and former boss spike a plumbing emergency in the streets of brooklyn prompts the two brothers to hop into action and prove themselves as the areas premiere plumbers zany calamity ensues with both brothers ending up far below the surface of the city where they discover a green pipe this pipe sucks both of them up spitting them out into very different lands mario lands in the mushroom kingdom a technicolor wonderland that resembles munchkinland if all the munchkins had mushroomlike hats toad keegan michaelkey decides to help the outsider taking him to see princess peach anya taylorjoy meanwhile luigi crash lands in the dark lands getting almost immediately captured by the nefarious bowser mario and peach team up to defeat bowser saving luigi and the mushroom kingdom in one swoop from the moment mario touches down in the mushroom kingdom were thrust into a goofy adventure the film will often revert to a flat 2dlike display where our characters go up and down various platforms and through colorful pipes dodging obstacles and hitting power ups along the way at super speed character development takes a backseat to razzle dazzle marios greatest change from beginning to end is learning to stomach mushrooms a food he despised back home in brooklyn what keeps the film from being just a cheap regurgitation of ip points is the enthusiasm and infectious whimsy of the plot these fun callback moments to the classic games are enhanced by the way they up the ante of the story peach trains mario using what would be a classic level with disappearing platforms piranha plants fire bars and more these are all fun callbacks but in the context of the film this scene provides an energetic training montage that shows mario harnessing his inner strength and bonding with peach all while guaranteeing to get laughs from kids when we reach kong island donkey kong seth rogen and mario face off in an arena setup that is part super smash bros with a bit of the 8 bit arcade game sensibilities its so clearly aping a video game level but still arrives at an objective that moves the story forward the film may be aiming for fans with these callbacks but the set pieces and story progression are all squarely aimed at kids who will likely eat this film up its not as smart or elegant as the lego movie but its similarly visually engaging and exciting
Apr 7 2023,positive, im pretty sure the super mario bros movie proves that movie critics are wildly out of touch with audiences when it comes to video game adaptations and really when it comes to lots of genre stuff in general when i saw that the movie was at a lousy 54 on rotten tomatoes i was initially pretty worried when i went out and read some of the reviewsincluding reviews lamenting the movies story or calling it offensive because bowser wants to marry princess peach against her willi knew it was more likely because the critics must be crazy sure enough the movie ended up being absolutely delightful its a great fun beautifully animated story of mario luigi toad peach donkey kong and a colorful zany cast of nintendo characters fighting off bowser and his armies in the mushroom kingdom theres mario kart racing theres a donkey kong arena battle its wonderful the music is straight from the games with a nice cinematic onceover and its just the right length oneandahalf hours long the theater i saw it in had lots of very enthusiastic kids but all the teens and grownups were having fun too this is all reflected in the films rotten tomatoes audience score which currently sits at 96 compared to the grumpy outoftouch critics score of 54 thats certified fresh vs decidedly rotten and the critics are wrong on this one folks beyond just the audience score on rt the cinemascore for the movie is a solid a many consider this a much more accurate sampling of moviegoers since that score is taken in postscreening surveys at the theaters themselves rather than just the most enthusiastic fans online all i can think is that the target audience here is nintendo fans not just kids as some have suggested but fans of these games going back to when i was a kid im 41 and grew up with nintendo games and these characters have been as important and dear to me and to many of my peers as any comic book superheroes or lord of the rings characters there just has never really been a great mario movie other than the wizard made until now its crazy within a week the first really excellent dd movie and the first really excellent mario bros movie came out what are the chances in any case a lot of these movie critics must not play much mario or know much about mario because the magic is apparently lost on far too many of them thats a shame this movie is absolutely great a very faithful very fun adaptation of one of the most popular and beloved video game franchises of all time go see it on the biggest screen you can find you can read my review of dungeons  dragons honor among thieves right here ill post my full review of the super mario bros movie here on this blog soon you can also follow me on twitter and facebook and support my work on patreon if you want you can also sign up for my diabolical newsletter on substack and subscribe to my youtube channel

Apr 7 2023,positive, the super mario bros movie is fun funny entertaining and tailor made for those who are huge fans of the game my inner child was grinning from ear to ear and i commend the filmmakers for successfully presenting the world building the game details and the iconic tunes by intertwining them with the films score this video game adaptation is directed by aaron horvath and michael jelenic it features the voices of chris pratt anya taylorjoy charlie day jack black keeganmichael kay and seth rogen when brothers mario and luigi leave their job to open their own plumbing company they face doubt and disappointment from their family one day they enter the citys sewer and come across a magical pipe that takes them to another realm the brothers are separated and must find a way back to each other without exaggerating i can confess that i was transported back to my childhood it rekindled specific memories i hadnt visited in decades sevenyearold rosa would often play mario bros on my neighbors nintendo my family couldnt afford one so all my experience came from playing with others those happy times resurfaced while watching this film and that nostalgic feeling of joy is something i wholeheartedly appreciate every nostalgic cord in my being was momentarily awakened the animation was beautiful and very authentic to the game its colorful aesthetic will appeal to the younger audience and the runtime is the perfect length to hold their attention it does feel like a commercial to the variety of characters games and worlds within this video game franchise so parents youve been warned the voice acting worked very well pratt was excellent as mario but jack black takes the mvp trophy he is perfect as bowser but it is black so we already know his singing skills are superb although in second place came lumalee who had the best one liners and jokes taylorjoy as peach is also flawless because anya is peach in every single sense of the word kay as toad was also great and days luigi also worked wonderfully rogens donkey kong may be my least favorite out of the bunch but i didnt dislike it the story is simple and formulaic but i dont expect a highly complex and layered plot from a video game adaptation i did buy into the brothers dynamic their bond and their need to succeed some funny moments worked for me maybe it was my inner child having the time of her life and i relished the abundance of references to the games if youre not a big fan of the video game then i wouldnt recommend seeing this film but if you grew up playing or you currently play then this may be a fun time at the theaters overall the super mario bros movie is an entertaining adaptation that stays true to its source material a dream come true to fans whove played the game religiously and a visually stunning animated feature for the kiddos rosa parra is a rotten tomatoesapproved film critic a member of leja latino entertainment journalists association and a member of oaffc online association of female film critics she is currently working on her bachelors degree in film and media studies she is a chicana born and raised in east la and currently resides in el monte ca
Apr 7 2023,positive, the last time mario and luigi were in a bigscreen theatrical movie with the 1993 film super mario bros the film was a gigantic flop and nintendo didnt make motion picture adaptations of its beloved properties for almost 30 years nintendos longtime ban on film adaptations has finally ended with the new cgianimated movie produced by illumination the super mario bros movie depicting the adventures of the iconic video game duo in an animated feature format was the ideal choice for the brooklyn plumbers the film faithfully recreates the worlds of nintendos interactive adventures onscreen for a vibrant fun and heartwarmingly sweet tale animation is the ideal format for adapting the adventures of mario and luigi since there is no predilection for grounding the material to make it look more realistic and palatable for a liveaction audience illumination and codirectors aaron horvath and michael jelenic embrace the visual look style and characters of nintendos games the animators do not stray far from the established and iconic designs of the worlds and characters of super mario bros right down to the mushroom kingdom the cheep cheeps goombas and bloopers theyre all here and appear faithful to their game counterparts the animators of illumination went wild to bring the world of the games to life without skimping on all the imaginative wild concepts at the heart of  super mario bros is the bond of its two wouldbe heroes mario pratt and luigi day the duo just quit their day job as plumbers for the big bully spike maniscalco and they are now ready to start their own plumbing business much to the chagrin of their dad longtime mario and luigi video game voice actor charles martinet who thankfully has a role in this picture with things not going too well after they strike it on their own mario seeks to bring the duo some glory by investigating a devastating water leak that threatens to flood all of brooklyn their endeavor causes them to be unwittingly sucked into an underground pipe that transports them to another world stranding luigi in the lavafilled darklands meanwhile mario is transported to the mushroom kingdom a peaceful land inhabited by sentient mushroom people such as toad key the mushroom kingdom is soon to be under siege by the despotic king of the koopas bowser black who has stolen a magic super star that will grant him the power to rule the world lest the mushroom kingdoms human ruler princess peach taylorjoy grants him her hand in marriage now its up to mario and peach to save her kingdom luigi and stop bowser once and for all the super mario bros tells a very simple story but it has heart where it counts the strong bond between luigi and mario shines through even though the duo is separated for most of the film mario and luigi make for charming underdogs who refuse to quit no matter how much they get bullied or beaten down  the emotionally tortured and belligerent bowser is a tyrannical monster but he wants to be loved the filmmakers lovingly adapt the classic bowser and writer matthew fogel clearly wrote the character with jack black in mind blacks casting is perfect as they incorporate the actors gift for music and song as part of bowsers personality which makes for some hilarious musical interludes  the films casting is incredibly solid day as luigi and black as bowser are pitchperfect casting choices days nasally scratchy voice is perfect for the cowardly neurotic luigi black has always been a gifted vocal talent and performer and bowser takes full advantage of his range and talents chris pratt was a very controversial choice to play mario and thats understandable however it is also understandable that charles martinet did not reprise his role as mario considering the film makes mario and luigi brooklyn natives it would not make much sense for them to speak with heavy italian accents through most of the film however the movie does portray their italian background which is illustrated when they sometimes speak in italianaccented phrases  pratts vocal performance is adequate he tries to put in the effort even though he uses a quasibrooklyn accent pratt does not attempt to use his typical inflection and voice his vocal performance does not blow you away and it is a weird attempt by a guy who is not from brooklyn trying to adopt brooklynese its not quite as strong a vocal performance as pratt has done in the past for the lego movie but it mostly gets the job done much is due to the films score composed by brian tyler tyler put considerable effort into creating the score for the super mario bros movie and adapting the classic iconic theme music composed by koji kondo for the original games many movies based on video games have been missing the boat by not maintaining the iconic music that goes with the games the music of video games is important the music empowers players for their gameplay sessions and the super mario bros game series music evokes a warm tingly feeling  tyler understands the power of nintendo music themes and consulted with koji kondo to create the films score converting the iconic kondos indelible music themes into big orchestral instrumentations it comes together for a delightful score that enlivens this vibrant animated world and makes it sound alive so many composers try to assert their own will onto video game properties without paying proper homage to the classic sounds that is not the case here the problem with the score is that the movie often resorts to using popular rock music and needle drops throughout the runtime brian tyler worked incredibly hard and collaborated with koji kondo to create a fantastic score yet the film repeatedly drops in pop music tracks when the music tyler composed is infinitely better the movie needs more of its excellent score and fewer pop songs the super mario bros movie is a wonderful and joyous experience horvath and jelenic demonstrate their love for the games and characters that comes through visually the movie is loaded with fan service and nostalgia however those moments are executed in a way that propels the story forward with effervescent energy some of the action sequences are staged like classic platform levels there is also the mario kart rainbow road sequence and an homage to super smash bros the filmmakers incorporate game concepts within the narrative in an organic way that doesnt require longwinded ridiculous exposition and is easy to follow within the cinematic world the integration of video gametype conventions makes sense horvath and jelenic go the extra mile by including some classic easter eggs in the most surprising places the discovery and inclusion of these references prove the filmmakers are true fans and they manage to incorporate those allimportant easter eggs to have a maximum narrative impact the super mario bros movie is a joyous event that will bring excitement to all longtime nintendo fans and players giving them a new generational story that they can share with their children and families this movie is playing with power copyright  2024 411maniacom llc all
