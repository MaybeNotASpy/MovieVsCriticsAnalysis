Dec 27 2023,positive, its been decades since ive read roald dahls 1964 childrens adventure novel charlie and the chocolate factory  after seeing timothée chalamet in wonka i immediately went back to the 1971 willy wonka  the chocolate factory and then followed that with the 2005 charlie and the chocolate factory each movie employs music and has its own strengths the title says it all this is a story about willy wonka as seen through the eyes of charlie rewatching this film in 2023 i was hit by a wave of sticky sweetness i remembered my younger days when walking home meant passing first farrells ice cream parlour which had an oldfashioned style candy store and then halfway home the mall that had sears which also a candy counter where candy could be measured out by the ounce at the time of this film there were about 120 farrells nationwide the original location closed in 2006 in eugene oregon and the very last location to close was in brea 8 june 2019 like the farrells ice cream parlours this willy wonka  the chocolate factory feels dated because of the clothing technology and the film used so this film might be best for younger children who wont be critical of these aspects or adults who want to wallow in the nostalgia charlie bucket peter ostrum is from a poor family who cannot afford the luxury of stepping into a candy store on his way home and buying sweets the owner bill aubrey woods is a kindly man and hes the one who sings the candy man the small town is dominated by the willy wonka chocolate factory but no one works there a tinker peter carell explains to charlie one evening that no one enters and no one leaves the factory charlies grandparents share a single bed and its his grandpa joe jack albertson who explains that wonka was forced to close down his factory because some of his employees aided his competitors by stealing wonkas recipes after laying off his entire workforce and closing the gates of his factory wonka kept the gates closed even three years later when the production mysteriously resumed theres considerable excitement generated worldwide when wonka announces that he has hidden five golden tickets in chocolate wonka bars the finders of the tickets will get a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate almost immediately a sinister figure mr slugworth günter meisner is seen slithering around in the background  although the film shows places like japan taking part of the buying pandemonium the winners are a gluttonous german boy augustus gloop michael böllner a spoiled daughter of a wealthy english father veruca salta john dawn cole and two americansa gumchewing champion violet beauregarde denise nickerson and a televisionobsessed boy mike teevee paris themmen  mr slugworth is seen whispering into the ears of each of the lucky ticket holders charlie only gets a chocolate bar on his birthday but is disappointed to find it doesnt have the golden ticket grandpa joe later takes him aside and gives him his tobacco money to use for another wonka bar but the ticket isnt in that bar either charlie gives up hope when news reports the fifth ticket was found in paraguay that fifth ticket in paraguay turns out to be a forgery walking home charlie finds money in the future and buys a wonka bar and discovers the last ticket bill tells him to run home before anyone can take it from him at home charlies good luck inspires grandpa joe to jump out of bed for the first time in two decades charlie chooses hime to be his chaperone for the tour before the tour slugworth asks charlie to get a sample of wonkas everlasting gobstopper a candy for poor people that changes color and flavors but never gets smaller or disappears from the beginning it is clear that willy wonka is a man of many surprises and not above some trickery he is also a business man and requires that people on the tour sign a contract the tour of the chocolate factory is filled with traps and mishaps and each of the children succumb to temptation including charlie and his grandfather yet unlike the others charlie and grandpa are able to complete the tour  wonka reminds them that they didnt follow the guidelines and lost their opportunity at a lifetime of chocolate although angry and disappointed charlie resists the temptation to give slugworth the gobstopper proving himself worthy of inheriting the chocolate factory director mel stuart takes us on a wondrous journey one that starts as relatable to kids growing up in a farrells ice cream parlour era and from there takes flight into a fantasy better than but not far removed from walt disneys wonderful world of color 19611969 or disneys wonderful world 19791981 wilders willy wonka is that favorite eccentric uncle who has some poignant story that he will not burden you with he will pretend to be the responsible adult while watching other bratty kids make mistakes that will lead to hard life lessons if youre a good kid hell lead you on grand adventures that youll relive as an adult even if seeing through your adult eyes he has grown more weary and less magical viewing this in 2023 the film seems a bit dated so it is best for younger children or adults who want to wallow in whimsical nostalgia gene wilder makes the mold for wonka that is more approachable than johnny depps and allows for the possibility of timothée chalamets willy wonka  the chocolate factory made its world premier 28 june 1971 in chicago the film is currently streaming on hbo max although the charlie has been put back in the title this film really does hinge on johnny depps portrayal of the candy maker as well as the sensibilities of auteur filmmaker tim burton working off of john augusts screenplay this remains a musical fantasy but none of the songs became major hits in this film charlie bucket freddie highmore has an intact family his father noah taylor had until recently worked at a toothpaste factory but was replaced by a machine his mother helena bonham carter does the best she can grandpa joe once worked at the wonka factory but it was closed due to industrial espionage when the contest is announced we meet the gluttonous augustus gloop the spoiled veruca salt julie winter the competitive violet beauregarde annasophia robb the obnoxious mike tease jordan fry as well as their parents this version stays closer to the childrens book with charlie and his grandfather finishing the tour without disobeying the rules however wonka is given a lesson to learn when charlie declines the opportunity to be wonkas heir since hed have to give up his family wonka then loses creative focuses until through charlie he is encouraged to visit his dentist father they reconcile and wonka learns that his father was secretly proud of him and had been following his career clipping out articles the entire bucket family is then invited to live on the grounds of the factory while the star of the 1971 film peter ostrum decided to leave acting and take up veterinary science this charlie bucket freddie highmore is currently the lead of the good doctor fans of burton wont be disappointed his people are always outsiders and a bit off the wall if gene wilders wonka was the eccentric uncle you who entertained and enchanted children johnny depps wonka was that weird uncle who was harmless but slightly off in a way that made conversation or ordinary situations often awkward instead of a perfume of pensiveness like bittersweet chocolate that wilders wonka had depps wonka was that weirdly white chocolate creamy and almost chocolate but not really what you have in mind when you want to eat chocolate and unpredictable in its actual sweetness wonka reminds us immediately of the golden ticket in the opening sequence giving credit to the original author before taking us through a pink haze to a small ship where up on the mast our willy wonka timothée chalamet  sings it is time to bid the seven seas farewell and the city ive pinned seven years of hopes on lies just over the horizon when we meet him hes wearing whitestriped beige pants and a white longsleeved shirt under a brown vest the purple overcoat and top hat come soon enough but they are tattered and his boots he tells us are leaky he has spent all his money on his obsession with chocolate the crew he leaved behind like him well enough wishing him good luck and the color of his vest seems to have changed he has only 12 silver sovereigns in his pocket hell soon lose them all as he pursues his hatful of dreams yet that hat is magical as mary poppins carpetbag you never know what hell be pulling out of it his destination has a famous restaurant on every corner and a galeries gourmet but he needs a place to stay and a suspicious person bleacher tom davis who takes him to the boarding house of mrs scrubitt olivia colman despite being warned by an orphan girl named noodle calah lane to read the small print wonka signs the ridiculously lengthy contract the next day willy sells the hoverchoc floating chocolates that cause a person to levitate he soon meets the leading chocolatiers arthur slugworth paterson joseph felix fickelgruber mathew baynton and gerald prodnose matt lucasall members of the chocolate cartel the police are called and all of his earnings confiscated for disrupting the trade of other businesses with only a sovereign left he believes he can cover his room but the small print charges him for everything including uses the steps and the soap he owes ten thousand sovereigns which with hard labor in the basement laundry will come to 27 years and 16 days its not that he didnt read the small print noodle quickly deduces wonka cant read sent down the dirty laundry chute willy meets with the other unfortunates which include accountant abacus crunch jim carter plumber piper benz natasha rothwell a quiet woman named lottie bell rhakee thakar and comedian larry chucklesworth rich fulcher  we soon learn that the police are under the control of the cartel because the chief of police keeganmichael key is addicted to chocolate and bribed with pricy bon tons we do meet  an orange man with green hair an oompa loompa named lofty because for his kind hes rather tall wonka stole cacao that lofty hugh grant had been watching and now by loftys calculations wonka owes a chocolate debt that must be paid first recruiting noodle and then the rest of the laundry workers wonka begins selling his chocolate on the streets trying to earn enough money to free them all but the chocolate cartel has both the police chief and the head priest father julius rowan atkinson under the thrall of their chocolates and the cartel isnt above murder this is a childrens film so there will be no murders even by chocolate the film has a steampunk sensibility and while chalet isnt a dancer the dancing numbers are still lovely enough the costumes by lindy hemming are confectionary perfection chunghoon chung the handmaiden 2016 oldboy 2003 and last night in soho 2021 casts an enchantment  the screenplay by paul king and simon farnaby is filled with whimsy and witty word turns wonka ask how to you like it dark white nutty absolutely insane he gets arrested by defying the laws of gravity as well as disrupting the trade of other businesses as director king brings the right light touch and respects both the dancing choreography and the dream timothy chalamets vocals are pleasant enough if chalamets  wonka was an uncle hed be the obsessive dreamer perhaps he wouldnt be the uncle youd ask to take your children to a dental appointment and you might not expect him to make the birthday party but hed bring a moment of magic into a childs life on the diversity score chalamet is part jewish lane keeganmichael key paterson joseph and natasha rothwell are  african american british actress rakhee thakrar is of asian indian descent if this fictional city was in europe then one would perhaps expect more north africans as for jason acuñas criticism of grants casting oompaloompas were originally depicted as black african pygmies the pygmy people are ethnic groups who are of unusually short stature but they are not people who have the medical condition of dwarfism including proportionate dwarf in the 1973 revised edition of charlie and the chocolate factory the oompaloompas were longhaired rosycheeked and white hailing from the island of loompaland in the 1971 film they became people with orange skin and green hair although dahl was british the original publication was the us edition in 1964 illustrated by joseph schindelman the first uk edition was in 1967 illustrated by faith jaques at that time there werent many british actors who were short i am 4ft 2in so six of the actors were british and they used one maltese actor another from turkey one from germany and one woman there were 10 of us in all the director mel stuart sometimes got very frustrated telling us what to do in english and then trying to explain to the maltese german and turkish actors what he wanted as well remember though chocolate was originally found in the americas and was only introduced to europe in the 16th century currently though the ivory coast leads in world production 38 percent followed by ghana and indonesia 14 percent each there are plenty of islands in indonesia but none with people who have orange skin and green hair maybe its the yeti sweat this wonderfully whimsical film gives us a world of pure imagination where a man with a magical hat takes on a chocolate cartel with new found friends take you kids or embrace your inner child and warm your cockles on this frothy fantasy wonka had its world premiere in london on 28 november 2023 it was released in the us on 8 december and in the us on 15 december 2023

Aug 19 2023,positive, though its tagged as a remake tim burton returns to roald dahls original novel and dahls original title for charlie and the chocolate factory 2005 the second cinematic take on the offbeat fantasy burton favorite johnny depp is downright odd even for depp as the eccentric and reclusive chocolate mogul willy wonka who has built his own private candy wonderland and shares it for one day with lucky kids who have found the golden tickets hidden in his wonka bars freddie highmore depps costar in finding neverland is the plucky impoverished charlie he lives in a rickety home that looks like a melting gingerbread house who becomes the heart that wonka has lost in his isolation and christopher lee is wonkas dentist father a character created specifically for the film burton feeds his creative sweet tooth with delicious art direction and imaginative creations and composer danny elfman writes a goofy set of pop tunes to dahls original lyrics but for all of the flights of fantasy burton never quite finds the heartbeat that warmed the original classic with gene wilder partly because this willy wonka is so disconnected and distracted unable to relate to anyone and partly because the other characters who spiced the original movie are all undercooked here but it is never less than enchanting and entertaining david kelly is charlies grandpa joe helena bonham carter and noah taylor his smilingthroughthestorm parents annasophia robb julia winter jordon fry and philip wiegratz are the fellow ticket holders violet beauregarde veruca salt mike teavee and augustus gloop respectively missi pyle james fox adam godley and franziska troegner the parents and deep roy is the oompa loompa workforceevery single singinganddancing one of them dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and x formerly known as twitter all disc editions include the featurette becoming oompa loompa how actor deep roy became an army of oompa loompas a settop game and the trailer the bluray and twodisc dvd includes seven additional featurettes and other supplements sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view
Feb 3 2020,positive,marrying extreme set design and sublime casting burtons film showcases his usual interest in gothic effects and the original willy wonkas psychedelia
Nov 19 2019,positive, remakes can be a tricky thing but director tim burton hits a bullseye with charlie and the chocolate factory a delightful treat filled with stunning visuals and a lot of fun performances headlined by johnny depp in this retelling of the roald dahl novel depp plays the reclusive candy maker willy wonka as the film opens wonka has decided to allow five children a chance to tour his chocolate factory by putting five golden tickets in his chocolate bars one of the winners is charlie bucket freddie highmore who lives in a tilted shack with his grandparents and his mom and dad and spends most of his time dreaming about the candy his family usually is unable to afford charlie may well be the bestlooking film i have seen this year thats even more visually appealing than the superb work by robert rodriguez in sin city burtons direction is sharp and the movie is a feast for the eyes with each scene burton gives audiences another piece of a unique world from the tilted house of the buckets to the many rooms the children discover inside the chocolate factory there are still five months left in 2005 but id be surprised if i see a movie more deserving of oscars for visual effects and art direction while the look of the film is the heart of charlie depp and highmore provide the movie with its soul depp has a lot of fun as wonka some have suggested his performance mimics michael jackson but i think it is much more original than that its delightful yet creepy and a performance that may top his goofy work in pirates of the caribbean charlie is sure to draw comparisons to the 1971 original starring gene wilder as someone who only vaguely remembers seeing that film its hard for me to compare it to this remake i can compare charlie to other 2005 releases though and it is clearly one of this years most enjoyable ferrell plays phil a family man who has always been the whipping boy of his very competitive father robert duvall when phil decides to coach his sons soccer team the family competition heats up it would be easy to see this as another lady bugs the really bad soccer comedy with rodney dangerfield and jackee but there is a bit of heart in kicking and screaming with ferrell and duvall both giving nice performances ferrell is capable of getting laughs even in bad films but he gets some help here in an unlikely extended cameo by former chicago bears coach mike ditka who was a good enough sport to playfully poke fun at his toughguy image sure kicking and screaming is filled with obvious cliches but director jesse dylan keeps the film moving along at a brisk enough pace that the flaws dont really matter

Feb 6 2018,positive,by fleshing out the backgrounds of the factorys most peculiar characters and allowing dahls unique mixture of charm and menace to guide him burton has created a film that is sharp scary and surprisingly quite heartwarming
Nov 12 2017,positive,it was once a place for pure imagination now under tim burtons care its a madhouse again
Mar 4 2015,positive, the band wagon 1953 the 1931 broadway revue the band wagon was the basis for director vincente minnellis opulent mgm musical for which the legendary writing team of betty comden and adolph green singin in the rain on the town built a plot around the stage shows howard dietzarthur schwartz songs and in the process made a film thats amusingly selfreflexive while not as perceptive  or hilarious  as 1952s singin in the rain in its skewering of backstage shenanigans among artists it offers plenty of choice observations as it centers on hasbeen movie star tony hunter fred astaire who hopes his flagging fortunes will be salvaged by appearing in a lightweight broadway musical written by his friends lily and lester marton nanette fabray and oscar levant but problems materialize when the martons select as their director jeffrey cordova jack buchanan a selfimportant blowhard who changes the martons frothy piece into a portentous reimagining of faust to further complicate matters cordova decides the leading lady should be ballet star gabrielle gerard cyd charisse whose classical training causes tony to wonder whether their different styles will allow them to be compatible dancers buchanan easily steals the show as the pompous director and key musical bits include the dreamy dancing in the dark the amusing triplets and the classic thats entertainment which was introduced in this film this earned three oscar nominations including one for comden and greens screenplay bluray extras include audio commentary by liza minnelli vincentes daughter and singermusical archivist michael feinstein a makingof featurette the 1930 musical short jack buchanan with the glee quartet and the theatrical trailer the band wagon is available individually or as part of the musicals collection a fourfilm set that also includes singin in the rain 1953s kiss me kate in 2d and 3d versions and 1953s calamity jane charlie and the chocolate factory 2005 forrest gumps mama famously declared that life is like a box of chocolates you never know what youre going to get you never know what youre going to get with charlie and the chocolate factory either given that director tim burton tends to fluctuate between enfant terrible and rank sentimentalist coming off the forced whimsy of big fish burton was back on steadier ground helming the second screen version of roald dahls beloved novel johnny depp headlines as willy wonka the eccentric candymaker who allows five children to take a tour through his gargantuan factory young charlie bucket freddie highmore is a perfect angel but the other four kids prove to be such brats that they all eventually get their comeuppance within the walls of wonkas candycoated fortress in some respects this surpasses the previous screen incarnation 1971s willy wonka and the chocolate factory its funnier and better paced but burtons maudlin streak gets the best of him via a needless back story that explains wonkas affinity for candy and this plot strand leads to a soggy finale thats easily bested by the final act of the 71 model depp whose wonka seems to be a cross between michael jackson and the cabinet of dr caligaris somnambulist cesare delivers an engaging surface performance though i far prefer the more measured madness of gene wilders interpretation the 10th anniversary edition bluray comes with a 28page photo booklet and a letter from burton extras include audio commentary by burton an immersive inmovie experience a featurette on the oompaloompas and a piece on dahl dont look now 1973 its rare when a filmmaker helms one genuine masterpiece in his lifetime let alone two and consecutively yet that was the case when nicolas roeg followed 1971s walkabout with another motion picture equally as brilliant based on a short story by daphne du maurier the wordsmith whose works also fueled the hitchcock classics rebecca and the birds this stars julie christie and donald sutherland as laura and john baxter a happily married couple who reeling from the death of their daughter christine have temporarily settled in venice so that john can assist in restoring an old church laura continues to drown in grief until she meets a pair of sisters hilary mason and clelia matania one of whom claims to be a psychic and informs her that christine is happy in the afterlife but john is in danger john believes its all nonsense even though he himself is blessedcursed with a second sight he chooses to dismiss but how to explain the strange visions he sees around him including fleeting glimpses of a child wearing the same red raincoat donned by christine when she died the exquisite visual presentation  accentuated by anthony richmonds inspired lensing and graeme cliffords astute editing  allows this artistic endeavor to function as a mood piece yet its much more than that thanks to its compelling plotline and heavy use of meaningful symbolism with water broken glass and the color red all receiving particularly vigorous workouts a hit in its native england ever since its release the picture is even more revered now separate polls by the british film institute and time out london have cited it as one of the 10 best british films ever made no argument here bluray extras include both new and older interviews with many who worked on the movie including roeg christie sutherland richmond clifford coscripter allan scott and composer pino donaggio the new piece nicolas roeg the enigma of film in which oscarwinning directors steven soderbergh traffic and danny boyle slumdog millionaire discuss roegs style and influence and a 2003 qa session with roeg eat drink man woman 1994 before he became an internationally renowned filmmaker and twotime academy award winner for best director brokeback mountain life of pi ang lee was carving out a nice career in his native taiwan two of his pictures 1993s the wedding banquet and 1994s eat drink man woman earned consecutive best foreign language film oscar nominations and both should have won against the underwhelming competition thats especially true of eat drink man woman a wise and touching piece that matches movies like babettes feast and like water for chocolate in its depiction of food as a source of spiritual nourishment sihung lung so memorable as the father in the wedding banquet here plays another parent this one a culinary wizard who relates better to his dishes than to his three daughters jen kueimei yang a schoolteacher still feeling the pain from a longago college relationship that ended badly kien chienlien wu a savvy businesswoman unable to find stability in her personal life and ning yuwen wang a perky fastfood employee who finds herself attracted to her best friends boyfriend the food on display will make mouths water but dont assume this film is merely the cinematic equivalent of a highend menu the various relationships among the characters prove to be as intricate and delectable as the dishes and the piece packs a potent emotional reach foxcatcher 2014 with a tip of the hat in the direction of langston hughes let it be noted that foxcatcher isnt so much a study of a dream deferred but of the american dream deferred at heart a film about the awkward dance between the haves and havenots  and more specifically a brutal condemnation of the barely masked disdain the onepercenters have for the other 99  this truelife tale finds steve carell cast waaay against type as john du pont scion of one of the most prominent families in the nation a meek and strange character charged with a patriotic zeal john elects to use his vast fortune to build a team of worldclass wrestlers to anchor the group he picks 1984 olympic gold medalist mark schultz channing tatum an opportunity that seems like a godsend to the struggling athlete but johns paranoidschizophrenic nature soon gets the better of him and he humiliates mark by inviting his saintly older brother dave mark ruffalo also an olympic gold medalist to take over as head of the team from there the tensions only mount leading to a shocking crime thats unexpected but perhaps also unavoidable as the rich nerd longing to be both an inspirational figure and just one of the guys and perhaps be with the guys carell is scarygood subjugating all traces of the familiar comic spark in evidence in his previous films ruffalo is effortlessly reassuring as the big brother who would be a benefit to any family while tatum reaches a new plateau as the troubled kid simply wanting life to give him a break like carell tatum is required to suppress his natural charm  its a knockout performance fully in line with a movie that feels like a body slam to the mat this earned five oscar nominations including bids for carell and ruffalo love and death 1975 if i could just see a miracle just one miracle if i could see a burning bush or the seas part or my uncle sasha pick up a check i go ie will be executed at 6 oclock tomorrow i was supposed to go at 5 oclock but i have a smart lawyer got leniency those are two of the great quips to be found in woody allens love and death but theres no use crying over spilled spoilers since the picture is packed front to back with many more cheery bon mots  to say nothing of rollicking slapstick sequences spoofy film homages and other modes of merriment guaranteed to keep viewers in perpetual guffaw using russian literature as the base ingredient woody adds pinches of ingmar bergman sergei eisenstein and bob hope to this yarn about lowly boris grushenko allen a coward who finds himself an unwilling participant in the napoleonic wars when hes not busy avoiding battlefield injury he can be found wooing his distant cousin sonja diane keaton who passes the time having affairs when asked how many lovers shes had she replies in the midtown area before she decides that she and boris should attempt to assassinate napoleon james tolkan with allen referencing everything from bergmans the seventh seal to dostoevskys the gambler love and death might seem more haphazard than most of the auteurs films but the astoundingly high hittomiss ratio deems it a keeper this would be the last of whats commonly referred to as allens early funny ones to quote stardust memories as his next picture 1977s annie hall would kick off a new chapter in his career the st valentines day massacre 1967 the great roger corman has produced 400 films and still counting over the course of 60 remarkable years and hes sat in the directors chair for 50 of those flicks the st valentines day massacre represents one of those occasions when he wore both hats more significantly it also marked the first time he worked in such lofty capacities for a major studio in true corman fashion he wasnt thrilled with the lack of control and went back to making movies his way his rattattat helming is one of the strengths of this crime flick which uses documentarystyle narration but exploitationstyle violence to relate the events leading up to the notorious 1929 gangland slaying the production values are topnotch while the script by howard browne an expert in the field who also penned 1961s portrait of a mobster with vic morrow as dutch schultz and 1975s capone starring ben gazzara as the title figure hews to reallife events to an impressive degree as for the supporting roster its peppered with familiar faces including those belonging to bruce dern poignant as a struggling mechanic joe turkel the shinings bartender or blade runners ceo take your pick and fantasyfilm stalwart john agar tarantula the mole people there are even uncredited bits by corman stableboys and the little shop of horrors stars jack nicholson dick miller and jonathan haze what damages the picture are the performances by the two topbilled stars jason robards handles the heavy lifting as al capone while george segal provides the muscle as a giggly rival gunman and he even smashes a sandwich in jane hales face aping james cagney planting that grapefruit in mae clarkes kisser in 1931s the public enemy but their hammy turns more suited to warren beattys cartoonish dick tracy than this godfather precursor strip the characters of any muchneeded menace watership down 1978 its long been a matter of public record that the british ratings board received and reportedly is still receiving complaints for bestowing a kidfriendly rating on an animated feature that is most decidedly not for the kiddies at least the very young uns based on richard adams renowned novel it centers on a group of rabbits who must find a new home after their warren is targeted for demolition by human builders these bunnies whose members include the heroic hazel voiced by john hurt the skittish fiver richard briers and the burly bigwig michael grahamcox face peril every step of the way whether its from other rabbits particularly the tyrannical woundwart played by harry andrews other animals a snarling dog a sneaky cat or various manmade instruments of pain shotguns snares like other enduring works of fiction such as george orwells animal farm and william goldings lord of the flies adams book is heavy on the allegory and the film admirably retains much of this angle but the pacing is flatly orchestrated by writerdirectorproducer martin rosen in his directorial debut and the animation style veers between poetic and prosaic despite an impressive roster of english actors handling vocal duties the rabbits are absent of personality and therefore dont provide much in the way of a rooting interest zero mostel provides the only comic relief as the bird kehaar although he tackles the role as if he were channeling the spirit of his the producers costar kenneth mars the films centerpiece song the treacly bright eyes sung by art garfunkel was a smash hit across europe but failed to crack the charts stateside bluray extras include an interview with rosen pictureinpicture storyboards for the entire film and an interview with filmmaker guillermo del toro a huge fan of the movie wild orchid 1990 while it hardly set the box office on fire writerdirector zalman kings wild orchid could be considered the fifty shades of grey of its day a wouldbe erotic romp that ultimately carries as much of a sexual charge as a chicken mcnugget mickey rourke in the lengthy flameout phase of his career stars as james wheeler a wealthy businessman living in the picaresque city of rio de janeiro through a mutual friend jacqueline bisset he makes the acquaintance of visiting lawyer emily reed carré otis and its not long before emilys under his spell and privy to his mind games and dominant behavior as scripter king also had a hand in 1986s equally risible nine 12 weeks also starring rourke but that picture at least had the benefit of an excellent central performance by kim basinger otis on the other hand is particularly dreadful displaying about as much acting talent as an avocado as for rourke his sleepyeyed performance leads one to believe that all wheeler really wants out of life is a good nights sleep the film achieved a small measure of media notoriety back in 1990 first when it had to be trimmed to garner an r rating rather than an x the more explicit version has long been available on home video but this new olive films bluray release only contains the theatrical rrated cut and later when the rumors wouldnt cease regarding the contention that the onscreen sex between thencouple rourke and otis wasnt simulated and the couple really did it to which a nation collectively shrugged and muttered who cares
Sep 8 2012,negative,predictably twisted scenery a bland story a horrible alteration of wonka and an ending thats anything but pleasing
May 27 2011,positive,adults and kids alike will take macabre delight in the punishment of naughty children burton and co make smart and funny additions to this classic tale
Apr 26 2011,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is quite simply wonderful a brilliantly imagined story that will win old fans and new fans alike
Jun 13 2008,positive, and so the latest movie remake slides sugarfrosted off the production line and into the waiting hands of a viewing public ready to gobble up anything as long as it has a soft centre gene wilder as the wacky confectioner of the original seventies adaptation was the best thing about that particular film which lacked pace and foundered on the shores of bad child acting his position is in no danger from johnny depp you know the drill  or if youve read the book you probably think you do charlie bucket is a poor lad big in heart but low on funds who lives with his family in the ramshackle part of town mind you despite their abject poverty and unremitting diet of cabbage soup they still manage to have a colour telly really tim weird old willy wonka who owns the nearby chocolate factory hasnt been seen for years until out of the blue he announces that hes hidden five golden tickets in his choccie bars so that five lucky little uns can pay him a visit needless to say in the way of good fairytales four of the five are nogood brats while charlies light shines out like a beacon in the night there are quite a lot of good things about this production in addition to a series of impressive industrial accidents the set design as you would expect from a burton film is superlative with the streets where the buckets live suitably atmospheric and cold the characterisation is good too  mike teavee jordan fry beautifully evil as the computer game crazed kid charlie freddie highmore believable yet nottoosugary and grandpa joe david kelly fighting a little too hard to make sure his irish accent doesnt escape equally so as the oldster who never grew up the film falls down with the oompa loompas all played by deep roy that isnt a bad idea but the busby berkeley and rap take on their songs doesnt really work roald dahls lyrics are lost in a heady rush of candyfloss effects however where the film fails most is with wonka himself depp has passed over weird in favour of downright creepy he really doesnt feel in keeping with the book at all as he is quirky without being fun also the character lacks depth compared to his previous manifestation which is odd because here he has been shackled with an unnecessary backstory that clumsily tries to make excuses for his weirdness dad was a dentist willies teeth were wired and oh you really dont want to know if it werent for the backstory and hollywoods need to add that extra bit of sugar coating this could have been a fudgemallow delight of a movie instead its centre is just a bit too squishy
Jan 15 2008,positive, a deliciously entertaining treat tim burton delivers his best work in years with his darkly comic and yet family friendly take on the classic childrens tale of a certain poor young boy and an eccentric chocolate factory owner roald dahls novel has been adapted once before into a 1971 gene wilder kids film which has a large and loyal following dahl himself however hated it and fans of the original story were understandably upset about how it not only made major changes but was so saccharinely sweet that it rotted your teeth just looking at it burtons film by contrast is far closer in tone and detail with dahls writing which was able to combine some pretty dark and adult themes into a wildly imaginative yet deceptively simple moral fable utilising both some truly astounding production design a strong cast and even some new back story to flesh out willy wonka himself  the result is something thats both esoteric and dark in that definitively tim burton style and yet bright cheery and deliciously mainstream in a way that works on levels that kids will appreciate and adults will enjoy its a tricky tale but one thats beautifully optimistic enough to warm the heart of most pessimists but only rarely delving into the sentimental so as not to disengage them leading the charge is depps take on the character of willy wonka instead of gene wilders wild mood swinging father figure depp opts to play wonka more like a misfit whos grown up in his own reality with his white face perfect teeth and flashy clothing the comparison of depps wonka with michael jackson is somewhat fair with some strikingly similar moments and mannerisms however theres significant differences  whereas jacko loves the children wonka has an almost inherit repulsion to them  hes not a man trying to recapture his youth but rather escape it and the childlike qualities stem from a rebellion to his overly disciplinary dentist father christopher lee depp makes wonka both creepy and by contrast sympathetic with unexpected but funny non sequiturs pouring from his mouth at regular intervals whats much stronger than the 70s film this time around is the supporting cast a fresh faced highmore gives a surprising weight and believability to his role of the kid who cant seem to see the bad in people  hes so good he almost wipes the memory of that horrid child actor from the old film away likewise all the kids the various parents missi pyle and james fox have great turns as an over achieving barbie doll mother and a classy stolid millionaire father respectively and the multiple turns by deep roy as the multicostumed oompa loompas are great and fit perfectly into the unfolding action burton has delicious fun with the assorted oompa loompa numbers which spoof all sorts of things from psycho to the beatles and whilst a little cutesy they are great show stoppers that are short and very different in styles the factory itself is astonishing admittedly the cg at times such as the glass elevator are all too obvious but other tricks ranging from the set enhancements to the oompa loompa size variations are flawless the sets are an effect in themselves with giant chocolate waterfalls and indian palaces sugary candy trees and giant pink boats rushing headlong down neoncoloured rapid rides the only real downside with the film is the tale is so inherently known that it does follow a predictable and tired path even those whove escaped familiarity with the story will easily recognise the way its headed each child undone by their blatant character flaw and how things will end up its not the goal though thats whats fun here but the journey and what a journey it is indeed the factory is so fantastical that the early and postvisit scenes seem sadly on the dull side in comparison and drag on a little long other thematic elements evoke burtons previous work ranging from edward scissorhands to big fish most of all though is the off beat tone which some will find too eccentric whilst others will say it doesnt got far enough whats going to be interesting here is how people react to a film like this the upbeat and innocent 1939 classic film adaptation of l frank baums the wizard of oz is how most people know that story but fans of the l frank baum original novels and the animated early 90s incarnation know of it as a slightly darker more complex and adult fantasy likewise the 70s wonka film is the only way a lot of people know this story but this charlie is much more of a direct adaptation of dahls similarly dark and more grown up novels its the same inherit story but each is quite different in their approaches and so like sweets which one you prefer is a matter of taste this take on charlie however i found the sweetest of all one of the best family films in a while and one of the years stronger films to date
Sep 24 2007,positive, ill bet there are many adults today who have queasy memories of 1971s willy wonka and the chocolate factory psychedelic yet moralistic the movie offered gene wilder in his full passiveaggressive efflorescence as the mysterious chocolatier willy wonka whose gentle demeanor cloaked what appeared to be a deep contempt for children his most loyal clientele it also had ghastly songs without this movie sammy davis jr wouldnt have inflicted the candy man on telethon viewers year after year those obnoxious oompa loompas and colorful but indifferent direction by mel stuart if anyone feels any sort of residual fondness for it its because that malicious fantasist roald dahl in his original book charlie and the chocolate factory devised such a readymade fantasy concept five children invited to spend a day in the worlds largest choccy emporium remakes generally depress me as much as they do anyone else but tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is poised to become a new cult classic to replace the old one burton understands this story in a way few other directors could although danny devito who did a rascally job with dahls matilda might also have had fun with the project this director constantly veers from mopiness to flamboyant glee though charlie is closer in tone to his beetlejuice than to his edward scissorhands once again burton has johnny depp along for the ride and though many have said that depp has based his willy wonka on michael jackson i suspect hes really playing the only person he ever plays in tim burton films  tim burton this wonka is a misfit who enjoys showing off his elaborately designed playpen but isnt much fazed by those who dont appreciate it as in all other versions the hero is charlie bucket freddie highmore who lives in a brokendown house with his povertylevel family burton however takes the pathos out of charlies situation by giving him a house right out of german expressionism  the entire doorway leans inward for instance charlie is one of the five kids who discover a golden ticket inside a wonka candy bar  a ticket to a day inside the elusive wonkas factory the other kids are brats who each illustrate a childish trait that dahl hated gluttonous augustus gloop gumchewing violet beauregarde cathodemesmerized mike teavee whose fixation has been updated to videogames and worst of all spoiled rich girl veruca salt whose attitude is so rotten that a rock band named themselves after her their punishments as before fit their crimes though one wonders what exactly roald dahl had against gumchewing instead of sappy anthony newley songs this movie has danny elfman scoring the original lyrics from dahls book theres no brainsearing oompa loompa doompadee doo song here the oompa loompas are all played via digital replication by the diminutive indian actor deep roy whose unsmiling and uncute persona here is both refreshing and consistently funny the sets are of course obvious sets but they always are in tim burtons films the nasty bits claustrophobes will as ever have a hard time with augustus gloops fate are softened by burtons jaunty sense of artifice gene wilder can criticize this remake all he wants  burton and depp have simply done it better i have mixed feelings about a backstory added by scripter john august in which the young wonkas fascination with sweets is neatly tied to his forbidding dentist dad it adds little to the story except for a lame coda in which wonka having learned the power of family reunites with his dad however since the father is played by christopher lee  still going strong at 83 hammer bless him  ill forgive it this factory genuinely beautiful and imaginative is the movie that admirers of the original factory who havent seen it since they were kids carry around in their heads and it adds another lovable freak to the burtondepp gallery perhaps the freakiest of all even without the jacko undertones some viewers see in it charlie and the chocolate factory is the most truly subversive entertainment for kids since  well since roald dahl stopped writing i can swallow tim burton making it thats fine its everything else that i hate  1 being johnny depp hes so overly cartoony and childishly creepy hes so pale he practically glows hes glasses hide is eyes hiding part of himself and he smile is some creepy plastered on appliance and is voice is a joke gene wilder gave a genuine kindness to a character that could seem harsh with the children and his singing was wonderful and almost calming while the children in the original are annoying they super dosed these kids with stupid juice for the modern times and while the ooompa loompas of the original all had their different shapes sizes and expressions they just gave the roll to one creepy guy and made stupid fake copies of him everywhere like a cop out im sure id have more complaints but i could only manage to suffer throught it once i think this movie should never have existed and should be made to dissapear completely and i see no positive comparison between this and the original
Sep 20 2007,positive, there is no place i know to compare with pure imagination gene wilder sang that dreamy refrain when he played willy wonka the candymaking madman in the beloved but creepy 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory based on roald dahls book charlie and the chocolate factory that famous song would fit in beautifully with director tim burtons take two of dahls whimsical adventure burton turns the story into an explosion of pure imagination in fact charlie and the chocolate factory is so alive with visual invention that some critics are saying theres too much imagination on screen its becoming more and more clear that burton despite his fetish for the phantasmagoric is not so much a storyteller as a stylist and charlie gives him a big bold framework across which he can drape his latest outrageous decorations its a challenge to take a story about people who do little more than tour a building and turn it into something consistently entertaining but burtons done it and better than it was done in 1971 it has some moments that teeter on the edge of tedium as wonka guides his admiring guests around and explains his whimsical inventions to them but the effects are a hoot the casting ranges from good to brilliant especially david kelly as grandpa joe and freddie highmore as charlie deep roy deserves some kind of award for what must have been a trying role performing all of the necessary oompa loompa tasks perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that the film is as good when depp leaves the screen as it is when hes on it in fact the opening scenes in charlies ramshackle home are fantastic and johnny depp while a far cry from dahls version of wonka creates another entirely unique character his version of wonka struck me as just as a man who never matured past the point of the fractured child he was when he ran away from home given the new backstory burtons invented for him that makes sense personally ive never been convinced that dahl gave us enough story to fill out the frame of a fully satisfying feature film thus i dont mind burtons embellishments on the life of young willy wonka so much i think burton makes it pretty clear right up front that this is a sort of thematic sequel to edward scissorhands  the first time we see depp turn and face the camera hes wielding a pair of scissors like edward wonka lives in a castle on a hill but unlike edward wonkas doesnt have a benevolent bone in his body hes the american dreamer selfindulgent pursuing only his own appetites like the beastly children who abuse his generous offer of a tour he finds in the end that even though he never had a loving family of his own his only route to happiness is to find one and to deal gracefully and forgivingly with the unfortunate damage thats been done to him sure this is a whole new lesson for the wonka story but its not a bad one at all in fact its a revision of the lesson of burtons last film big fish that film ended by justifying the selfindulgence of its central character saying its alright to escape into irresponsible fantasies even if you hurt those around you because fantasy will earn you immortality burtons chocolate factory suggests that sometimes our fantasies can turn us into selfish fools sometimes its better to make room for some reality sometimes we should pursue not what we want but what we need i feel compelled to add that im pleased with the films emphasis on the link between parental irresponsibility and damaged child psyches no the movie is in no way subtle about this point but thats forgivable considering the cartoonish nature of this adaptation in which everything is exaggerated to exaggerate a phrase from flannery oconnor sometimes a deaf culture needs to have its head stuffed into a megaphone while someone shouts the truth through it
Jul 14 2007,neutral,depps wonka exudes none of the gravity required for the role its as though he didnt take the role seriously rather than an intimidating candyman teaching brats a lesson this wonka is simply a freak
Apr 19 2007,positive,possibly the first hollywood movie to design a fairy tale of sorts around globalization the film conjures a mythic brit multinational instead of the usual imperial realm asa basically high caloric magical kingdom
Mar 1 2007,negative,theres a lot of cool stuff on display here but it lacks the consistent creative visionor if you like the pure imaginationof the original film
Oct 21 2006,positive, first things first tim burtons 2005 charlie and the chocolate factory is not a remake of mel stuarts beloved 1971 willy wonka and the chocolate factory comparisons between the two adaptations of roald dahls classic childrens book are inescapable and actually rather interesting but each deserves to be judged on its own merits since each is successful and enchanting in its own right when rumors of a new version of dahls tale about poor charlie bucket and his golden ticketworthy adventures inside the mysterious realm of enigmatic candy man willy wonka first started circulating fans of the first film were rightfully skeptical who could possibly live up to gene wilders careerdefining performance as the cheerfully cracked chocolate czar certainly not robin williams jim carrey or nicolas cage all of whom were in the running for the role at one time ultimately burton  who made a repeated point of saying that dahls book was his only inspiration  decided that wonkas trademark frock coat and top hat were best suited to frequent collaborator johnny depp and depp as is his wont stepped up and made the part completely his own sporting a prince valiant bob and a pale complexion that has the greenish hue of a true shutin the erstwhile captain jack sparrow turns wonka into a fey chipper mercurial man whos really just an overgrown child himself his highpitched voice clipped speech and cockeyed enthusiasm are more reminiscent of depps turn as bmovie auteur ed wood than they are of pop star michael jackson as some have suggested burtons most significant deviation from dahls book is to give wonka a backstory that explains some of his arrested development and emotional instability its not really necessary  part of wonkas appeal as a character is his mystery  but since it doesnt slow down the main action too much its forgivable the rest of the plot follows the source material very closely sweetnatured charlie bucket the talented freddie highmore who also worked with depp in finding neverland lives in a rickety shack with his parents helena bonhamcarter and noah taylor and four grandparents in a bleakly anonymous town where the skyline is dominated by the smokestack of wonkas factory when the notorious recluse announces that five lucky children who find golden tickets hes hidden inside his chocolate bars will get to come inside for a tour the race is on after charlie finds the last ticket he and grandpa joe the perfectly cast david kelly queue up with greedy augustus gloop philip wiegratz selfish veruca salt julia winter competitive violet beauregarde annasophia robb and videogameaddicted mike teavee jordan fry once they pass through the factory gates they discover a fantastical world filled with delights the chocolate room wonkas oompa loompas and dangers experimental chewing gum a roomful of nuttesting squirrels burton delivers it all in style the 1971 film was an imaginative visual treat but effects technology has come a long way in the last three decades and it shows the squirrels are particularly impressive and when digital magic meets creative compelling storytelling  as it does here  the result is a reimagining that any dahl fan should savor one of burtons most unusual and rewarding ideas was to have a single person deep roy play all of wonkas oompa loompa workers the actor is put through the paces in composer danny elfmans four big musical numbers each of which is done in a different style from bollywood to 70s pyschedelia
Oct 3 2006,positive,full review in greek
Sep 28 2006,positive,if anything cramps depp and the films sense of fun it is the weight that is placed on reconciliation between wonka and his father
Sep 11 2006,positive,a funny and sweet adventure for kids and parents thanks to burtons ability to stir the imagination and tell a sweepingly charming story
May 12 2006,positive,as the star whos framed in the center of nearly every shot hes in depp is a constantly surprising willy wonka
May 12 2006,positive,softspoken eccentric and just a little sadistic at times depp makes for an alloriginal wonka and not a rehash of wilders infamous work
Jan 17 2006,positive, this is a new adaptation of roald dahls novel young charlie bucket freddie highmore lives with his loving parents and two sets of equally doting grandparents in the poorest house in his neighbourhood  one day he becomes one of five children chosen to tour wonkas factory and meet its reclusive owner suddenly everything becomes possible unlike the book wonka has a tough job impressing the children but as he gets his act together depps performance takes on a deliciously doubleedged quality as does the factory itself 
Dec 31 2005,positive,tim burton commands his environments with such exacting precision that one cant help but lose oneself in the intricate layers of sets and costumes
Dec 6 2005,positive,fun and creepy
Dec 6 2005,positive,in its combination of fidelity to its source and wacky visual ideas burtons take is a triumph of common sense and imagination  exactly the qualities for which we admire children
Dec 6 2005,positive,witty wonderful and wildly imaginative burtons first proper family movie since peewees big adventure delivers a sugar rush thatll last for days
Nov 11 2005,positive,beautiful art direction creative special effects and great performances make the movie just as sweet as any wonka treat
Nov 8 2005,positive,even if its not wholly faithful this incarnation does the book justice and certainly outshines the 1971 musical
Nov 6 2005,positive,if charlie is upstaged by the factory then the factory itself gets upstaged by willy wonka
Nov 3 2005,positive, before you start promoting your film ensure you have a clear visual and verbal identity in place a compelling poster or key image is crucial to grab in an age where digital entertainment is more accessible than ever movie marathons have become a favorite pastime for many yet as we indulge in irish bookmaker paddy powers cheeky humor and bold marketing tactics have helped the company become one of the biggest igaming brands in the world the film threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information visit our full length privacy policy to get informed on our policies regarding the collection use and disclosure of information we receive from users
Oct 31 2005,positive,instead of destroying a classic as many people feared burton has completely reinvented and reinvigorated it creating something terrific and timeless
Oct 25 2005,positive,this new charlie and the chocolate factory makes for a splashy eccentric movie treat
Oct 12 2005,positive,this along with edward scissorhands are among burtons bestever films
Oct 7 2005,positive,tim burton and johnny depp collude to subvert the storys incidental allusions to michael jackson and his neverland ranch
Aug 30 2005,positive,a visual carnival of colour and fantasy dripping with quirk and seriously eccentric
Aug 26 2005,positive,yes its pretty hilarious but its also delightfully deranged in all the best ways
Aug 18 2005,positive,its hard to imagine a more fitting interpreter of roald dahl particularly his beloved charlie and the chocolate factory than director tim burton
Aug 12 2005,positive,more madcap than the original with even more spectacular set designs and production values
Aug 8 2005,positive,by turns dazzling inventive and amusing this charlie and the chocolate factory is one that ought to appeal to children of all ages
Aug 2 2005,positive,brilliant its a gleaming candycolored fantasy that teems with mad invention  theres no other film quite like this one
Jul 31 2005,positive,of the somewhat overlong 115minute running time theres an entertaining 90 minutes of eye candy with a dark daring center
Jul 30 2005,positive,this is not just a childrens movie this is a tim burton classic and it must be seen on the big screen
Jul 30 2005,positive,as entertaining as anything else in this movie are the opening frames that depict a chocolate bar being manufactured from the first chocolate drop to the final packaging
Jul 30 2005,neutral, everyone knows the story reclusive candy man willy wonka will be opening the doors of his factory for the five lucky children who find a golden ticket inside one of his chocolate bars as wonkamania spreads throughout the world and candy bars are snapped up by the truckload poor little charlie bucket dreams of being able to afford just one he lives with his parents and four bedridden grandparents in a ramshackle hut in the shadow of wonkas factory with holes in the roof and cabbage soup for dinner   one by one the tickets are found around the world by a succession of undeserving children augustus gloop wiegratz the german glutton who celebrates finding the ticket by eating even more chocolate  violet beauregarde robb the world gum chewing champion and now martial arts expert for some reason  veruca salt winter the spoiled rotten brat with the rich daddy  and mike teavee fry the kid who spends his entire life in front of a tv screen   charlie knows that his chances of finding a ticket are almost impossible but with the love and support of his family he never gives up hope even as the fifth ticket is found and just as quickly declared a hoax charlie finds some money in the street and decides to use it to buy one last wonka bar it shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone that he buys the bar containing the last golden ticket and so turns up at wonkas factory along with his grandpa joe kelly the rest of the winning kids and their parents to claim their prize  a tour of the factory and a lifetimes supply of chocolate plus a special additional prize that only one of the children will receive   as far as changes to the source material goes im afraid its been at least twenty years since i read roald dahls book so any point of reference has to be the 1971 filmed version that notwithstanding a rather dull first half hour remains a magical experience anchored by a mesmerising gene wilder existing in the same isitengland isitamerica isitswitzerland world burtons rendering follows it fairly closely in its midsection while going off in slightly different directions during the build up and finale   dahls moral is still intact even if  as seems to be the way of things these days  it is hammered into us from early in the film but gone now is the gleefully sadistic edge yes the rotten kids still get their comeuppance but great pains are made to ensure the audience knows that they didnt come to any permanent harm contrast this with the original where for all you knew they did end up in the incinerator design wise its appealing but not breathtaking with the subtler external cg shots of the factory and the bucket home if anything more impressive than the bold and colourful but sometimes ordinary interiors   where charlie and the chocolate factory really suffers is in burtons direction he seems to have lost the ability to make a film with any semblance of narrative flow theres no energy no sugar rush merely a linear procession from room to room contraption to contraption in fairness a criticism that can occasionally be levelled at the original the excising of the slugworth subplot means we stumble towards one enormous anticlimax only to be forced to endure a laboured and unnecessary final reel thats the cinematic equivalent of pulling teeth   then theres the vital central element of willy wonka whereas wilder made him a mischievous eccentric who could occasionally become unhinged depp plays him as a genuinely freaky manchild with an obvious disdain for any sort of human contact and not just with children  his distrust of parental figures is illustrated in a series of flashbacks to his childhood where his dentist father lee practically brainwashes him on the evil of sweeties its not a bad performance just a really really odd one that does nothing to make the character interesting or likeable   elsewhere highmore is perfect as charlie cute without being cloying and able to gain the sympathy of the audience from the outset the rest of the kids are ideally cast for their particular roles and are quite good fun kelly barely registers as grandpa joe particularly once we get to the factory where he disappears into the background along with everybody else and theres little sense of the bond hes supposed to share with charlie that was so evident with jack albertson   tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory should have been a magical mystery tour full of sparkle and invention instead a leaden pace a lack of wit and one sorely misjudged performance have infused it with all the fun of a broken down carnival ride
Jul 30 2005,positive,a hugely enjoyable brightly coloured childrens fantasy with a terrific central performance from johnny depp in a word delicious
Jul 29 2005,negative,charlie and the chocolate factory has all the warmth of a clockwork orange
Jul 29 2005,positive,a movie worth catching mostly thanks to depp who lights up the screen as the deliciouslydotty confectioner
Jul 28 2005,negative,i wonder if even children will respond to the peculiarly humorless and charmless stylistic eccentricities of mr burton and his star johnny depp
Jul 27 2005,positive,the tour turns out to be such a treat that one both hopes and expects the studio to turn it into a ride but until that ride is built the movie will have to suffice
Jul 26 2005,positive,an intoxicating confection worthy of the childrens classic written by roald dahl
Jul 25 2005,positive,the ingenuity and audacity of it are thrilling at first but it turns into a whipped cream that doesnt get better with too much churning

Jul 25 2005,negative,though the idea of a burton  dahl collaboration would seem a perfect aligning of sensibilities it becomes incredibly apparent that the directors pretenses get in the way of dahls simpler intent
Jul 25 2005,positive, tim burtons first and best movie peewees big adventure follows paul reubens childlike title character as he embarks on a quest to find his stolen bicycle its clear virtually from the word go that peewees big adventure is the sort of film that one either loves or hates as  burton working from phil hartman michael varhol and reubens script employs a seriously and unapologetically broad directorial sensibility thats reflected in the movies various attributes  from danny elfmans irresistibly largerthanlife score to david l snyders eyepopping set design to reubens lessthansubtle yet always engrossing turn as the cartoonish protagonist the latters consistently affable performance plays a pivotal role in cementing peewees big adventures success to be sure as the actor steps into the shoes of his almost unreasonably likable character to an extent thats nothing short of hypnotic  with reubens stellar work heightened by an eclectic supporting cast that includes elizabeth daily mark holton and judd omen and while the episodic screenplay admittedly does result in a very small handful of narrative lulls eg theres probably one too many dream sequences here peewees big adventure closes with a series of immensely captivating sequences that ensure it ends on as positive a note as one could envision  with the perpetually amiable atmosphere confirming the movies place as a delight that holds appeal for all ages quite possibly the most bizarre and flatout surreal effort of tim burtons career beetle juice details the postdeath exploits of happilymarried couple adam alec baldwin and barbara geena davis  with the majority of the proceedings devoted to their efforts at scaring away the new family thats moved into their expansive home though his character provides the films title michael keatons beetlejuice remains a surprisingly periphery figure for the majority of beetle juices runtime  with burton instead using adam and barbaras oddball shenanigans as a springboard for a series of thoroughly creative setpieces and interludes the inevitable realization that michael mcdowell and warren skaarens screenplay isnt actually about anything is subsequently not nearly as problematic as one mightve feared as burton has  along with production designer bo welch and composer danny elfman  infused the movie with a funhouselike sensibility that proves instrumental in capturing and sustaining the viewers enduring interest and while there are admittedly a few lulls within the narrative the consistent inclusion of eyepopping sequences  ie the infamous dayo musical number a confrontation with an enormous sandworm etc  does assure that such instances of downtime are often short lived and easy to overlook keatons scenestealing performance remains an obvious highlight yet its hard to deny the effectiveness of the supporting casts uniformly strong work in addition to baldwin and davis the movie boasts appearances from jeffrey jones sylvia sidney and winona ryder  with the end result an unapologetically silly and endlessly inventive exercise in style it is unfortunately awfully difficult to revisit tim burtons batman with an impartial eye in the wake of christopher nolans genredefining dark knight trilogy as the film viewed in that light cant help but come off as underwhelming and overly cartoonish by comparison  which is too bad certainly given that there are still plenty of elements here that absolutely enthrall including michael keatons tremendously entertaining turn as bruce waynebatman but the movie which unfolds at a pace that often feels much more deliberate than necessary is never quite able to make the leap from mildly amusing to flatout engrossing with burtons curiously subdued sensibilities playing a key role in perpetuating the films erratic uninvolving atmosphere ie the film though suffused with largerthanlife characters and visuals mostly plays like a somber drama the compellingyetrarelycaptivating vibe prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly connecting to either the characters or the storyline with the transformation of jack nicholsons jack napier into the joker faring especially poorly  as nicholson though quite good here never quite manages to make the role his own as heath ledger did in 2008s the dark knight ie it often feels as though nicholson is just riffing on cesar romeros take from the campy 60s television series theres so much here that works  danny elfmans iconic score anton fursts gothic production design etc  that batmans inability to take flight so to speak is nothing short of baffling as its clear that the film watchable as it may be could and should be so much better  planet of the apes casts mark wahlberg as leo davidson a cocky pilot who through a series of bizarre incidences finds himself thrust into a world where intelligent simians rule the humans have been relegated to slavery used as bartering chips among the apes being the headstrong soldier that he is davidson is not content to just sit around and do the bidding of a bunch of monkeys so he sets out to escape his captors and make it back to his ship  where hell hopefully be able to fly away from this planet of the apes along the way he befriends two women  one an ape and one a human  and incurs the wrath of a vengeful chimp named general thade played with overthetop glee by tim roth planet of the apes bears little resemblance to the charlton heston flick that inspired it as the film generally plays out as more of an action movie than a drama and oddly enough some of the more compelling characters in the movie are under a few coats of ape makeup as one of the few humans mark wahlberg has an unenviable job  he has to try and make an impression while standing next to remarkably lifelike apes monkeys and orangutans and hes good though in a bland sort of way its the many actors trapped inside ape costumes that steal the show particularly paul giamatti as limbo  if theres a fault to this otherwise consistently entertaining flick its a truly bizarre ending that leaves a horrible aftertaste twist endings are good provided they make sense twist endings simply for the sake of twist endings are bad and thats what weve got here burton should have just left well enough alone and either ended the flick after that last battle or copied that oftimitated conclusion from the original anything but this nonsensical ending that were stuck with planet of the apes is summer entertainment done right with a topnotch director and some amazing visual effects its certainly one of the most entertaining checkyourbrainatthedoor flicks in recent years though its not quite his best work that remains peewees big adventure big fish does mark tim burtons most accomplished and for lack of a better word grownup movie to date and after the unapologetically mainstream planet of the apes big fish returns burton to his quirky and more character driven roots told largely in flashback the film stars billy crudup as a successful young man named will bloom wills never had a very good relationship with this father edward albert finney a gregarious southerner with a penchant for tall tales but given that edward is on his deathbed will finds that he has to try and connect with his dad before he passes away meanwhile the various stories that edwards been telling his whole life unfold before our eyes with ewan mcgregor appearing as the younger edward big fish is expansive yet intimate with detailed portraits of various characters occurring over some of the most visually interesting sets to come around in a while from the bizarre town of spectre in which the roads are covered in grass to the circus that employs edward the film is a continual delight on a visceral level and theres  no mistaking burtons unique touch and as one would expect from a burton flick hes included a roster of actors thats just about perfect though most of mcgregors scenes take place in the fantasy land of edwards imagination the actor imbues the character with a definite sense of realism he never goes over the top which must have been a temptation especially when youre consorting with a literal giant not surprisingly edwards been surrounded by a variety of eccentric characters  including the aforementioned giant who actually turns out to be a fairly compelling figure as played by matthew mcgrory the man never becomes a cliché familiar faces like danny devito and steve buscemi pop up in supporting roles which just adds to the atmosphere of fun but the film also spends a good deal of time in the present as will attempts to get to know the real edward crudup in one of his rare normal guy roles does a superb job of playing this man that clearly loves his father but has grown tired of his neverending stories its wills relationship with edward that provides the film with its emotional core which proves to be downright touching by the time everything is said and done and thats what makes big fish as special as it is the fantastical elements in the film ensure that it remains entertaining throughout but its the reality of the characters that makes the movie more than just a visual treat by the time the end credits roll around theres a distinct possibility that male audience members will find themselves shedding a tear or two big fish is one of those films that deals with the relationship between a father and his son and like frequency and field of dreams before it packs an emotional wallop to which most men will easily be able to relate big fish is a real achievement from one of hollywoods most underrated directors dont miss it charlie and the chocolate factory marks tim burtons second remake following planet of the apes and to call this an improvement is quite an understatement burtons only goal this time around is to entertain and on that level he undoubtedly succeeds the film is set in some bizarre amalgam of various time periods where women dress like its the 40s kids play modern video games and blue collar workers have begun losing jobs to machines our hero is charlie bucket freddie highmore one of five children that wins a chance to visit willy wonkas johnny depp legendary candy factory leading the tour is of course willy wonka himself  who takes the kids all around his largerthenlife plant and introduces them to the fabled oompa loompas all of whom are portrayed by one man deep roy its impossible to talk about charlie and the chocolate factory without mentioning depps odd performance odd even by his standards which will undoubtedly divide audiences theres absolutely nothing warm and fuzzy about this guy he seems to actively dislike these kids and their parents to the extent that its difficult to imagine why wonka would invite all these people into his factory we learn the necessity behind the invitation as the film progresses in that respect the film offers up an explanation behind wonkas antisocial tendencies in the form of flashbacks revolving around his relationship with his cruel father played by christopher lee but theres absolutely no denying the fact that  along with burtons expectedly loopy sense of style and danny elfmans quirky score  its depp who keeps things interesting throughout if only to see what hell say or do next based on stephen sondheims 1979 musical sweeney todd casts johnny depp as benjamin barker  a barber whose efforts at exacting revenge against those who wronged him are sidetracked by his participation in a profitable and grisly meatpie business with neighbor mrs lovett helena bonham carter while theres certainly no shortage of positive attributes within sweeney todd  including tim burtons expectedly grandiose directorial choices and depps wonderfully entertaining performance  the film suffers from a relentless emphasis on bland thoroughly forgettable musical numbers whose sameness inevitably lends the proceedings a distinctly oppressive quality and although there are a few admittedly memorable songs sprinkled here and there  ie my friends barkers bizarre ode to his knives and a touching ballad entitled johanna  the movie primarily comes off as a strangely interior piece of work that seems to transpire mostly within the confines of one tiny room that the running time has been padded out with a whole host of superfluous subplots and supporting characters certainly doesnt help matters with the wouldbe romance between barkers daughter and a scrappy young sailor clearly the most obvious example of this the end result is a film thats sporadically intriguing but mostly dull which is undoubtedly the last thing one would expect from a filmmaker with as flawless a track record as burton  a sequel to lewis carrolls alices adventures in wonderland and through the lookingglass alice in wonderland follows a grownup alice mia wasikowska as shes summoned back into the title fantasy world by michael sheens white rabbit  with the film subsequently revolving around alices ongoing efforts at ending the red queens helena bonham carter reign of terror theres little doubt that alice in wonderland boasts as impressive and frequently eyepopping a visual sensibility as filmmaker tim burton has become known for as the director does a superb job of transforming wonderland into an immersive downright astonishing landscape that ultimately stands as the movies most compelling attribute its just as clear however that the films decidedly thin storyline effectively and continually prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly embracing the proceedings with the proliferation of oddball yet farfromengrossing characters proving instrumental in perpetuating the movies armslength atmosphere  although to be fair there are a few notable exceptions to this with carters amusingly overthetop turn as the capricious red queen an obvious highlight by the time the largerthanlife battleheavy finale rolls around alice in wonderland has undoubtedly established itself as an endeavor thats big on spectacle yet small on plot  which cements its place as bigbudget timewaster that just barely manages to squeak by as a result of burtons visual flair but really the movie shouldve been so so much better based on the longrunning television series dark shadows follows vampire barnabas collins johnny depp as he emerges from a centurieslong imprisonment into swinging 1972  with the film subsequently exploring barnabas fishoutofwater exploits and eventually his efforts at defeating his maker and nemesis eva greens angelique bouchard filmmaker tim burton working from a script by seth grahamesmith does a superb job of immediately luring the viewer into the proceedings as dark shadows kicks off with an irresistibly overthetop prologue detailing barnabas lurid past  with the fastpaced and engrossing nature of this stretch heightened by burtons familiar yet compelling directorial choices and although the film slows down considerably as it makes the jump into the 70s dark shadows benefits substantially from an initial emphasis on barnabas culture shock as the character begins exploring his new surroundings eg he refers to alice cooper playing himself as the ugliest woman hes ever seen inevitably though the novelty of the premise wears off and the movie slowlybutsurely loses its grip on the viewer with the increasingly middling midsection which is devoted primarily to barnabas lessthancaptivating efforts at both rebuilding his family business and destroying greens sultry character paving the way for an actionpacked climax thats as conventional as it is tedious the end result is a disappointingly underwhelming endeavor that stands as the latest misfire from a once rocksolid filmmaker which is a shame certainly since dark shadows does possess a good chunk of exceedingly positive attributes eg depps amusingly broad performance based on a 29minute short from 1984 frankenweenie follows an intrepid youngster charlie tahans victor as he successfully brings his dead dog back to life using a frankensteinlike contraption there is unfortunately never a point at which its not completely obvious that frankenweenie has been adapted from a short film as the movie scripted by john august has been suffused with a number of sequences that are either palpably overlong or flatout needless  with the paddedout vibe as anticipated diminishing the strength of the films positive attributes its clear though that frankenweenie benefits substantially from tim burtons expectedly largerthanlife approach to the material as the director has infused the proceedings with a broad and decidedly gothic sensibility thats more in line with his earlier efforts edward scissorhands batman than with his newer comparatively garish output alice in wonderland dark shadows the films highlight is for example a long bravura sequence in which vincent resurrects his departed pooch theres a lack of momentum here that grows increasingly problematic as time progresses however and its worth noting too that the aggressively actionpacked final stretch which seems to take up a third of the movies running time ensures that the film concludes with a whimper instead of a bang still frankenweenie is nevertheless an obvious step in the right direction for burton after a series of overwhelming overthetop blockbusters  although its becoming less and less likely that the filmmaker will ever return to the aboveaverage landscape of his first features big eyes tells the truelife story of painter margaret keane amy adams with the movie detailing the characters marriage to christoph waltzs charismatic yet sleazy walter and the eventual fallout of his decision to take credit for her drawings filmmaker tim burton admittedly does a smashing job of initially drawing the viewer into the proceedings as the early part of big eyes boasts a fastpaced colorful sensibility thats heightened by adams typically appealing turn as the central character it does become dishearteningly clear however that theres just not enough story here to sustain a fulllength motion picture with the film suffering from a repetitive midsection that grows more and more tedious as time progresses ie once the conflict between margaret and walter has been established big eyes treads water to an almost shocking extent the excessively deliberate pacing and annoyingly overthetop performance by waltz compounds the films simplistic atmosphere as the narrative increasingly begins to resemble an empowering feelgood drama that one might expect to see on lifetime by the time the bizarre thematicallyincongruous courtroom finale rolls around big eyes has confirmed its place as yet another in a long line of disappointments from a once rocksolid filmmaker tim burton hits rock bottom with this thoroughly misbegotten adaptation of ransom riggs eponymous novel as the film which follows asa butterfields jake as he discovers the title domicile and the assortment of quirky gifted characters that reside within comes off as an interminable mess thats too frightening for children and too unfocused and meandering to keep older viewers interested ie who is the target audience for this disaster exactly burtons pervasively lazy approach to the waferthin material is in evidence virtually from the minute go with miss peregrines home for peculiar children suffering from a shockingly sluggish narrative thats compounded by an absence of threedimensional characters and an almost aggressively bland and drab visual sensibility ie why does the movie look as though it was shot through a screen door jane goldmans paddedout meandering screenplay grows more and more aimless as time slowly progresses and its consequently impossible to work up any interest in jakes eventual investigation into the oddball happenings at the title locale the increasingly frenetic and actionpacked bent of the movies second half is nothing short of exhausting with the viewers total lack of investment here preventing such moments from generating the thrills and excitement that burton has undoubtedly intended  which when coupled with an absolutely endless climax cements miss peregrines home for peculiar childrens place as a complete disaster from a director who really needs to be put out to pasture 
Jul 25 2005,positive,different enough to not make me shake my head and say why did they even bother
Jul 24 2005,positive,not a remake but a bold genuinely delightful new interpretation of a classic childrens story with intoxicating color sound and fury and heart tim burton pulls it off
Jul 24 2005,neutral,  that said there are a few enjoyable factory scenes deserving praise the squirrelnutsorting scene is absolutely adorable and the tv transport scene has its highlights aside from that the factory tour is rather tedious  depp is not wonka hes depp trying to be quirky creepy and charming all at once and oompas are fun at first but very quickly bore as long as theyre going to use only one actor then computer multiply him why not get someone who can really dance break dance hiphop something the musical sequences are drab sporting uninspiring songs and direction   i also loved the design and blocking of charlies family home bent slanting pocked with holes out to the snow above but warm nonetheless the seating of both sets of grandparents in one bed is absolutely genius 
Jul 23 2005,positive,like sense and sensibility a good screenplay can be its own creation and still be slavishly true to its sourcea perfect cast and a loviong adaptation read the book

Jul 21 2005,positive,the everlasting gobstopper of dahl adaptations
Jul 20 2005,positive,attempts to provide wonkas backstory can slow down the films momentum but overall burton puts an enjoyable twist on a beloved story while justifying the remakes existence
Jul 20 2005,positive, theres more manic invention creativity and the sheer joy of filmmaking in any five minutes of tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory than has yet been seen in all the mainstream releases of 2005 put together the film is not going to be to everyones liking  and thank god for that because a film thats to everyones liking is by its very nature bound to be free of much in the way of risks and charlie is nothing if not risktaking i remember reading a basically negative review of spielbergs war of the worlds where the writer remarked that it was probably impossible for spielberg to make a truly bad movie its an arguable statement that i think was meant as a kind of praise but it strikes me as an assessment of a filmmaker who long ago gave up taking any risks at all happily burton seems to have sidestepped this pitfall  though it was a close call when he opted to prove he could make a normal movie with planet of the apes of course remaking a moveloved classic  including charlie and apes  was a risk in itself few seem to remember now that the original was a huge flop that was rescued from oblivion by tv and the latenight stoner crowd and frankly apart from gene wilders performance it isnt much of a movie in any case burton hasnt so much remade the 1971 film as hes put his personal spin on the source book by roald dahl  and the results are phenomenal if ever a filmmaker was suited to his material burton is to this the material in fact seems like a tim burton picture just waiting to be made  and in collaboration with two of burtons most remarkable coconspirators johnny depp and danny elfman from start to finish this is a burton film  with everything that implies and then some its the and then some that pushes his new film into greatness instead of the movie just being an exercise in burtonism  charlie follows the pattern of virtually burtons entire filmography even to the point of referencing his earlier films the opening credits for instance are in a style that can only be called typical burton while the workings of the chocolate factory beneath those credits evoke the inventors cookie machine in edward scissorhands moreover the factory itself  perched above the town as a brooding place of mystery  inevitably recalls the inventors improbable castle at the end of a suburban street similarly the new films setting continues the directors love affair with snow  and his final image even jokingly references that this is more an aesthetic romance than a genuine fondness for the powdery white stuff but theres more here than a burtons greatest hits package its not that burton departs from himself in charlie  he expands theres not much in his previous work to suggest that burton would make a film that plays like a combination of fairy tale british invasion flick and particularly twisted busby berkeley musical but thats what hes made here which makes sense burton is exactly the right age to have been fueled by the popart culture referenced here including berkeleys work which underwent a major revival in the late 60s and early 70s typically burton doesnt reproduce the things he evokes but fashions his take based more on his memory of them than on simple reality this helps burton capture the freshness that was so a part of the era in which dahls work first appeared and which now feeds the directors vision of dahls book but instead of aping the pop culture of that time burton has created what feels like the greatest british invasion flick never made  and his star and composer seem perfectly in tune with him depps willy wonka with his pageboy hair and velvet coat looks for all the world like a disaffected 60sera rock star his wonka is a startling some say frightening creation wandering through his private world of personal pleasures in a perpetual haze the scripts references to grass and flashbacks are hardly accidental but hes more than a vaguely burntout rocker hes also the burton misfit of so many movies as such hes from that world but not really of it willy wonka is also an extension of burtons take on childhood the character is similar to other burton heroes in that he has father issues yet differs in that he cannot relate to doesnt understand and doesnt even like children this may seem odd in view of burtons ability to empathize with the seriousness to a child of childhood but why would you expect a man whose view of childhood is  to put it mildly  rather bleak to identify with its more normal inhabitants the answer of course is that you wouldnt youd expect him to be awkward to distance himself to not really like them  and perhaps be jealous of them and thats exactly what depp and burton give us in keeping with the invasionpicture tone we also have danny elfmans score  and more importantly his songs which not only evoke the 60s but elfmans own work with oingo boingo despite elfmans altered vocals his songs here sound like his own earlier rock music which was always much influenced by a brit invasion sensibility in a sense elfman here returns to his roots and something similar can be said of burton not only is the director evoking something of his childhood but charlie is also a film that calls to mind more than anything else the wild energy and cheeky dayglo colors of burtons first feature peewees big adventure the result is a brilliant synthesis of burtons work to date that also manages to break new ground in such a way that it makes you anxious to see where he will go next if you can ask for more from a movie than that then youre

beloved old teddy bear i watched it again  this version was closer to the book than the wilder version  i liked the family better and i liked burtons twist on them  they were pretty saccharine and onedimensional in the first film depps performance to me seemed to be quirky for the sake of quirkiness and too michael jacksonesque  it felt like an experiment that didnt work and was then justified with a hastily writtenin backstory  wonkas character in the book was a lovable eccentric  to turn that character into a strange creepy guy with a hint of paedophilia just seems wrong  i dont think dahl would have been pleased depps performance to me seemed to be quirky for the sake of quirkiness and too michael jacksonesque  it felt like an experiment that didnt work and was then justified with a hastily writtenin backstory  wonkas character in the book was a lovable eccentric  to turn that character into a strange creepy guy with a hint of paedophilia just seems wrong well to be honest with you if you take out the notion that hes meant to evoke michael jackson  which never even occurred to me  im not sure where youre getting pedophilia this may be a generational thing since ive noticed that people for whom jackson is a youthful pop icon other than as a kid in the jackson five latch on to this jackson comparison i can see where it comes from but does it match the british invasion acidflashback tone of the movie id say not really to me wonka is a stonedout rocker from the 1960s not michael jackson apart from the fact that this is burtons film and not dahls book its as well to remember that dahl wasnt pleased with the earlier version either moreover apart from the very ending of the old version its wonka could hardly be described as a lovable eccentric wilders wonka is downright sinister well to be honest with you if you take out the notion that hes meant to evoke michael jacksonwhich never even occurred to meim not sure where youre getting pedophilia i dont see where youre getting that except from the music and maybe his clothes  he was repressed anal and just generally weird through the whole movie  he seemed more like a less entertaining peewee herman who would wear his pajamas buttoned up to the neck to me  and the disturbing childman thing worked for paul reubens but the sexual ambiguity did make you uncomfortable  that feel of being sexually arrested reminded me of peewee as well were going to have to agree to disagree on that one  but i have an admitted bias towards the old version  i didnt feel the sense of menace from wilders wonka that i did from depps but thats a personal reflection btw i meant to also say that i liked carter in this and i usually dont care for her remember the great mrs lovitz debate  i agree wth you about her making the perfect bellatrix lestrange though well the clothes definitely  look at the beatles the moody blues marc bolan from the latemid 60s  and the pageboy hair definitely not michael jackson and the references to drugs and drug flashbacks all that says burntout 60s rocker to me now im not saying that depps wonka isnt menacing  only that so is wilders id also not say that this is a bad thing in either case in fact the sinister quality of wilder is all that makes the old movie even watchable to me
Jul 19 2005,positive,as a successor to the original charlie and the chocolate factory is a pleasant enough concoction
Jul 19 2005,positive,if you like when adults creepier than michael jackson joke about cannibalism in front of children than youll be in wonky heaven
Jul 19 2005,positive,its designed to bring out the very worst qualities of children none of which are pleasant most of which hit their mark
Jul 19 2005,positive,depps onejoke performance makes the film a confection with a hollow center

Jul 19 2005,negative,charlies disturbing factorytim burton rendition of childs tale excessive
Jul 19 2005,positive,  deliciously dark and packed with candycoloured visuals tim burtons adaptation of roald dahls charlie and the chocolate factory is an intoxicating endorphin rush freddie highmore is engagingly winsome as one of five children who scores a ticket to the worlds most magnificent chocolate factory but its his finding neverland costar johnny depp who steals the show as the oddball chocolatier while the story is a little soft in the centre his take on willy wonka is a richly layered treat  theres more than a touch of wacko jacko about his childlike demeanour  even down to the nervous giggle  but the genius of depps performance is that he manages to be creepy sympathetic and hilarious all at once papa he whimpers when charlie introduces him to his grandpa joe david kelly straight away its clear that wonka is a few fondants short of the whole box  screenwriter john august embellishes dahls story with carefully pitched flashbacks to wonkas traumatic childhood and gives depp the edge over gene wilders 1971 portrayal the backstory lends a darker tone but strangely for burton the idea of the four rotten children who disappear one by one on the factory tour lacks a palpable sense of menace his greatest strength is in creating a seductive but slightly offkilter wonderland rippled with chocolate rivers and where marshmallows grow on shrubs harvested by pygmylike oompaloompas all played by deep roy with a garnish of zingy dialogue dont touch that squirrels nuts it makes him crazy the finished product is a confection sure to bring out the child in any fudgeloving fuddyduddy
Jul 18 2005,negative,you cant help feeling that a fantasist as accomplished as burton can manage this kind of project with his eyes shut the trouble is that from film to film his dreams are starting to look the same
Jul 18 2005,negative,like too much candy this movie causes a bellyache of entertainment
Jul 18 2005,positive,burtons modernized take  benefits from improved special effects and the unhinged brilliance of his repeat collaborator johnny depp

Jul 17 2005,positive,definitely number one in movies about candy factories nudging or is that fudging out 1971s willy wonka  the chocolate factory by an everlasting gobstopper
Jul 16 2005,positive,perhaps the best defense of peewee hermann and michael jackson ever offered
Jul 16 2005,positive,burton and depps willy wonka doesnt like children i admire that
Jul 16 2005,positive,ignore the gaffes and this retelling sparkles
Jul 16 2005,positive, tim burtons charlie and the chocolate   factory is enough to make any fan of roald dahls most beloved novel cry  with   delight at all the film gets so magically right and with   frustration that in spite of that the film is still nearly ruined   by burtons obsessions and a spectacularly miscalculated   performance by star johnny depp no one but burton could possibly have so perfectly nailed   dahls blend of whimsical fantasy and withering comeuppance or   the dickensian glee and extravagance of its moralityplay   tableau with abject poverty and decency lavishly rewarded while   excess and surfeit and decadence are mercilessly punished and no one but burton could possibly have thought it would be   a good idea to give candymaker extraordinaire willy wonka depp   unresolved issues from childhood stemming from a traumatic   relationship with his dentist father christopher lee leaving   wonka unable to say the words family or parents and subject   to disorienting childhood flashbacks when the books climax and   denouement have played out and the credits should be rolling any   minute now and the film suddenly invents additional obstacles to   delay the heros reward then cuts to a scene with the other most   prominent character on a psychiatrists couch can there be any   doubt that the film has gone off the rails and who on earth thought it was a good idea to have depp play   willy wonka with deathly palegrey makeup framed by a black bob   did anybody but depp himself think that his portrayal of wonka as   an emotionally stunted antisocial misfit with a chilly nervous   giggle who delivers lines like lets boogey and youre really   weird as if coining new catchphrases was an improvement over   dahls character as badly as gene wilder botched the role in   1971 this is worse yet take out wonka and whats left is little short of   brilliant far outstripping the 1971 film from young charlie   bucket freddy highmore fresh from his last collaboration with   depp finding   neverland his extended family and their crazy   ramshackle house to the wonders of wonkas factory including   the oompaloompas and their zany musical numbers to the   overthetop rottenness of the other four children and for the   most part their parents this charlie and the chocolate   factory is both faithful and inspired true both to the   spirit and the letter of the book even as it goes beyond it in   ways its so good it has the makings of a modern family   classic the dark childhood fantasy that all the harry potter   films and lemony snicket   are trying to be and yet at the center of it all is one of the best actors in   hollywood working as hard as he can to ruin the film aided and   abetted by tackedon excursions into yet another cinematic   rehashing of tim burtons father figure issues cf big fish edward   scissorhands for those who havent read the book allow me to introduce you   to a character you wont meet in either film mr willy wonka as   dahl introduces him we learn of marvelously bright eyes   twinkling and sparkling at you all the time in a face alight   with fun and laughter dahl rhapsodizes about how clever he   looked how quick and sharp and full of life in his movements   like a quick clever old squirrel at the park on seeing the   children he does a funny skipping dance and calls out to them   in a high flutey voice hes delighted to meet them all  and   their parents  and clearly just as excited as everyone   else he looks and behaves in fact like a slender hyperactively   excitable santa claus proudly welcoming visitors to a north pole   workshop of candy rather than toys for some inexplicable reason   its a characterization neither film version to date comes within   a million miles of wilders wonka was almost the polar opposite of dahls   creation lowkey and darkly ironic depp on the other hand   takes the character in a direction at right angles to both dahls   and wilders versions dahls wonka was genuinely friendly   wilders wonka at least knew how to fake it depps character not   only doesnt try he wouldnt even know how to in fact hes so   socially dysfunctional he has no clue how to make a speech of   welcome or respond to basic questions without a stack of note   cards from which he reads as mechanically as a first grader   sounding out dr seuss its ironic that where the 1971 film was called willy wonka    the chocolate factory this one takes the name of the   original book charlie and the chocolate factory even   though the climax of the story the filmmakers wish to tell is no   longer charlies moral triumph or crowning reward but willy   wonkas emotional healing and life lessons learned about the real   meaning of family on one level of course only fans of the book will be   bothered by the films radical reconstruction of the character  though its a crying shame that the film bothers to be so   brilliantly true to the book in almost every other way only to   subvert it so thoroughly in this one crucial respect yet will   anyone even newcomers to the story find this willy wonka   engaging interesting or an any way appealing are wonkas   childhood issues really of interest to anyone but burton and   depp although the creep factor of depps wonka is real the effect   is somewhat exaggerated by external factors including timing and   depps previous choices as roger ebert astutely observes that   depp has acknowleged that his performance in pirates of the caribbean   was largely inspired by keith richards of the rolling stones has   primed us to look for inspirations here as well and as it happens recent events make it nearly impossible   watching this film not to think of another emotionally stunted   reclusive millionaire childman with pale skin and black hair who   built a fantasy wonderland for himself and then invited children   into it the neverland connection of depps last film in which   he played yet another emotionally stunted childman who created   fantasy worlds  and was explicitly suspected of pedophilia  doesnt help matters yet theres no hint in depps brittle   performance of michael jacksons mannerisms or speech   patterns and the rest of the film is good enough that its worth   gritting ones teeth and looking past willy wonka from the   hypercompetitiveness of violet beauregarde annasophia robb   because of   winndixie  and of her excheerleader mother who   competes vicariously through her daughter  to the aggressive   impatient computergame mentality of video junkie mike teavee    jordan fry the films cautionary satire hits bullseyes the casting  again depp aside  is perfect old david kelly    waking ned devine is noteperfect as grandpa joe and indian   actor deep roy big fish   planet of the apes   brings solemn dignity to the role of all 100 oompaloompas whose   showstopping musical numbers composed by longtime burton   collaborator danny elfman to lyrics drawn unlike those of the   oompa loompa song of the earlier film straight from dahl made   me want to stand up and cheer if only the camera didnt keep   coming back to depp every time the music winds down along with chitty chitty bang bang and the 10000 fingers of dr t willy wonka illustrates the distinct possibility of telling a fairytale like story about a child transported to a fantasy wonderland with brightly costumed little people singing and dancing and strange dangers to be negotiated yet winding up with a film that is more a fond tribute to pure imagination than a triumph of it
Jul 16 2005,positive,imaginative and highly visual rendering with a deliciously venal wit
