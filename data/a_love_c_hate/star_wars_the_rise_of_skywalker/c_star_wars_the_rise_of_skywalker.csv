Apr 4 2024,positive,a beautiful capper to not only just this new trilogy but the entire skywalker saga
Sep 26 2023,negative, may the 4th be with you ever since those words were uttered in 1979 it was bound to the star wars franchise till the end of time what i love about that pun is that it wasnt created by the fans it happened when margaret thatcher became the prime minister of the uk not only did that term  became a dedicated phrase to star wars fans around the world but it also shows how much weight the original phrase may the force be with you has on star wars zealots  as every year passes fans of this franchise rewatch their favorite star wars movies as if its some type of tradition it surrounds us penetrates us and binds us fanatics together this franchise means the world to so many people and has helped others get through difficult times in their lives as some films do and i believe that to be the power of the force working its magic in the best way it knows how as i mentioned before rewatching star wars films every year is a tradition for most people and i plan to carry the torch as it is my duty as a fan here is my definitive ranking of every star wars movie  i want to start by saying that i had a lot of fun with this film but this finale that supposedly concludes a ninefilm franchise has to be the worst out of the entire skywalker saga much like the last jedi this film provided us with some of the best visual effects and cinematography i have ever seen from any star wars movie or series there are countless screenshots that i have used as my computer wallpaper they are truly something to behold unfortunately the story feels more like a collage of multiple threads that were never mentioned in the previous installments this is especially true with finns john boyega story arc many important lines of dialogue feel like they appeared out of thin air finn is screaming reys daisy ridley name and attempting to tell her that he is forcesensitive but his story thread never goes anywhere it feels as if this should have been addressed in the force awakens to set up different events moving forward not only does this film feel rushed but the third act is extremely similar to disneys other box office success avengers endgame i hate sand its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere this is one of the most quotable lines to any star wars fan it almost sums up your feelings for the film in the bluntest way possible this entry was filled with so much potential but with a run time of 2 hours and 22 minutes it feels as though youre waiting for the hourglass to run out star wars attack of the clones is supposed to be the story of how anakin hayden christiansen and padme amidala natalie portman fell in love and launched us into the events of the star wars clone wars series those are the two saving graces of this film and we finally get to see yoda frank oz face off against count dooku christopher lee i cannot express how terrible and dragged out the pacing of this entry was it is the weakest episode of the prequel trilogy  this film is criminally underrated i dont think people give it enough credit as it is the featurelength film that launched the success of the tv series of the same name is the plot silly yes saving jabba the hutts son from imprisonment is very outlandish and hilarious but the way it is woven into the story makes it work this film is director dave filonis passion project he is one of the few directors out there who truly understands star wars and never disappoints and he introduces my 2nd favorite character in the history of the franchise ahsoka tano as she becomes anakin skywalkers padawan they must both learn how to trust each other in dire situations and build a mutual bond of trust patience and faith in one another this is a film i always find myself going back to due to its comedic moments and amazing action scenes  out of any star wars movie solo a star wars story is the most unnecessary of them all now dont get me wrong i had a lot of fun going on a new adventure with young han solo played by alden ehrenreich however this story doesnt add any necessary facts that i needed to know about the character i dont need to know how han solo and chewbacca met how han got his name or how a spry lando calrissian donald glover met the franchises most famous smuggler i wish this film would have focused on the random adventures of han solo and chewbacca instead of trying to give us a backstory to give more depth to his character han solos first love interest qira emilia clarke was the saving grace of the film the cast is great theres no doubt about it but theres a reason why disney stepped away from creating so many standalone star wars films and i think this film was a contributing factor  this is perhaps the goofiest entry in the original trilogy which is something i adore mainly thanks to the ewoks there is nothing more lovable than a gearedup teddy bear thats ready to kick some empire booty its never clear how much time has passed between the events of the empire strikes back and return of the jedi but this being the final installment of a trilogy isnt the worst but its not the greatest either for some reason ive always felt like there was an element missing from the story perhaps there are too many moving parts or not enough ive never been able to put my finger on it but the scenes between darth vader james earl jones and luke mark hamill are some of the best scripts that the franchise has to offer as this is the final chapter of a trilogy it never feels like we got a proper goodbye ending to these characters we love so dear  i will always acknowledge the importance and impact this film had on countless fans worldwide it is the foundation of the franchise we all love so dearly and presented the start of the heros journey engagingly which made it a lighting inthebottle experience nonetheless i have always had more issues with this movie over other entries in this franchise a new hope is a wellmade film full of outstanding performances and practical effects but the pacing of this story is unfortunately its greatest downfall i have watched this movie countless times and the beginning of lukes journey has always felt like the story is dragging its feet until the 2nd act when the story finally starts to give us insight into a larger galaxy with that being said this film shines with its expedition outside of the sands of tatooine now this is podracing ill admit it i am a big fan of the prequel trilogy i grew up with them and have always had a soft spot for this film this is the start of anakins journey as he is thrown into a life larger than himself  much like star wars a new hope a good chunk of the film takes place on tatooine and suffers a few of the same pacing issues with moving the story along the main difference is that the phantom menace focuses more on the political state of the galaxy and it isnt as action heavy the visual effects are outdated but for a film made in 1999 they were pretty impressive for its time it always seems as if this film gets an unfair hake we were introduced to darth maul and the doublesided lightsaber the best podracing scene in the history of the franchise and the duel of fates score composed and conducted by john williams whats not to love director gareth edwards has created one of the best modern star wars films in recent years and even though it fits into the events of the mainline movies it tells a bleak tale of sacrifice freedom and hope from early drafts of the script to unused footage this film pulls multiple inspirations from  a new hope as this story serves as more of a prologue to the events of that film micheal giacchinos score for rogue one is mostly original with a dash of john williams work blended in the theme of this story is about characters such as jyn erso felicity jones and cassian andor diego luna shifting from incarceration to developing their own free will not only is this one of my favorite films in the series but it also gives the most jawdropping darth vader scene in the franchise  let the past die kill it if you have to its the only way to become who you were meant to be no one hates star wars more than star wars fans this film will stand the test of time as the most divisive story in the franchise and i will defend it until the end of time the last jedi is the most ambitious star wars movie to ever grace theaters and our television screens director rian johnson had a vision for this franchise moving forward and the only way to escape the jedi and sith struggle was to let the past die the last jedi is a perfect sequel to the force awakens they blend so well together especially dealing with the ancestry of rey daisy ridley giving luke skywalker mark hamill the perfect sendoff and finally giving disney the opening to move forward with how we view the jedi and sith it is by no means a perfect movie but it still works it encompasses the ideology of what the force is and much like reys origin leaves more questions than answers  movies in which the protagonists fail to save the day will always be my bread and butter it shows that even the greatest heroes we admire have flaws it makes the heroes of the story relatable and shows us a different side of the characters when things do hit a rough patch the empire strikes back proves that a sequel can improve and outperform its predecessor from the getgo this film goes full steam from start to finish it is the most wellpaced out of the original trilogy and it feels like the characters are constantly on the run without changing locations before they have a moment to breathe every time i watch this film time seems to fly by with no effort this is one of the best climaxes that movies can offer and receives all of the respect it deserves i saw this film three times in theaters and to this day it is easily one of my favorites of the mainline stories disney proved that they were able to handle ushering in a new wave of fans into this franchise im aware of the naysayers when it comes to the sequel trilogy people say this story echoes a new hope and in some ways it does however i believe this to be a refined and improved film over a new hope the pacing is incredible and the movie flies by without any fatigue the force awakens has so much to offer rey daisy ridley is a phenomenal character i have always adored her determination resourcefulness and empathy toward others this was daisys first big role in her career and she is now one of the many faces for new star wars fans finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar issac are strong additions along with kylo ren adam driver becoming one of the most complex star wars villains in the franchise finn and rey click instantly in the scenes they share it makes me wish that their relationship would have evolved into something more intimate the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural  this might come as a shock to most fans out there but this is my favorite star wars story of all time there is a chain of themes that snowball into one another fear leads to the anger of things you cannot control which launches you into hating the very thing you cant contain and ends in suffering if there was one word to describe this tale of a fallen hero its melancholy this is not a happy story this is the climax of anakins passage to the dark side his mind has been twisted and warped and as he slowly transforms into the greatest villain in movie history he never stops seeing himself as the hero of his narrative anakindarth vader has always been a layered character and thats what makes his transformation so interesting his suffering and hatred stem from multiple sources the death of his mother the distrust in the jedi the fear of padme dying in childbirth and countless other reasons it is always fascinating to see a character go through a powerful transformation whether it be for better or for worse
Sep 10 2023,negative, in a galaxy far far away life is not always easy and im not just talking about epic battles between good and evil though the final chapter of george lucass saga begins right where its prequel left off with the resistance and the first order very much at war and rey daisy ridley still trying to understand the ways of the force star wars the rise of skywalker also introduces new elements that drive the narrative away from the direction established by rian johnson in the last jedi  part of what made fans have such strong opinions whether positive or negative on episode viii is that it genuinely managed to subvert expectations on what a star wars movie should be like in the last jedi we learned that jedis can make mistakes that being rebellious isnt always the answer and that not every star wars character needs to be related to a skywalker in order to be gifted in the force as a matter of fact reys parents were nobodies and yet the force is still very much strong in this one as master yoda would put it  johnson also enabled ordinary characters such as rose kelly marie tran and vice admiral holdo laura dern to play an extraordinary role in the rebellion and used reys unexplicable connection with kylo ren adam driver to bring further meaning to the existence of the force though the last jedi left more than one question unanswered and plenty of room for developing certain themes that are only hinted at in the film the rise of skywalker strays from johnsons direction and takes a different path entirely if the last jedi left us wondering about a child using the force to move a broom the rise of skywalker wants us to stick to the main storyline and directs our attention back to reys origins in fact lets forget about the last few movies entirely emperor snoke andy serkis was as much of a nobody as rey is and we now have a new villain or rather a very old one jjabrams resurrects emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid who is back with a new evil plan only his plan is not new and not evil at all and his night of the living dead look is not threatening at all in fact palpatines unconvincing scheming is only the first of a series of developments that are not only messy and confusing but also full of plot holes  with the kind of attachment fans have to the first three chapters of the star wars saga a high degree of nostalgia is to be expected in its latest releases and the rise of skywalker doesnt disappoint seeing chewie joonas suotamo on the millennium falcon will always remind us of han solo harrison ford and well never get tired of listening to c3po anthony danielss unsolicited opinions and watching leia carrie fisher gracefully lead the rebels the rise of skywalker provides plenty of nostalgic moments quotable lines and familiar appearances that remind us of specific moments in star wars history  it also leaves enough room for john boyega and oscar isaac to shine as finn and poe dameron who are without a doubt the real heroes of this film there are hilarious lines memeworthy scenes insightful pearls of wisdom chess games and a few truly unexpected twists that give much needed screen time to characters we seldom get to see yet the narrative is so messy that it leaves little room for any real growth its hard to take the rise of skywalker seriously and that is simply because some of its narrative developments dont seem to make much sense in a film that is developed around nostalgia and that seems to borrow props from the marvel cinematic universe dialogues and scenes and basilisk from harry potter supporting characters from pirates of the caribbean and sentimental moments from the lion king and beauty and the beast there isnt much room for originality a lot happens in a short amount of time plans are conceived characters learn unconvenient truths about each other and their relatives in the best star wars tradition and choices are made  yet the absence of context makes it hard for the audience to understand some of these developments which are given names but never really explained in a film where everything happens too quickly and too easily there isnt any conflict to face just like there is no real momentum or buildup though the movie does provide a few emotional scenes towards the end it doesnt leave us much room to let its harshest choices really sink in it also makes it really hard to understand its confusing ending and that is a real shame star wars the rise of the skywalker is not an unenjoyable movie altogether youll find yourself laughing at its most absurd moments and genuinely having fun during its battle scenes youll be mesmerized by adam drivers performance and youll find yourself rooting for finn poe leia chewbacca c3po and r2d2 at different times and for different reasons youll enjoy watching lando billy dee williams in action once more youll get teary at the most unexpected times and youll channel your inner bb8 brian herring more than once youll also be frustrated by the films lack of clarity and at the end of it all youll find yourself struggling to remember its most confusing moments
Jul 24 2023,neutral, synopsis when its discovered that the evil emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid did not die at the hands of darth vader james earl jones the rebels must race against the clock to find out his whereabouts finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac lead the resistance to put a stop to the first orders plans to form a new empire while rey daisy ridley anticipates her inevitable confrontation with kylo ren adam driver the rise of skywalker is a tremendous letdown i wont sugarcoat it if someone told me at the beginning of the year that jj abrams wouldnt be able to offer a satisfying end to the nineepisode story i would laugh like crazy it disappointed me so much that i dont even want to extend this review more than the usual i know that a lot of people hated the last jedi but for better or worse that film exists rian johnsons decisions were made some people received them well some didnt but all of us got to watch and experience his narrative theres something called artistic integrity which jj abrams and chris terrio completely forgot about the lack of respect for the sagas previous installment is baffling the structureless screenplay is so unbelievably convoluted that it reaches a point where evident logical issues come into play major plot points occur due to some genuinely hardtobelieve events and even the characters seem to have no path whatsoever its entertainment for the sake of entertainment of course there are a lot of visually jawdropping action sequences the cinematography dan mindel is some of the best ive seen in the franchise and in this year john williams score is emotionally compelling and it definitely elevates a lot of important moments being a big source for the chills down my body and yes there are a bunch of epic scenes however throughout the whole runtime the frustration was always there major threads and character backstories were answered in the last jedi but the rise of skywalker feels more like another sequel to the force awakens than to rian johnsons flick if theres one undeniable aspect about this trilogy that this last movie proves is that there was no plan no roadmap no overall structure whether you love or hate each or every installment this is indisputable disney screwed up this time creative freedom is essential to filmmakers but the production team behind a franchise needs to have a wellorganized structure the simple fact that jj abrams directed the first film left and returned to do the third one is already weird and uncommon by itself besides the lack of artistic integrity theres this feeling of constant disappointment throughout the movie on several occasions the rise of skywalker is so close to delivering a perfect sequence a chillinducing moment an incredibly emotional scene almost every time it fails at the last second at the last line of dialogue or at the last action movement some moments are still captivating and they dont lose that much impact nevertheless some are totally destroyed by the most ridiculous cringeworthy choices ive witnessed in the saga the first act is devoid of any thought characters go to places to get something they need to another place so that in that place they find something else that leads them into another place its frenetic outofcontrol pacing the desperation to set up so many different side stories in time is so prominent that its visible from another galaxy from the second act on things get a bit more clear and in the third act all the threads blend decently its in the last 30 minutes that the resemblances to avengers endgame come into play the only difference is that it doesnt have 110 of the emotional impact due to the questionable decisions i mentioned above only one character got his arc complete without detours or significant changes kylo ren jj set him up rian johnson continued his journey and jj closed his arc pretty well every other character either got their arcs complete with major changes throughout or they didnt come close to finish their own story theres one exception though and thats carrie fischers leia it would be extremely disrespectful and unfair for someone to criticize the filmmakers about her they inserted her reasonably well in the scenes please if someone complains about visual effects just get lost and they did the absolute best they could under the known circumstances i might be extremely disappointed but i do have to send the team my congrats for closing her arc in the most dignified way possible as for everyone else well the cast has been outstanding from the very beginning adam driver i have no words for him hes so perfect as kylo ren that i even defend his character as a villain more layered and emotionally complex than darth vader i love daisy ridley as rey and she does a phenomenal job in this last film even when her dialogue doesnt entirely suit her john boyega oscar isaac and everyone else who i wont mention due to possible spoilers are all brilliant and i have to congratulate them on making every single movie a bit better
Jul 20 2023,negative, star wars has gone through three evolutionary stages the first trilogy of films captured the spirit of the saturday afternoon movie serials produced during the golden age of hollywood imaginative worldbuilding and unambiguous good versus evil storylines provided state of the art escapism for a generation still recovering from watergate and vietnam the second trilogy reflected the creators elevated sense of selfimportance the films themselves taking on a pretentious air of somber seriousness as if george lucas thought his puerile space operas were on equal footing with shakespeare aesthetically their antiseptic computer generated images reflected the technological boom of the 90s with the release of star wars the rise of skywalker  the supposed final episode of the final trilogy yeah right  the franchise has successfully recaptured some of the fun of the original trilogy while pandering to the concerns of millennials such as diversity representation and gender equality no matter where one falls on the previous installment the general consensus is rian johnsons script for the last jedi was for the most part unpredictable taking delight in deliberately subverting audience expectations despite grossing over a billion dollars johnsons upsettheapplecart approach did not sit well with most fans apparently the lesson learned from the backlash is that a successful star wars sequel must play it safe with a nostalgic approach that adheres to previously established formulae to that end writerdirector jj abrams along with three other writers coursecorrected by recycling characters and plot points from the first trilogy just as they did with the force awakens then they compensated for their lack of vision with more frequent and extravagant action sequences jedi powers approaching those of a god and a bigger technological threat which of course has the exploitable achilles heel some fans might appreciate returning to familiar territory however theres a fine line between familiarity and predictability and the rise of skywalker crosses that line more than any of the previous chapters it also undoes or ignores virtually everything that occurred in the last jedi structurally it takes a while to settle into a comfortable rhythm the first part of the film feels rushed as if the filmmakers are desperately trying to establish where everyone is and what theyre doing as quickly as possible the result is a previously on star wars ambience as if were watching an extended recap of an episode that never was despite these shortcomings and more the rise of skywalker mostly succeeds as popcorn entertainment thanks to a talented cast impressive set pieces a few laughs and the occasional inspired moment in fact those who are emotionally invested in reys character arc might want to bring some kleenex along but after an exhausting nine chapters its become pastiche sadly even john williams classic star wars theme is starting to feel tired and clichéd ever since he was a teen paul has been involved in some form of film criticism exhibition or production for the better part of two decades he moderated the film discussion group lets talk about the movies which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic del mar theater in downtown santa cruz in 2023 pauls insightful ksqd movie reviews earned him tomatometerapproved critic status on rotten tomatoes 
Apr 16 2023,positive, wrapping up a trilogy is a hard enough task on its own with narrative threads and character arcs needing a succinct and satisfying conclusion but with star wars the rise of skywalker director jj abrams and cowriter chris terrio had to wrap up 42 years worth of storytelling in one film while trying to please various fans with multiple expectations the end result is a complicated conclusion that hits high highs and low lows in the film a year has passed since the events of 2017s the last jedi and the conflict between the resistance and the first order has been shaken up by a mysterious message sent by emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid threatening the galaxy with an armada of hidden star destroyers rey daisy ridley  finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar issac are sent by general leia organa carrie fisher on a mission to find the path towards the evil sith menace as supreme leader kylo ren adam driver attempts to thwart their efforts if that information seems like a lot to take in then the first fifteen minutes of this movie is going to be quite a shock to the system one of the biggest issues with the movie is the pacing with the opening crawl feeling less like a subtle introduction laced with important information and more like a wookieepedia entry the audience doesnt really have much of a chance to breathe during the first act but at the same time  theres plenty of spectacle awe and love for these characters that you cant help being drawn in during the marketing campaign the core cast mentioned how much they enjoyed working as a trio in this film and its clear every time you see them on screen the love and friendship between these characters is joyous and contagious allowing the audience to really believe in this selfmade family which is an important theme in the movie speaking of standout performances c3p0 anthony daniels absolutely shines in this movie punintended delivering a performance that is sure to both move the audience one moment and make them laugh the next newcomers jannah naomi ackie  allegiant general pryde richard e grant and zorri bliss keri russell are a welcome introduction to the franchise but dont have much of a chance to shine with such a massive cast to focus on and so many narrative threads and plot details that need to be addressed  rian johnsons exploration of kylo ren and rey in the last jedi was one of the most interesting parts of the sequel trilogy and jj abrams picks up that torch by continuing to explore that particular relationship  including his own rendition of the fantastic force ability seen throughout the eighth installment daisy ridley and adam driver once again act their hearts out portraying these two lost yet connected souls yearning for family while jj doesnt undo rians work per se there are definitely plot points such as reys background that are once again framed as a mystery and rose ticos kelly marie tran appearance in the film is woefully short utilizing the character in exposition scenes  however the film mostly benefits from the previous episodic installment the rise of skywalker is visually stunning with setpieces such as the festival on pasaana and the ruins of the second death star being highlights of the film its absolutely one of the most visually appealing entries in the franchise providing audiences with captivating flight sequences with the millennium falcon and some of the best lightsaber choreography in the saga while at first daunting obvious reasons the use of carrie fisher and leia in the movie is beautifully done  giving the character some purpose rather than just adding her in for no reason and allowing a fitting goodbye to a character that fans have adored for 42 years the most frustrating aspect about the rise of skywalker is that it tries too hard to please everybody if anything the lesson both fans and lucasfilm should have learned from the last jedi is that sometimes you cant please everyone  and thats okay fanservice isnt always a bad thing in fact there are plenty of moments in the film that are pleasantly surprising and will certainly make some longterms fans jump up in their seats but this film is full to the brim with it but the issue with fans having different ideas of what they want from the film means that these crafted moments will either make you beam groan or both thankfully the rise of skywalker avoids the trappings of being return of the jedi with a modern coat applied to it and instead delivers a satisfying ending to the saga in whole when it comes to tying up loose ends the film actually does a pretty good job bringing this trilogys story to a close and fulfilling the main arcs of each core character  and also the wider sagalong story of the skywalkers jj even adds in a sequence thats as close to putting a bow on the whole thing as well ever get however the film is stuffed with plot and quite frankly some things just dont get an answer or explanation at all presumably those details will be left to other writers and creators in the next few years to fill out in books games etc overall the rise of skywalker is a messy film that contains too much plot for its own good but also a really entertaining movie that showcases why audiences love star wars naturally fans of star wars are not going to agree with every choice made in the film  but there are moments that are guaranteed to make people jump with joy the rise of skywalker is a messy film that contains too much plot for its own good but also a really entertaining movie that showcases why

Mar 29 2023,negative, today is may 4th yep that day    star wars  day may the 4th be with you etc a pun that thanks to the internet somehow transformed a regular day into a global holiday of star wars worship but theres only one problem i dont really want to worship at that altar any more  its embarrassing but there was a point in the prepandemic days  during my first watch of the rise of skywalker  where in a packed theater i audibly said what the hell  i cant remember exactly which part there were a few candidates it could have been right at the beginning when rose tico played by kelly marie tran was yanked from the rise of skywalker like poochie from the simpsons a move that felt designed to placate the racist trolls whod bullied tran off social media in 2018  it could have been the moment they unkilled chewbacca rewinding perhaps the only challenging moment in a first act that felt like it was written and edited by a 5yearold high on sherbet  years later distanced from the warped bubble of star wars discourse  and its place in the culture wars that consume all light and reason  its still difficult to explain why this choice annoyed me so much  in hindsight reys reveal was the moment when star wars stopped existing as an object i could believe in and transformed into banal fan fiction catering to the worst type of fan when star wars shrank into a story in a reddit thread far far away designed to offend the least amount of people possible built for people to sit in movie theatres and point look its lando landos here pity my poor wife eyes glazing over who had to endure the train journey home me arms waving like a madman trying to explain why the passable scifi flick shed just watched and immediately began forgetting like a normal adult was a betrayal that it deliberately and systematically unraveled every attempt made by the last jedi to reinvent star wars and have it successfully escape the dull nostalgia pit its now fully descended into i stand by the assessment the last jedi was a movie that demanded we let the past die it railed against casual nostalgia entire sections like the casino scene on canto bight were far from perfect but the last jedi was bold and inventive it never invited us to point look landos here instead it did a fantastic job of shredding all fan expectations it murdered its main villain halfway through the run time transformed luke skywalker from a dull dotherightthing herotype into a vicious bitter hermit tortured by his own failings  it was a film that paid testament to the weird imagination of the original trilogy but refused to pander to the most basic tenets of its mythology a vocal minority hated it but for my money it was one of the bravest blockbuster movies of the last decade it made me care about star wars again in a postgamergate age intense fandom has poisoned the well the only response treat franchises like star wars and marvel with indifference if they rise above like into the spiderverse or thor ragnarok great if they dont ah well its just a movie taking it seriously is a losing game  i made the crucial mistake that renders all fandom toxic i was invested as a teenager i devoured the star wars expanded universe the good the bad and the courtship of princess leia i was painfully in love with star wars as both a series and an idea as an adult i had a huge amount of respect for the universe and the incredible movies it helped produce but now postrise of skywalker i reckon i need a break from star wars a long break  may the fourth be with you sure id rather ignore it its a hashtag ill be muting into oblivion because in a day thats supposed to be a celebration theres not much to celebrate 
Dec 1 2022,negative, i was reading room to dream david lynchs memoirofsorts on the way to star wars episode ixthe rise of skywalker for lynch writes his biographerinterlocuter kristine mckenna the 1950s have never really gone away  classic rock n roll diner waitresses wearing cute little caps girls in bobby sox and saddle shoes sweaters and pleated plaid skirtsthese are elements of lynchs aesthetic vocabulary it then occurred to me to check whether lynch and george lucas are contemporaries which they are born 12046 and 51444 respectively for lynch these images are eternally recurring whereas lucas got them out of his system exactly once in american graffiti set in 1962 but an eisenhowerera holdover if there ever was one lynchs preoccupation with his formative years risks courting an ok boomer response but results in adventurous progressive work lucas had a different relationship to his upbringing in which memories of movie serials and the way he reformulated their narrative lessons turned out to have 40 years and countings worth of implications this is on some level the revenge of the boomers as we live in the distant muchdistorted echoes of their formative cultural intake as it turns out even setting aside lynch being offered return of the jedi im not the first person to make a connection between these two directors a serial of serials the rise of skywalker is a calamitously overstuffed series of exposition dumps relentless incident and canon boxchecking like watching someone whos on four hours of sleep and three red bulls try to do an immense task in as little time as possible so they can crash againthe movie is barreling through about three times as much information as it could reasonably bear amidst the rush to answer certain longteased questions who are reys parents will kylo ren abandon the dark side there is an ungodly amount of connective tissue that keeps characters moving from one location to another to no particular end there are very basic screenwriting problems like something happening and then characters in the very next scene describing to each other what you just saw information they have to deliver to each other to keep the plot moving there is very little time for character detail or tossedoff lines at the margins and richard e grant appears to actively be at war with the material which is actually pretty funny all the characters you would expect to make one final cameo do including carrie fisher which is a major mistake her lines are all generic unused filler perceptibly responding to nothing onscreen and theres an unavoidable shesnotthere component to her accidental performance its very funny that in this truly alternate universe adam driver looks like hes basically the same height as everybody else one of the weirdest side effects of this new star wars trilogy is the backlash narrative promulgated by breitbart and other unsavory players that basically says a beloved redblooded american franchise for manly men has been hijacked by sjws ramming progressive politics down viewer throats there isnt much to this theres the gamergateinflected argument that daisy ridleys rey is feminist propaganda  and also that lucasfilm is now owned by disney because disney world now does gay pride and releases content featuring queer people it logically follows that theyve found yet another outlet for nefarious social engineering as patently nutsoid as this argument is please explain to me precisely which progressive values are represented by the new trilogy as opposed to normalizing permanent warfare as a default premise for entertainment or the antivietnam war allegorical intent of the very first film it has some kind of countermyth staying power this reached some kind of fever pitch or other last week when breitbarts john nolte got pumped as the cast and crew started trashing the last jedi thereby vindicating him and all his fellow deplorables but but but i was told only racist toxic sexist altright wannabe hitlers didnt care for star wars the last jedi at least thats what all the supersmart people with blue checkmarks on twitter told me again this is insane but heres the thing the new star wars has definite messaging of the most useless resistance kind oscar isaac gets to rally the rebellions troops explaining that theres more of us than there are of them and that the empire succeeds by making people think they dont have a chance this is dangerously close to and thats why the democratic party must rally around joe biden and its certainly not going to help anything get done as for me this is where i get off the star wars train i was happy enough to wrap up some unfinished childhood business although if theyd stopped at force awakens that would have done the job just as well lordmiller being fired from solo was a clear indication that no coloring outside certain margins would be accepted lawrence kasdans vision must be respected so theres very little chance further interesting work will be done in this terrain after 40 years everyone can go home were done here
Aug 25 2022,positive, what a rollercoaster adventure the last two years have been for star wars fans fair or not rian johnsons the last jedi sparked all sorts of fan backlash enough to prompt some to even blame it for the 2018 solo movies disappointing box office numbers without question much of the outrage was overthetop which caused many of the legitimate criticisms to be lost in the noise but equally overthetop was the critical praise some of which heralded it as the best star wars movie ever made much of that was rooted in a needless lust for subversion and rabid contempt for fandom in reality the last jedi had problems but it wasnt the franchise killing disaster some have painted it as actually outside of about 30 minutes of wildly uneven and arguably bad storytelling its a movie with an assortment of big thrills and exciting moments more importantly it left the story in a promising place and gave the characters plenty to reckon with it ultimately set the table for rise of skywalker and the return of director and cowriter jj abrams abrams clearly listened to the criticisms which has already triggered the predictable whines of fan service from certain critic circles but star wars has always been about continuity and connection even the standalone movies are inherently connected to the films that came before them so it makes sense that abrams would try to rein in some of johnsons carefree creative choices and as a movie tasked with wrapping up an entire four decadeplus saga you almost have to expect some level of fan service heres the important thing the fan service we get in episode ix isnt halfbaked or intrusive most of it is entertaining nostalgic and ultimately satisfying cool callbacks of all kinds pop up throughout the movie lots of it genuinely in service to the story while other bits are simply there for the fun of it do they go a little overboard perhaps but whether or not it is a dealbreaker for you probably depends on how youre approaching this film as a whole skywalker gets off to a shaky and frankly concerning start the first twenty minutes or so sees abrams and cowriter chris terrio bouncing us from one location to another while never letting us plant our feet there is some snazzy scenery and a couple of decent action sequences but theyre kinda lost in the films manic rush to get the story and the characters to where they need to be but once the narrative pieces are put in place the movie slows down a bit and gets into a more manageable rhythm the movies most captivating storyline remains the mysterious connection between young and raw jedi extraordinaire rey daisy ridley and tortured dark sider kylo ren adam driver rey works hard to hone her skills but is still haunted by questions of her identity kylo who steals the movie uses every ounce of rage he can muster to smother out the glimmer of light within him both ridley and driver approach most of their scenes with a steely intensity befitting of their characters and their inevitable collision course as for another big plus skywalker finally gives the trilogys heroes some meaningful screentime together rey poe oscar isaac finn john boyega chewbacca joonas suotamo c3po anthony daniels and of course bb8 go off on a sinbadlike quest look that reference up kids to find an artifact once sought by luke skywalker mark hamill its believed to contain the location of a wayfinder that will lead them to a sith planet where a new dark force has emerged it turns out kylo ren has a wayfinder of his own and has ventured to the sinister planet while there he discovers a way to turn his terrorizing first order into a bigger and truly unstoppable force but it requires that he kill his one biggest threat  rey so as the ragtag band of heroes look for a way to the sith planet the first order scours the entire galaxy in pursuit of them despite the seriousness of their mission there are always moments of levity especially between playful best bros poe and finn but its c3po who turns out to be the biggest ham hes the perfect punchline for several jokes but he also has some cracking comedic lines of his own its just a shame r2d2 was left back at the rebel base with practically nothing to do the same could be said for lando billy dee williams who wasnt thrilled to see the goodhearted gambler returning to the franchise but he just conveniently pops up with little explanation and then quickly fades into the background and as you might expect we get several new characters entering the galaxy far far away for the first time among the best keri russells zori bliss a shady old acquaintance of poes its not a big role but zori has a background fans will love to explore richard e grant is a hoot playing the sour and everserious allegiant general pryde of the first order grant chews up his lines in classic imperial officer fashion we dont quite get enough of his story but hes a fun and interesting presence and star wars knows how to do droids new here is do affectionately called conehead by poe again small role but tender and quite funny abrams does do some patchwork to several of rian johnsons more controversial choices reys parents supreme leader snoke etc the movie addresses them in a way that should please many of the fans while infuriating those who couldnt care less about star wars continuity or lore but lets be serious the rise of skywalker had no chance of pleasing everyone it was a hopeless proposition so do you follow johnsons lead and kick more sand in the eyes of longtime fans or do you make a movie for the devoted fanbase and face the ire of scorned critics sadly an unnecessary chasm between critics and fans is all but certain and is already blazing across social media the film will probably be held to a ridiculously high standard by fans and critics and unhelpful comparisons to the original trilogy are all but inevitable its a shame because rise of skywalker is pure entertainment  fun at times thrilling with a steady tinge of franchise nostalgia and an emotional punch at the end its far from perfect the story is messy theres enough plot to fill two movies and some of its characters need more attention but this is still very much a star wars film and will evoke many of those same old feelings of kidlike joy and excitement for those who allow it im glad this worked for you but i am so bitterly disappointed i wanted so badly to like this and it sucks when something you love so much ends on a terrible note  a sorry to hear im such a diehard sw fan and i tend to digest these movies a lot differently than most i had a really good time with it my biggest gripe is that it had enough material for two movies all this fandom and whiney moaners is a bit bonkers im not sure if the same thing goes on with the marvel or dc movies probably but i dont think its as vitriolic as the star wars mob jeez people its just a godamned movie  glad you enjoyed it anyway sean over at assholes had similar feelings as yourself about it so am thinking it was mostly ok one day in a tv room far far away well 12 feet at least anyway i will watch the sw movies in order have only seen the first three this has turned into a really weird thing partly because of tenderfooted fans and antifan critics its really hard to have a rational discussion about this series these days i really enjoyed it i dont think it had as strong an impact as a closing chapter as it could have i think return of the jedi and revenge of the sith both stuck the landing a bit better yet i found it a blast i kinda wish some of those early reviews didnt seem to pit it as a last jedi vs the world situation it felt like the knives were out just because it tried not to be divisive like the last jedi  yep its unfortunate who the division over tlj is actually showing itself in many critic reviews my only real gripe on this one is that it felt rushed which left some storylines feeling underserved my son made the comment that there was enough material here for two movies the last jedi by rian johnson is the only movie in the trilogy that somewhat works and is because is the one movie jj abrams did not write not direct  thats interesting because the last jedi is easily my least favorite sw movie its a film full of incredible moments but an absolute mess of a script  you do realize that doesnt help ease the discourse right im a long time fan since i watched the original trilogy in theaters during the initial release of return of the jedi well i loved both the force awakens and the last jedi but i still enjoyed the rise of skywalker how do i fit in your narrative it doesnt sound like you do fit into my narrative i too watched all of the original films at the theater loved them watched all of the prequel trilogy on the big screen i like those films watched all the sequel trilogy including tlj in theaters liked them too so it sounds like im coming from the angle as you so i take it what you wrote there was done tongue in cheek then because it seemed rian johnson did write tlj for the devoted fanbase he actually covers themes and story threads that started in the prequels and continued in clone wars and rebels hes rewarding fans who are deep into star wars lore and history by acknowledging what those entrees contributed to the whole mythology how is that considered kicking sand in the eyes of long time fans which is why i like the movie even wrote a recent piece defending the luke skywalker depiction but at the same time he also chose to be subversive in an episode titled episode viii and clearly did so with little thought of fan reactions this was essentially reinforced by recent defensive comments about pandering to fans  but my comments were framed in the form of two questions which unfortunately represents the two most vocal sides of the responses as ive alluded to on my site and in the review i dont subscribe to either i certainly dont blame abrams for going a different route but also my problems with tlj was more about storytelling flaws than what most fans are still fussing about im seeing this tomorrow morning and ive already lowered my expectations though i tend to keep it low  at least its not fucking cats  the image of rebel wilson eating cgi cockroaches already made me throw up as im still dealing with flulike illnesses in coughs runny noses and a sore throat ya know part of me wants to see cats just to witness its horror but another part of me doesnt want to give them a dime of my money so we are watching star wars again havent seen it yet but i did get the sense that at least some critics are just looking for a reason not to like it  kind of like the last one hurt their feelings and they are getting even it does seem like abrams didnt have a chance with some critics i had a lot of fun despite its flaws seeing it again tomorrow  spoilersthat whole potential love triangle was weird and then just vanished was he going to tell her he loved her that poe loved or what tlj ends with that odd finn and rose kiss poe seems to have feelings for rey but they zorii comes along and there is clearly a spark there and then rey has her kiss moment with somebody totally different the three of them all hug at the end which i think is the best scenario  they are simply the best of friends lots of loose ends and side roads that lead nowhere  some one above mentioned how revenge of the sith  an return to the jedi both stuck the landing for their respective series and this one doesnt quite do that  i have to agree rushed and patched together it meets fan expectations for nostalgia in several places but that often leaves the story we should be following dangling  the last trilogy feels cobbled together  as if they had only the most general idea of where they were heading  and they tried to work it out as they went along emotional satisfaction was low for me but as usual  the spectacle  was solid maybe it will work better on subsequent viewing  but that is not the way i think i should have to go with a star wars movie that kind of speaks to one of my biggest gripes  there was enough material here for two movies obviously though that doesnt fit into the trilogy format spoilers things like leia teaching rey in the ways of the force thats a pretty big thing that needs more attention than a brief flashback of luke training leia same with reys parents the revelation is interesting but it still needed more attention good review keith i agree with your point its messy but its enjoyable i guess for me it was not a good the end film for the franchise but oh well wow havent felt anakins story impacted much at all by this other than it was his grandson and a new jedi trained by his children who ultimately ended the sith threat still a better movie than tlj for me anakins whole reason to turn to dark side here kylo and rey can just heal the others just like that anakins prophecy lol emperor and all the shit is back anakin also helps this random chick and doesnt help his own grandson id say that is some impact saving padme was in anakins mind but it was fed to him by palpatine who then exploited it to his advantage but in episode iii palpatine alluded to these very powers we see in this film and even see from baby yoda and im not sure how anakin could help his grandson hes been dead since well before kylo was born man you hear anakins voice rooting for rey he says nothing to ben you have luke literally lift a plane for her are you really not sure how he could help when you have force ghosts doing this whats the different that palpatine told him about it you now have two characters having that power out of nowhere for really no reason other than playing ping pong with life force why would we think that anakins force ghost would suddenly appear when the only time weve ever even seen it is standing next to yoda and obiwan in return of the jedi he has literally zero presence other than in voices some of which were manipulations of palpatine as for rey having her power we learn she has many powers she doesnt realize she has sith lightning anyone i dont know to me them having healing powers doesnt ruin things it just speaks to the criticism i have mentioned that there is too much material here for just one movie and the only reason for him not having presence is because the writers didnt include him when they could and should its the worst script for a blockbuster i saw in years you have the sith messing with ben his entire life and the jedi never intervening once when they all do for rey in the end its indefensible luke trying to rebuild the jedi was literally training ben when he turned to the dark side he was trying to help him the ghosts didnt appear to ben after he turned but thats not unusual they never appeared to vader either i suppose they could have appeared to ben before he turned but dont force ghosts only appear to those they had personal connections with what a fantastic review i cant help but agree with you on how this film will most certainly not eliminate any grievances people have had since the beginning of the new era of films your review is honestly the most fair ive seen yet thank you so much appreciate you checking it out i just finished watching it a second time and i definitely stand by my score its a strong 4 stars i even liked it better a second time because i picked up on so many more things i had missed thats what im hoping will happen for me too i always feel that the best way to handle an opinion is by giving whatever it is a second chance  the movie throws so much at you and it can be a little overwhelming on the first viewing but this time i knew where the story was going so i could pay closer attention to the details picked up several things that gave me some clarity  as a big fan of the last jedi who generally sides more with the lucasfilm and their creative choices than with the more vocal fans i absolutely love the rise of skywalker just got back from seeing it  an epic satisfying resonating conclusion to the skywalker saga and the trilogy of trilogies i had so much fun with it especially after a second viewing do yourself a favor and watch it a second time youll notice so many more things you may have missed in the first viewing oh im almost definitely going for a second viewing  such a lot of fun  loved all the easter eggsreferences to almost all of the previous movies solid review mate have to say as a massive fan of tlj i was disappointed by a lot of the storytelling aspects of this film but i did enjoy it in the moment my own review reflects my dismay at the seemingly offhanded way jj and co tried to tie up all the disparate plot points  the revelation of reys parentage while shocking wasnt given anywhere near enough time to bake into the audiences brain imo  within the films lengthy timeframe its also a shame at the obvious shade thrown at tlj in such a snarky manner the scene with force ghost luke and the lighsabre most obviously which left me with a sour taste in the mouth performances were generally good considering in my own review i write that the characters werent given dialogue so much as they were given exposition the difference between the two being that dialogue allows the characters to grow whilst exposition allows the characters to go the latter whilst important robs a lot of character beats from the story and results in a thinner less emotional film again imo and this is the crucial deficit the film has that said the visuals are spectacular the sound mix astonishing i think the subwoofers in the cinema i saw this in couldnt handle the lfe abrams threw at us they were bottoming out and the music again was among the highlights time will tell how the sequel trilogy holds up but for me rise of skywalker was a disappointment compared to the relatively evenhanded earlier two films those are completely fair criticisms i guess i didnt really have a problem with lukes scene mainly because he is in such a different place by the end of tlj than he was when he pitched the lightsaber i could see him saying the same thing at that point in the previous film its one reason i never had a problem with how tlj treated luke youre right there is a lot of exposition but i also felt it had several good emotional punches and one reason i like it better than tlj is because it doesnt have any pointless and befuddling sequences like the casino planet excursion my biggest gripe and you touch on it is that several details in this movie needed more time and attention youre 100 right about the palpatine revelation also the whole idea of leia being trained in the force by luke that seems like such a major bit of information yet we get a brief flashback image and a few words from luke and thats about it in their defense though i saw an interview where abrams said they had more planned but obviously with carrie fishers death they were much more limited than they intended to be great review as ever keith i appreciated your wider perspective of the film by trying to tie it to the perception of the last jedi and the almost impossible task that abrams had  i liked the film and would call it a good star wars film this is mostly down to reys arc and subsequent internal wrestle with her lineage it feels so in keeping with the franchise and its themes thanks so much im glad you enjoyed it too i know some people walked away disappointed but i had a lot of fun with it then again i view all of these movies as a whole some episodes are better than others but they all come together to form something i always have and always will love thats an excellent point its a big story thats split into different chapters and with that comes weak and strong entries etc endings are especially tricky and i would have liked to have seen the social media reactiongeneral consensus for return of the jedi and revenge of the sith  much like some of the reviews at the time i dont think the empire strikes back would be as enamoured if it were released during the era of social media  trying to digest everything that went down after seeing it  is like taking in too much pie and struggling to swallow it lol but i will say there was in my opinion much course correction going on from the last jedi  i was not a fan of that movie over all  although the performances were solid  johnson made choices that i really disliked and it was clear jj took to heart the anger of many fans  the first part was a bit muddled but once it got going  it was frenetic pace  they dealt decently with the death of fisher limiting what could have been in this movie  i felt there where tons of fan service but i was quite happy with that  the scene that featured han talking to ben solokylo ren had more impact and heart for me than it the scene in the force awakens plus it was great to see lando back and to see luke as a force ghost was great  still not sold on the emperor return and how that all went down but my i might need to see it again before i can rate it fairly  as it stands  my view still stands that this whole series of movies was unneeded but here we are  so without being too nit picky  a solid 75  definitely see it again youre right there is so much to follow and process during a first viewing you spend a lot of time just trying to keep up with plot points especially during the first act but my second viewing was really great mainly because i knew where the story was going so i could just focus on the details characters etc it opened the movie up even more to me i get what youre saying about palpatine but think of it this way from episode one all the way to this movie this really is a saga of too powerful families the skywalkers and the palpatines all three trilogies have this in common so i found it kind of cool that the final movie of the saga dealt with that story thread and brought it to a conclusion just a thought that is true and i thought that by rey being saved by a skywalker and her rejecting the name of her grandfather and adopting skywalker it brings a piece to the force just my observationbut im going again this weekend and i also agree the pace may slow down a bit so i will able to see the movie in a clearer light  the pace issue made a world of difference being able to sit back and take in the details paints things in a new light hoping to see it one more time before it leaves the big screen great review keith and im glad you enjoyed rise of skywalker  i liked it fine and was entertained but as the end of a trilogy and a saga it was a little weak  looking forward to the mandalorian when we get disney here in the uk at the end of march oh gosh i forget you guys are still waiting on mandalorian thats just terrible im sure there are things behind the scenes that i just dont understand but it stinks that there is such a huge gap between release dates yeah its seemingly all down to the various contractslicensing agreements disney has with different outlets worldwide which need to expire before disney can go live  looking forward to it
Aug 22 2022,neutral, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away the creators of the new star wars trilogy must be dedicated environmentalists because they keep recycling the same old material over and over and over im not sure if its my fond memories of my childhood rewatching the original star wars series that have me holding the jj abramshelmed incarnation to a higher standard the mastermind behind lost clearly has his heart in the right place you can agree even more so when you compare it to the great george lucas merchandise sixyear cash grabs at the turn of the century the passion for it is there the visual effects are more than impressive and there are a few mild moments of rare inspiration but thats usually reserved from the droids and anthony daniels gift of the gab and comic timing star wars the rise of the skywalker while an improvement over the last two cant hold a lightsaber to rogue one and has an emotional payoff thats akin to bill murray trying to recapture the magic in several scenes with andie mcdowell in groundhog day im starting to wonder if a long time ago in a galaxy far far away abrams and chris terrio the writers of the newest star wars trilogy must be dedicated environmentalists because they keep recycling the sameold material over and over and over every time when the gang goes off to find a piece of the puzzle right after they complete their task the bad guys show up to ruin their fun the same plotlines are recycled from previous chapters so there is hardly any suspense that built or had the script also especially with the modern film trilogy relies on cringeworthy dialogue remember when we used to get gems like why you stuckup halfwitted scruffylooking nerf herder now we get in particular when it comes to transitioning scenes a line that usually goes to something like wait and then repeat the exact same line like dejavu usually john boyegas finn is saddled with this task even the same tropes and macguffins are on autopilot and are used as standards here that would all be fine or at least condoned if the casting was right from the start the original big three of hamill ford and fisher had great chemistry as a unit or in a separate one on one encounter their conflict made things interesting here their current throuple interactions conflict or buddytime is forced and unnatural oscar isaac god love him for everything else he acts in is swinging and missing when it comes to being the comic swashbuckling relief that harrison ford perfected 40 years earlier boyegas finn has been relegated to screaming a characters name and staring at rey with puppydog eyes its a hoot to see some old characters return but more screen time would have been appreciated for new additions like keri russels zori bliss the special effects are topnotch and there is value in telling a story simply and competently even if repeated as it is entertainment product that has had consistent success and many love after all adam driver besides the natural head of black hair that looks like darth vadars helmet is a gifted actor and makes for an interesting villain as mentioned before anthony daniels is the main source of comic relief with his sharp timing and pitch perfect delivery star wars the rise of skywalker and this current trilogy for that matter belongs to daisy ridley its an incredibly hard role to fill and pull off emotionally and physically it may be and might not receive praise as the best performance in an actionadventure series in recent memory she is the heart and soul of this franchise and its the perfect fit for the decade that is finally recognizing strong smart confident female characters overall the force awakens the last jedi and the rise of the skywalker prove if anything you cant go home again yes they arent remakes these are new films but they are similar and feel like a repackaged holiday gift from the aunt who says she cant afford much but spends her winters in boca rotan if you enjoy the series i am glad you got your moneys worth though you should demand more for your dollar especially at todays prices and the amount of money spent on technical production this could have afforded a rewrite from a script doctor not that far far away marc miller also known as mn miller joined ready steady cut in april 2018 as a film and tv critic publishing over 1600 articles on the website since a young age marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous rotten tomato approved status  in 2023 he achieved that status

Feb 22 2022,negative, if rian johnson upset a segment of star wars fans by subverting expectations and taking the franchise in a new direction with the last jedi 2017 then jj abrams could be faulted for not following the new course with his sequel star wars episode ix  the rise of skywalker johnsons divisive film introduced alternative ideas and thematic deviations into the star wars mythology inventing sometimes oddball story elements leia using the force to pull herself through space that clashed with the first six episodes overseen by george lucaswhose integrity abrams jealously preserved in his entertaining 2015 reboot the force awakens some of the last jedis detractors felt that while change is welcome and needed for a franchise to endure johnsons film did not follow the episodic progression implied with star wars roots in saturday matinee serials the last jedi is a wellmade film often gorgeous and thrillingly acted but in the sequential order of things it sticks out like a sore thumb after johnsons film incited ridiculous protests and online petitions to have it stricken from the canon the disney overseers have attempted to coursecorrect with the rise of skywalker a cinematic apology to fans for tampering with their hallowed grounds  thats where star wars fandom stands today the discourse about films of this sort has degraded to such a degree that viewers now demand studios make their franchise movies in the manner they expect and feel entitled all else is jettisoned denied as a part of their selective reality when the theatrical version of justice league 2017 underwhelmed online communities demanded that warner bros release director zack snyders original cut when the last jedi challenged the rules of star wars fans clamored and asked that it be stricken from the record and remade and if the rise of skywalker is any indication disney listens to the most vocal protestors and endeavors to appease them after all the house of mouse desperately wants to gratify fans if only to ensure the billiondollar potential of each new star wars film given such pandering and the everdiscontent fanbase star wars has become for this critic a low exhausting state of affairs that discourages further enthusiasm about anything having to do with this franchise  star wars has been wildly inconsistent from the start plot holes and story inconsistencies run rampant throughout the original trilogy later lucas abortive prequel trilogy marred by early cgi characters that appear laughable by todays standards cheapened the franchise by demystifying the originals meanwhile disneys nowcomplete trilogy has a manic dramatic arc reflected by the wildly impulsive motivations of rey daisy ridley and kylo ren adam driver who teetertotter between the dark side and the light often within the same episode whereas the first two trilogies each have an overarching story that spans their three films disneys star wars output seems to be making it up as it goes along everything from the individual episodes and maligned spinoffs rogue one and solo feel like nothing more than disorganized fan fiction its a studio trying desperately to manage its audience rather than tell a story as a result the characters from the force awakens rarely feel like the same characters from the last jedi or the rise of skywalker  with that in mind abrams new episode which he cowrote alongside chris terrio who wrote justice league no less from a story with contributions by colin trevorrow and derek connolly tries to reset the franchises forward momentum to something resembling where he started with the force awakens abrams has already established himself as hollywoods defacto rebooter of franchises see his mission impossible iii and star trek and while his latest stops short of pretending the last jedi never happened it uses a considerable amount of energy on shifting the overarching story away from where johnson had pointed it instead he concentrates on satiating the audience with nostalgia and correcting the perceived mistakes of the past for instance abrams tidies up the plot holes that have existed since the empire strikes back 1980 where leia carrie fisher was propped up as another hope in place of luke but nothing ever happened with that in the rise of skywalker theres a brief flashback of luke mark hamill training his sister in the ways of the jedi which would explain why she has jedi abilities later in life  while abrams builds upon the integrity of johnsons film with flashbacks that explain why leia had the jedi mastery to pull herself through space hes less generous elsewhere on the question of lukes monklike solitude and aversion to the ancient jedi texts in johnsons film luke makes a stark admission here i was wrong indeed abrams undoes many of the most potent alterations in the last jedi such as moving the story away from johnsons rallying theme built around the average nobody abrams also rethinks the last films sudden shifts in character kylo ren who destroyed his darth vaderinspired helmet in johnsons film in an act of independence from his grandfathers example repairs the mask now making him look appropriately fractured after all as a result of the backandforth between abrams and johnsons films cracked identities are what drive disneys trilogy ever split between his draw to the dark side and his parents hero legacy kylo ren cant decide which path to take neither can rey who was led to believe her parents were nobodies in the last jedi however abrams changes that too revealing a twist that not only upends johnsons film but better justifies her impulse to reach into the darkest corners of her identity in this film she once again must confront her dark side personified by a hooded evil twin with a doubleedged lightsaber  when the rise of skywalker opens everyones looking for emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid whose presence has returned to the galaxy in the form of a frankensteinedtogether cyborg as it turns out palpatine has been controlling the voices in kylo rens head using the puppeteered snoke clones and astral projection or something to build the empires first order into the new final order for his hooded chanting sith army palpatine even promises kylo ren the galaxy if he kills the last remaining jedi rey in another part of the galaxy our heroesrey finn john boyega poe oscar isaac chewbacca joonas suotamo and a posse of droidsscramble to find palpatine on the hidden planet exegol but to do that they need a macguffin called a sith wayfinder abrams and terrio have structured most of their film around gathering one macguffin that leads to another macguffin and so on propelling our heroes from one planet to the next in search of a plot device much like the superfluousness of the last jedis casino planet interlude theres a subplot or two that feel unnecessary giving the film an excuse to check fan service boxes all the while rose kelly marie tran so important in johnsons film to establish its themes that anyone can be a hero has been reduced to a minor supporting role  the extraneous plotting pushes the runtime over 140 minutes which gives the filmmakers ample time to engage the viewers sense of nostalgia and bring finality to the nineepisode saga abrams has exhumed beloved characters and images from earlier films to accomplish this farewellofamovie which attempts to close the skywalker saga that began with the phantom menace 1999technically a new hope 1977 besides the resurrected palpatine luke skywalker and han solo harrison ford make appearances as a ghost and a projected memory respectively in a different sort of resurrection the late carrie fisher who died in 2016 before the last jedi hit theaters appears as a cgi character constructed of outtakes from johnson and abrams previous episodesdemonstrating that disney no longer needs actors to create convincing performances admittedly the effect looks better than the young fisher in rogue one both chewbacca and c3po meet their demise in the rise of skywalker and each of them experiences a type of rebirth a few scenes later billy dee williams appears once more as lando calrissian looking relaxed in a role he last played a quartercentury ago the film even dredges up the death star the resurrection motif becomes tiresome if only because it spends more time reflecting on the past than advancing the story but then thats just what abrams does  even as major characters show up for their obligatory goodbye to the fanbase the few innovations in the film remain uninspired confusing and downright silly the rise of skywalker introduces the idea that reys powerful grasp of the force allows her to miraculously heal injuries a skill she masters on the first try despite her abilities proving unwieldy in another scene that leads to an accidental shuttle explosion also running with an idea from the last jedi that kylo ren and rey converse using forcebased telepathy abrams mounts psychic lightsaber duels where the boundaries of each duellists location begin to overlap with the other he takes this idea even further when psychic projections become tangible objects leading to a type of lightsaber teleportation in one scene the bond between these two characters also has some curious implications about the sheer power they share when together but im not sure i understand it perhaps because like most everything else in this film its breezed overincluding a lastminute romantic turn at last in the final duel between palpatine and rey they fight as all the sith versus all the jedi in a ridiculous battle of energy beams that settles the matter once and for all for now  this is a deliriously paced film that barely leaves a moment for the viewer to process whats happening that comes later if his other work is any indication abrams is a propulsive director of action driven by faces chases and places his films rush from one disaster to the next during which the viewer cannot breathe much less absorb every plot detail in the first scenes the millenium falcon zips through an ice shaft pursued by enemy fighters while the characters spout expositional dialogue amid the occasional that was a close one its difficult to say whats happening or why but boy is it exciting editors maryann brandon and stefan grube maintain the films breakneck pacing yet they hardly leave time for us to access the emotional center of these characters and their many motivational shifts later kylo ren and reys lightsaber duel on the death stars halfsubmerged ruins an image of grandiosity to be sure goes on and on ad nauseam but theres no consequence to the scene apart from neatlooking action abrams has directed the rise of skywalker into memeworthy moments that have no greater consequence but they can be easily shared on social media to facilitate cultural saturation  capably made but misguided in its attempts to satiate its fanbase the rise of skywalker marks some kind of end to the franchise its a film that tries to please everyone and in doing so crams so much into its harried story that it seldom feels inspired the sheer number of reference points callbacks phantoms and delusions in this film leaves too much to disentangle with any logical acceptance but nostalgia isnt about logic its about emotions and the feelings of preciousness about the original trilogy have sustained millions of moviegoers through more bad episodes than good in my estimation taking a step back and looking at this new trilogy disneys star wars episodes have proven quite erratic robbing the material of its serial appeal when so much about kylo ren and rey proves almost bipolar its difficult to invest oneself in their fates as heroes or villains much like its immediate predecessor the last jedi the viewers lizard brain leaves the theater thoroughly entertained maybe thats enough to justify a bucket of popcorn and some escapist viewership but not much more 
Feb 21 2022,negative, these are dark times for the disney empire the unified celebration that greeted its first two star wars entries the force awakens and rogue one descended into rebellion with the release of the last jedi one of the most divisive films in recent memory then came solo the first star wars movie to lose money  with future plans in flux this is the last big screen adventure for the moment with the franchise finding success in tv with the mandalorian following the departure of original director colin trevorrow jj abrams has returned to close out the journey he started with the force awakens  one criticism of his previous film was that it leaned too heavily on nostalgia if thats a problem for you then the rise of skywalker is going to be a bumpy ride every possible reference and easter egg you can think of is jammed into this carnival of fan service but once the sugar rush of sentiment fades it becomes clear these baubles are a distraction from a plot with no life  we catch up with rey daisy ridley still fighting against both the first order and the dark visions of her own future on the other side is kylo ren adam driver racked with guilt at the deeds of his past and unsure what to make of his connection with rey  but once the sugar rush of sentiment fades it becomes clear these baubles are a distraction from a plot with no life we catch up with rey daisy ridley still fighting against both the first order and the dark visions of her own future on the other side is kylo ren adam driver racked with guilt at the deeds of his past and unsure what to make of his connection with rey  the trouble is were not too sure what to make of it either this is a conclusion for characters who havent been given time to breathe the results of varying artistic and commercial visions that feel incomplete without the requisite development we get supposedly climactic confrontations that are important only because the script says they are most of the contentious aspects of the last jedi are reworked or forgotten quickly with certain twists feeling like a direct response to fan outrage whether these changes are right or wrong is subjective but they come too late in the game to be implemented naturally in short the ending feels empty when were asked to forget about the middle  this isnt to say its a disaster the visual spectacle is awesome from nightmarish caves to roiling oceans it feels like a galaxy far far away and one youd quite like to visit theres also plenty of fun moments as we accompany finn john boyega poe oscar isaac and various others as they race between planets interacting with cute new sidekicks vying for baby yodas crown  there are thrilling fights funny jokes and aside from the often excruciating dialogue never really a strong point in the star wars universe its a fine experience  and thats the problem star wars has never been just fine whether you left the cinema punching the air or seething with rage every one of these stories made you feel something  even the worst entries had moments that took your breath away for all the visual effects all the speeches its hard to think of a moment in this film that anyone will be referencing in 20 years trying to please everyone has resulted in a film thats apparently happy to be average all of a sudden star wars doesnt feel special anymore  most cheated by all the indecision are the younger cast members who do their best with characters who have been pulled in different directions over the course of three films isaacs poe fares best out of them all showing some progression as he struggles to become the leader he knows he has to be  he forms a charming partnership with boyegas finn with the friends working to build an army to launch one last offensive against the first order ridley is given the most screen time which is a good thing given the seismic shifts in character she has to perform she navigates these sharp turns well steering rey towards a plausible  if unsatisfying  conclusion adam driver may be the actor whose stock has most risen since the films began but a role this slight would leave even the most talented stars stranded benkylos conflicted stance means hes lost in the shuffle hes not the hero of the story but nor is he the villain his arc has potential but with the focus elsewhere he often feels like a character from an entirely different film hes someone for ridley to spar with to run to and from aside from one waterside hearttoheart his journey is mainly to service his costar of all the underdeveloped characters in this trilogy hes the most wasted as for the old guard lando calrissian billy dee williams returns for little reason other than hes the last original character who hadnt already reappeared like the film in microcosm his appearance is fun but pointless its also time to say goodbye to the late carrie fisher of course with the production workingin previously cut footage to round out her performance it isnt seamless but its at least respectful the rise of skywalker is a film designed to calm the waters but is that what star wars really needed its true that the last jedi took some narrative risks that didnt pay off but a follow up that plays it safe from beginning to end hardly seems preferable what should feel like an epic conclusion to a 42yearold story instead acts as proof that the franchise that has lost its way
Feb 18 2022,positive, fortytwo years ago we were first taken to a galaxy far far away and film as we know it changed forever star wars not only produced a groundbreaking new way of filmmaking but created a fan base that is as divisive as it possibly could be its one of the most passionate fan bases i know while quite vocal over the past four years during the releases of the force awakens and 2017s controversial the last jedi there is no denying that fans across the galaxy were ready for the conclusion of the skywalker saga with the release of star wars the rise of skywalker without question this film is the most flawed out of the disney trilogy a film while full of fan service tidbits and nostalgia has a difficult time distancing itself from that crutch to establish itself fully throughout its early run time  i believe that star wars the last jedi is a real original look at what star wars the rise of skywalker could have been with unique storytelling  rather than focus solely on the skywalker name the last jedi establishes that you dont need skywalker blood to become a jedi as the prequels and former star wars stories showed us with characters such as mace windu quigon and of course obiwan many fans rejected that concept and that coincides with rise of skywalkers most significant issue  it spends the first 45 minutes of the film cleaning up the choices made in the previous movie rather than pushing forward the last films different perspective  when the exposition in the beginning finally finishes this is where rise of skywalker really picks up steam jj abrams never fails to deliver a polished entertaining film that includes all the elements of star wars that have brought fans together over the past four decades the film is a relentless thrill ride with some of the best set pieces in the entire disney trilogy while the lesser of the three films rise of skywalker comes the closest in matching the original trilogy in terms of humor heart and showcasing a team dynamic that was missing from the force awakens and the last jedi  now there are questions i can answer without spoiling carrie fisher is used beautifully throughout the film and quite frankly a more significant focal point to the central story than i originally expected it is well known that episode ix was set to be leias story and jj does a great job of incorporating and elevating leia and carries importance to not only the franchise but for a legion of star wars fans leia will forever be my princess lets discuss emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid has not lost a step his return to the throne does not fail as he is as menacing and fearinducing as before however a huge flaw was the explanation or lack thereof on how he was able to return was he always set to be the big bad of this trilogy or was this course correction after the last jedi well never know but we can enjoy his time onscreen  daisy ridley and adam driver are the mvps of rise of skywalker both give their all in their final performances as rey and ben solo from the moment i laid eyes on rey in the force awakens ive felt that she was the perfect heroine to lead this new trilogy and she does not disappoint and reys story pleasingly comes full circle while there are lesser fans of ben with criticism ranging from he should be working at hot topic with his temper tantrums to hes just always whining ive personally been a fan of his story and especially now with its conclusion in this film my counter to those previous criticisms has always been hes a skywalker would you expect nothing less bens obsession with becoming his grandfather was his motivation and once he became supreme leader as seen in this film his attitude changes he becomes more assertive and in control adding more depth to his character unlike seen before his story was one of the best endings ive seen in the franchise  as always the supporting players add a ton to the film finn while ive never been a fan of feels essential to the central story here especially in the battle against the first order poe channels his inner han solo and finn and poes buddy chemistry is admirable the return of lando was a sweet treat for fans and while not a massive player to the films overall narrative his appearance is welcomed along with chewie and all our favorite droids they all shine bright in this film  in his final work in the star wars franchise john williams delivers a pleasing and impactful score a score that with each beat calls back to every film in the franchise and molds them into one of his best works throughout the entire saga star wars is and will continue to be more than just a film franchise to me there are decades of memories good times and bad times that this space soap opera have been a part of and i wouldnt have it any other way as the saga comes to an end rise of skywalker while flawed in some areas has successfully ended the story of the skywalker family in a gratifying fashion 
Feb 12 2022,positive, there has never been a review that has caused more nerves while preparing to write it than this one star wars the rise of skywalker not only concludes the new trilogy of star wars films but wraps up a saga started over 40 years ago there is no doubting that star wars has become a foundation in our pop culture that will live on forever especially after the last jedi though where director rian johnson pushed the series into a totally different style star wars also has become one of the most decisive franchises out there with those  shall we say  differing opinions with each new installment already days before the official release of the rise of skywalker these sides have been at war with each other without even seeing the movie different opinions are fine despite what twitter seems to make everyone think as cinema speaks to us in different ways there is not a single other movie that comes to mind with the scale and controversy from its fanbase than the rise of skywalker it is impossible to look at this film outside of the context of which it was built as mentioned before 2017s the last jedi pushed star wars into unknown territory sticking out against every other piece of media in the franchise for better or for worse almost becoming a meditation on good vs evil and the muddy area between the movie polarized audiences with kylo ren adam driver growing stronger than ever and rey daisy ridley pushing her training as much as she can the conflict between jedi and sith finally reaches a climax in a battle for the universe at the beginning of the rise of skywalker it is clear that the people behind the scenes reacted to the direction rian johnson had taken the franchise almost immediately the film retcons so much that the last jedi spent its entire runtime trying to build from mysteries surrounding our main characters to kylo ren being a neutral force trying to destroy both the good and bad the rise of skywalker starts by destroying a good amount of what was already built in order to set its own story up at first this appears legitimately infuriating specifically with stripping down the character of kylo ren a character i found extremely interesting in the last jedi of his nuance as a villain and reducing him back down to just being a bad guy on the side of the sith rian johnson had set the rise of skywalker up to be different and something incredibly unique compared to the rest of the franchise initially it seemed that jj abrams was just trying to play it safe that perhaps did nothing new from the other films this was also heavily felt at the beginning of the film with the character of rey they set her character up as a jedi dealing with her anger pulling her towards the darkside this is a character arc we have seen multiple times in this franchise up to this point and made the character just seem mundane at first this is clearly where most are stopping with their opinions of the film condemning the rest as bland garbage from this point of destruction on though what the rise of skywalker builds from its initial destruction was not only just pure enjoyment but was deep and intriguing pushing the story and the world in its own subtle and unique ways it is hard to talk about the morals and messages this film is trying to explore without getting into spoilers this is a huge film that explores themes of purpose and destiny in ways that have never really been seen before in the franchise the battle between the jedi and the sith has always been one that never quite seemed to connect with me in the way that it has for others the moral idea that one side is objectively good and one side is objectively bad never gained much traction from me but the idea that you are born on a side and even if you are born on the wrong side you eventually find your way to the other never quite worked for me my favorite part of the last jedi was its exploration of this good vs evil in the form of kylo ren and where nothing in this film quite reaches that point of intrigue it does continue to push this idea in a way that was thoroughly engaging the moral takeaway from the rise of skywalker and its exploration of this is also possibly the most relevant moral a star wars movie has ever had this movie has important ideas and lessons that need to be taught and this movie accomplishes that this is not just a fun scifi movie it is smart and has something important to say the way the rise of skywalker also explores the past and its effect on the current and future also ties this new trilogy nicely together on a thematic level from kylo ren first drawing inspiration from the past eventually wanting to kill it to rey still being haunted by her past having been abandoned by her parents this movie reaches a conclusion with this idea its been exploring since the force awakens that feels satisfying and gives it an even bigger reason to exist providing something that none of the other six main movies could a look at the consequences from the past shown in those films and how that helps and hurts characters throughout these films this is a level of perspective series rarely gets to have following a journey through three generations with that said though the film absolutely is tons of fun featuring some of the best comedy from the entire franchise i have not laughed so hard at c3po anthony daniels as he nearly steals the show poe dameron oscar isaac also really shines here after having missed most of the force awakens and being brought down by easily the most painful part of the last jedi poe finally is able to take more of a lead role showing off not just oscar issacs extreme charisma but also his emotional ability as an actor if he was given the right plot in these films poe really could have been the new han solo sadly up until this film he was not given the opportunity to become much more than a fun side character if you have seen the other star wars movies and at least have enjoyed some of them or simply grew up with them this movie will at least also work with you on a basic level there is something chilling about hearing the swell of music at the beginning of the films as the logo appears and the opening crawl starts to reveal itself one huge complaint that keeps floating around is the fan service in the rise of skywalker many have called this lazy but i have to disagree not only do these callbacks help bring this movie full circle but there is something very effective about seeing these classic characters back on screen neither do these moments of fan service become so significant to the plot that it feels like it takes away from story values the action in this film is also breathtaking in the opening introduction to the film there is a spectacular chase scene  legitimately one of my favorites now of the star wars series every piece of action is pulsating and thrilling not only because of the incredible visual effects but also the fine cinematography from dan mindel unique and impressive throughout the handheld approach to some of these tracking shots in the action also give this movie a dynamic edge the weight of the conflict in this film also added something to the story  particularly on an emotional level perhaps more than ever this is a fight for the universe there is no option for the jedi to lose and live to fight another day adding a sense of desperation that put the gravitas on every decision our heroes made on another positive judging by certain elements the trailers teased i was nervous about some of the twists and turns potentially in store however the narrative of this saga and the practicality of the film each reveal works beyond what may or may not be false alarms no spoilers here therell be on the flip side the story itself seems to try and juggle a lot the film sets up three clear stories to follow and as it attempts to reset itself to a point from the last jedi  while carrying some baggage from it  the rise of skywalker is somewhat jumbled in places some plot points were fabricated to follow proceedings like randomly finding important information in unlikely places although not completely meaningless compared to the other star wars movies  like the jabba the hunt fight from return of the jedi for example  the fillers in this movie felt smaller and did build to service its narrative and moral messages with the rise of skywalkers inclusion of general leia carrie fisher utilizing archival footage of her is smartly used quite sparingly even if the placement was a little off you could tell she wasnt really in the conversations it made for a compelling respect to both the character and late actor somehow despite being traditionally on the more critical side of star wars judging by early social media reactions the rise of skywalker is way higher on my star wars ranked list than most structurally this movie is one of the soundest in this entire franchise especially once you get past the rocky start the rise of skywalker might play it safer than its predecessor the last jedi but it so effective in its messages that it connects and provides a more a very satisfying conclusion not just to this trilogy but the skywalker saga overall the rise of skywalker gives you chills is an absolute blast overall and i personally am already planning my next trip through the galaxy with it
Oct 20 2021,positive, well its finally over after 42 years the skywalker saga has allegedly ended with the rise of skywalker and i am sad yet totally here for it you dont need me to tell you how culturally significant the star wars franchise has been i have been a diehard fangirl since i first saw princess leias iconic buns and blaster hans handsome smirk and lukes luminescent lightsaber with such history i can only imagine the difficulty in deciding how to say goodbye to this beloved series and its old and new characters but director jj abrams who directed my favorite star wars film the force awakens nailed it  of course youre never going to make everyone happy and as you may or may not have seen the film has become very divisive with fans i will admit that there are a few things i wish abrams had done differently mainly when it came to honoring the characters of rose and finn however i genuinely find it hard to imagine calling this movie bad or considering it a disappointment  so with all of the ridiculous hostility surrounding the rise of skywalker i wanted to focus on the several things i loved most about the film hopefully instead of focusing on the negativity you will buy a ticket and make your own decision will this be your favorite film in the franchise probably not the force awakens and empire strikes back exist but embrace your inner fanboyfangirl and have fun how can you not its star wars you scruffylooking nerfherder  the stakes because han fing solo was killed in the force awakens and luke skywalker supreme leader snoke and admiral holdo laura dern died in the last jedi i was constantly concerned that another big character was going to go kaput in this film especially with it being the last in the franchise and thats how an action movie should be i wont tell you if anyone does die but the fact that star wars has shown it is possible really added to the suspense of each fight  the music do i even need to mention this john williams score continues to not only be a main highlight for each film but also a main character itself rise of skywalker is no exception how he is able to build and release tension through his score in each scene is unmatched in cinema i love how each character has his or her own theme unsurprisingly leias theme really got to me especially when we see carrie fisher on screen as leia for the last time  and dont get me started on keri russell who stars as an awesome new masked character named zorii bliss although zorii may only show her eyes russell gives an incredibly expressive performance rocks a sleek costume and her chemistry with poe dameron oscar isaac is whitehot i am going to need a spinoff movie or tv show asap  the cute new characters i would die for bb8 and leave it to star wars to introduce us to a couple more new characters this time around  no unfortunately one of those is not baby yoda babu frik is too cute for me to handle even if his particular set of skills may be detrimental to a fan favorite character look at his little welding mask my heart and this sounds a bit weird to say but i love the friendship between the new pixar lamplooking droid called do and bb8 almost as much as i loved hearing the droid tell rey no thank you when she attempts to touch him similar to what i want to say to all of the rise of skywalker haters 
Sep 15 2021,positive,i had a great time i loved it
Sep 8 2021,positive, star wars the rise of skywalker the final entry in the series ninefilm skywalker story is the cinematic equivalent of anakin and obiwan landing that gigantic ship at the end of revenge of the siths opening space battle its not exactly clean or elegant and the entire ship is on fire with bells and whistles going off when it lands but its a thrill to watch and its all smiles and relieved laughter once everyone is back on solid ground  despite some bumps director jj abrams  co bring the saga home in one piece its a whimsical aggressively engaging positively exhausting movie that all at once might fry your brain and make you fall in love again with one of our defining cultural touchstones  early buzz after the films la premiere was that some found its reported galaxybrain plotting and nostalgic pandering wearying indeed abrams leans into all of his vices with his return to the series  trapdoor twists dorky macguffin quests imprecise dialogue  as well as his virtues including strong characters good casting and highenergy chase scenes these movies are about kooky melodramatic space adventures that lean on the wholesome values of friendship and hope  thats exactly what the rise of skywalker hangs its cloak on and why it works so well though with the previous star wars saga installment the last jedi rian johnson made a film that loved its universe and characters the director caught flack for challenging the series to look past its patented palace intrigue and familial melodrama into galaxies of new possibility abrams seems to have allowed some of that to rub off though he certainly also comes to this armed with all the force awakens loose plot threads bad robot mysterybox surprises and fan service  abrams is a devotee of the establishment not a disruptor like johnson but he also seems to have a distinct bone to pick with the boneheads who rallied against the last jedi for malevolent reasons abrams indeed has the final word here but he offers a loving advancement to johnsons noble call to expand the galaxys heroes to include more than just those holding a lightsaber abrams is more interested in the people and places we already know but he fits in what he wants from johnsons film more generously than you might expect the unification is not perfect but it feels right  maybe youll disagree some will likely find the rise of skywalker a garish nostalgia run with silly developments after all this is star wars postfilm discussion and debate are as much a part of the films as the stories themselves the rise of skywalker differs from the last jedi in some ways but both glow with a love and admiration for the message of the original trilogy all thats left at the end is a landed ship and a reminder of how powerful these movies can be to the ones who they matter to the most 
Aug 19 2021,negative, a disjointed rushed and incohesive mess of fan service and b genre plotting kennedy should have the reins taken away from her now that this body is bagged and tagged lucas not finishing his saga as a holistic storyteller was already deeply disappointing to me and this just rubs salt in the wound  boyega ridley and isaac are bad in this film i genuinely like each person and at least one of their performances in another film the action choreography is perhaps the worst ive seen on a project at this scale and budget however there were certainly some positives keri russells world and character were neat i dug babu frik that opening sequence with driver getting all murdery and finally engaging with some of the vast body of sith lore all in all im disappointed and wonder what the hell specifically lead to this fan service centric trilogy that has nothing new or interesting to say at least to me
Aug 12 2021,positive, it may not have been in a galaxy far far away but it does feel like a long time ago that the star wars saga began with george lucass 1977 space opera star wars iv a new hope now the whole story comes full circle with star wars ix the rise of skywalker im hoping however that the phenomenon that is star wars is not coming to an end like rogue one a star wars story showed there are other tales to tell about the rebellions fight to overcome evil in the galaxy and this particular star wars fan will be on hand to see them whenever they come around the final installment in the star wars saga the rise of skywalker is a fitting end to more than four decades of storytelling it has everything fans love jj abrams is back behind the helm as director and cowriter after rian johnsons muchdebated episode viii the last jedi filled with epic battle sequences old friends new friends and old enemies the rise of skywalker doesnt meet the memorability of the empire strikes back but it does leave the audience with hope and a rather shocking answer to a burning question left over from episodes vii and viii namely what are reys daisy ridley origins hopefully the answer will surprise you as it did me after the nowfamiliar but oh so exciting opening scroll we find the rebels always outnumbered and short on time gathering resources to challenge the first order and new supreme leader kylo ren adam driver poe oscar isaac chewie joonas suotamo c3po anthony daniels and exstormtrooper finn john boyega are out seeking information and allies to join in the fight back at base rey hones her jedi skills under the watchful eye of general leia organa the late carrie fisher from archival footage but theres still something unsettled about rey that ridleys performance manages to convey to the audience so much so that we can feel her ambiguity and ache with her as she struggles to discover who she is and what her ultimate purpose will be her forceenhanced connection with kylo ren only confuses matters more for her his invitation to join him leads her to set aside her training much like luke did in the empire strikes back rey seems to know that within kylo ren still lives ben solo son of han harrison ford and leia and she wants to bring him back to the light especially for leias sake and speaking of leia the way shes woven into the story after carrie fishers death in 2016 using archival footage from the force awakens is seamless and doesnt feel contrived like the digital inclusion of her younger self in earlier films kudos go to abrams and cowriter chris terrio for making fishers beloved leia an integral part of this last star wars film there have always been spiritual undertones in all the star wars films and rise of skywalker is no different while the idea of the force being an energy that connects all living things still smacks of new age thought we christians know that its really god who is the allpowerful force in the universe and all created reality very strong in this film is the reality of selfsacrifice and redemption strong also is the hope that comes from knowing were not alone so relevant in our society today i dont know about you but there have been times in my life when i felt like i was the only one experiencing some sort of suffering or uncertainty fear or pain often does that to us whatever is going on in our lives we can convince ourselves that no one else could possibly understand what were going through loneliness and isolation follow in her training we hear rey petitioning be with me being the last of the jedi it is natural that rey would have felt alone and thought that no one could understand her suffering so she prays be with me she pulls on the strength of the jedi before her especially luke even in her darkest hour she knows that shes not alone in her struggle knowing that we also are not alone can be lifesaving no matter how alone we may feel god is always with us we are still in the midst of the christmas season a time when we celebrate jesus the second person of the trinity coming to us as a vulnerable child to show us how much god wants to be with us god never leaves us alone its not clear to whom rey addresses her be with me but for us we address that prayer to god who responds to us i am with you always matthew 2820 in this assurance lies our hope sister

Jun 26 2021,positive,abrams knows when and how to play the nostalgia card without getting intoxicated with it allowing us to say goodbye to the heroes of the original saga but without removing the focus from the real protagonists of this story full review in spanish
Feb 17 2021,positive,  for more than 40 years the specter of star wars has hung over the movie landscape like no other franchise it has influenced countless filmmakers showing up in big and small ways in multiple other works of art now characters new and old are getting one last chance to add to the series legacy with star wars the rise of skywalker  without getting into spoiler specifics the resistance  led by rey daisy ridley finn john boyega poe oscar isaac chewbacca joonas suatamo and general leia organa carrie fisher  are still facing the threat of the first order led by supreme leader kylo ren adam driver but a new danger has emerged one that divides the focus of the resistance and may also usurp the power of the first order  the previous film the last jedi was a divisive effort because of new elements that writerdirector rian johnson introduced to the series jj abrams who directed and cowrote the force awakens is back for episode xi and he brings with him both the familiar and unfamiliar  there are plenty of recognizable settings and characters from previous movies to trigger nostalgia but enough is different so as to not seem simply like a retread of things that have been done before he also introduces some heretofore unseen elements that may have some purists crying foul  that said a lot of retconning is done to make sure plot points that were introduced in the previous two films fall into place some of them feel organic to an everevolving plot but there are more than a few that come off as shoehorned in putting a round peg in a square hole just to provide some sort of answer  unfortunately one of the biggest of these is the presence of leia in the film abrams and his team used footage from fishers work on the force awakens to make her a part of the plot and a series of perfunctory lines fail to do justice for either the character or the actor who died in 2016 because of leias relationships with other characters emotions do come but they dont feel fully earned  the connection between rey and kylo ren was the overarching part of the first two films and that bond comes to a head in the rise of skywalker abrams and johnson have tried to make this relationship on par with that of luke skywalker and darth vader but its never had that depth of feeling still they do engage in some epic battles and the way their story is wrapped up is fully satisfying  poe and finn are crucial to the plot of the film but neither feels as important as rey they spend most of their time ensconced with the rest of the resistance and their efforts are more part of the team than as individuals they do get some fun and exciting moments but nothing that makes them truly stand out  part of the reason for this is because the new characters in this trilogy have never been able to move out of the shadow of the characters from the first trilogy the old characters are revered or reviled by the new characters for good reason but the attention paid to them has prevented these new films from ever being able to establish their own identity star wars the rise of skywalker is a finale that is both enthralling and frustrating feelings that could change in either direction on repeat viewings one can only hope that now that the skywalker saga is finished future star wars films can explore whatever direction they please without being as beholden

Feb 16 2021,negative, if you were looking for the perfect film to put a capstone on the 2010s star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker arguably would be it even with the blockbuster heavyweight of avengers endgame concluding the first ten years of the marvel cinematic universe trosas well call it for easewas the most anticipated cinematic event of the year given it doesnt just serve as the third part of a trilogy but also the concluding chapter of a ninepart four decade spanning saga within easily the biggest film franchise in movie history this is about as epic as franchise filmmaking gets though star wars the jewel in disneys alldominating media crown will of course continue into the 2020s this marks the end of the skywalker saga with which george lucas changed the landscape of moviemaking more than perhaps any director in the 20th century the final conclusion to a story we thought had definitively ended twice before going into the rise of skywalker you may experience cautious optimism rian johnson delivered a defiantly auteurdriven insular examination of the core mystical and philosophical themes within star wars with 2017s trilogy middlepart the last jedi going in brave new directions from 2015s vibrant trilogy opener the force awakens in which jj abrams revived the franchise with a verve that spoke to lucas original saturday adventure serial vision with abrams back at the helm following the departure of original director colin trevorrow there was every reason to believe tros would recapture tfas spirit and top off star wars with a fulsome flourish you may leave the rise of skywalker somewhat perplexed that that didnt happen that in fact abrams has delivered the weakest star wars film since quite possibly fetid prequel attack of the clones for a myriad amount of reasons the rise of skywalker feels like an argument on screen for why going into the next decade we need to rethink how we approach franchise filmmaking it doesnt just feel like a culmination of indulgent cinematic excess but a cautionary bulwark against it when it was announced in 2012 that disney had purchased lucasfilm and a new star wars trilogy was being developed a million voices cried out not in terror but rather jubilation even after the underwhelming prequels the idea we would see luke skywalker princess leia han solo and the classic trilogy characters again was thrilling but it tapped into a powerful emotion that has come to define mainstream entertainment this last decade nostalgia nostalgia has always been present in popular culture you would never have had 1999s the phantom menace and all of the revived star wars content after it if not for a yearning to return to the comfort of a universe that defined millions of childhoods in the 1970s and 1980s the period directors like abrams and writers such as chris terriodrafted it to cowrite tros after trevorrows firing and the junking of much of his scriptwere growing up a period in which creators such as lucas or steven spielberg brought escapist entertainment back to the masses as super producers who launched entire empires from on screen to merchandising to games to you name it properties like star wars became cottage industries about more than just the films themselves and they swept up children and young adults into the worlds these creatives conjured its why generation x in particular are largely defined by popculture references in the way baby boomers often arent its also why they keenly feel the pull of nostalgia in their storytelling in everything from cinematic franchises such as star trek or james bond tapping into their iconic 1960s roots or popular properties being reborn or sequelizedghostbusters doctor sleepthrough to classic tv shows being revived with the same legendary characters and actorsthe xfiles the upcoming star trek picardthrough to contemporary masterpieces such as recently watchmen telling vibrant new stories which revolve around legacy and the past defining us the 2010s has seen audiences look in the rear view mirror for comforting reassuring fodder perhaps as a response to the chaotic events in politics and social change that have rippled across the globe particularly in the last half of the decade audiences have clung to familiarity and narrative safety heroes have seen a powerful rebirth in our consciousness hence why the mcu has become so prosperous or the arrowverse on television we have looked to what we know and we have welcomed stories which reinforce our primal existential hope someone will be there to save us star wars from its inception has always been a fairy tale lucas built what would become episode iv a new hope on mythical fable tropes transposing them to the sciencefiction genre as he sought to create his own version of the flash gordon serials from the 1930s it was always a story of pure good vs pure evil hence the constructs of the jedi and the sith or the force as an intangible construct that could be bent toward either paradigm lucas original trilogy was designed as a classic heroes journey as defined by the groundbreaking work of cultural anthropologist joseph campbell who in his book the hero with a thousand faces pulled together mythic constructs from dozens of historical cultures which shared common archetypes that boiled down to this the journey of the hero sees them travel from safety into the unknown on a quest in which they lay their past ghosts to rest with the help of a wizened mentor defeat the obstacle in their way and recover a treasure they then take back to their original home in the process they are changed and renewed a journey without is really the journey within if you look at a significant amount of modern pop culture fiction and the majority of the stories we are most invested in culturally they often cleave to heroes journeys this is something ive built my upcoming book mythbuilding in modern media around  this idea of the monomytharc that contemporary fictional mythologies in popular culture utilise many of these campbellian structures to define their characters and worlds it happens in avengers endgame you can see it in game of thrones which infamously ended this year its present in star wars from the very beginning and lukes entire story in the original trilogy tracks this mythological arc  luke ventures out from tatooine a naive young farmhand undertakes a quest to understand his true self with the help of a mentor yoda faces the duality of his lineage pulling him between good and evil after learning darth vader is actually his father and then refuses to allow emperor palpatine to corrupt him enabling vaders own redemption as a consequence  which too fulfills a similar journey anakin skywalker takes in the prequels only his being the inverse turning away from good to evil this duality this eventual understanding of ones true self is key to how star wars is approached in every one of its eight episodic films and the message is always this good will triumph evil will be vanquished the force for good will be with you always the rise of skywalker is no exception there are no surprises there are no diversions there is the nostalgic fulcrum of a narrative structure you as an audience expect of this film thats also a key point here expectation we have become hardwired to expect that triumph even when we dont see it reflected in our own lived experience  if this were reality given the emergence of fascist demagogues such as donald trump or jair bolsonaro etc or the normalisation of rightwing tropes that are encouraging intolerance and violence across the globe kylo ren would undoubtedly have been the one to rise in this story he and palpatine would have killed rey and simply dominated the universe with their final order something they probably could have done with relative ease at multiple points in this trilogy yet as audiences we expect the jedi and their quasibuddhist philosophy of quiet strength and tolerance to prosper much like after avengers infinity war when thanos actually did manage to wipe out half of the universe and half of our heroes the question for endgame was never will they defeat him it was always how will they defeat him and how will those lost heroes return everyone knew they would it was satisfying to see occur but it was a given thanos may boast he is inevitable but the only inevitability about endgame was in how it ended we wouldnt have expected anything less it is quite remarkable just how similar the last act of tros is to the final act of endgame actually having spent the majority of the running time pillaging from half a dozen different famous and beloved pieces of popular culture it is at various points indiana jones and the rise of skywalker or harry potter and the sith wayfinder the ending however is particularly in step with endgames expected denouement of bringing all of our heroes as close to destruction as possible in the face of impossible universeshattering odds only to have a gandalf in the return of the king or littlefinger in battle of the bastardsstyle last minute turn of the tide which allows rey and company to succeed endgame without question did it better having thoroughly laid the groundwork for the breathtaking moment of spectacle in which the entire mcu shows up to take down thanos there is nothing like that in tros even with your expectation that it will happen the last act is built on an evercollapsing house of cards in which the rules of the entire story are rewritten on the spot to up the stakes again and again and again it is among many things in tros that doesnt make a lick of sense its hard for me to admit as an admittedly huge fan of jj abrams work for almost 20 years that this was the first time i walked out of one of his projects knowing in my heart of hearts that it just wasnt very good star trek into darkness depreciates the more you watch it but even that i emerged from initially delighted perhaps because im a trekkie as opposed to being more of a casual wars fan emerging from tros felt a little like coming out of the other side of a chaotic head rush a confluence of elements which should have made sense but didnt abrams puts together a film which whether intentionally or not seems willfully determined to run with abandon in the opposite direction to the last jedi in almost every way the frenetic opening scenes quickly throw back in palpatine with zero context quickly explain snoke quickly establish the tropes that abrams relies heavily on in his construction of star wars narrativestreasures and quest itemsand foregrounds the questions that rian johnson intended for audiences to do away with entirely who is rey why is she special and what does this mean for the end of the saga this too was an inevitability one of the key negative reactions from the entitled fanboy base of star wars following the last jedi was that johnsons suggestion that rey was nobodydespite tfa foreshadowing the contraryand everyone had the potential to become a jedi or indeed a sky walker was just virtue signalling liberal bs the noisiest fan base did not want to accept that rey would not conventionally have a destiny and its clearly something abrams believed too abrams and terrio are fanboys lets not forget in something of a different manner to johnson the latter was keen to try and transform star wars to push and challenge at the tropes and perceptions constructed over the previous seven films keen to use his knowledge of the franchise to subvert those campbellian structures  in doing so rey and ren started to feel more like complicated humans filled with a dangerous sexual energy finn embraced a journey of tolerance and bonding with rose tico in tros reduced to little more than an exposition machine to help an underclass stymied by fascistenabling capitalist structures and poe pushed against conditioned swaggering masculine heroism in the face of powerful female leaders tros ejects all of that almost instantly rey is now on a conventional campbellian journey as is ren in opposition finn ends up caught between plotlines tethered to rey in one moment and then elsewhere the next poe is simply reverted to a cocksure amalgam of han solo and indiana jones saddled with a conventional spiky romance with keri russells sexy trader zorri leia resorts to awkward platitudes they really should have not had carrie fisher in this because it just looks and sounds uncanny even luke from beyond ends up telling rey i was wrong handing back the lightsaber he threw away all of the last jedis nuance is underwritten this is perhaps because abrams isnt that kind of filmmaker he is almost a love child of lucas stringent fascination with myth and mystery and spielbergs imaginative wonder and emotion abrams tells stories from the heart whereas johnson works a little bit more from the head abrams understands the heroes journey as a quest narrative and thats how he and lawrence kasdan wrote the force awakens  the quest there was to find luke who was the treasure in the cave at the end of the story rey faced key trials to reach learning aspects of herself in the process if tros has sith artefacts then tfa had jedi maps but the essential construct was the same tfa borrowed heavily from a new hope in the process but it worked fine because it was at the same time rebuilding and reconstructing a world and establishing characters journeys and mysteries  if you look at abrams career how often does he ever end a story mission impossible star trek lost alias  all are either yet to be ended or were concluded by other people endings are far far harder than beginnings sticking landings is tough and abrams was tasked with not just unconventionally for him ending a story he initialised but also course correcting from the last jedia film he would have done entirely differentlyand creating a grand unified theory of the entire 42 year old skywalker saga like endgame the culmination of star wars first true cycle not just the end of a trilogy as a result abrams enables the kind of nostalgic safety that the last jedi ran away from this isnt the same ren who barked let the past die kill it if you have to this is a kylo who encourages rey to embrace her own past embrace the key connection and truth about her parentswhich youll probably be able to guess after the first few scenesand embrace her crucial link to the entirety of the franchise to date rey was always important there was always going to be an ultimate destiny there would always be an ultimate battle and consequently everything is on turbo  the millennium falcon hyperjumps between systems and landscapes for the ultimate space chase the first order unleash the biggest fleet of star destroyers any star wars film could possibly deliver we get call backs galore  characters lando calrissian wedge antilles entire moments from previous films repurposed such as the xwing rising out the dagobah swamp and force powers that wouldnt go amiss out of a video game it teases the deaths of major characters and then almost instantly rolls back on them though abrams is more intelligent than just pandering to fanboys who wish to see very expensive fan fiction on screen tros is essentially just that  a nostalgic reheated mash up of everything you have loved about star wars for four decades charged to maximum there is however one thing it lacks aside from much in the way of logic at key points especially the final act that tfa and tlj both had soul the rise of skywalker left me empty in a similar fashion to the iron throne the final episode of game of thrones both of them were enjoyable both were highly anticipated but both were constructed on narrative expectations of mystery and payoff that audiences had largely predetermined and seeing them play out as expected left a hollow evaporation ive thought almost nothing about game of thrones since that finale when i expected to be turning it over for years compare this to watchmen a masterful examination of legacy and nostalgia which points out how dangerous those elements can be to the modern day and were legions apart similarly the rise of skywalker escapes into the ether the moment it has finished there is none of the rousing spirit of how a new hope ended or even the cathartic victory of return of the jedi it ends in true campbellian fashion by returning to the beginning and marking that territory with the last shot playing on perhaps the most iconic shot in star wars that sums up tros and in many ways the cinematic trend of the 2010s the determination to look back rather than boldly push forward the rise of skywalker is creatively the weakest star wars film since revenge of the sith and possibly even attack of the clones at times frenetic  bereft of storytelling logic and poorly written it reduces this sequel trilogy to less a point of renewal and satisfaction but rather a pointlessness if we had known this was where it was all heading would we have thought twice as to whether it was a good idea the billions of dollars in box office receipts would have been worth it for disney but what does tros truly add for us as audiences what does it say about our world today except that fascists are bad and we should all stand together to stop them that was a message the original trilogy communicated if less overtly in terms of gender and cultural equality the last jedi especially suggested that star wars was on the cusp of a genuine rise of the masses that the children of tomorrow born not of a quasimythical mystical lineage like ben solo or now rey palpatine would all become sky walkers could all harness the force in order to balance the dyad of good and evil in humanity for a while we hoped perhaps thats what the rise of skywalker meant as a title in the end it means exactly what you expected it to mean and thats both the most inevitable and disappointing way for the star wars saga to for now come to a close
Jan 30 2021,positive,  it has taken 42 years but the story of the resistance that started in star wars a new hope comes to its conclusion in star wars the rise of skywalker with an ampedup story featuring flying stormtroopers and much talk of destiny confronting fear and inner turmoil the ancient conflict between the jedi and the sith promises to deliver big at the box office but will it satisfy old school fans who have waited a lifetime for the films final showdown  the events of star wars the last jedi and the passing of carrie fisher presented challenges that helped shape the plot of the new film but youll get no spoilers here i will say that old footage of fisher as general leia organa from the force awakens appears alongside new work from darth vaders grandson kylo ren adam driver jedi apprentice rey daisy ridley stormtrooperturnedresistancefighter finn john boyega resistance pilot poe dameron oscar isaac chewbacca joonas suotamo and the first orders general hux domhnall gleeson  add to that new characters like diabolical first order allegiant general pryde richard e grant spice runners of kijimi leader zorii bliss keri russell and returning faves lando calrissian billy dee williams and mark hamills luke skywalker in what form i will not say and you have a blended brady bunchstyle family in space  tasked with wrapping the skywalker saga up in a pretty bow director jj abrams has made a film that is part fan servicemany familiar faces come along for the rideand part homage to the original trilogy he replaces subtext with action rehabilitates one characters tarnished cranky old man reputation no spoilers here and essentially delivers the movie you expect  abrams knows there are no do overs on this one do or do not there is no try comes to mind it is the wrap to one of the most popular and talked about film franchises of all time expectations are high with the possibility of fan backlash ever present questions are answeredreys parentage chief among themquips are thrown chewbacca howls and star ships are blasted to kingdom come as the rise of skywalker for better and for worse replaces the nuanced take of rian johnsons the last jedi with the more tried and true star wars tale of nature vs nurture and good vs evil  jam packed with action and plot the rise of skywalker gets bogged down with exposition and tying up loose ends worse it often drifts from the thing that made star wars great in the first placethe characters theyre all present and accounted for but are often overshadowed by the whiz bang pacing and overabundance of story  having said that the films final third the payoff to the saga hits several emotional high points its the end of the saga and therefore no spoilers here just the facts the final appearances of several members of the original cast their exits are handled with sensitivity and should generate a sniffle or two from hardcore fans  the core of the movie is the anguished dynamic between rey and kylo the push and pull between their logical vs biological family commitments is the most compelling part of the story it also provides for several of the films most visually interesting scenes including a climatic lightsaber battle on the wreckage of the death star  star wars the rise of skywalker ticks a lot of boxes for fans butagain no spoilersthe mythic battle of good vs evil of finding balance in the force that has fuelled the franchise for 40 plus years was really only going to resolve itself in one way as such the metaphysical struggle is about the journey and not as much about the actual conclusion  opening in londons west end in 1981 it ran for 21 years and 8949 performances while the broadway production ran for 18 years and 7485 performances it has played in over 30 countries in 15 languages and has been seen by more than 73 million people worldwide the showstopping hit song memory has been recorded by everyone from liberace to barbra streisand it is truly a show that always lands on its feet  when he asked the composer if cats was a political metaphor are those cats queen victoria gladstone and disraeli the broadway legend wondered hal the composer replied this is just about cats  lets not pussyfoot around cats will go down in history as the weirdest studio movie of 2019 with actors who appear to have been put through the fullbody snapchat cat filter a ziegfeld folliesstyle chorus line of dancing cockroaches and felines with human hands and feet youll wonder if the theatre popcorn is laced with catnip  its an example of spectacle over substance the songs are catchy the cats swing and sway in a manner that would make cirque du soleil envious but the story such that it is is still simply a collection of show tunes bound by theme but unconcerned with the niceties of plotting in other words instead of a story cats is essentially a cluster of songs of introduction based on a weird plotless collection of eliots poems  where director tom hoopers les misérables worked to downplay the musicals theatricality cats embraces it allowing the felines to slink about the set part ballet part pantomime part cat in heart its big and silly but unfortunately the hightech veneer of the cgi costumes and sets erases much of the charm present in the more modest stage versions one of the movies highlights is one stripped of almost all artifice dame judy stares down the camera to deliver a playful the addressing of cats which has the kind of simple absurd fun the rest of the film lacks  there are other notsobad moments laurie davidsons the magical mr mistoffelees has a touch of well magic and taylor swift sashays convincingly through bombalurinas number but while the cast works hard to sell the material the film is so unrestrained so in search of meaning in a story that offers up religious resurrection metaphors but not much else that i suspect audiences will make the jellicle choice and go see star wars the rise of skywalker instead  bombshell the new film starring charlize theron nicole kidman and a cast of thousands is set at a time when dinosaurs roamed the earth the dinosaur in the room in this story is roger ailes john lithgow the chairman and ceo of fox news much of the action is set in 2016 but the attitudes on display are positively prehistoric  ailes died on may 18 2017 aged 77 but when we first meet him he reigns supreme he helped elected presidents walked the halls of power with confidence and most importantly for the purposes of this story created the conservative cable news juggernaut fox news specializing in covering stories that according to producer jess carr kate mckinnon will scare your grandmother and piss off your grandfather fox became ailes mouthpiece to counter liberal cnn  ailes altered how americans consumed the news making stars out of greta van susteren bill oreilly sean hannity and the two women at the heart of bombshells story gretchen carlson nicole kidman and megyn kelly charlize theron kelly is one of the networks biggest stars an outspoken lawyer engaged in a war of words with then candidate donald trump the feud was good for ratings so despite his protrump stance ailes allowed it to continue not as good for the ratings was carlson a former primetime anchor demoted to midafternoons following disagreements with her boss  eventually fired carlson leveled accusations of sexual misconduct against her former boss alleging she had been fired for rebuffing ailes advances when the expected support from other women inside fox who had been auditioned by ailes with the words stand up and give me a twirl or lift your skirt up higher so i can see your legs carlson fears her allegations will fall on deaf ears  on the inside kelly weighs her options despite a support roger campaign from colleague jeanine pirro alanna ubach she bides her time before opening up about her own experiences  the title bombshell is a double entendre referring to ailes objectification of his onair talent and to the accusations leveled against him which sent ripples throughout the male dominated corporate world of news  bombshell echoes the story recently told in the miniseries the loudest voice both tell of a toxic workplace where one man ruled by intimidation sexual harassment and micromanagement we have two three and four doughnut days says ailes executive assistant holland taylor these arent doughnuts he eats theyre doughnuts he throws his if you want to play with the big boys you have to lay with the big boys credo is dramatized in his interactions with kayla pospisil a composite of several fox employees played by margot robbie it was the days before metoo and the film does a good job of showing the apprehension some of the abused women feel about revealing their lurid treatment by ailes  at the films helm is theron with the aid of an incredible makeup job disappears into the role of megyn she pierces the icy demeanor of kellys onair persona to reveal a heroine torn between loyalty to a man she knows has done terrible things and doing the right thing its tremendous work that humanizes a character often portrayed in the reallife press as a divisive figure  bombshell is a tornfromtheheadlines story about the people behind the headlines that serves as a reminder of the importance of the metoo movement in shining a light on the kind of inappropriate behavior that placed women in peril in the workplace good performances aided by makeup and prosthetics bring the story to vivid life
Jan 29 2021,neutral, let the past die kill it if you have to it is the only way to become what you were meant to be in 2017 rian johnsons divisive the last jedi  with all of its charms and faults  set its eyes on recontextualizing the star wars mythos daring to scry a future free from tradition and legacy jedi and sith skywalkers and palpatines the middle entry of the new sequel trilogy boldly jettisoned the status quo but where the last jedi shed the trappings of old detonating mythologies in service of an exciting and uncertain future the rise of skywalker reaches back with a nostalgic vicegrip unable to let go of the past in the most frustrating of ways a weightless and rushed endcap all too eager to check boxes rather than provide any semblance of real catharsis or closure the final installment of a saga over forty years in the making lands with a whimper and a shrug  of the last jedis many  and oftentimes controversial  contributions to the star wars narrative none are more resonant than the parallel arcs of kylo ren adam driver and rey daisy ridley introduced in 2015s the force awakens kylo ren was established as a conflicted darksider drawn to the light while rey was a mysterious new heroine grappling with her place in the galaxy with the last jedi writer and director rian johnson deepened their stories by exploring the concept of legacy setting up kylo ren and rey as opposite sides of the same coin its one of star wars most compelling threads a corrupted ben solo torn asunder and crushed under the weight of the skywalker vader and solo mantles comes into conflict with rey a forceuser untethered from the franchises deeply entrenched bloodlines  a nobody in a fateful encounter kylo spits venomous truth about reys parents to her face they were filthy junk traders sold you off for drinking money theyre dead in a paupers grave in the jakku desert you come from nothing youre nothing but not to me even the material surrounding the last jedis release barely a year old supported johnsons bold democratization of the force the book women of the galaxy summarizes rey just because you come from nothing doesnt mean youre not part of the story youre not no one because anybody can save the galaxy anyone even leading up to the release of the rise of skywalker the water seemed troubled in the onslaught of press that coincided with the films premiere many of the actors and creators started taking what could only be construed as thinlyveiled potshots at the the last jedi jj abrams in a widely quoted statement took his swing its a bit of a meta approach to the story i dont think that people go to star wars to be told this doesnt matter furthermore john boyega took umbrage at the fact that the cast was separated for much of the last film while daisy ridley cried with relief when it was announced that abrams would be returning to close out the saga all of this coupled with the fact that there is a small but incredibly vocal contingent of the fanbase that hates everything about the last jedi  from its perceived sidelining of luke skywalker mark hamill to its inclusion of a woman of color rose tico kelly marie tran  the onus was on abrams to close out the sequel trilogy in the most satisfactory way  unfortunately in this case satisfactory also equates to prohibitively safe the rise of skywalker sacks all of the last jedis narrative boldness and characterization in favor of crowdpleasing fan service  walking back the most compelling aspects of rian johnsons entry the film is suffocatingly beholden to nostalgia and star wars history and while its one thing to tell a vapid story that fruitlessly clings to tradition its another issue entirely to send the following  much more troubling  message to its toxic fandom your voice matters and were listening if you desperately wanted reys parents to be related to a legacy character if you wanted rose to be marginalized into oblivion if you wanted a clear explanation for supreme leader snoke or if you wanted a nonstop stream of macguffins and fetch quests loaded with sly references then the rise of skywalker is the perfect remedy for your the last jedi woes the first words of the films opening crawl sets the tone for the franchises most ossified entry the dead speak following the last jedi in terms of chronology but not in spirit rise establishes that emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid has returned from the dead pulling the strings of the first order from the shadows theres not much more to the paperthin plot as general leia organas the late carrie fisher ragtag resistance once again strives to defeat a sinister superweapon if theres one word to distill the film to its purest essence it would be frenzied the rise of skywalker wears its deficit of attention on its sleeve often opening doors without bothering to close them there are subplots about poe damerons oscar isaac shrouded past finns john boyega big secret and even a rebel stormtrooper movement but the film clearly doesnt have the narrative economy to effectively explore any of them and for such a manic film much of the plot feels strangely inert  most of its busyness is tied up in fetch quests and poorly explained macguffins abrams and screenwriter chris terrio argo justice league love to wheelspin whether its rebooting c3pos anthony daniels memory or chasing a nonsensical sith wayfinder the rise of skywalker chugs along with enervated purpose there are however still moments left over to enjoy in the film the entire cast gives it their all when it comes to the frantic adventure and its especially fun to see ian mcdiarmid chew up the scenery as emperor palpatine once again even if his resurrection is largely misguided and adam driver finally gets a chance to flex some playfulness and levity along with his signature kylo ren dourness even providing the few emotional moments of rise that do land in addition the film is also quite pretty to look at dan mindel returns after the force awakens as director of photography giving its empty spectacle at least a veneer of lush beauty rian johnson in a radiocom interview railed against the propensity to bend over backwards and please fans i think approaching any creative process with making fandoms happy would be a mistake that would lead to probably the exact opposite result johnson said i want to be shocked i want to be surprised i want to be thrown offguard i want to have things recontextualized i want to be challenged as a fan when i sit down in the theater its a sentiment i largely agree with unfortunately star wars the rise of skywalker is the exact opposite of the daring challenges offered by the last jedi an empty vessel crafted specifically to be filled by the lowestcommondenominator its indicative of the lack of forethought put into the new sequel trilogy in the first place its supremely disappointing to see that of the endless possibilities available to be painted on the star wars canvas the rise of skywalker chose to erase its predecessor and retreat into its own safety
Jan 28 2021,positive, with the holiday season comes another star wars film except this year fans are walking into the theater with the bittersweet knowledge that this one marks the end of the star wars saga as we know it number ix in the series star wars the rise of skywalker isnt particularly novel in its treatment of plot or characters in fact both carry over from prior films some with more weight than others but this final installment does exactly what fans of the series want it to it strikes at the aw look whos back remember that this feels familiar cord allowing nostalgia and some fun fast flirty fight sequences to close up a property over 40 years old next is where i disclose a summary of the film if you havent seen it and dont want to know general plot points then perhaps read no further you know just to be safe the film picks up where 2017s the last jedi left off the resistance is hanging on by its thinnest thread yet general leia carrie fisher oversees the troops but gives special attention to rey daisy ridley who spends her time training alone in the forest perfecting jedimind tricks like fighting using only her intuition and levitating above the ground as she searches for the voices of jedis past meanwhile modern dayhamlet kylo ren adam driver leader of the first order is drawn to remote planet exegol where he discovers emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid still alive and teasing an offer too good to be true kill the last jedi and be by his side while they rule over the galaxy for those of you with poor memories or little knowledge of the star wars universe palpatine has been the overarching villain of the series since his first appearance in the empire strikes back in his youth he dissolved the governing body in favor of imperial rule electing himself supreme leader he was darth vaders boss until as always happens student killed master but hes back now somehow in zombified form eager to continue the reign of the sith empire and push the dark sides propaganda onto the universe kylo ren is the key for him to destroy the last jedi rey but kylo ren has his own agenda and they play a game of cat and mouse using their special connection to project their consciousness throughs space to one another rey with the help of friends poe oscar isaac finn john boyega chewbacca joonas suotamo c3po anthony daniels and adorable bb8 is on an intergalactic quest to find the pathfinder that will show her the way to exegol so she can finally learn her true identity and confront the evil palpatine the crew hops from planet to planet always narrowly evading the first order until they find what they are looking for rey meanwhile is fighting her own battle she can feel the darkness creeping up inside her it doesnt help that her attraction to kylo ren upsets her jedi mindfulness when rey learns that she is redacted spoiler her resolve to kill palpatine convert kylo ren back to the side his parents fought for all their lives and keep her friends safe is tested in an epic final battle with a few deaths but plenty of gratifying moments to close out the saga with jj abrams back at the helm  we love rian johnson but the new string of star wars films is abrams baby  the rise of skywalker doesnt attempt to do too much in its allotted runtime something that could have made the film implode it introduces very few new characters and the ones it does poes maskwearing former cohort keri russell and a runaway stormtrooper naomi ackie even feel unnecessary despite their limited screen time there is a lot of flying and shooting the dialogue often takes a backseat to the action but thats what we want and need and love about a series that expands the universe it lives in with each installation despite all the other noise it is rey who is our focus shes been the driving force of the new series episodes viiix and she deserves this conclusion to her story which is also the resolution for now to the conflict of dark versus light good versus evil its all a bit cliche sure but the duality of those themes is played out tactfully and with enough newness to make the film interesting avid fans will enjoy the sprinkling of easter eggs that litter the film the most obvious of which include billy dee williams reprising his role as lando calrissian and the ghost of han solo harrison ford returning to deliver his iconic line one more time at the end of the day the rise of skywalker came saw and entertained it wont be flooding the academy with oscar nominations but it will delight those who matter most for now may the force be with you

Jan 27 2021,positive, joonas suotamo is chewbacca oscar isaac is poe dameron daisy ridley is rey and john boyega is finn in star wars  the rise of skywalkerlucasfilm ltd cleveland ohio  a long time ago in what now feels like a galaxy far far away i distinctly remember hearing a rumor my favorite movie star wars was actually meant to be part of a nineepisode saga the prospect of more star wars movies was the kind of thing that got a kid like me who cherished the empty box he once got for christmas that only had pictures of star wars action figures on it up in the morning there were doubts along the way  first in 1983 following return of the jedi and again in 2005 after revenge of the sith  that wed ever see all nine of those films but some 42 years later here we are star wars the rise of skywalker represents the end to the beloved epic space opera george lucas created many decades ago expectations are through the roof especially after the films predecessor the last jedi left some fans saying they had a bad feeling about it the standalone solo the most recent star wars film till now didnt exactly light a spark of enthusiasm either or instill confidence in disneys stewardship of the franchise so does the rise of skywalker deliver a satisfying conclusion to the saga or will your opinion of star wars turn to the dark side the rise of skywalker feels like a big giant f you to the last jedi that was my working headline for this post being charged with the final movie in the biggest pop culture phenomenon ever is a huge responsibility directorcowriter jj abrams had a lot of questions to answer and people to please at the top of that list of people himself abrams recently took a shot at the last jedi director rian johnson calling his approach to the saga as meta and saying that people dont go to star wars to be told this doesnt matter abrams was referring specifically to the force awakens the 2015 reboot he directed so abrams spends a considerable amount of time in the rise of skywalker undoing pretty much everything johnson undid in episode viii the knights of ren theyre back reys nobody parents not nobodies anymore rose kelly marie tran relegated undeservedly to the background some of the housekeeping is minor admiral ackbar has a kid but some of it kylo rens mask is distracting more signficantly abrams coursecorrecting results in a movie that feels more like a sequel to the force awakens than it does to the last jedi backing the story into a messy convoluted corner in short if you preferred the subversiveness of the last jedi over the paintbynumbers of the force awakens this isnt the film youre looking for the dead speak those are the first three words of the movies customary opening crawl its no secret that emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid from the prequels and original trilogy is back because a the movie needed a villain after snoke was killed in the previous film and b these things always come full circle the problem none of it really makes any sense not only is there no reason for palpatine to be alive other than the film needs him to be his return is never fully explained other characters inexplicably appear at just the right moment like in a shortened season of game of thrones the galaxy has always been full of plot holes but there are more here than in a block of bluemilk cheese instead of coherence we get familiarity as abrams relies on recycled tropes from the force awakens and previous films rey daisy ridley finn john boyega poe oscar isaac c3po anthony daniels and chewbacca joonas suotamo go in search of a map to palpatine as kylo ren adam driver chases them across the galaxy with designs on turning rey to the dark side by enticing her with secrets about her parents its true all of it  dont get the wrong impression this isnt a negative review the film indeed has hurdles to clear but if youre able to get past all of the above  and you should  youll discover the rise of skywalker is a blast a rousing nonstop thrill ride that packs the emotional wallop youd expect from a final chapter no ones ever really gone much of the films emotion comes from seeing the original trilogy characters in their final appearances on screen call it fan service if you want but billy dee williams is a joy in his return as lando in his most signifcant screentime since return of the jedi daniels crushes it turning what had become an annoying character back into the threepio that first captured our hearts its a kick to see mark hamill finally get to play luke as both a force ghost and as a young jedi master training leia in a flashback speaking of leia the late carrie fisher is radiant as the iconic princess how abrams pieced together a seamless performance from previously unused footage of fisher is one of the films triumphs both the character and actress are given a touching sendoff if youre not already crying by then a surprise cameo by another original cast member should do the trick search your feelings make no mistake about it this is rey and kylo rens film their force bond something abrams convenienty kept from the last jedi is stronger than ever the chemistry between the ridley and driver is undeniable as they navigate the peripheries of the jedi and sith and you thought your relationship was complicated the resolution of their story might not please everybody  there were audible groans at the screening i attended  but the journey should move if not bowl you over like a speeding rathtar rebellions are built on hope abrams paints inside the lines but its still a wondrous canvas the rise of skywalker is more a star chase than a fullblown star war but the lightsaber duel on the sinking remains of the death star and the climactic battle on a star destroyer are worthy set pieces in franchise lore finn and poe are an intergalactic buddy cop comedy waiting to happen the film is full of twists turns surprises and reveals some youll see a parsec away others not so much looseends are neatly tied up mostly anyway a nostalgic epilogue on tattooine plants the seeds for possible future films the force will be with you always the rise of skywalker is a flawed if not safe film even the title is a misdirect is it worth the 42year wait no movie could live up to that expectation still there are enough reminders of why you fell in love with star wars in the first place to make you feel like a kid again a kid who never has to wonder if those nine films will ever get made if you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on

Dec 17 2020,positive, there comes a point when studios need to understand that fan service can only do so much heavy lifting with a film it requires a convincing narrative strong characterizations and a commitment to taking risks to elevate a film beyond the pablum of boxchecking star wars the rise of skywalker is not the film disney should have made its the film fans demanded to their own detriment as the final film in the skywalker saga the rise of skywalker is an overlong mess that tries to tie every single other film into the narrative without doing so convincingly the film features countless cameos and throwbacks to the prior films that it almost feels like a documentary about the saga itself rather than a fullyformed idea of a film as rey daisy ridley continues her jedi training under the tutelage of leia organa carrie fisher the threat of a thoughtdead villain threatens the forward momentum of the rebellion while finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar isaac work to find his location through a series of roadblocks all three continue trying to find the necessary course while rey continues to insist that only she can stop the threat nearly every character that has dotted the landscape of the last fourplus decades of films features at some point in the film the prequels see the least representation but the originals are well represented with the likes of fisher harrison ford mark hamill and billy dee williams all making requisite appearances its a film almost entirely built off of fan service without giving them anything suitably deep or thoughtprovoking to latch onto the lackluster screenplay by chris terrio and jj abrams struggles to find something worthy to say that doesnt devolve into pointless regurgitation of series tropes and characterizations further characters with a great deal of promise like rose tico kelly marie tran have been sidelined while new characters like zorii bliss keri russell were added with seemingly little need a great deal of effort has also been made to retcon the prior outing from rian johnson simply because fans were unreasonably angry about it the end result is something that feels almost halfbaked that isnt to say that the film doesnt work fans are sure to be enthralled by the movie even if some are disappointed by the direction the final film ultimately took those fan service moments largely excite and there are plenty of emotionfilled moments thanks to john williams alwaysexciting score the problem is and always will be jj abrams who has never been a fan of creating his own unique vision every franchise he gets his hands on is stripped bare of its essence and retrofitted to his exacting mediocrity if hes not outright copying other better work super 8 star trek 1  2 the force awakens hes creating something as unchallenging and frequently dull as the rise of skywalker
Dec 7 2020,positive, umors of puppetmaster emperor palpatines existence persist causing supreme leader kylo ren adam driver to venture off in search of the hidden world of the sith while the meager remnants of the resistance struggle to find support despite the thunderous theme music and the iconic yellow text crawl the events summed up in this opening are perhaps the least eventful  and most unnecessary  of all the star wars films to date clearly its expected that this preamble occur even if theres no need in the initial moments a new alien species is seen new structures are unearthed and elements of the otherworldly dark side antagonists are glimpsed  even if fashioned for little more than a single scene back in 1977 when star wars first debuted the sith were the sleeker hipper edgier betterdressed brethren to the jedi the rebellious younger brother of sorts but here they generate a horror movie vibe as if inhabiting the world of a grim modernized vision of frankensteins monster after all these years the villains arent as cool as they are simply icky though the opening reveals some notsosurprising revelations spoilertype items are introduced quickly so as not to keep audiences waiting for what they know to be inevitable  particularly from the films advertising which gives away the setup a dependable action sequence follows again transitioning between new imagery  from an icy borglike planetoid to a stalagmitic region and then to a green gaseous world  as if to cram as many fresh environments into the mix as possible and it all leads to intermediary activities including rey daisy ridley continuing her training under the casual guidance of leia carrie fisher poe oscar isaac and finn john boyega using the millennium falcon to rendezvous with a spy and ren coordinating the assemblage of the final order a monstrous fleet of soldiers and warships combining to finally wipe out the opposition plus rey must eventually find out why her abilities with the force continue to grow never be afraid of who you are since this closing chapter to the sequel trilogy is once again helmed by jj abrams he has a rare opportunity to undo  or correct  the many things that former writerdirector rian johnson did to the storyline but right from the start abrams embraces heavy homages to the original trilogy which border on disagreeable repetition rather than welcomed reappearances neatly tying together johnsons additives or restoring abrams own concepts appear as trivial concerns a roundtable meeting with sharplyuniformed uncertain first order officers ends in a typical forcechoke a desert planet is overpopulated with alien denizens much like the many establishments on tatooine the knights of ren a gang of intimidating jedi trainees sporting barbaric shortrange weapons feel all too similar to snokes crimsonarmored praetorian guards themselves a twist on palpatines royal guards  or even the children of thanos its difficult at times for certain concepts in star wars not to resemble something from the marvel universe or vice versa and a death startype infiltration retreads much of the vaderobiwan showdown and the leia rescue though the architectural comparisons are amusing hinting at the evolution of the imperials into the first order and disappointingly theres still no answer as to who or what snoke was supposed to be  obviously an idea that fizzled out when the role was deemed dispensable as in the previous episodes plenty of contrivances populate the premise a convenient sith wayfinder is the only clue to locating an unknown planet conveniently lando calrissian billy dee williams returns for an extended cameo a first order captains medallion is conveniently handed to poe for his very next act of espionage and poe just happens to know a droidhacker when a droid needs to be hacked how convenient there are also too many justinthenickoftime sequences to count nevertheless the film also knows how to blend in with the star wars adventures that preceded it crafting new vehicles monsters technology weaponry costumes and visual splendor even if all of it is used in the same kinds of chases battles dogfights and rescue missions from before yet rey gets to do some stunning things with the force proving to be more formidable than ever c3po is utilized in spectacular ways for comic relief representing a dependable return to the humor of the original trilogy and plenty of practical effects and rubbery puppetry highlight the charm of tangible props diminutive droidsmith babu is one of the best examples the stakes are higher the allies are scarcer and the enemies more plentiful building to a grand climax of course with the shift in writing comes the jettisoning of a few major characters backtracking on bits of history and themes and a romantic counterpart reshuffle yet the conclusion is rife with jawdropping sets lightsaber duels emotional confrontations and sentimental throwbacks to recognizable elements not only from the original trilogy but also from star wars the force awakens bringing to an end if only temporarily a remarkably vast collection of cinematic legends and lore and an acclaimed legacy

Nov 27 2020,positive, set after the events of the last jedi  which saw the resistance at their weakest  we are thrown straight into the action as rey daisy ridley finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac look to finally defeat the first order led by supreme leader kylo ren adam driver add on the returning threat of emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid and the pieces all appear in place for an epic conclusion that could leave the majority satisfied however what follows while satisfying on certain levels suffers from a tirade of problems that will leave many frustrated to keep this review as spoiler free as possible i wont get into specificsbut it is safe to say that adam driver is the stand out performer as kylo ren he has always been a powerful presence on screen that balances both the light and the dark in the last jedi his internal conflict was at a tipping point with the rise of skywalker we see how far these choices have taken him and whether anything can bring him back from the darkness daisy ridley has now comfortably found her stride with the character of rey and has been able to portray an incredible depth of emotion she is given a lot of material to work with here and she does well to help make it believable through her grounded performance it is however sad to report that the screentime of a lot of fan favourites such as rose tico kelly marie tran and general hux domnhall gleeson is lacking moved to the background when their performances were highlights of the sequel trilogy it was disheartening to see these characters reduced to set dressing in favour of new characters with little backstory outside of the main trio of heroes we do not get a chance to see many more of the heroes to shine even newcomers jannah naomi ackie and zorii bliss keri russell only serve to further plot and do not feel full formed as characters themselves jannah in particular feels underutilised especially when you consider her characters backstory and its connection to another of the lead characters something hard to deny is that john williams has done some incredible work with the score using elements from all his previous work as well as fresh interpretations the soundtrack is full of life and truly lives up to the incredibly high standards that williams has set for himself without the score the rise of skywalkers biggest moments of levity would perhaps not ring quite as strong as williams finds the perfect moment to elevate  emotions having scored every episode of the skywalker saga it seems fitting that williams ends on perhaps his most powerful yet one thing that became clear in the rise of skywalker was how much of an impact rian johnsons the last jedi had on how we view the star wars franchise at the time there was a lot of controversy surrounding the film but now two years on we can see how johnsons interpretation and reflective look on our heroes and how we perceive them was perhaps a one of a kind moment the rise of skywalker feels like a missed opportunity to continue the incredible themes and ideas started by johnson plot threads that were resolved previously become reopened as though to undo previous work where the last jedi looked to be its own entity despite what fans may believe the rise of skywalker looks to please fans without wanting to have a reason to do so some choices feel made specifically to appease the toxic side of the fandom and in the end feel calculated decisions not by a free filmmaker but someone terrified by their audience  the rise of skywalker offers a lot of good material for fans of the sequel trilogy as we finally see the heroic trio fighting together and adventuring much like luke han and leia had done previously those moments feel joyful and what star wars is about is feeling joy while the conclusion of this film will leave some unhappy and others shocked their is a sense that the past is being honoured and circle that started with anakin is brought to a poetic conclusion the film is far from perfect but offers enough action and heart to satisfy the majority of moviegoers a better film lives somewhere within this story  but i am left with a sense of hope that the future of this franchise still shines bright
Oct 19 2020,positive, lets get this out of the way up top i like star wars the rise of skywalker i really do its full of energy it never lets the gas up the performances especially the leads are all top shelf carrie fisher through the use of archival footage and such is on a giant screen one last time and that is a good thing the emotional journeys are moving and fulfilling the twists and turns and surprises are all built on foundations of what came before john williams score is toecurlingly goodthe movie is eyecandy and earcandy of the highest order but it is also the most pandering movie of the year maybe of the decade endgame you can see yourself out the door skywalker will take your seat at the table it creaks under the weight of all of the fan service the heroes land on a planet looking for whatsit there is a festival going on someone mentions the festival occurs every 42 years you can do the math since 1977 there are cameos and easter eggs and callbacks being dropped every few minutes some of these are clunky some of them are not some cause eyeballs to roll all the way back some cause a smile or a tear some might call it nostalgia gone crazy some might call it trying to play it safe and anyone expecting more of the franchise breaking weirdness and giddiness of last jedi well im sorry this aint that film i dont hide my love for last jedi not at all i love every overstuffed moment every unexpected narrative turn and every kurosawa influenced frame of that billion plus dollar grossing bit of oddness to see some aspects of last jedi treated with what appears to be disrespect kind of hurts so yeah rise of skywalker is fulfilling the promise of force awakens its a star wars movie that is trying not to upset anyone its not trying to reinvent the franchise its trying to bring it to an end but yes it sticks the landing it sure does ill confess  there may have been a tear or two when i heard john williams finale start to play and the credits started to roll this is it the saga is over this story with all of its repeating motifs and themes is finally over i wonder if wee me sitting in that theatre a lifetime ago would understand that one day he would be writing a bunch of words about the last piece of this story that essentially come down to movie good i think wee me might be very confused by this there was no episode 4 no a new hope when wee me saw star wars it was just that star wars i think i might be old whats it about well there is a tribe of cats called the jellicles and theyve come together for the annual jellicle ball and for some reason dame judi dench is a cat but has human hands nice try writing about nothing has become a bit of a superpower in this spoiler adverse age we currently live in ive had lots of practice what with the marvel movies and the other star wars properties and other comic book movies and look im doing it right now nice try indeed at its worst moments rise of skywalker feels like a film made with notes from reddit its clunky and you can almost feel the expectations and desperation to please coming off of the screen at its best it feels like a natural conclusion to a story that has been told over decades remove the fan service you will still have a heck of a genre movie here and the cast elevates everything from the odd plotting to the undercooked dialogue will it break the genre wall at the oscars nope is rise of skywalker what it is intended to be is it a piece of crowd pleasing popcorn entertainment where some things blow up real good yep dont over think it its a star wars movie noone can hear you giggle in space is it worth seeing in a theatre yes you crazy person a million times yes this thing looks amazing its big and it is beautiful there are so many moments that i cant talk about here but trust me rise of skywalker is a feast now get back to work
Aug 28 2020,negative, the skywalker saga reaches its conclusion for now as jj abrams once again takes the reins to make a finale that aims to please all factions of fans across the galaxy this review is spoiler free  following the divisive reaction of the last jedi there was a choice to be made with the final piece of this sequel trilogy give in to the loud factions of fans who disagreed with decisions made or develop the story from the threads of rian johnsons daring midquel with jj back business has resumed to normal with the rise of skywalker a trilogy capper so eager to please as many corners of the fandom as it possibly can that it forgets to tell a story along the way the emperor has returned thought dead emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid has been moving in the shadows and is finally ready to launch his strike the only thing that stands in his way is the hope of the jedi in the form of scavenger rey daisy ridley who is being pursued by supreme leader kylo ren adam driver as she and the rest of the resistance fight to ensure a peaceful future for the galaxy abrams is a director who is more than capable of mounting action and creating a peppy sense of excitement and mystery but sadly here it feels as though he is drowning beneath the weight of the responsibility put before him from the very off the apparently troubled production history can be felt as the film panics in setting up its adventure with an opening act that throws all the toys on the table and quickly tries to put them in a specific place that proves to be a direction thats frustratingly familiar and only fitfully intriguing as the film ends up being a furiously paced adventure across numerous planets following multiple hunts for macguffins with very vague purposes from there the adventure ends up hitting similar beats to that of the franchise as a whole from the original trilogy right down to the prequels while the return of palpatine does bring with it the fun of mcdiarmids deliciously pantomime performance it cant help but feel like a desperate plea to please the faithful along with many other choices that deliberately avoid fragments developed in the last jedi in favour of a broad assumption of what it thinks the fans want this quickly becomes a finale that is far too concerned with developing something that brings together the 40 years of the franchise so while the film is well made with incredible special effects and features a suitably grand john williams score and is dedicatedly performed by its cast of talented actors there is the inescapable feeling of desperation powering it all you can feel the anxiety behind the camera to deliver something that all fans can enjoy a task which is frankly impossible and doomed to fail as a result this is fan service in the worst possible fashion with characters and plot points dropped in for merely the sake of getting a cheer from the crowd rather than add to the story or to strengthen the overall reason for this sequel trilogy to exist the rise of skywalker is a concluding chapter that is so ferociously paced that it forgets to construct a story moving frantically through action beats which dont leave much of an impression delivered at such a clip that it hopes you dont have time to dwell on the thinly sketched details of what plot there is what development there is among characters feels largely superficial and some plot fragments are dropped as quickly as they are introduced there is the niggling sense that another year in production mightve allowed abrams and his cowriter chris terrio the time to smooth out their ambitions however as it stands this is a final chapter that feels as though it just cant wait to get it all done with rather than one that feels like it wants the moment to last very much the return of the jedi to the last jedis empire strikes back in that it concludes its trilogy in an awkwardly paced fashion tros is devoid of much ambition other than to get to a place where it feels most fans will be contented it lacks the confidence of the force awakens and the thematic bravado of the last jedi there are some joyous moments along the way that my inner star wars fan couldnt help but smile at but there are others that are simply confusing and some that are just a bit embarrassing a messy and ultimately underwhelming experience but one that feels so desperate to please that the sense you leave with is not one of anger or annoyance but rather one of pity and so this is how the skywalker saga ends not with thunderous applause but with a heavy shrug of exhausted shoulders
Jul 28 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker is so scared of doing something wrong that by the end it doesnt do much at all
Jul 28 2020,negative, the skywalker saga is brought to a close with this the final film in the main storyline canon tasked with bringing the curtain down in a way befitting of the moment except the rise of skywalker does not even come close the magic that made audiences fall in love with a galaxy far far away has been erased in its place comes the galactic equivalent of an audit reconciled bland an empty record of the originals the result is perhaps the least inspiring entry the series has ever endured on paper there is so much promise somehow the sinister emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid has survived all these years plotting his revenge rey daisy ridley has to stand against both palpatine and kylo ren adam driver who knows a shocking secret about reys heritage yet quickly you realise that bringing back palpatine is one of the safest least creative things disney and jj abrams could possibly have done and thats just the beginning the story and its execution stinks of needless course correction following the last jedi gone are the fascinating new avenues and ideas introduced in the last film abrams bulldozing over everything with what he introduced in the force awakens the knights of ren reys parents and planetkilling weaponry are just some of the things brought back resulting in a convoluted story that throws the entire age of resistance trilogy off kilter worse still is that newer characters are cruelly pushed out none more so than rose kelly marie tran largely forgotten also is general hux domhnall gleeson granted an inexplicable and hastily justified character arc and even finn john boyega cursed with increasingly little to do as reys power grows poe oscar isaac meanwhile is lazily thrown more love interests instead of building on how he grew in the last jedi abrams confirming how disinterested he is in detailed characterisation some fan service is not unwelcome but the rise of skywalker feels like it was based on an overenthusiastic reddit post the endless stream of nods references and direct quotes borders on laziness it feels woefully uninspiring  even the sequences that try and spin something new barely register this is as cold calculated and profane as studioproduced efforts get a paintbynumbers kind of movie the zip and wonder of star wars has been butchered there are some moments to savour all featuring rey and kylo ren their lightsaber duel on the wavebattered ruins of the second death star is riveting and the strange connection that has brought them together is concluded in a way that while it still lacks great surprises at least feels right ridley and driver have settled into their roles wonderfully carrying the script through their most dramatic encounters with enough gravitas to feel like they at least are getting the farewell they deserve welcome also is the return of lando calrissian billy dee williams another instance where there is more than surfacelevel gratification  this is not how it should have ended star wars made its mark with imagination fuelled by the bravery to introduce new ideas and leave stars in the audiences eyes instead disney have decided that a lazy slog through tested content was the way to go and it is unforgivable the rise of skywalker simply lacks the spark that has kept this franchise going for so long replaced by a poisonous hesitation to stray too far from what the fanbase would likely demand it leaves many questions unanswered a feeling of dissatisfaction deep in your stomach and a strange sense of paralysing disappointment
Jul 25 2020,positive, sitting there waiting for john williams opening fanfare at the start of star wars the rise of skywalker i harbored one apprehension that despite their assurances that this ninth film in the series would bring the entire 42year star wars saga to a close the sith lords at disney would nevertheless concoct a cliffhanger ending teasing yet another threepart goround with the skywalker clan breathe easy the mouse house has admirably resisted going over to the dark side rise of skywalker has a fully resolved fadeout leaving no one in jeopardy and the bad guys vanquished spare me the spoiler alert emails what you thought the star wars saga would end like the hateful eight will those who still wear their hair in princess leia buns or who argue about whether han solo shot first be satisfied with the way director jj abrams and his army of writers have resolved the tale who knows but for the casual observer  albeit one who since 1977 has seen every star wars movie during its opening week  this is a pretty satisfactory wrapup the iconic opening text rambles on about rebels and an evil emperor and then chapter 9 picks up right where chapter 8 left off a ragtag army of rebels is holed up on some distant planet desperately trying to figure out a way to resist a powerful galactic dictatorship that has developed a super weapon capable of destroying entire planets now you may ask wasnt that the exact same plot of the original star wars well yes yes it was but back then the chief bad guy was the emperor palpatine and the rebels were led by princess leia okay well yeah this time the emperor remains ian mcdiarmid still playing the role after 36 years and so does leia carrie fisher still playing the role three years after her passing but thats definitely where the similarities end except for the hallway shootouts between our heroes and the storm troopers terrible shots as ever and the climactic dogfight in which mosquitolike space fighters wreak havoc on enemy ships the size of manhattan you just need to know where to aim and of course theres the brave young heroine in white daisy ridley whos got multiple handsome guys hopelessly in love with her ah so heres an element in rise of skywalker that was definitely not in the first star wars movie a repentant villain performs the ultimate act of selfsacrifice to save the life of an innocent ha that didnt happen  until the end of the return of the jedi the point here i guess is that repetition isnt a glitch in the star wars universe  its a feature not unlike medieval passion plays for which audiences tolerated only the most minor variations on a theme the star wars movies vary primarily in the people speaking the lines and the exact nature of the deus ex machina that will deliver our heroes from the brink of destruction this time the chief contribution abrams has made in producing the last three star wars movies has been in assembling an appealing cast as opposed to george lucas three prequels which seemed to have held their casting calls at madame tussauds daisy ridley beautiful and badass brings marvelcaliber energy to the role of rey a jedi adam driver gives the most thoughtful and sympathetic of his three turns as conflicted bad guy kylo ren we still dont get enough time with oscar isaac john boyega and keri russell as hotshot fighter pilots  i wouldnt mind following that trio in some future star wars spinoff but not a sequel and of course abrams has had the advantage of recruiting star wars veterans whose audience goodwill is automatic i wont spill how many of them show up here but its well known that abrams employed previously unused footage of fisher to cobble together a supporting role for her here its the most ambitious gamble of the film and surprisingly successful despite the fact that the entire script was reverse engineered to accommodate the snippets of film at hand princess leias part in the narrative is not only substantial  its central to the plot no one is deluding themselves into thinking disney is flushing the whole star wars universe but its clear that the whole skywalker saga ran its course a few films ago and now is the time to stop for one thing if trends continued the next installment would have required the return of jarjar binks featured image adam driver and daisy ridley in star wars the rise of skywalker photo by lucasfilmlucasfilm ltd  2019 and tm lucasfilm ltd all rights reserved
Jul 24 2020,positive, after jj abrams reignited the star wars franchise for a new generation in the force awakens 2015 rian johnsons the last jedi 2017 didnt quite deliver as luke skywalker told rey he had three lessons to teach her but only revealed two this weekend abrams delivers a hard course correct in episode ix the rise of skywalker fulfilling every promise with plenty of fan service and wrapping things up without ambiguity if anything the movie plays it too safe with everything tied up too neatly but as a final chapter for these characters its a solidly satisfying conclusion after the defeat of snoke rey daisy ridley joins back up with resistance pals finn john boyega poe oscar isaac chewbacca joonas suotamo c3po anthony daniels r2d2 hasan taj lee towersey bb8 brian herring dave chapman rose kelly marie tran and general leia the late carrie fisher rey still suffers visions connecting her to kylo ren adam driver who wants her to join the dark side where emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid returns to lead the sith armys first order this closing chapter smartly focuses on the mental bond between rey and ren as ridley and driver take center stage ridley starts out running a training course in the woods like clarice starling reminding us how shes become an inspiring heroine for young girls growing up with katniss everdeen and wonder woman driver has become an even bigger star earning oscar buzz for his role in marriage story but first fusing together his darth vaderstyle dark helmet for a cool new mask of molten welding their spiritual connection of crossover communications is the most visually compelling element by abrams who works with editors maryann brandon and stefan grube to intercut rey and rens shared experiences when they are in different locations they can even affect the others world in tangible ways a fascinating addition to the powers of the force which has always been the strength of george lucas genius creation cowritten by abrams and chris terrio argo the script offers plenty of popcorn munching delight babu frik hilariously mumbles for comic relief like baby groot poe trades sassy banter with zorri bliss keri russell and rey wages two killer lightsaber battles at one point a weapon becomes a cluefinder like something out of indiana jones while john williams reminds us he can still provide nostalgic goosebumps on the downside the script practically abandons the romance between finn and rose which is odd considering it was such a driving force of the last jedi in fact rose is barely on screen at all while finn starts to offer a confession but never finishes other characters like lupita nyongos maz kanata appear briefly to show face but without much plot involvement while domhnall gleeson gets a laughable line as general hux amid the catchphrases a great screenplay should most importantly keep us guessing here the surprises may be satisfying in closing the story loop without rocking the existing canon but they are underwhelming as a viewer craving twists and turns this is partly due to over exposure by trailers already revealing the biggest moments its great to see billy dee williams back as lando calrissian for the first time in 36 years but it would have been much more exciting if we didnt see it coming the same goes for the trailers revealing the return of emperor palpatine its a pretty lazy choice to bring back the villain from return of the jedi feeling like weve seen it all before with ewoks it makes the 1983 victory less important now that we know palpatine survived the writers should have built a new foe rather than rehash an old one alas at least we get closure to reys longdebated identity crisis dont worry we wont spoil it here but lets just say that it is definitively answered thats not to say its very rewarding considering all of the juicier fan conspiracies since 2015 the result is more of a shrug than a shocker no where near darth vaders iconic i am your father reveal from the empire strikes back 1980 which remains the franchises best installment now after nine official episodes this is the curtain call for these characters as the end of the franchises third trilogy looking back i wish they had waited three years in between chapters like the original trilogy even the disappointing prequel trilogy made us wait several years in between releases instead they rushed out rogue one thumbs up and solo thumbs down as inbetween offshoots that diluted the brand disney will now pump the boxoffice brakes by focusing on the disney series the mandalorian this is probably the best medium for diehard fans to continue exploring the star wars universe as oldschool fans jump off the ride with fatigue regardless of which camp youre in we can all agree that the bigscreen installments should go away for a while and make us miss them then if a new movie ever does arrive lets leave luke leia and solo in the past and explore a new galaxy far far away hailed by

Jul 17 2020,negative, the final chapter of the epic star wars saga the rise of skywalker finally hits theaters this week and although there are so many questions about what becomes of the many characters weve grown to love over the past four decades theres also something many lgbtq fans of the franchise are begging to finally know do we exist in a galaxy far far away picking up a year after where 2017s the last jedi left off the rise of skywalker starts with the resistance or whats left of it still recovering from their last encounter with the first order under the leadership of supreme leader snoke using the most diabolical forces of the dark side the infamous emperor palpatine has mysteriously reemerged back to life as the leader of the sith and is planning once again to completely take over the galaxy and put a permanent end to the jedi without spoiling too much the rest of the movie focuses mostly on our main hero rey daisy ridley the last known jedi and de facto face of the resistance as she tries to put an end to the emperors wicked plot despite attempts by kylo ren adam driver to lure her to the dark side though they were mostly kept apart in the two previous star wars films rey also finally gets to team up with finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar isaac on an urgent resistance mission and their dynamic feels a lot like the beloved friendship between luke leia and han solo of course many star wars fans know that ever since they were introduced to us in 2015s the force awakens viewers wanted more than just friendship between finn and poe so will the rise of skywalker give loyal finnpoe shippers and lgbtq star wars fans the queer romance and representation weve been desperately wanting for the past 42 years yes and no and while we did get a speck not a crumb a speck of lgbtq rep it wasnt from finn and poe the two characters fans have been feverishly shipping together for years in fact it feels like the rise of skywalker goes out of its way to reinforce the notion that finn and poe arent a thing despite their actors john boyega and oscar isaac even admitting their two characters have chemistry and that they wished they could have explored that more on screen in the film poe is given a love interest in the new character zorii keri russell and the fling between rose kelly marie tran and finn is really played up especially during dramatic emotional moments in the final battle with the sith the decision to make two unimportant background characters queer felt like such a waste especially since more of an impact would have been made if two main characters especially ones with as much chemistry as finn and poe had their queerness confirmed in canon despite these problems the rise of skywalker didnt do anything that other films and tv shows havent shoehorning a small but pleasant queer moment in wherever was convenient is too little too late oh yeah is it something that lgbtq pop culture fans are already used to unfortunately  raffy is a los angelesbased writer editor video creator critic and digital director of out magazine the former editorinchief of pride he is also a diehard rihanna and sailor moon stan who loves to write about all things pop culture entertainment and identities follow him on instagram raffyermac and twitter byraffy and subscribe to his youtube channel  raffy is a los angelesbased writer editor video creator critic and digital director of out magazine the former editorinchief of pride he is also a diehard rihanna and sailor moon stan who loves to write about all things pop culture entertainment and identities follow him on instagram raffyermac and twitter byraffy and subscribe to his youtube channel  raffy is a los angelesbased writer editor video creator critic and digital director of out magazine the former editorinchief of pride he is also a diehard rihanna and sailor moon stan who loves to write about all things pop culture entertainment and identities follow him on instagram raffyermac and twitter byraffy and subscribe to his youtube channel  raffy is a los angelesbased writer editor video creator critic and digital director of out magazine the former editorinchief of pride he is also a diehard rihanna and sailor moon stan who loves to write about all things pop culture entertainment and identities follow him on instagram raffyermac and twitter byraffy and subscribe to his youtube channel 
Jul 14 2020,neutral, the power of nostalgia cannot be overestimated jj abrams who directed the first film of the star wars sequel trilogy the force awakens 2015 and returns to steer the franchise to its culmination with star wars the rise of skywalker is all too aware of that truism especially in the light of the hostile fan reaction provoked by star wars the last jedi 2017 in which director rian johnson dared to stray from the beaten path star wars the rise of skywalker drifts back into the known orbit treads cautiously and falls back on old sleights as a result parts of the film particularly in the last hour or so may seem like a rehash of 1983s return of the jedi fans are unlikely to complain however sticking largely to established norms and mindful of what the star wars heroes villains and their galactic battles  all of which are largerthanlife and have been pop culturedefining phenomena over a period of 40plus years  mean to the fans abrams is unwaveringly focused on carrying the fans along in the bargain he skips paying attention to letting the rise of skywalker acquire a life and logic of its own the weight of expectations  star wars episode ix is one of the most anticipated films in the annals of hollywood  is a heavy burden for what is meant to be the swan song of muchloved franchise shouldnt it have been better and brighter than any of the previous eight star wars episodes it is anything but the film is energetic and entertaining on the face of it but if you pause to consider the finer aspects of storytelling  plotting character development logic and suchlike  you are likely to spot gaping holes in the structure built by abrams who has cowritten the rise of skywalker with chris terrio he pays homage to the george lucas universe throws in a few minor visual easter eggs and mounts a few grand scenes that look great while they last neither a proper expansion nor a summation of what star wars stands for it falls into the cracks between conception and execution following rey daisy ridley who is firstrate and her buddies finn frank boyega and poe oscar isaac as they set out to stymie the evil plans of the tyrannical first order the film answers a few key questions most notably one related to the reys parentage kills off a few characters and surprisingly brings back a few others one character who makes a comeback is the principal villain emperor sheev palpatine ian mcdiarmid who at the end of return of the jedi had been thrown down a chute and had met his end in the rise of skywalker his revival is presented as a fait accompli without a proper explanation nor an attempt to make it believable palpatine is reintroduced with the express purpose of overriding snorks surprise death in the last jedi but it is anything but convincing much of the rise of skywalker is devoted to a strategy to negate the last jedi a film that sought to pull away from the george lucas imagination of a galaxy far far away what this necessitates for the rise of skywalker is the act of drawing upon star wars lore to restore the links with the franchises past and then creating its own course towards a finale all this makes the film so dizzyingly busy that it becomes difficult in the initial hour to grasp every plot detail this is turn leads to contrivances designed to paper over the gaps  they barely pass muster the craftsmanship is of the highest order the cgi is terrific and the performances applauseworthy but there is something about the rise of skywalker that does not let it float free and rise to heights that the franchise hasnt touched before its finesse is of the strictly superficial kind which is a huge disappointment for those who believed that star wars would end with a bang rey finn and poe generate a fair deal of excitement but they cannot replicate the magic that luke skywalker han solo and princess leia worked in the original star wars trilogy the rise of skywalker is daisy ridleys film but boyega and isaac do not have as much to do it is adam driver who steals the show as kylo ren whose telepathic connection with rey allows him to taunt her about switching allegiance to the dark side palpatine has picked kylo to be his successor the evil emperor promises kylo an entire army and immense power in exchange for the task of eliminating the last jedi trainee rey on the other side rey having lost her master luke is learning the jedi ropes from general leia carrie fisher who appears in awkwardly spliced together scenes left out of the earlier films eventually rey decides that she must track down palpatine and leaves the resistance base accompanied by finn poe chewbacca joonas suotamo and c3po anthony daniels and bb they progress towards their goal rising level by level as if in a video game only two people can stop palpatine  rey and kylo  but they are on opposing sides a lightsaber duel on a fallen death star and other visually striking passages abound in the film but they are slapped together in a manner that smacks of a lack of planning slapdash writing and generic action tics
Jul 14 2020,negative, when the dust finally settled star wars the rise of skywalker inevitably brought back memories to something i wrote last year  it was titled the pitfalls of nostalgia  a conversational look into our relationship with the convention and its excessive use and overreliance of it in film and tv  and yet somehow as i mull over my thoughts in summing up the final film in the skywalker saga somehow those words are more apparent than ever jj abrams has a deep fascination with mystery box adventures that you could probably write a thesis on it  from lost alias fringe mission impossible 3 and even star trek into darkness he operates this trademark style with an almost spielbergian methodology  the quest creates a sense of wonder and the inevitable whippedup frenzy of speculation and discourse  in jjs reality the power surrounding the mystery serves as a powerful narrative where questions can be layered upon mystery box upon mystery box with a countless amount of teasing that would prop up a charlie day conspiracy meme instead of having to explain or confront its context perhaps the best example of his concept is super 8 arguably jjs strongest work in his filmography a film enriched in spielberg both in its nostalgia and that larger than life adventurism bonded by family and friendship  whilst it does well to convey the emotional outreach with its fantastic young cast and sharp dialogue its muddled turn off was its choice to change the nature of the alien switching between a cloverfieldjaws obliteration of the residents to a sudden et complex of an alien wanting to phone home  in a film that feels like a mashup of his favourite genres and themes you can make a humble argument that the alien was a substitute for family grief  but the truth is the twist works more as an executed jigsaw convention something to reward an audience through its emotional overtures than catering for some constructed logic within its script thats not to say theres a right or wrong way of storytelling its clear he loves this tool hence why he frequently deploys it theres a comfort and reliability helping him to articulate the abundance of ideas in his mind but like observing the pattern as fringe fans would say often it comes across as an imitation that finds itself making questionable decisions rather than entertain something uniquely substantial with this established safety net it allows him a template to help sell the concept and introduce or reintroduce his characters to respond to its mystery the overriding question that loomed over the rise of skywalker is whether he could finish something he started always finding himself in a position where he leaves before a projects completion  nostalgia may serve a purpose like playing a spotify greatest hits collection but depending on its execution it can also leave one feeling  emptiness its like playing a video game with all of its cheat codes turned on yes it is fun for a while and yes you get its immediate satisfaction but somehow youre left with the legacy feeling of nothing to engage from in the case of watching super 8 i wanted to go home and watch a spielberg film rather than rewatch super 8 the rise of skywalker falls into that same distinct trap the rise of skywalker showcases the best and utmost worst of jj abrams work generic stale unfinished and lopsided  sure its energetic and unapologetically visceral but its breakneck speed for pacing can be summed up in poe dameron oscar isaac rapidly jumping to lightspeed to find his way out of trouble in the millennium falcon knowing the famous ship cant handle that kind of intensity as if to cover over the flaws from jj abrams and chris terrios script through its sheer velocity we have no sense of what planets city or perspective in its blink and youll miss it overture  the sheer nature of the move is gungho reckless and brazen as you would expect from the director but also presents a discombobulating sensation that youve bingewatched the entirety of game of thrones in a day with the fast forward speed of 10x obviously not possible but you get the gist of the idea its easy to boil this down as if you loved the last jedi youre gonna hate this argument and vice versa  that argument is far too simple for something generational subjective and far more complicated than most people will recognise  irrespective of whether you enjoyed rian johnsons metacommentary experiment on the last jedi or not the hindsight reality is that it took risks risks the franchise needed to ask itself about its legacy and its subsequent role in its history  the ultimate failure from the rise of skywalker falls on its basic principles of storytelling where character arcs from its opening crawl and previous films are left in the deserted wastelands of tatooine where dialogue is replaced by heavy doses of exposition and characters shoehorned into cameo appearances that end up feeling like a reunion party than functioning as an integral part of the plot  theres an adage of no one hates star wars more than star wars fans and yet what the rise of skywalker does is hand the keys over to a vocal minority by excessively pandering to their satisfaction  it plays the game of having your cake and eating it too trying to restore the balance as the franchise has always lived up to  but in doing so the rise of skywalker not only validates their opinions but sacrifices its own artistic voice where its merits are never earned and its dramatic beats are carelessly rushed through leaving it soulless and hollow  the euphoria behind star wars should never leave you like this and the rise of skywalker was fan service at its worst i want to vehemently stress that there is nothing wrong with nostalgia and fan service as mentioned in my article about nostalgia i talk about how it places itself in a difficult quandary of appeasement and yet ryan cooglers creed for example has utilised it better than most films would imagine  in its myriad of options in its conversations about legacy it offers the audience something that makes every signifying moment worthwhile  substance in another classic example its something that netflixs stranger things does so well where our emotional connection to the past is defined by our personal experiences rather than the kids themselves theyre living in the era oblivious of its significance and not as most films do including the rise of skywalker occasionally stop the film to acknowledge it and as if lessons werent learnt from jjs previous experience such as star trek into darkness then he understands the architectural mechanisms behind nostalgia but not the reasons why that moment resonates so deeply and judging by his brand of filmmaking a trait which ive seen far too often the nostalgia is only used as an effective means to an end to get from point a to b and nothing more  its fine as a setup  what the force awakens accomplishes manages to restore faith in the aftermath of the prequel trilogy  but as a conclusion it deserved something far richer than proposed instead of the persistent return down memory lane thats continually seeking validation and vindication  not even the brilliant john williams and his score can escape the callbacks to the past but heartbreakingly so while the situation cant be blamed solely on abrams returning in a nearimpossible situation after the vitriolic backlash from the last jedi but the rise of skywalker painfully confirms the lack of planning between the arcs im willing to be controversial in saying johnson had the most difficult task of the tenure picking up the pieces from the scattergun approach left after the force awakens by contextualising the franchises bigger picture but the unifying statement left in the aftermath by the rise of skywalker is the feeling of it doesnt matter undoing some of the most interesting aspects of the franchise like a damage control exercise that wb utilised after batman v superman which produced suicide squad in its aftermath but its most disappointing aspect is the genuine lack of stakes ambition or risks with its fakeouts and sacrificial undoing which only cheapen the experience  and as a consequence it leaves the franchise in an undesirable place a place defined by the safety of creature comforts familiarity and convenience that serves only to make the universe smaller again  of course change is a gamble but judging on this effort its the realisation that the franchise is happy to stick with the status quo and allow for history to repeat itself and instead of confronting the challenges headon it decides to not pick up the baton and finish the marathon that apt feeling is summed up by rey daisy ridley a character who spent the last two films redefining her identity a film in which the last jedi conveyed lineage was not important in defining who you are only to be told the opposite  some would easily say its a technicality some would say its a complete retcon that rolls back on the intentions laid out by rian johnson and some would easily say abrams was merely fixing a mess by giving its audience a direct sequel to the force awakens  but the rise of skywalker spends the majority of the film reemphasising the same point about who she is in the context of the franchise the sad thing about reys ultimate fate is how she already started from a position of power by being a noone a new succession of forcesensitive jedis opens the doors to new possibilities its not defined by blood or some royal right or some easily convenient connection within an already convoluted legacy that happens to be problematically tied to that galaxy far far away its the inspirational takeaway that anyone can be a hero rising out of nothing in the epic struggle between good and evil and yet the connection towards lineage with the reassertion of a major character only asks more questions than answers theres an element of spectre the 24th bond film in its deflating reveal but even if this was the intention all along to have rey mythically connect with the previous eight films then this parental conflict that should have been addressed right from the beginning  it would have allowed more time with rey to come to terms with the revelation instead of what the film does repeatedly  have her run to different planets with speed and haste it would have been in the same pretence at how brie larsons captain marvel for example was imbued with the same choice after learning her secret  captain marvel is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination which i actively discuss in my review but at least its an attempt to codify her origins with a choice that bravely moves it forward  its not to say these elements did not feature in the rise of skywalker but its execution is clumsy and rushed explained through tiresome lines of exposition that expect us to feel a sense of emotional shock at the revelation when its depth is shallow at best the fact remains pretty much every character suffers from the films choppy and hasty editing and execution  the rise of skywalker is more concerned with getting over the next hurdle introducing the next clue to get to this mystery rather than spend time with the characters it possesses or introduces and trust me there are plenty in its convoluted equation including the return of lando billy dee williams and keri russells daft punk looking zorri  and by doing so it sacrifices what has been the heart and soul of these films  character and growth character development is fueled by reactions rather than the choices theyve made we get to see finn john boyega and poe spend more time together but even the exchanges feel disjointed and somewhat regressive with most of their bromance moments connected with wouldnt it be cool moments  but the most disheartening was rose tico kelly marie tran who is shamefully sidelined for what i can only imagine as capitulation and cowardice to an abusive fandom rather giving her character something meaningful to do i would have preferred the rise of skywalker to be the length of avengers endgame and the irishman  call it indulgence or being spoiled after 2019 gave us a succession of 3hour epics  but if the length was an option to convey some of its story without the feeling of being like a meaningless blur then its a luxury i would have happily endured  it wouldnt have solved all of its fundamental and stalemate problems but it would have been easier to digest and i get it endings are hard and writing one is extremely hard not even revenge of the sith could accomplish it  im not even going to pretend i have the perfect ironfisted resolution that neatly ties up a 42year old saga  im not going to pretend i have a respectable path of utilising general leia after the tragic death of carrie always loved and always missed fisher  and unquestionably im not going to pretend i have a dignified approach to unite an already divided fandom that has been long bickering about the franchise since the release of the empire strikes back  for every generation star wars has meant something different to someone  in essence loving star wars can be a religion  george lucas our creator in saviour gave us this world and each of us has taken what we believe is the best part consuming canonical or noncanonical books media video games and pretty much anything we fans can get our hands on shaping our perspective on the franchise our introduction has no universal or centralised means of entry in comparison to how we all started getting into the marvel cinematic universe for example with iron man but based on that reality it is something that cannot be appeased no matter how good its intentions are and the film caves into that idea by believing it can throughout popular culture even something as prestigious as game of thrones struggled with it earlier this year   the xfiles during its twoseason return struggled trying to balance out the mythology of the past with the context of the present within a short span of episodes which was not enough heck in another context even star trek discovery bowed down to familiarity of its past fakeout deaths and introduced the worst storyline concept for season 2  time crystals the less said the better  but again returning to the basic plots of filmmaking as an isolated standalone film its the sheer lack of creativity and ambition that severely hurts its wasted potential  it is as jarring as the recent addition of maclunky in the new versions of a new hope on disney for an already contentious scene  and in its desperate attempt to win everyone over you end up watching a film thats having a constant argument with itself settling on a marked checklist of requirements and targets to include as if decided by a committee i dont necessarily believe jj abrams is a bad director the fun he manages to encapsulate is above the qualities of the prequel trilogy some of the best moments come as visual statements such as kylo ren adam driver and rey having a force projection conversation as the camera swap between their thoughts and location  as the return of the jedi in the franchise the rebalance of the force was inevitable its simplistic storytelling if somewhat predictable  but in the immortal words of yoda with his masterful quote of we are what we grow beyond that piece of advice wasnt adhered to  its a film thats big on spectacle but leaves nothing for audiences to take away from does this film derail my love of the franchise no for over 30 years of my life these stories have defined me from the mythology to pure escapist unadulterated entertainment regardless of whether anyone thinks its just a kids movie about space wizards  and on the contrary im still looking forward to the new trilogy a trilogy not defined by the legacy of the past but something that explores the universe instead of relying on bloodlines dynasties and keeping everything in the family there is no sense of enjoyment or pleasure if the same storylines are endlessly rehashed and repurposed when the possibilities are endless  all it takes is a little imagination and creativity which the rise of skywalker openly rejects if you enjoyed the rise of skywalker for what it is then all power to you  your happiness should never be defined by what others say including myself who is happy to be in the minority with my opinions  but like all legacies time will be its ultimate decider and whether we return to the rise of skywalker with the same energetic verve as previous films will be a fascinating and hopefully civil debate for years to come  but ultimately its a film that tried too hard and ends up utilising every kitchen sink trick to make this film whole but in my humblest opinion it is by far the weakest out of the new trilogy and what should have been a triumphant end to the saga the rise of skywalker just ends in bitter disappointment i actually loved both this movie and the last jedi but i also love hearing alternate takes im always fascinated by how these movies impact us all differently im glad you enjoyed it as mentioned all power to you but i thought it was let down that made way too many convenient choices and topped it up with massive doses of fan service which is not a great way to make a movie this is not just a tros problem this is something that has been evident for a long time with jj and this film imo showed up his weakness as a director hes great at ideas but the execution or concluding them just has no value he just doesnt know how to end it i enjoyed rise of skywalker the duel between kylo ren and rey was action packed for sure yet i reluctantly agree with this review it did leave out a lot of answers us star wars fans so desperately need heck if it wasnt for the toxic fanboys berating rian johnson for supposedly ruining the franchise and carrie fishers passing disney could have made star wars great again i guess some things are only great once if there were to be a series where rey revives the jedi order thats the least disney owes us or would the high republic fit that category
Jul 4 2020,negative,so much thrown at you with so little character reaction that it feels more like fanfiction
Jun 27 2020,positive, a year after the devastating battle of crait the rebels have been rebuilding and trying to decide their next move under leias tutelage rey daisy ridley has been busy training to hone her jedi skills meanwhile kylo ren adam driver has been on his own quest to find the sith planet of exegol what he finds there sets him on a new much more sinister path word gets back to the rebels of kylos discovery and rey poe dameron oscar isaac finn john boyega chewbacca bb8 and c3po journey to find their own way to exegol and stop what has been unleashed its an odyssey that will test them all especially rey who will learn who she really is as a jediand a person the rise of skywalker does a fantastic job of wrapping up this branch of one of the most popular and influential franchises in the history of entertainment it is exciting actionpacked visually impressive lightly humorous and poignantly emotional in short everything you hope a star wars film would be sitting back down in the directors chair is jj abrams he has the rather daunting undertaking of pulling together all of the threads both he and rian johnson have laid out over two films not an easy task because they along with george lucas through his previous involvement have been weaving a very detailed tapestry yet amazingly abrams completes the task with flying colors he has developed a rather simpler script compared to the complexities johnson delivered in his universeexpanding entry theres a very straightforward goal and everything moves toward it as he did with the force awakens abrams borrows bits and pieces from a new hope not nearly as much this goaround but youll recognize them when they occur he also as he did a few times before plays on our nostalgia through clever moments and audiovisual cues he pays off our dedicated fandom with scenes that tug at the heartstrings and fog up the eyes of course as the last jedi proved not everyone is going to be satisfied you know what thats ok thats the danger when creating something within a universe with a highly zealous fanbase many different people have many different connections to this material and they have many different ideas on how the story should go i myself have a very deep connection to this saga i was threeyearsold in the summer of 1977 and star wars is the first movie i remember seeing in theaters i have a wonderful family memory about going to the first show opening day of empire i can distinctly remember the feeling of tapping the action figure packages aside to see if there was one toward the back of a row that i needed suffice it to say with many more memories such as these this franchise means a great deal to me ive mentioned before in reviews that my first question walking out of an auditorium is was i entertained no matter the style or genre the purpose of film is entertainment was i entertained by the force awakens yes was i entertained by the last jedi yes the same holds true for the rise of skywalker too so if someone like me someone whose entire life has been influenced in some part by lucas creation was genuinely entertained by this film and honestly satisfied by its outcome then what else do you need hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites
Jun 17 2020,neutral,its like jj abrams missed the day of scriptwriting school when they taught show dont tell
Jun 10 2020,negative, and so we return one final time to the skywalker family after star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker we are told there will be no more stories told about the spawn of darth vader and their various friends spawn and acolytes with this i officially lose interest in the star wars franchise even back in 1983 when i thought star wars was over i couldnt find any hunger for the comics or the expanded universe novels or any of the other things lucasfilm devised to keep the brand a going concern until george lucas revisited the saga sixteen years later so the multimedia joseph campbell rewrite will have to chug along without me  this last goround neither disappointed nor thrilled me it just exists theres always something going on and thats part of the problem theres never not something going on no pause for breath no beauty or poetry we aint got time for that now the final order a bunch of bad guys led by the big bad guy the resurgent emperor palpatine plans to subjugate or destroy every planet everywhere the good guys leap to the rescue  identitycrisis jedi in training rey daisy ridley rash pilot poe oscar isaac former stormtrooper finn john boyega meanwhile goodbad guy kylo ren adam driver wants to save rey from palpatine his deal is as tangled as ever   some thematic relevance could be teased out of the previous entries the force awakens 2015 and the last jedi 2017 the latter which i consider the best of the new trilogy dripped some poison into the ears of the faithful luke skywalker mark hamill like achilles renounced the heroic code he literally tossed his lightsaber over his shoulder in disgust well well have none of that now not with nonentity jj abrams who made the first of the sequel trilogy at the helm abrams insight seems to be that the fans want endless lightsaber duels and shootouts and spacecraft looping around some of the action has a shoottheworks electricity but the special effects are as hectic busy and essentially insecure as anything in lucas prequel trilogy abrams strains so hard not to lose our attention that through sheer narrative vehemence he loses it anyway  there are some pleasures i felt it would be churlish to try to make out the seams in carrie fishers performance  cobbled together from unused footage  as general leia i was grateful for however much the moviemakers could give me of her billy dee williams as the returning lando calrissian comes through with a suave turn that helps to remind us that acting was once possible in these things adam driver just about sprains himself trying to make something real out of kylo rens nightmares of conscience but he did better under the tutelage of rian johnson a real director on the last jedi the young trinity of new stars sprint this way and that hopping from world to world in search of a mcguffin called the wayfinder that will lead them to the lair of palpatine this dark emperor is as boringly eeeeeevil as ever and his connection to one of the heroes feels underdone as if abrams and his writers were wincing and hoping the parallels to a similar revelation in the empire strikes back wouldnt strike us as too blatant  were frequently reminded of the stakes  this needs to happen or the bad guys will be very bad and everyone will die  yet the demands of fantasy on this budgetary level guarantee there are no real stakes people die but come back one way or another the total outcome is never in doubt here and there a bit of business tugs at the old nostalgic feelings or packs a sidewise punch daisy ridleys teardrop falling on carrie fishers or a doubles shoulder a droid cowed by past abuse who declines a humans touch with a prim but slightly panicked no thank you even old luke returns as a force ghost reassuring rey and us that he was wrong and its important for good to stand up to evil that point is made here in the most generic of ways it doesnt risk resonating with the world we live in which even lucas goofball prequels at least tried to do that muchderided deathstick bit in attack of the clones for instance at least tried to engage with human frailty outside the franchise albeit in a laughable dad way nothing like that here
Apr 15 2020,negative, it truly was a long time ago and a galaxy far far away when star wars was seen as not much more than a risky venture doomed to box office failure but in 1977 fox executives thought just that director george lucas seen as someone who was rebelling against the traditional modes of hollywood filmmaking had made a homage to the cheap and cheerful flash gordon serials with an overwrought space opera that would surely be laughing the only people laughing would be lucas and his accountants as star wars caught the public imagination and the films and its two sequels became the biggest hits of the early 80s by the time of the prequel trilogy in 1999 lucas was no longer a hollywood rebel he was a member of the establishment the head of a franchise that had made a huge impact on popular culture and had spawned numerous ancillary products such as cartoon shows books video games and much more the prequel trilogy would often be critically derided but were still huge moneymakers and solidified star wars status as one of the dominant franchises in cinema by the time the final sequel trilogy rolled around circumstances had changed again lucas was shut out having sold up to disney he often complaining that disney were no longer taking on board any of his ideas in the manner a divorced dad frustrated he has no say in how his child does their homework star wars was now the property of perhaps the biggest media conglomerate in the world and now alongside marvel the symbol of dominance within not only hollywood cinema but also within mainstream pop culture star wars episode ix  the rise of skywalker is ostensibly meant to represent an end to the narrative that lucas began in 1977 yet whilst it is undoubtedly a farewell to the plots and characters introduced all those years ago the film is also a reflection of the modern film industry that it has helped to create with all the excess and disregard for individual artistic expression that one has come to associate with the modern era the end result is less a film and more a series of moments strung together to please a cabal of corporate overlords the warning signs are apparent from the very first few seconds in the films opening crawl the now de rigeur block of text that allows the film to begin in media res the dead live it proclaims with such a disregard for any sort of semblance of credibility that it so resembles a donald trump tweet that you halfexpect it to finish with an epithet of sad instead it and the following five minute opening of the film are a massive dump of exposition that reveals that emperor palpatine is alive and is back to terrorise the galaxy and is now asking kylo ren adam driver to find rey daisy ridley and kill her theres been no narrative seeding throughout the previous two films that have prepared for this moment no hints that his character survived the fact of which also undermines much of the ending of return of the jedi with a handwaving moment in which various bits about cloning and dark magic are uttered the ultimate reason hes brought back is well because its not the last time in the film where you can swear you hear the incessant interference of executives humming throughout the background hes a recognisable character  lets bring him back doesnt matter why fans know who he is theres a constant need to satiate an audience with nostalgia such as the appearance of billy dee williams as original trilogy character lando calrissian in another move that seems to amount to a shoulder shrug of why not and flashy visual effects than make any attempt to create something narratively cohesive indeed much of the movie can be boiled down to a series of tedious exposition moments and then sending the characters to search for a macguffin which seems nothing more than a reason to keep the screen time up and give the characters something to do until the inevitable climax indeed one of the major points of the movie is the quest for the wayfinder basically a magic compass that will allow them to find the emperor after much flitting around the galaxy and through the ruins of the death star in another moment that screams look nostalgic moment now stop thinking anything critical its destroyed luckily rey finds another one in about five minutes rendering the previous hour pretty much pointless the films lazy trading on nostalgia bleeds into the constant threat of killing of some of the known characters it never does it would be a much more interesting film if it did and just gives an air of cheap emotion chewbacca is seemingly blown up and brought back within two minutes c3p0 is given a moment of sacrifice which is immediately played for laughs and then reversed a little while later princess leias demise is handled as well as it could be considering carrie fishers sad death in 2016 but even the scenes in which she appears filmed some years previously are awkwardly edited and her final moments are more shaped by the tragedy of real life than any attempt to make it work on a narrative level the film so desperately wants to be a conclusion and to have some sort of closure but we know that therell be a world of spinoffs and stories to be continued in cinema on tv and in a litany of other media so the film ends up in a sort of limbo land where there is no sense of consequence or meaning everything has to happen so the rest of the star wars universe can continue to happen as well you can bet a moment in which the protagonists meet a group of stormtrooper deserters which again is thrown away in a few lines is being developed as a future filmtv showvideo gamecomic as we speak there is no time to explore or reflect lets just move on with any form of narrative consequence effectively neutered the characters are given nowhere to really go while kylo ren actor adam driver and rey actress daisy ridley are given something of a character arc mainly thanks to the first two films in the trilogy their performances are still rather one note ridley is stoic to the point of being dislikeable while drivers conflicted villain still drifts towards the realm of idiot manbaby though his ability as an actor just about stops it from tipping over the edge everyone else is given little to work with oscar isaacs poe dameron just jumps around being roguish john boyegas finn is given little to do apart from look troubled while rose tico actress kelly marie tran one of the more interesting characters from the previous instalment is given around one minutes worth of screen time the irony is that on a technical level jj abrams has a steady hand when it comes to catering for the needs of a blockbuster and when it comes to all the requisite whizzes and bangs the film delivers on a visceral level from the fleet of worldkilling star destroyers to the final battle which includes space horses on one level a homage to the elements of the western including in the original film and on another almost a satirical bone thrown to the constant need to one up previous instalments it all delivers but everything that hangs around is so threadbare so unsatisfying that it feels hollow laurence boyce is a film journalist who likes bond batman and doctor who just to prove the things he enjoys things that dont just start with a b he is also a film programmer for various film festivals in the uk and abroad its too bad you cant enjoy a great movie because of your need to have everything be logical i believe in the importance of everything being logical in the real world such as politics logical and truth being the opposite of trump but in a movie i just want to suspend belief and just enjoy the fantasy i loved seeing all the dead come beach to life and yes i often similed and thought what the fuc but it was so much fun that logic be damned i not a star wars fanatic and i loved some of the previous star wars movies and was disappointed but still enjoyed others but i was wowed but rise of skywalker and thought it was the best movie ive see in a long time i hope your bad review wont keep anyone who enjoys fantasy si fi from watching this movie i had low expectations and put off watching rise for a while and was surprised at what a great way to end a great story absolutely loved it note commissions can be earned from some of the links on this page

Apr 14 2020,neutral,the way abrams and terrios script wrap up the entire skywalker saga in this final chapter of star wars sequel trilogy left me both baffled and yes a mixed feeling
Apr 8 2020,positive,a scifi action movie that proudly waves its spiritual and religious flag in its approach to a good v evil storyline as it was in the beginning and forever shall be
Apr 1 2020,positive,when watched with your brain turned off star wars the rise of skywalker is an entertaining and actionpacked thrill ride
Mar 22 2020,positive,daisy ridley and adam driver have both honed their individual characters and chemistry to a very strong place and their scenes together are easily the strongest in the film
Mar 13 2020,negative,it is trying to accomplish a lot because it has to tie up every plotline it has to involve every character it has to has to take you to every planet and so in trying to cram in all of that it feels very cursory and very rushed
Feb 24 2020,negative, whether youre standing in the theater lobby or curled up in bed deciding what to watch next is often the most difficult part of any popculture junkies day and with dozens of films in theaters on any given weekend plus virtually endless layers of streaming purgatory to sort through in search of your next bingewatch theres more out thereand tougher decisions to makethan ever fortunes here to help you navigate the weeks latest offerings boiling all the entertainment out there down into three distinct recommendations should you see it stream it or skip it find out below what you have to understand about cats is that its certifiably insane from its jellicle whiskers to the tip of its jellice tail im referring here to the beloved andrew lloyd webber stage musical one of broadways longestrunning as much as tom hoopers gleefully demented movie adaptation from day one cats has been one of the strangest megahits in any storytelling medium its necessary to know this and accept this before reading any further  describing the plot of cats makes you feel like youre on bath salts though not as much as does seeing it play out on screen but the broad strokes are essentially this over the course of one night in an unnamed eerily empty neighborhood a group of cats take turns introducing one anotherwith names like rum tum tugger and mr mistoffeeleesas they debate which one of them will get to die ascending to another plane of existence known as the heaviside layer where theyll be reborn into a new life as a story its pure fever dream the kind of thing even roald dahls editor wouldnt have let him get away with but the strange nonplot of cats functions in a theatrical setting as an ideal delivery system for visual splendor and powerhouse vocals hoopers tackled musicals before notably in 2012s les miserables where he spent 158 minutes on extreme closeups of frances most impoverished and he fully throws himself into the task of translating cats a much more experimental piece of work to the screen theres a newly created audience surrogate victoria newcomer francesca hayward whos tossed via burlap sack into the neighborhood of the jellicles a tribe of cats on the eve of making their jellicle choice across the sungthrough story she meets a mewling menagerie of contenders for said choice including bumbling jennyanydots rebel wilson stately gus the theatre cat ian mckellen and portly bustopher jones james corden plus the aforementioned mistoffeelees a gawky laurie davidson and rum tum tugger jason derulo who sings and simpers gamely but seems to be missing a little something presiding over all is old deuteronomy judi dench and no i dont know who named these cats wholl enjoy the festivities then select the lucky  feline in question  the real draw of cats involves seeing the allstar cast which also includes pop sovereign taylor swift and vocal legend jennifer hudson who gets to belt out memory the productions lone showstopper made over with the help of cg effects called digital fur technology though its basically just expensive deepfakery into cathuman hybrids the effect is deeply upsetting though the actors are covered in fur and sporting twitchy tails their proportions are still human so the actors appear discomfitingly sensual while dancing and serenading one another they have cat ears but also human teeth whiskers but also fingernails some wear jumpsuits while others go for a more pawnaturel look the movie directs attention to the strange sense of fauxnudity that results by having idris elbas villainous macavity wear a hat and fur coat which begs questions we shouldnt dare to ask but later make a surprise scene entrance after disrobing to which the other cats react with a fairly hypocritical degree of horror  in watching this digital fur extravaganza at work entranced by the sheer scale of its visual chaos i found myself wondering what else hooper and his team could have done the tactic most employed by disney the imperial overlord universals bravely going up against with this freaky little musical note this weeks skip it has been to pursue photorealism in its animated productions earlier this year it turned the lion king into an uncannyvalley catastrophe sapping the story of all emotional and dramatic resonance in the process people simply did not want to hear human voices coming out of the mouths of planet earth lions which is very understandable hoopers techniques with cats through which his furry creations sing and dance maniacally into their versions of heaven or hell bring the whole affair closer to gaspar noes climax by way of the aristocats while cats is by no means going to be a guaranteed hit with the little ones who may be terrified by it or confused by its sexuality its an absolutely unhinged piece of blockbuster filmmaking worth beholding in all its tawdry queer bombastic glory  its the kind of risk studios just dont take any more perhaps much more of one than executives ever intended it to be the film cost some 100 million to pull off and the amount of uncertainty cats brings with it into the multiplexdid those ohmygodtheyactuallydidit trailers turn people off or the oppositemakes it the most exciting boxoffice curiosity left in the calendar year will it break records or bomb the experience of watching catshowls of stunned laughter from many with a few swifties cheering her grand entrance and the majority of us struggling to even once pick our jaws up off the flooris one of the most strange and mindmelting youre likely to have in a theater when it comes to studio content of this size and scope id recommend going for much for the same reason the plays stuck around so longwhether its a masterpiece or one of the worst things youve ever seen its resolutely its own thing a deranged freakfantasia worth falling into for a couple of hours if just to say you did that is to say its cats netflixs latest originalseries gamble is aiming for game of throneslevel complexity in its sketching of a darkfantasy realm where mythical creatures lie in wait but monarchal power struggles loom just as large  and based on its first season the witcher adapted from the beloved book series by polish writer andrzej sapkowski is well on its way comprising eight episodes a smaller number which clearly allowed showrunner lauren schmidt hissrich to focus on thoughtfully tracing an ambitious array of story arcs the series hangs around the impossibly broad shoulders of geralt of rivia henry cavill great at veining these strongandsilent types with a gallows humor  further detailing the epic sweeping nature of the witchers story would be to deprive audiences of unexpected rather graceful reveals that the scripts tease out in due time what there is to say about the witcher is that it represents one of netflixs most fully formed forays into genre territory yet the fights especially in a cinematic and sprawling pilot are of a kinetic and impressively topshelf variety cavills geralt moving like a man possessed as he rends flesh from bone and engages in some surprisingly balletic bouts of swordplay and the production design is similarly wellexecuted quickly establishing the continent as a grungy bloody landscape for these characters to navigate but its the strength of the storytelling that bodes most well for the witcher as a new destination for those done licking their wounds after that fateful final run in westeros  if this mission fails it was all for nothing characters tell one another throughout star wars the rise of skywalker thats popcornprose concentrate the kind of dramatic hyperbole that star wars has been coasting on since the very beginning and while its traditionally been a fakeouttheres always another mission another battle to be won even after ones that end with your hero encased in carbonitesuch sentiment has never felt as profoundly hollowed out as it does by the end of rise of skywalker a graceless franchise finale about nothing more than missions succeeding that itself feels like a staggering failure of vision conceptually as well as on basic storytelling fronts director jj abrams anxiety in making rise of skywalker surely fell along those same allornothing lines by his own admission hes bad at endings and there was tremendous pressure riding on abrams to bring home the story of the skywalker clan a ninemovie saga thats never loomed larger in the pop cultural imagination the rise of skywalker may well be the last star wars movie to feature the heroes abrams helped forge in his nostalgic the force awakensrey daisy ridley finn john boyega and poe oscar isaacand its almost certain to be the final outing for original cast members the series is now starting to outlive carrie fisher died after shooting her scenes for the last jedi and this entry once intended to be leias movie in the sense that the force awakens was hans and the last jedi was lukes is to be her last screen credit this just makes the magnitude of abramss failure all the more devastating one last adventure hardly in a pivotal entry for the franchise he chooses not to tell a story instead drowning the developments this trilogys second film put forward in a soupy mess of fan service and stilted unoriginal plotting when the last jedi hit theaters two years ago it offered a thematic depth hitherto unseen in star wars movies in the hands of writerdirector rian johnson it tangled headon with questions of hero worship and inheritance that have always been intrinsic to the galaxy far far away but the answers it providedthat one must relinquish the past to chart a future that our heroes will disappoint us that the force is not the lineage of a select but a spiritual energy belonging to all of uswere bold and unexpected in this it was a shocking followup to the force awakens abrams playthehits remake of a new hope and ruffled feathers with a small but loud contingent of fans who disliked the films treatment of luke and focus on supporting characters the most hated of whom perhaps not coincidentally given the way these internet mobs tend to go were women and minorities  this is worth mentioning because the rise of skywalker feels more than a film like a featurelength capitulation to those who disliked what the last jedi did with the star wars mythos which was at the end of the day to make a real movie with it where the last jedi zagged rise of skywalker zigs choppily back inside the preexisting template to which disney and lucasfilm clearly now believes these movies must adhere it is in fact comical how frantically it rushes to undo johnsons progression of these characters crowding them unnaturally into the same space to combat criticisms everyone spent too much time apart in the last film and entirely sidelining rose tico kelly marie tran the series first asianamerican lead who was brutally harassed online after the last jedi with so little explanation it feels just as racist and sexist as the chatroom vitriol she was subjected to the rise of skywalker also works overtime to retcon the last jedis biggest twists one deformed bad guy with force powers is down for the count lets introduce another the question of reys parentage got answered unexpectedly with the revelation her family name didnt have to matter so much well lets revisit that actually thats truly the order of business in the rise of skywalker its a movie slavishly devoted to hitting beats from previous films without basic narrative sense to the point where it feels less like a natural ending to this franchise and more like bad fanfiction the only way the characters progress is through illadvised romantic pairings one interminable and ultimately pointless lightsaber battle takes place amid in the wreckage of a destroyed death star the finale involves outgunned resistance fighters making one last stand to blow up a massive badguy space base beloved characters are imperiled constantly but there are no real stakes when even the alreadydead ones are back for sizable roles familiar desert planets pop up along with lando calrissian billy dee williams for maximum fan pandering theres a real difference between a director and an artist and nothing demonstrates this better than the massive step down the rise of skywalker takes both thematically and visually after the last jedi theres little by way of distinctive or striking visuals the entire film is hued a murky blue with an illadvised focus on strobe lighting furthermore its a star wars movie with absolutely nothing under its surface which is a damning trait for a movie in this franchise abrams is a great producer but his weaknesses as a filmmaker have never been this exposed in attempting to give a noxious portion of the star wars fanbase what they asked for his finale feels like a cheap and derivative product the ultimate endresult of disneys writtenbycommittee modus operandi so craven about resurrecting star wars that it comes off like graverobbing this is star wars broken under the weight of its own importance eating its own tail for lack of any original voices to better nourish it its nothing short of a tragedy why these highprofile book adaptations bombed at the box office in 2019tis the season for holiday moviesand hallmark and

Jan 20 2020,negative, so im a little late with this review its been really hard to find the time but with copious amounts of notes from the night i watched it combined with a couple of weeks to let everything settle means this will probably be a bit more calm and gathered than my immediately postcinema review of episode viii from two years ago episode ix was well exactly what i feared more jj abrams sticking far too rigidly to the original trilogy it wasnt without good moments but it wasnt a great follow up to the interesting ground work done beforehand lets take a closer look the core trio of rey daisy ridley finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac are now a fullyfledged friend group and all play off of each other well an exchange where poe is outed as a former spice runner only for him to point out that hes talking to a former storm  trooper and an exscavenger made me laugh and generally they have great chemistry which is good because theyre joined at the hip for most of the film c3p0 anthony daniels is also with them for a lot of this and for the first time since empire is actually really funny with everyone generally ignoring him and treating him like crap sounds harsh but it works then c3p0 has his memory wiped in order for everyone to access information to the emperors whereabouts and that also leads to a lot of funny lines he gets his memory restored later in the film which is a bit of a cop out but fine nothing major the other standout is once again adam drivers supreme leader kylo ren  ben solo ignoring that all his character development of becoming his own man and freeing himself of the past being abandoned by having him immediately serve under the emperor and reforge his darth vaderlike helmet he has some great scenes in particular the big fight with rey where he is wounded but healed by the young jedi after he was distracted by hearing his mothers voice leading to a hallucination conversation with his father revealing that he never quite got over killing him kylo ren finally discards his dark self and becomes ben solo and at the end even has some lighthearted moments as he takes out his former allies and helps rey while i didnt like the idea of bringing him back and it certainly seems like it was solely because mr abrams didnt know how to finish a star wars story without a dark overlord character ian mcdiarmid was undeniably still great fun as the overthetop scenerychewing emperor the utter overevilness of some of his scenes did put a smile on my face even if in the back of my mind i was wondering if theyd ever actually bother to explain how he came back to life they didnt other characters like poes old friend in a cool helmet zorii bliss keri russell and the returning lando calrissian billy dee williams fill out a really fun cast as for moments well there are some good teases here and there on tatooinelikeplanet 400 rey and kylo both try and pull an escaping ship which ends up with rey exhibiting force lightning which was a good moment and the aforementioned final fight between rey and ren on the ruins of the death star ii was also good during the final fight between rey and kylo against the emperor there is a moment where all hope seems lost before lando arrives with a large armada of rebel vessels which was a very cool moment and well scored to make it feel like a real triumphant moment so close to release there were no good shots of the emperor so thisll have to do hes sitting in the chair to the left honest the rebels are assaulting a group of weapons that can destroy planets but need to wait for a ground team to destroy a radar before they can destroy them during this time our lead protagonist is facing off with the emperor but is losing and is being told to join the dark side as the only way to save her allies in the space battle soon the ground team is successful and the rebels begin taking down the weapons as the emperor is eventually killed thanks to the help of our protagonists former enemy who although he ends up dead is redeemed for his evil deeds in death the weapons destroyed and the emperor defeated loads of planets around the galaxy celebrate replace weapons with weapon and her allies with his allies and thats a description of the end to return of the jedi i mean bringing back the emperor and undoing kylos character development was one thing but jj really couldnt come up with something even slightly new for an ending speaking of undoing development its revealed that rey is actually somehow emperor palpatines granddaughter and kylos revelation of rey being a nobody from episode viii was still true because her parents pretended to be nobodies to protect her so the refreshing you dont have to come from one of the previous families to be special message was erased and replaced with things tied to the original trilogy are cool great at the last moments of the film rey adopts the surname skywalker so even that name isnt gone the end of the skywalker saga could well still result in skywalkers in future films even if they wont be related by blood to luke anakin et al speaking of chewbacca the final scene included him receiving a medal like the one he infamously didnt receive at the end of the first movie and while that got a chuckle out of me it also immediately pulled me out of the film why would leia wait until she was dead to give it to him she wouldnt and in fact in the expanded media she didnt it was written to pop longtime fans without a single thought as to whether it would make sense or not which is the wrong way to do fanwank much like most of this film lastly the emperor reveals a massive armada of star destroyers all manned with people loyal to him and the ways of the sith multiplying the first order by thousandsfold and still jj abrams had to add in that the new fleet are armed with planetdestroying superweapons come on the massive new fleet of ships and hundreds and thousands of new troops was threat enough there was no need to add in a scene where one of these new star destroyers wipe out a planet i went to a bjs right afterwards the meal was disappointingly mediocre just like the movie that said i did like the scene where harrison ford cameos it was a genuine surprise and quite moving

Jan 16 2020,negative, in the ninth installment of the star wars saga the rise of skywalker rey the most recent hero and kylo ren who is both reys nemesis and soul mate transfer lightsabers in a crucial battle many small moments throughout the film have paved the way materially and spiritually for this sleight of hand and when it happens it is both obvious and breathtaking it is an exhilarating vision of what could have been in an alternate universe for a moment we see that this moment of alliance is not the result of bloodlines and superior genetics or of there being born heroes and born villains but the product of subtle free human choices for a moment the film appears to see beyond the tired tropes and family dramas it has so relentlessly pursued the moment doesnt last the rise of skywalker picks up where the last jedi left off kylo ren son of leia and han solo nephew of luke skywalker and grandson of anakin skywalkerdarth vader has killed his way to the position of supreme leader of the imperial first order rey who shares a mysterious bond with kylo that allows them to communicate across time and space is trying to complete her jedi training and race kylo to the hidden planet of the sith as in all star wars movies a small band of poorly resourced resistance fighters tries to defeat the imperial power against crushing odds and threats of impossible weapons as rey and her comrades zip across the galaxy they meet new allies and many many old characters who show up for final goodbyes they outwit foes attempt daring rescues and face nearcertain destruction with witty dialogue and sincere camaraderie they are a compelling band of friends with whom to face the end of the world but the real focus of the movie is the relationship between rey and kylo this article is available to christian century magazine subscribers only to keep reading subscribesubscriptions begin at 695or log in thank you for supporting our publishing ministry
Jan 16 2020,positive,but in between all of the galaxyhopping and doodadhunting theres some great star wars here this trilogy has been at its most effective when exploring the skywalker legacy and rise of skywalker continues that trend
Jan 15 2020,negative,the first half of it just feels unnecessary with lots of wheelspinning and then the second half is just a lot of pandering to people who should have been ignored
Jan 15 2020,negative,star wars rise of skywalker made a lot of strange turns overlooked details in order to force this narrative to a predetermined ending
Jan 13 2020,positive, so here we are 42 years and nine films into the official star wars skywalker saga that began in may of 1977 with the release of george lucass original star wars or star wars episode iva new hope if you want to be thorough at the time lucas was so unsure of his films chances for success that he went to hawaii on opening weekend so he wouldnt have to be around if and when it bombed it was during that hawaiian trip that lucas and steven spielberg who was there escaping his own woes during the postproduction of close encounters of the third kind cooked up the idea for indiana jones but thats another story  how wrong he turned out to be you would have to go back to thomas edison declaring that motion pictures which he helped innovate would be a passing fancy that lasted 10 years at best to find a more misguided movie predication as we all know now the original trilogy which included stars wars the empire strikes back 1980 and return of the jedi 1983 turned into a cultural juggernaut that forever changed the movie industry and its ancillary markets in a sense we are still watching movies in the house that star wars built lucas returned to the franchise he created in the late 1990s and early 2000s with a trilogy of prequels 1999s the phantom menace 2002s attack of the clones and 2005s revenge of the sith that charted the path of hewhowouldbecomedarthvader it was a stew of mixed results although hindsight has shown that lucass consistency of vision across those three films was both admirable and challenging that consistency is precisely what the third trilogy of star wars films which began with jj abramss star wars the force awakens 2015 and was followed by rian johnsons star wars the last jedi 2017 lacks the force awakens kicked things off in grand style by introducing an entirely new cast of charactersdaisy ridleys rey a resolute orphan with a jedi future john boyegas finn a rebellious storm trooper who joins the resistance against the fascistic first order oscar isaacs poe dameron an ace resistance pilot and owner of bb8 a rollypolly new droid and adam drivers kylo ren a conflicted sith lord who yearns to be the next darth vaderwhile also bringing back familiar faces three decades older notably harrison fords han solo and carrie fishers leia organa who we learned gave birth of kylo ren much of the new star wars world was successfully established although some critics and fans griped that it looked and felt a bit too much like the old world  no matternarratives were launched characters created and longterm mysteries established particularly the tantalizing question of reys lineage those questions were deepenedand in some ways conflictedin johnsons the last jedi which divided fans right down the middle johnsons take on the material particularly the return of luke skywalker mark hamill wasnt to everyones liking although i remain mystified as to why some decried it as the worst film in the series so there has been great expectation that abrams in returning to the directing chair would essentially right that films wrongs the very fact that this would need to be done speaks to the lack of planning that went into this trilogy which now viewed as a whole has a kind of awkward slipshod feel the individual parts are all good in their own ways but the series comes together only under obvious pressure and stress almost anything can be forced to fit together but dont look too closely at the seams with the rise of skywalker abrams and cowriter chris terrio working from a story concocted by derek connolly and colin trevorrow the latter of whom was originally slated to direct have delivered something that certainly passes for a fitting conclusion there has been some griping about fan service suggesting that abrams is just kowtowing to star wars fans which is basically the opposite of what johnson did two years ago in taking the series in his own idiosyncratic direction that kind of criticism strikes me as absurd since abramss intentions are largely irrelevant and what matters is whether the rise of skywalker works both on its own as a film and as the capstone of the third trilogy in the star wars saga on both counts i would argue that it does imperfectly sure but it works the first half hour is definitely the roughest as we lurch from plot point to plot point in such rushed fashion that its hard to digest much of anything much less enjoy it the film opens with a massive reveal showing us in the first 10 minutes that the mastermind behind all the evil doings from the previous two films has been none other than emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid who was also the evil mastermind behind all the evils doings in both of the previous trilogies his villainous bona fides were secured in both creating the galactic empire and turning anakin skywalker into darth vader when we last saw the emperor at the end of return of the jedi when ronald reagan was president mind you vader had hurled him into a void in the middle of the new death star where he apparently exploded that alas was not enough to take him out and it appears that he has continued to exist albeit in weak skeletal form biding his time until he can reenergize himself and take command of the first orderwith kylo rens assistance of course the reveal of the emperor is supposed to be a big kick but it doesnt really work because no groundwork had been laid in the previous films abrams and company just drop him into the proceedingsbamas a desperate ploy to fill in the necessary narrative gaps thankfully the film is more interested in following the continued plight of rey who is well on her way to becoming a very powerful jedi and her conflicted relationship with kylo ren with whom she has already done battle multiple times and with whom she now has a strong mental connection leia organas role in the film was intended to be much larger before the untimely passing of carrie fisher but she still has a notable presence that largely hides the fact that it is cobbled together from preexisting footage from the first two films and digital effects we get a few new characters including a mysterious masked bounty hunter named zorii bliss keri russell who has an intriguing history with poe dameron as well as the return of some familiar faces most notably billy dee williamss wry scoundrel lando calrissian who once again commandeers the millennium falcon  like the first two films in the new trilogy the rise of skywalker is fundamentally a nostalgia machine drawing heavily on the iconography and narrative beats of the original trilogy but with just enough of twists that it feels relatively new abrams cannily stages one of the films climactic moments in the twisted remains of the throne room from return of the jedis second death star which further underscores how rey is the new luke and kylo ren is the new vader and the emperor is  well  still the emperor abrams doesnt have rian johnsons belligerent daring and this film lacks some of the clever visual grandeur that the last jedi had in spades abrams is certainly going for broke giving us a lightsaber duel on a precipice thrashed by massive waves a tense desert showdown and a horrorshow of star destroyers lined up in the sky and lit with bursts of lightning these moments work in and of themselves and abrams manages to stitch them together with enough spit and determination that you feel like youve witnessed a real conclusion even if we all know that this particular juggernaut is likely nowhere near its

Jan 12 2020,negative,this is a submissive sloppy apology for a terrific movie this is a series apologizing for itself when it didnt need to which just feels embarrassing
Jan 11 2020,positive,the best star wars episode since the empire strikes back with as much nostalgia as new story content star wars the rise of skywalker rose to the occasion full force pun intended  ignore the haters
Jan 10 2020,negative,after delivering such a brilliant cinematic masterpiece rian johnsons excellent story telling was ignored negated and just plain disrespected by jj
Jan 10 2020,neutral, theres a moment in the middle of star wars the rise of skywalker when rey is approached by a new droid it takes a step back as she reaches her hand out bringing her to the conclusion that it had been harmed before its all right she says youre safe now she hits a button to essentially reboot it its a moment that has no bearing on the story except that it reflects entirely how jj abrams views the star wars fandom a collection of people who were hurt by the last jedi but are now in safe hands that understand them this is how the rise of skywalker feels safe when the force awakens came out in 2015 that word was thrown around a lot it had several familiar concepts a planetkilling weapon a nobody hero from a desert planet a bad guy with a black helmet who speaks through an intercom but even with the familiar there was still a sense of innovation you had a storm trooper with a conscience and a villain with a strong inner conflict more than that the force awakens felt like a movie about something a new generation trying to figure out their place in a world that was so profoundly belonging to the old one  star wars the rise of skywalker has none of that its so often a retread of the old and familiar that it forgets to do anything of its own in fact it even reverts some of the brilliant subversions of the last jedi it does so in a way that feels punitive almost as if to change is an offensive notion for the biggest movie franchise in history it even has problems on a basic level the first half of the movie is so incredibly rushed that the characters are essentially racing to get from one point to the other it works best when things slow down but then its bogged down by setup for the next scene  its not so much that you cant enjoy the movie its still star wars there are spaceships lightsabers villains and heroes its just that having seen how good star wars could be its a shame that the finale to this saga is such a whimper it feels like a knife thats been used for too long and now its just dull
Jan 9 2020,neutral,its hard to believe at the culmination of 42 years and nine movies that the last three would be essentially improvisational exercises by all directors concerned
Jan 9 2020,negative, kudos to jj abrams for doing something extraordinary to star wars with his rise of skywalker he has made me not care about it for the first time in my life look i am the clichéd genx star wars fan who was eight years old in the summer of 1977 when the first movie hit us all with the force of a supernova i lined up as a teenager  the queue wrapped around the cinema just a onescreener back in those premultiplex days  to find out what return of the jedi would bring us i was there when the first phantom menace trailer debut broke the baby world wide web i spent the summer of 1999 rewatching episode i many many times and having endless and still not resolved philosophical discussions with other fans about just what precisely constituted the phantom menace and whether quigon was stupid and incompetent or wise but thwarted and what bringing balance to the force would mean i was so very primed in 2015 for the third trilogy to bring the 40yearlong story of my geek existence to a conclusion this myth has defined my entire popculture life in so many ways it has contributed to the patois of generation x use the force i dunno i have a bad feeling about this it has shaped how we all think about movies now star wars  the first movie but also the ongoing sprawling saga with its videogames and cartoon tv series and all of it  has been the ultimate story in the same way that say gone with the wind or casablanca or lawrence of arabia or the sound of music have been for earlier generations except even more allencompassing the star wars machine has become the movies star wars is almost religion almost literally what im saying is i love star wars and i very much own that love i have lived that love the saga is in my geek blood and yet i watched the rise of skywalker and  throughout it and after it  could muster no reaction beyond a huge heaving sigh of i no longer have any fucks to give here i dont even want to argue about any of it anymore im exhausted by all of it and not in a good way i am exhausted by the toxic fan reaction and by the ultimate pointlessness of it all i am not saying that arguing over fiction is pointless i am saying that arguing over this particular story has been deliberately rendered pointless by those who have been telling it im kind of relieved that its over actually because it has stopped being fun worse it has stopped being interesting  it charts a path to a future that refuses to get mired in nostalgia yet all the star wars notes are here remixed into a glorious new arrangement   upended expectations demythologized the mythos and took an iconic series in a bold new direction with a story full of humor courage and dazzling imagery  it seemed to me that this was the right approach for the first two movies of a new trilogy a wrapup trilogy to take acknowledge the past and play with the tropes but then move in a muchneeded new direction finish this particular story but open up this universe and make room for it to expand into fresh vistas i mean thats how you keep it going right thats what you need to continue raking in big ol corporate profit no its a big fucking galaxy out there isnt it lets explore it but with the rise of skywalker abrams  director as well as one of four credited screenwriters  sucks it all back in upon itself nothing that happens here and none of the answers to the mysteries the previous films in this new trilogy posed are the least bit surprising or enlightening the biggest narrative crimes of the rise of skywalker are the same ones as solo a star wars story everyone in the galaxy actually knows everyone weve met before this big crazy wide universe is in fact really insular and really fucking small and incredibly familiar say what you will about george lucass prequel trilogy  it certainly has its problems to say the very least  but at least it showed us a vibrant diverse galactic civilization and yet rise of skywalker might as well be a soap opera set in a small village for all the scope it has its genuinely shocking how cramped this movie ends up feeling who is rey daisy ridley peter rabbit murder on the orient express whence comes her force powers from there really groan forget whatever space battles this movie wants to mount forget everything else rise of skywalker could have been about abrams star trek into darkness super 8 makes this movie about that question and the answer is tedious as well as aimless for all the endless callbacks to beats from the original star wars trilogy  just when you think abrams is done referring to the old movies he throws in an even more shameless reference  rise barely seems interested in the spirit of the overall tale in 1977 star wars was rebellious and antiestablishment in every way it could be from its provenance as a scrappy little indie in a hollywood that didnt know what to make of it  it was damn near cinematic outsider art  to its protagonist the lonely farmboy who dreamed of adventure and of a life anywhere but where he was last jedi was imbued with that spirit in its audacious suggestion that the jedi were greatly in need of at a minimum a reformation or that maybe the faiths time had come to die in its celebration of the little people who win wars with their necessary slogging gruntwork and its rejection of showy oneman heroics last jedi was anti status quo was all about blowing up the metaphoric death star that is this movie machine its target  perhaps unwittingly though i suspect not  was as much a hidebound fandom as the increasingly hidebound franchise it worshipped and then jj abrams comes back here in rise with lol hell no and delivers multiple fuckyou reversals to what rian johnson did in his film poe dameron oscar isaac xmen apocalypse mojave is back to being celebrated as a cheerfully reckless hothead exstormtrooper finn john boyega pacific rim uprising detroit and maintenance engineer rose tico kelly marie tran are completely sidelined their brand of quiet power and everyday courage not required here and certainly not deemed of any worth rise brings in another token nonwhite nonmale in order to pretend it is diverse but mysterious lowtech warrior jannah naomi ackie lady macbeth doctor who ends up with almost nothing to do too its one thing  a depressing thing  to see that obviously there was never any unifying vision for this trilogy no one mapped out even a sketch of a overarching plot for the three movies and the grand story it tells is damn near incoherent because no one seems to have had any idea what it was going to be about way worse though is how with the rise of skywalker  the film struggles to justify that title  star wars became the empire solidifying ideas about lineage and nobility broadly defined and destiny and heritage that more than ever in todays world need to fucking die when slavish adherence to dynasties and heritage are doing so much damage somehow im always shocked when anything considered science fiction or fantasy shows itself to be so lacking in imagination and when its fans reward it for its narrowmindedness im also never not disappointed its clear now that whatever flight of fancy star wars once took me on it is no longer interested in having me along on the journey this saddens me but there are plenty of other stories out there that will engage me as i need in addition to what you pointed out every single character save rey and kylo is a plot device the whole story was slapped together while they were scripting and it shows its such a waste of daisy ridleys talents she deserved a strong finish for the franchise that gave her a career as well as putting oscar fucking isaac in a leading role and not giving him much to do i thought the ending was beautifully done but everything else was a mess leading up to it if disney decides not to make more star wars films  id be just fine with that george lucas got crazier as the movies he made progressed into the new episodes but everything he did was because he believed in it disneys interest is in seeing how high they can build the pile of sw money  the first clue was disney trying to turn out a film every year those threeyear gaps between the lucas films made you hungry for the next installment now not so much rian johnson believed in the story he told which makes it all the more angering how its edges were sanded off in this one  makes me wish id gone to see knives out instead its funny i agree with almost all of your specific points but still enjoyed the hell out of this one maryann and i are the same age  maybe the magic and not being able to imagine not loving star wars are still working for me  and maybe a little of it is the headcanon i invented for this movie that takes the little bit of dark side necromancy we see and just runs with it  still ending up at the same place but with some much cooler bits in between i was going to post much the same as what you said i enjoyed the rise of skywalker  i saw it twice  but i agreed with almost all of the points maryann made which is the sign of a good critic  they provide insight even when you disagree ive been a comics fan as long as ive been a star wars fan  back in the 80s dc did this thing called the dc challenge it was a 12issue round robin story with randomly determined creative teams for each issue  each issue had to end with a cliffhanger that the next team had to deal with  for instance i remember one that left aquaman stranded in the middle of the sahara desert and minutes away from dying due to lack of water the writer had to have something in mind for an escape from the cliffhanger but the next writer didnt know what it was and might go off in a completely different direction the whole thing was fun if a little disjointed and unavoidably gimmicky  but this was a minor comic book limited series  sure dc hoped it would sell but if it didnt it was just this fun little experiment that wouldnt ruin the company or anything how can you possibly arrive at the notion that a dc challenge approach is in any way wise or appropriate for a multibillion dollar franchise i know its utterly ridiculous  jj loves his little mystery boxes and allegedly had answers in mind all along but didnt tell anyone  thats a terrible way to manage a franchise and just like the mystery of who is cumberbatch playing in star trek the resolution is the most obvious and underwhelming thing imaginable its so so so sloppy if youre going to kill off chewbacca 45 minutes in maybe make the audience think hes dead for a good hour before he comes back in the third act if youre going to have lando call a bunch of ships for a big sweeping moment of support that specific moment is done beautifully maybe show him calling the ships if youre going to have finn insist that hes going to tell rey something have him tell her the thing if you want adam driver to have a character arc maybe give him actual lines and things to say theres only so much looks and unwarranted kissing can justify in the third act as much as i disliked this movie and i was never going to like reylo or rey skywalker rey palpatine could have been okay but was treated lazily like everything else i would have enjoyed seeing the threehour cut that was rumored agreed with all of this  i was so angry at the reveal of who rey really is  i loved all the weird directions tlj took and i hate that jj undid all of it  i particularly agree with the idea of the jedi needing a reformation  its one of the few things i defend in the prequels i think the jedi were deliberately presented as bloated and corrupt and the three trilogies could have presented a cycle of fall and rebirth  i was guessing rey would found a successor to the jedi called the skywalkers justifying the films title  also i wanted more of broom boy and other nobodies to show up and play a role but no go there was one scene i really liked and that was when they met the underground worm thing  it felt very doctor who with our hero seeing a great beast but being affectionate towards it and helping to heal its pain c3po is not allowed to translate sith language but he can if they reset his memory  this is contrived and doesnt make much sense but from a story perspective it makes sense  hes one of only two characters whos been with us for every movie so his offering to essentially die for his friends was pretty touching  but then later r2 restores his memory from a backup file  so what was the point of that  its like jj wasnt satisfied with undoing tlj he had to retcon things that happened in the same movie is that right  i know it had a gap in it but i wasnt sure how far back it went  but if youre right then yeah that says it all i might be looking for slightly more than is really there in the text but confirming it would require seeing it again and that aint happening in a hurry jj needs to stay away from venerated sci franchises hes done more damage to star wars and star trek that i dont know if those two franchises will ever recover he has the lead touch i really dont think its as bad as all that  i absolutely loved the new treks and as far as i remember maryann did too  the first new sw film by jj was great the second sw made not by jj was great  this one wasnt great but one out of five isnt a bad record yup ive enjoyed the new treks and i have the same relationship to trek as i do to wars grew up with it shaped my geekiness etc my issue with new installments in either franchise hasnt been lack of trekiness or warsiness but more basic storytelling issues his early career in the 90s is mostly schmaltzy and sentimental although i remember regarding henry being a minor hit when i was a kid  joy ride felicity and alias in the early 2000s were his peak then of course he made a truckload of money with lost which i know many people love  after that i dont know what happened maybe he was given too much creative control a la lucas maybe he ran out of ideas but everything went south in a hurry good science fiction is about ideas and exploration and hes become incapable of building a world substantial enough to reward wandering through  as your comment and this review state he and disney have sucked all the wonder out of entire universes and left once rich juicy ideas shriveled and crumbling in the mud i dont want him to fail or succeed i just want him to get better  now cameron for some reason partially jealousy i kinda want to see him fail spectacularly  his failures have the potential to be overblown campy fun jjs failures and successes are forgettable shiny mush like a bowl of cold oatmeal with candy sprinkles personally i always thought the cinematic sw universe was in trouble long before abrams came along and that blaming the failure of the sw series on abrams is like pretending the phantom menace would have been a scifi classic if not for jarjar binks  im glad my niece and nephew find something to like in the new movies but apart from that i have not much to say about the matter apart from noting that i wish for maryanns sake that the last two movies were a lot better hollywood does not reward this though or at least it thinks it doesnt reward this until some dude always a dude and a white dude at that bucks a trend that inexplicably makes a splash see 1977 george lucas has a hit that no one expected and then said white dude is hailed as a visionary or whateverthefuck and oh god i am so exhausted by it all i didnt like the last jedi found it a bore to watch i must admit and didnt like any of the male or female characters in itluke poe rose and holdo especially not seen rise of skywalker yet but im guessing as i mostly enjoyed force awakens ill probably enjoy rise of skywalker more than you did last jedi left such a sour taste in my mouth though i skipped rise of skywalker because of it youre probably right that disliking tlj makes you more likely to like this one  i disagree with you strongly but its nice to see someone express that opinion respectfully without falling into sexism write  a better one lets all see it considering the hurdles faced in this finale  two principles being the incredibly short schedule and the loss of a key actor even before production began it simply could have been worse but wasnt and im grateful for that i thought the reykylo scenes were watchable and they had palpable chemistry  ren is largely culpable in the murder of millions sentient beings though which undercuts some of the dramatic moments near the end quite a bit  you have to admit finn and poe have arcs that go nowhere in this film and the trilogy as a whole youre right though making a movie is not an easy undertaking and there were certainly many challenges involved in this particular installment and many different interest groups to appease im happy you went in with low expectations and were pleasantly surprised  no need to challenge those who felt let down  if someone eats a piece of pie you like and says meh not so good it would be a little silly to angrily retort id like to see you open up your own restaurant and bake a better one  it could have tasted way worse  you liked it they didnt  ma has a personal connection to the series too which makes her disappointment that much more heartbreaking which is to say fuck that guy that you are replying to and fuck hollywood i know movies and i know what makes good movies and what doesnt even if i have never made a small fortune in the process you dont have to agree with her review but if the main points of your counterargument are write a better one and it could have been worse you might want to consider writing a better review yourself not gonna lie the rise of skywalker is to return of the jedi as the force awakens is to a new hope except rotj wasnt that great to begin with so tros is commensurately worse i was going to write that well it could have been worse but after considering for a long while i realized i couldnt think of any way it could have been worse it passed the final episode of a trilogy of trilogies over to jj im not good with endings abrams instead of rian johnson who was originally going to make episode nine until the whining fanbaby men writing ignorant screeds on the internetz got disney scared and they replaced him it threw out and undid all the wonderful stuff rian johnson had done in the last jedi and gave us stupid fan service to placate the worst element of the fans it wasted a bunch of good actors most notably kelly marie tran who i thought the best thing in the last jedi it did such silly things as making the hidden fleet of star destroyers each have its own death star cannon making you wonder why in hell theyd bothered building death stars to hold those cannons in the first place it goes without saying that any time you find yourself considering logical points in a star wars movie youre kinda fucked 1  in the middle of the film kylo makes a pit stop at 69 aftward the 24 hour night club on his ship  as he orders a cold one he spots a mysterious female twilek across the room and offers her a twirl on the dance floor when hux cuts in with a smirk saying these tentacles are taken why dont you ren back to your room kyloser  they breakdance to the death but it ends in a draw  they lock eyes panting in exhaustion go to rens room and make out awkwardly but its disney so the penetration is implied offscreen 2  near the end of the climactic battle an army of ewoks led by a fully shaved wicket hang glide out of a wormhole and drop water balloons filled with purple egg nog on the heads on the storm troopers guarding the shield gen er radio tower  a force ghost of anakin appears the jake lloyd verson and exclaims now that was pod racing  the ghost then breaks out in a lively jedi space shanty to celebrate their victory and the remaining storm troopers driven mad by the beauty of the song take off their armour and put it on again upside down so that it looks like theyre all walking on their hands and waving their feet in the air  everyone tries not to look at wickets smoothly shaved body and fails  are you an angel  youre endorable exclaims jake lloyd anakin  the force ghost and wicket embrace then make out awkwardly while everyone around them slowly pretends to suddenly have somewhere to go  its disney so you only see wickets sideboob for a couple seconds and his nipples are blurred out 3  after the credit roll the camera pans up from the spot in the sand to a robotic foot as it continues upwards we see that the robotic legs are attached to the torsos of darth maul jar jar binks and a badly burned jyn erso  at last meesa reveal ourselves to the jedi meesa have hope revenge issa built on hope  the creature exclaims ominiously  rey and the the charred torso of erso make out awkwardly while the maul and binks torsos play rock paper scissors to decide who gets lukes saber  baby yoda and baby groot drive up in a gold plated sandcrawler wearing blinged out geordi la forge visors and begin rapping about blasters and slave girls jabba features but his verse is subpar   its disney so they play the clean radio edit its bizarre that disney would want to play it safe with this franchise given that it was guaranteed to make money no matter what  why not swing for the fences  it did such silly things as making the hidden fleet of star destroyers each have its own death star cannon making you wonder why in hell theyd bothered building death stars to hold those cannons in the first place  that doesnt bother me at all  after forty years the technology has no doubt advanced so im willing to accept that they just now managed to miniaturize the cannons enough to fit on a star destroyer  its actually nice to see a scifi universe where technology isnt frozen in whatever people thought futuristic meant in 1950s pulp magazines im grateful this new trilogy happened just for the last jedi i love that movie so goddamn much it ignited a passion id never previously felt for this series i happily isolate it as a glorious oneoff not being a star wars fan the shocking awfulness of this movie can be shrugged off as another piece of hollywood horseshit it might as well be called star wars episode ix fuck rian johnson it really feels like this movie was made to placate fans who hated last jedi  as soon as it was announced jj was going to direct this i adjusted expectations accordingly down to zero i just detest everything abrams does he has no artistic soul as a filmmaker all of his shots are empty existing only on the surface potentially engrossing moments happen but the second theyre over they disappear ill go further his movies are all sociopathic theres no emotion theres the appearance of emotion but theres nothing true behind it all potentially engrossing moments happen quickly then pass without lingering or seeping in to the subconscious to be truly savoured every moment is like that an astonishing image appears onscreen but it never actually becomes astonishing its always taken away by inherent falseness an embedded emptiness suffusing the entire film and also by the lightspeed editing that ensures nothing stays on screen long enough to matter nothing feels earned or honest nothing is real there can be no time to be sincere as that would disrupt the momentum of emptiness a genuinely moving cinematic experience becomes real in the mind of the satisfied viewer you can feel it you know when its reached you on some deeper level nothing here came close to that this is pod people filmmaking the ultimate example of jj abrams deeply unpleasant cinematic sociopathy is still the destruction of the republic by starkiller base in the force awakens five densely populated planets are destroyed in what is far and away the most monumental devastating cataclysmic unimaginable masskilling in the history of the universe and literally five seconds later the movie forgets all about it hey fuck it thats over with next i get that on one level this is all broad pulp scifi nonsense but it still shocks me how that film made that into such a banal moment meanwhile paige ticos sacrifice in the opening of last jedi still makes me gasp and shiver with an intense emotional response with less than two minutes of screentime and no dialogue shes a living breathing person who matters i cant say that about anything in rise of skywalker finally saw this film and while my immediate experience was enjoyment thanks to my utter lack of expectations funnily enough a general moviegoing philosophy i adopted after going into the phantom menace with high hopes you absolutely nail the lasting impact of the film  nothing like you say every scene every visual every moment every emotion every idea breezes by in a moment and vanishes never to be concerned again  theres some things that happen which should have major ramifications but dont because the movie doesnt care  including once again destroying a planet  which isnt a spoiler because it doesnt matter at all like i dont think the protagonists even know it happened  at least  and holy turds is this damning with faint praise  someone was like whoa  the republic was destroyed thats bad thats a good point  in force awakens theres at least some reaction to the planets blowing up but in rise it just happens randomly because its the sort of thing thats supposed to happen in a star wars movie its only there for the audiences benefit not the characters which ends up not benefiting the audience because shallow fan service in place of a real dramatic story isnt a foundation for anything meaningful its clear now that whatever flight of fancy star wars once took me on it is no longer interested in having me along on the journey im with stacy livitsanis im glad the new trilogy gave space for tlj to exist as a fantastic oneoff it stands on its own both as a film and as muchneeded commentary on both the franchise and its fans and the films themes will continue to resonate whether future storytellers fulfill or squander its promise but ive pretty much given up hoping for a cohesive satisfying narrative for the star wars universe as a whole and will just have to enjoy whatever nuggets of gold emerge from the inevitable sea of mediocre or atrocious crap sturgeons law and all that i believe we actually are living through a time of quality star wars storytelling its just that its all happening in the mandalorian oh well really trivial spoilers ahead    this movie shows a number of women working for the first order these women have hardly any lines my theory is that the first order went on a huge recruiting drive trying to add more women to the team but they couldnt find any women who were willing to sign up so they came up with a plan the first orders spies knew that the resistance had made tremendous advances in artificial intelligence and had developed extremely lifelike androids to fight on their behalf so they conducted a raid on a resistance base and stole as many female androids as they could find they reprogrammed all of the androids to join the first order there was only one problem the androids original programming didnt allow them to speak the sith language no matter how much time the first order technicians spent trying to solve the problem they could never get the female androids to speak more than a sentence or two so the women spend most of their time saying nothing at all the other possibility i suppose is that jj abrams and his team made very little effort to put interesting female characters onscreen but its 2020 so surely hes aware of the need for better representation in the movies lukes ghost also keeps appearing to rey who continues to train to be a jedi while also being overwhelmed with selfdoubt it seems that kylo ren telling her that shes descended from dead nobodies has really messedup her mind and sapped her confidence but reys standalone nature is also part of her strength during a conversation with leia the general says youre not like my father or my brother youre new whatever happens remember the force chose you rey your story isnt written by anyone else the beginning of the film very much picks up from the last jedi in that the first order has cut off all communication between planets in order to suppress a rebellion inspired by luke skywalkers stand off at the battle of crait so the spark of the rebellion did work in this version of the movie  oh and rose apparently front and center through the whole movie which is a damn shame given that shes completely sidelined in rise of skywalker  at the very end of the movie finn and rose lead a group of force sensitive youth to a remote planet where rey is waiting to train the next generation of jedi and yes broom boy is one of them rey tries unsuccessfully to bring kylo ren back to the light but hes too far gone and in the end he is extinguished this is honestly what many felt the crux of episode ix should have been the battle for kylo rens soul instead abrams and co decided to muddle everything up with this palpatine nonsense which is just unnecessary added external conflict that detracts from the emotional thrust of this trilogy and its worse because it is more than fanfic in the sense that it had a real chance of becoming a movie in a way that none of the it might have made a better movie fanfics have  like the studio literally paid someone to write it so that it could become the actual script of the actual movie they just decided nah so doesnt change anything about the merits of the final film just like a fanfic but frustratingly closer to a reality we could have inhabited kinda like the original script for that terrible russel crowe robin hood movie that was gonna make the sheriff the protagonist  like they had gold in their hands and flushed it down the toilet  thats much worse than the idea of the sympathetic sheriff simply existing a important caveat to the relationships between trevorrows and abramss ep ix scripts trevorrow was fired from the production 3 months before the last jedi premiered oh sure theres no guarantee that what looks promising on paper actually winds up being good onscreen all im saying is that trevorrow seemed to understand and go along with the story direction that johnson was suggesting he was yesanding johnson as opposed to abrams who just said nah were gonna go back to my idea it means that the decision not to go with his script was not made in response to the reactions to the last jedi it was deemed unsuable all on its own however disappointing abrams and terrios script is trevorrows film would almost certainly been at least as disappointing in its own unique ways which makes this whole leaked script business into a ridiculous exercise one that because this is still the early 21st century is already morphing into a bunch releasethetrevorrowcut nonsense  and thats assuming we take the authenticity of this script at face value which really consider this is a production company that went to such lengths to keep the existence of a major character in a highly anticipated and heavily promoted new show under such wraps that etsy sellers made more money selling merch of this character last year than did two of the most merchandising savvy companies in the world but somehow a rejected script by the guy they fired leaked out pull the other one i never said that it was i will say that tros feels like abrams very personal response to tlj taking the story in a direction he seems not to have wanted but whether or not the trevorrow script is real its a story that feels more satisfying and makes more sense as a continuation and culmination of the themes and story elements that have come before trying to offer something positive i just listened to an episode of a star wars podcast called scavengers hoard celebrating rose tico and what she stands for partway through the episode the hosts read several moving comments from people talking about how much rose still inspires them regardless of the insulting way rise of skywalker treated her the embrace of hope and love and the rejection of cynicism and hate gave me a solid lift out of the numb state i was in after seeing rise  i glanced at your red dot and quick take before going to see the movie anyway hoping it would be one of those cases where i disagreed with you or where i kind of agreed but liked the movie anyway 1  adam driver and daisey ridley  but especially adam  freaking carry this deadcow of a movie  the closest anything came to working was their story and thats 100 because of their acting chops adding depth that everything else on screen lacked  no offense to any other actor john boyega did what he could with reeeeeeeey 2 boy the last line of the movie ticked me off  when shes asked for the second time rey who and she pauses to think then smiles i was actually starting to feel a swell of emotion for what i felt had to be coming next  just rey  same answer as before but this time said not with insecurity and shame but confidence and acceptance because its her foundfamily that matters and they arent signified by a family name  but nooooope i think you could find justification for the title without that and no other changes to the movie  at this point all the skywalker line we know of are dead and the evil ones redeemed  rise could mean to ascending to jedi heaven  but whatever  the main thing i hate about the line is how it reinforces the theme that your lineage is actually superduper important and if yours sucksis egregiously evil the best you can do is adopt a better one yup the more i read about it the more i really really prefer the trevorrow version that could have been where rey gets over her obsession with lineage and decides that just rey is more than enough our masters were wrong rey said i will not deny my anger i will not reject my love i am the darkness and i am the light youre nothing youre no one kylo responds rey then ignites her lightsaber and says no one is no one before running at him and the battle continues the line according to burnett is a callback to earlier in the film when rey is discussing her lineage with poe and he explains that everyone is who they want to be no one is no one i can just imagine the line no one is no one resonating in the culture in a way that nothing in tros really has it would have been a rallying cry for anyone protesting all sorts of injustice for anyone who felt marginalized for insecure teens and unmoored adults for everyone no chosen one status needed it would have been brilliant and a damn shame it was never allowed to happen
Jan 8 2020,positive,star wars the rise of skywalker is a good tentpole movie for the holiday season and a fun star wars movie that ends on a high
Jan 8 2020,negative, its a statement weve heard countless times before but theres no denying that star wars means so much to so many people for generations fans have eagerly awaited new instalments with passion and dedication finding meaning in a simple story about space battles and mythical wizards created in the 70s by george lucas like many others i grew up with the theatrical releases of the prequels and was introduced to the original trilogy by my parents at an early age the announcement of a sequel trilogy came at a perfect time in my young adult life that had me excited and hopeful for the futurea fandom dividedits impossible to discuss star wars in 2019 without first acknowledging the fandom behind it people have always had their own opinions about star wars what it should be what it represents and ultimately these conversations have turned from constructive and passionate to downright toxic over recent yearsafter rian johnsons the last jedi the fanbase was quite literally divided and it appeared as though there was no nuance in opinion you either thought it was the best star wars movie ever made or you wholeheartedly believe johnson ruined star wars an opinion that was once used against the prequel trilogyquite frankly the response to the film was embarrassing rian johnson was constantly bombarded with personal attacks and threats of violence on twitter fans were petitioning to have episode 8 remade and during this time i was almost afraid to admit my status as a star wars fan whether or not you liked the film personally it is in my top 3 johnsons vision oozed with creativity passion and a determination to create a project within the framework of a domineering company with the hope of bringing something fresh to the sagasource walt disney studios motion picturesunfortunately the same cannot be said for the ninth and final instalment directed by jj abrams which ultimately serves as a poignant example of the ways artistic integrity and individual creativity are of little importance when compared to pleasing the masses even more so it shows the lack of planning that lucasfilm and disney engaged in prior to the release of episode 7 a deficit that has resulted in three films that feel disjointed and almost unrelated to one anothera lack of visionwhen we open on the rise of skywalker kylo ren has taken the place of snoke as supreme leader after a failed attempt at recruiting rey in episode 8 and the galaxy is now threatened again by the late emperor palpatine who has featured in the marketing and promotional material of the film right away its clear that youre expected to be on board and if youre not its going to be a rough ride without going into spoilers the reason for his return is mostly unanswered swept under the rug with vague explanations and messy storytelling which is the biggest problem with the film its storytellingfilled with macguffins side quests and plot conveniences that arent always explained the film suffers due to its rushed and overstuffed approach to writing and a perceived need to throw as much at the audience as possible while it is satisfying to see rey daisy ridley poe oscar isaac and finn john boyega take centre stage in many of these adventures their path is a result of lazy writing that is immediately jarring and just doesnt feel like star wars at timessource walt disney studios

Jan 8 2020,positive, star wars is my first movie memory as a 5yearold boy i huddled with my mom in a london movie palace in december 1977 transfixed by the images flickering on the huge screen but then came the sand people who along with the movies overwhelming auditory experience scared me enough that we had to leave early despite that frightening introduction to the franchise i soon became a devotee and though ive lost much of my original enthusiasm over the years  mostly thanks to the poor quality of the phantom menace and the endless parade of noncanon content  i was genuinely curious about the impending conclusion to the saga would it take the story in a direction that would satisfy both super fans and casual admirers and more importantly would it simply be a good film while the jury is still out on that first question the answer to the second is a resounding yes at least in the mind of this casual fan who surprisingly found himself tearing up once or twice the effects are superb and the performances endearing especially the four main actors from the three sequels daisy ridley as rey adam driver as kylo ren john boyega as finn and oscar isaac as poe yes the film is derivative repetitive overstuffed frenetic and sometimes just plain ridiculous but its also irresistible powerful entertainment on an enormous scale its the most emotionally resonant star wars movie since return of the jedi in 1983 directed by jj abrams from a script by chris terrio argo batman v superman and abrams the rise of skywalker needs no advance plot discussion one should go in fresh and uninformed so i recommend avoiding trailers and blogs that might reveal twists strangely though a major twist  which negates one of the central plot points of the original trilogy  is revealed essentially before the movie begins by the famous scrolling text i wont divulge that here suffice to say it is a rather jarring rewrite of star wars history and one that i was initially uncomfortable with until i found myself on the same narrative wavelength as abrams and allowed the spectacle to wash over me and thats what i suggest you do too take off your critics hat set aside your fanboy phobias and stop projecting your own desires onto the franchise just enjoy the nostalgia and theres plenty of it almost as if abrams wanted to wipe away some of the less star warsy choices made by writerdirector rian johnson in the last jedi but i dont embrace this battle of the writers theory on the contrary i contend that the narrative pivots have served a purpose despite the new films lack of originality but there i go again overthinking let go we must and if we do we might discover the films surprising message of moral duality and ambiguity good and evil live in all of us in equal measure abrams seems to be saying palpatine and skywalker are two sides of the same republic datary confronting fear is the destiny of the jedi luke reminds us well weve learned a lot about destiny over the last 42 years the destinies of the characters the destiny of cinematic entertainment and our own personal paths its been a memorable journey fun emotional exhilarating frequently disappointing but ultimately satisfying the force has come full circle
Jan 6 2020,negative, in the last weeks of 2019 the big studios generously served up two christmas turkeys judging by the reviews i wasnt the only person yawning through star wars the rise of skywalker or wondering how tom hoopers weirdly sexualised cats ever secured a g rating both films are selfconscious blockbusters intended to appeal to a popular audience both are surprisingly incoherent the star wars movie tries too slavishly to supply fans with everything they might want from a series finale  oh please let it be over  at the expense of plot and continuity the makers of cats rely so completely on costumes and cgi to distinguish the film from the stage version they seem to have forgotten the most basic principles of storytelling the star wars franchise is a juggernaut that guarantees the new film will make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits regardless of the lukewarm reactions cats is a more tricky proposition as it seems to be struggling even though the international success of the lion king aud7778 million and counting suggests there is a huge audience for movies based on hit musicals cats debuted in 1981 and would run for 21 years in the west end and 18 years on broadway making it one of the popular stage shows of all time this is a slightly depressing statistic because the music is so bloody awful the musical might be defined as a degraded diluted form of opera interbred with the instant hooks and cheap sentiment of pop nevertheless the best musicals such as west side story or cabaret are tremendously seductive stephen sondheim is arguably the best of the musicalists but if andrew lloyd webber had stopped after jesus christ superstar 1970 we might look back on him as a brilliant talent instead he has rolled on and on churning out treacly formulaic tunes that keep the cash registers ringing cats has one memorable song aptly called memory a piece of cgrade puccini meets celine dion its hummable but utterly maudlin the plot borrowed along with the lyrics from tseliots old possums book of practical cats 1939 is deceptively simple a bunch of cats called the jellicles get together for a big annual shindig the highlight will be when one lucky cat gets to ascend to the heaviside layer and start a new life i say deceptively because its never made clear why the cats are jellicles is it a name or some kind of category does it have any special meaning neither is it obvious why any cat would want to trade in its nine lives and ascend to the next world despite the relentless singing and dancing the entire party feels like the sacrificial rite of a primitive tribe this impression is exacerbated by the way hooper has clad his allstar cast with the merciful exception of judi dench and ian mckellen in skinhugging lightly furred costumes that make them look virtually naked few porno films could boast so much squirming fondling and legspreading if youve ever dreamt of rebel wilson clad in a body suit waving her extremities in the air this is the movie for you or perhaps youd prefer idris elba in skintight buttockgrabbing leotards after an hour of cats i began to suspect the popcorn they fed us had been laced with a psychotropic drug the only problem was that i wasnt actually enjoying myself when it comes to star wars there are legions of devoted fans who treat each installment as a religious experience but even the diehards must have been a little disappointed by jjabramss notsogrand finale for viewers that havent followed the series with such close attention  and i confess to having seen no more than five out of nine installments of the saga not counting the spinoffs   there are no concessions if you didnt see the previous film the last jedi 2018 you may find yourself struggling to remember who all these people are and what they do abrams is so focused on addressing the rustedon fans that he leaves the rest of us lost in space this narrative complacency means the rise of skywalker fails as a standalone film which cannot be the case for any successful sequel for the viewer striving to figure out whats going on the action is remarkably uninvolving all those fights with laser sabers the intergalactic space ship chases and so on feel like a pointless mishmash when we pause for a little character development the dialogue is so pedestrian one begins to look forward to the next empty action sequence as usual the wookiee gets all the best lines uugggh errmmh the costumes the funnylooking aliens the claptrap about the force and the sith it all feels so tired and looks so plastic its not just carrie fisher that returns from the dead via digital wizardry just about everyone who was ever retired from the saga gets to be briefly resurrected  which is presumably the way abrams conveys the sense of an ending to use a phrase made famous by literary critic frank kermode none of this will disturb the real star wars fanatics the franchise has become a decadent first world subculture that allows people to enjoy a little harmless fantasy at the price of switching off ones brain and abandoning any sense of what makes a great movie if an entire planet is destroyed by a ray beam again this is just a piece of fun très amusant martin scorsese recently copped flak from the pop culture groupies for claiming that superhero movies and franchise films werent cinema of course these movies are cinema but they are a form of cinema in which any hint of artistry has been dissolved in a formula as corrosive as hydrochloric acid success at the box office has become a reliable indicator not of quality but of industrialgrade cynicism whats most disturbing is the blind willingness of paying customers to keep frequenting and supporting these movies many of the fans will confess their disappointment in the rise of skywalker and cats but one suspects theyll be back next weekend shelling out for something just as bad
Jan 6 2020,positive, in a way star wars has ended again but its never really going to end the finality of star wars the rise of skywalker is a joke this film wasnt even the last star wars adventure many fans saw in 2019 since the mandalorians season finale trailed the movies release by a week but skywalker does wrap up the trilogy of new movies that were first announced when disney bought lucasfilm back in 2012 no further numbered episode movies that add onto george lucas original ninefilm arc are expected to materialize in the foreseeable future this puts star wars in the unusual position of having drawn to a close three separate times with three separate trilogies plenty of franchises have promised an ending then continued anyway but even at its most cynical star wars isnt exactly friday the 13th in the 1980s advertising a final installment then releasing another sequel a year later though star wars has had multiple tv and movie spinoffs with more on the way the core of the series is those three trilogies each separated by a decade or more all of which were intended to tie up loose ends in their respective third installments 1983s return of the jedi 2005s revenge of the sith and now the rise of skywalker few film sagas get this many cracks at designing a satisfying ending theres been a lot of debate though over exactly how detailed those designs have been a lot of criticisms over the rise of skywalker focus on the new trilogys planning or lack thereof cowriter and director jj abrams kicked off the run with the force awakens then ceded the middle installment the last jedi to writerdirector rian johnson with skywalker abrams returns to the trilogy and visibly scrambles to assemble payoffs fan service and callbacks to the lucasera films all while offhandedly retconning last jedi truthfully though a lack of forethought has always been a hallmark of star wars trilogies some of the first three movies biggest plot points were famously not part of george lucas original set of ideas return of the jedi in particular feels like spirited vamping it introduces inconsequential but fun new characters the ewoks the denizens of jabba the hutts palace of sleaze and eventually falls back on the opening films plot assembling another fleet of spaceships for another attack on an even bigger death star  only this time with the three main heroes occupied elsewhere years later even with lucas exercising even more control the prequel trilogy picks up some story threads but lets others drop sometimes those dropped threads are productive revenge of the sith has a singularity of purpose that the other two films in the prequel trilogy lack sometimes they arent did lucas ever actually work out who clonearmycommissioner sifo dyas was exactly the bestcase scenario for the lack of an overarching plan is spectacular middle chapters like the original trilogys the empire strikes back and the sequel trilogys the last jedi rian johnson clearly took his inspiration from old star wars movies and from what hed been handed with the force awakens but somehow he crafted a story that feels fresher and more personal and he boldly avoids ending on an obvious cliffhanger in imitation of empire its no accident that at the moment empire and last jedi are the most critically beloved star wars movies after a new hope neither of those middle films had to attend to the messy business of wrapping up and paying off a trilogy rise of skywalker has to sort through that kind of messy business on an unprecedented level since its also wrapping up a 40year saga every star wars sequel or prequel has carried baggage from what came before via mirrors callbacks and improbable familial connections as the series has continued the baggage has accumulated giving abrams the unenviable task of wrapping up his own movie the full sequel trilogy and the two previously ended trilogies all at once but sometimes that feels like a selfimposed sentence more than an audience mandate as if the filmmakers are taking cues from the pseudofinality of avengers endgame abrams clearly aspires to both the speedy crowdpleasing adventure of return of the jedi what pauline kael dismissed as a fun machine back in 1983 and to the sense of sagadefining inevitability that gives revenge of the sith its darker more operatic momentum since revenge of the sith was already the empire strikes back of the prequel trilogy and abrams also wants to continue with the characters he helped create in force awakens this means rise of skywalker is essentially trying to function as all star wars sequels at once well maybe not attack of the clones although that is the other star wars film with pivotally awkward romantic chemistry but yes the last jedi is in there too for all of the moments in skywalker that can be read as walkbacks of johnsons work there are plenty of times where abrams attempts to honor that movie in the home stretch however clumsily the forcefueled skype sessions between rey daisy ridley and kylo ren adam driver remain integral to the story and so does their uneasy emotional connection with the originaltrilogy characters they each parallel  leia in reys case darth vader in kylos and their connection to each other is also significantly emphasized and deepened in last jedi to the point where skywalker has to see it through and find an emotional ending to their arc while skywalker retcons reys supposed lack of a fancy lineage abrams does try to retain some humbler origins by revealing that finn john boyega is forcesensitive he was a stormtrooper in the past but could possibly become a jedi in the future whether he does or doesnt his building force abilities make a strong argument that individuals choices matter more than their history they also pay off johnsons last jedi idea that force users can come from anywhere so its not that abrams seems determined to finish the saga without input from last jedi he apparently just felt obligated to sequelize and tie up far more than just his immediate cinematic predecessor skywalker shares that problem with the other star wars finales in different ways return of the jedi plays off the first trilogys greatest hits dealing with the fallout from empires dramatic iamyourfather revelation as it happily recreates the zip of the first film like empire its betterregarded now than it was upon release benefitting from the way so many latterday fans experienced the original trilogy as a single work easier to watch and love as a cohesive whole than when doled out over the course of years revenge of the sith reversed that trajectory critically speaking it got pretty great reviews in 2005 as it broadened the scope of the prequels to tie further into the original trilogy but in the years since its been recategorized as just another clunky star wars prequel fodder for windbaggy video analysis on youtube and the occasional fan defense this reputation sells all three prequels short its especially unfair to siths downbeat grandeur rise of skywalker refers to both of the previous trilogy wrapups though the greatest hits of return of the jedi fittingly receive more attention from hollywoods most successful coverband filmmaker abrams mirrors returns entire climax with the hero facing off against palpatines superpowered fascism while her friends stage a dramatic siege on the bad guys megaweapon sith gets quoted in part to handwave away a plot point also connected to return of the jedi a repeated line from sith about how the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural is meant to explain how palpatine continues to quasilive even after he was chucked down the shaft of an exploding space station at the end of episode vi skywalker mirrors revenge of the sith in another subtler way sith opens with a largescale rescue sequence where jedi partners obiwan kenobi and anakin skywalker rescue chancellor palpatine oops from the openly villainous general grievous though much of the film heads inexorably toward tragedy this passage is both a wonderfully sustained bit of swashbuckling actionadventure and an oddly touching glimpse at the brotherly closeness between obiwan and anakin rise of skywalker echoes that breakneckyetbittersweet quality sending rey finn and poe on their only real onscreen adventure as a trio racing through a fastpaced banterheavy first hour both sith and skywalker take fond last looks at their droid heroes r2d2 proves his mettle again in the opening section of sith a treat for longtime fans c3po gets his biggest role since the original trilogy in abrams new movie c3pos story in episode ix has a meta dimension reviving his fussynuisance shtick from the original trilogy minus some of the bile before requiring a reset of his memory in order to access a crucial bit of mcguffinhunting information halfway through the movie the cyclical adventures of the new star wars generation becomes all new to threepio who regards his friends with freshly rebooted eyes and renewed skepticism over their recklessness at the same time his preerasure willingness to sacrifice his memories for the greater good carries an unexpected poignancy even if abrams isnt willing to commit to the idea its a lighter version of the new trilogys favorite overused trick the fakeout pretend death it also misses the opportunity to restore c3pos wiped memory of the prequels here and at several other key moments  the reclaimed soloish gestures of a reformed kylo ren say  abrams and cowriter chris terrio realize an inspired hybridization of return of the jedis chummy sense of fun and siths heavier sense of series history they acknowledge the formulaic pleasures of this spaceserial adventure as well as their characters willingness and desire to break free of old patterns at its best this lends rise of skywalker a prismatic effect at its worst the new movie searches for its own homegrown sense of inevitability and comes up short the solution to reys palpatine dilemma  how she can defeat this massive evil without becoming what she most fears and loathes  amounts to a massive hedge a jediinflected version of the old actionmovie cliché of a hero killing in semipassive selfdefense though return to jedi retreated into the safety of hugready ewoks the cuddliest versions of han and leia and another death star run it also featured luke skywalker throwing down his lightsaber and rejecting hatred in the face of withered sith evil rey rejects palpatine by lending her lightsaber to kylo for a few minutes then reacquiring it so she can use two lightsabers to push away palpatines force lightning that ending converts emotional turmoil into physical mechanics its no surprise that rey defeats palpatine nor does it need to be not much that happens in return of the jedi or revenge of the sith is especially surprising  empire and last jedi have to take the burden of creative surprises but the skywalker filmmakers seem to arrive at their own conclusion by process of elimination where anything too far afield from previous movies has been crossed off a brainstormed list to some degree skywalker seems selfaware about this abrams and terrio know theyre evoking memories of earlier films and competing with them at the same time yet the retreads of return of the jedi and the selfreferential rhyming of revenge of the sith both extend their reach further into the world outside of fantasy and fandom lukes decisions in return of the jedi have some philosophical depth and sith is explicitly about a society complicit in its own descent into a fascist state the newest finale gins up some resonance about the vigilance required to keep fascism from rising again but its mostly secondhand almost incidental  rise of skywalkers reverence for the past may be necessary in a way abrams and company probably didnt intend theyre out to placate the fans but instead they may be helping to banish this saga in this form from movies more than either previous series wrapup this finale has been made with a strong awareness that more bigscreen star wars will eventually follow to its credit the film still feels conclusive revenge of the sith ends with a lot of good guys dead but the key characters from the original trilogy  obiwan yoda vader  had to survive return of the jedi similarly ends with a lot of good guys surviving but the sequel trilogy methodically kills off han luke and leia in spite of their respective curtain calls and manages not to feel too grim about it fusing the funmachine exhaustion and mythic grandeur of the other trilogycappers turns rise of skywalker into a messy exorcism its by turns delightful muddled cathartic and frustrating sometimes within the same scene and what could be more post1977 star wars than that the series final shot true to skywalkers everythingtoeveryone nature mashes up the final shot of revenge of the sith itself an homage to the famous twomoon horizon of the first star wars and a strong image from the force awakens with a dash of the forceghost finale from return of the jedi blurring the iconography of rey and bb8 into that of their predecessors is simultaneously heartening and a little sad like a blip from c3pos erased restored imperfect memory with three trilogies a renewable fan base and money to be made star wars is always beginning again and always ending again in its imperfect way rise of skywalker captures those endless endings perfectly with the saga over maybe the next chapter can find a way to end better
Jan 6 2020,negative,the movie is so determined to be all things to all people that it overstuffs itself becoming more of a star wars fan collage than a movie on its own terms
Jan 6 2020,neutral, starring carrie fisher mark hamill adam driver daisy ridley john boyega oscar isaac anthony daniels naomi ackie domhnall gleeson richard e grant lupita nyongo keri russell joonas suotamo kelly marie tran ian mcdiarmid and billy dee williams the skywalker saga comes to an end nearly 42 years after it began with the ninth and final episode in the main star wars series the rise of skywalker banks on franchise nostalgia for a finale designed to please fans while playing it safe and suffering perhaps as a consequence the film begins with the revelation that emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid somehow survived the events of return of the jedi 1983  presumably by jumping through a convenient loophole  and has now assembled a fleet of star destroyers to decimate the resistance and establish a final order  rey daisy ridley  who has been training under the watchful eye of general leia organa carrie fisher  joins defected storm trooper finn john boyega and commander poe oscar isaac as well as chewbacca joonas suotamo bb8 and c3po anthony daniels to find and stop palpatine while continuing her tussle with kylo ren adam driver but everything ends up feeling rushed even though the movie has a nearly two and a half hour running time to handle all its storylines there are parts that could have been written and presented more deftly and unnecessary arcs  like c3pos sith text issues for instance  that could have been exorcised altogether without losing anything from the story also for a film with this much action and destruction the rise of skywalker is oddly vacant and short on excitement and poignancy the climactic battle isnt as edgeoftheseat exciting as it should be while the rest of the proceeds lack impact possibly because they lack permanence several times the film presents a touching or powerful moment and then a few minutes later promptly undoes that development j j abrams mostly chooses to bask in throwback nostalgia and brings back familiar faces without managing to do anything particularly interesting along the way his competent but riskaverse approach keeps the film from going in an inventive direction there are moments that feel contrived and the scripts sharpness is often lacking as is character development for intriguing players like finn who arent used to their full potential carrie fishers parts  put together using unseen footage fragments  leave you wishing we could have seen the movie that wouldve been made if she had still been alive the choice of primary antagonist also has a significant impact on the rest of the series and not necessarily in a positive way that said there is fun to be had in episode ix and there are many elements of this actionpacked finale that fans will enjoy but the sequel trilogy on the whole feels a bit mismanaged  the rise of skywalker ultimately leaves you with the feeling that things might have been more consistent and powerful if the three films were better planned helmed by one filmmaker and managed to strike a finer balance between creativity and fan service andrew lloyd webbers longrunning stage musical cats makes its way to the big screen in the form of a bizarrely poor film the pure awfulness of which simply boggles the mind the musical basically shows anthropomorphic cats  or what are supposed to be cats but rather look like creepy pointyeared humanoid extraterrestrials  auditioning to be picked for the chance to  die and be reincarnated i guess  the plot  or what passes for a plot here  finds the jellicle cats tribe introducing themselves via song and dance in the annual jellicle ball hoping that their leader old deuteronomy judi dench will choose them as the one who gets to go to heaviside layer and be granted a new life while the villainous macavity idris elba plans to kidnap the other contestants so that he can win by default what should be a delightfully quirky romp quickly turns into a nightmarish fever dream instead the cgi descends to the depths of the uncanny valley  the almost nonexistent story is as incoherent as it is bonkers the songs are unmemorable the dance sequences badly shot cats may work on stage although based on this cinematic atrocity its hard to tell why the musical has been so popular but onscreen the whole project feels like a giant misuse of t s eliots whimsical poetry  the cast seems to comprise of actors who cant sing and singers who cant act stars are crammed into the film for no real reason other than marketing including a glorified cameo by taylor swift in a brief appearance as bombalurina who makes zero impact with a performance that would have gone unnoticed were it not for her fame rebel wilson who plays the lazy jennyanydots gets what is possibly the most poorly conceived sequence of the film judi denchs monologue at the end is bewildering meanwhile the overwrought jennifer hudson who plays the ostracised grizabella seems to be in an entirely different movie altogether tom hopper who previously did an uneven job with les miserables has basically delivered a case study in how not to make a movie the fact that this cgidrenched liveaction version was made altogether is baffling in itself seeing how the material is clearly better suited for an aristocatsstyle animated adaptation and the fact that they managed to mess up literally every aspect of the project is almost intriguing
Jan 6 2020,positive,jj abrams had the arduous task to tie up loose ends not just for the rise of skywalkers two predecessors but the entire saga
Jan 3 2020,negative, i run at warp speed up the escalator and across the lobby open the door to the auditorium and theres luke han leia and chewbacca trapped in the trash compactor its the summer of 1977 in one of my first moviegoing memories my parents take my brother and me to plaza las américas in hato rey puerto rico for a matinee showing of star wars not a new hope not episode iv just plain star wars walking into a movie at the halfway point was a common practice that thankfully has gone the way of jabba the hut and so three years later my brother and i made sure we saw the empire strikes back from beginning to traumatic cliffhanger i was upset at how much my beloved rebels suffered and even more upset id have to wait three more years to see how it all turned out of course i came around on empire and even mom came around on the skywalker saga when we took her to see return of the jedi at the secondrun roosevelt also in hato rey despite the modest nature of the bargainpriced theater i still felt that tingle in my stomach restless with anticipation as to what george l was going to show me that day in my case for the second time i felt some of that frisson of the unexpected two years ago when i saw the last jedi aka episode viii an unfairly maligned chapter also a tad overpraised in some circles that showed looper director rian johnson taking risks that are all too rare in a franchise of this magnitude so before delving into the many many ways star wars the rise of skywalker the ninth and ostensibly final entry in this fourdecadesinthemaking scifi epic goes astonishingly wrong lets begin with what it gets right at heart lucas took aspects from john fords the searchers akira kurosawas the hidden fortress and the matinee serials he grew up on as points of departure for him and his screenwriting collaborators to tell a generationsspanning tale of a dysfunctional family that bears a resemblance to our own despite being separated across vast chasms of space and time it wasnt just the newness of the technology or the expertly staged action that kept drawing audiences to the theaters again and again its how lucas and his team made us see ourselves in these characters particularly when he turned the one who was initially portrayed as pure evil into a remorseful father despite that he was an extreme case of damaged goods dad discovered he still felt something for his children could that possibly be love director jj abrams returning to the directors chair after making the force awakens aka episode vii understands this cornball sentiment is not something to shy away from but embrace wholeheartedly but whats missing this time is a creative spark the kind of overarching vision that weaved together the two prior trilogies even lucas muchmaligned prequels without that backbone mapping out how the events will unfold it lays bare that the team behind skywalker is making things up as they go along  as a result viewers invariably end up thinking more about the behindthescenes turmoil that has plagued the franchise since disney bought lucasfilm back in 2012 than whatever is happening onscreen the rise of skywalker picks up some time after the events of the last jedi which ended with the resistance in tatters and the first order aka the fascistic regime born out of the embers of the galactic empire hot on their tails and finalizing plans to snuff out those pesky rebels once and for all a shrewd director would incorporate aspects from both force awakens and the last jedi striking a balance between the familiar comforts of the former and the bold departures of the latter but abrams working from a screenplay credited to him and argo scribe chris terrio shows little to no interest in further developing the intriguing politically minded strands johnson cultivated in his imperfect but engrossing entry a jedi can come from anywhere and the future of this galaxy rests on the oppressed masses ready to rise up against the soulcrushing overlords last jedi posited with an eye on ensuring the series continued to evolve in rise of skywalker abrams and terrio react to these concepts with a collective thats nice but no thanks reverting instead to the walltowall fan service that hampered force awakens abrams heart is clearly in the right place but hes supplanted the curiosity johnson brought to the table with franchise fatigue  familiar faces and new characters once again fight for screen time some amounting to little more than window dressing as the central heroic trio of spunky rey daisy ridley steadfast and loyal finn john boyega and raffish and brash poe dameron oscar isaac cross paths and square off against the brooding tortured kylo ren the ubiquitous adam driver all while going on yet another scavenger hunt that is even more generic and forgettable than in previous installments the big selling point here already spoiled in trailers and tv spots in addition to carrie fishers final onscreen moments as general leia is the return of emperor palpatine apparently reanimated from the ashes of previous script drafts once again played by ian mcdiarmid the character has the potential to wrap its tendrils around this tired and stale cash cow to at least give it a sinister jolt but abrams and terrio give him nothing to do but assume stock villain duties leading to scenarios that feel like déja  vu all over again richard e grant fares better at twirling his mustache as the ruthless general pryde the real frankenstein monster attempting to pull the strings turns out to be the rise of skywalker itself the more it grafts aspects from its eight predecessors onto its frenetic slappedtogether narrative the more impersonal it becomes there are a couple of interesting ideas tossed around like a heretofore unseen way of using warp speed but they are abandoned as soon as theyre introduced you feel your goodwill eroding like the sands of tatooine well before a conclusion that feels at once preordained and undercooked even the chemistry between the younger actors feels halfhearted their stabs at humor feeble most dispiriting of all their quest for personal fulfillment is barely explored damerons proclivities and finns separate unrequited yearnings in particular are hinted at in timid wholly unsatisfying ways before abrams attempts to tie everything up in a bow without answering any vital questions but as much as you may want the rise of skywalker to grow a pair and take star wars into the future it remains irreparably stuck in the past the resistance has been squashed by disneys evil empire it pains me to report and no one is more crushed than my inner scififantasy geek that this once influential precedentsetting series has gotten lost in the firmament theater the actor nominated for a tony award for his portrayal as mrs doubtfire in the broadway musical comes to fort lauderdale in the national tour michelle f solomon has the review
Jan 3 2020,negative,neither abrams nor johnson who have more than proven their skills as filmmakers on other occasions are guilty of a trilogys failure that of course originated without a true narrative purpose full review in spanish
Jan 3 2020,negative, the ninth and final outing in this 42yearlong star wars saga is a step up from the last jedi two years ago but still a disappointment  but then again how could it not be  with the force awakens writer director and producer jj abrams replacing the last jedis rian johnson a public whippingboy for that one although it wasnt that bad this reunites the new characters drags in some old familiar faces ties up loose ends and builds at length to what should be one of the grandest finales in all american cinema but it isnt really even more dispiriting than the movie itself however are the rabid legions of star wars fans out there  amongst the most toxic in the world today  wholl be screaming apoplectically about this until the next essentially unrelated movie comes along in a few years time dont you wish theyd all grow the hell up without mentioning any spoilers we open with supreme leader of the first order kylo ren adam driver travelling to discover the origins of a mysterious voice he keeps on hearing ren like voldemort freddy kruger and godzilla simply wont die and driver has trouble making him as commanding as he really should be he comes on less like a shakespearean villain and more a sullen teenager which ren kind of is actually finn john boyega poe dameron oscar isaac and chewbacca now played by joonas suotamo are off in the millennium falcon while rey daisy ridley is jediing around as general leia carrie fisher contributes sagely advice the late great fisher has been gone for three years now and the role has been somewhat macabrely constructed here by way of unused footage soundbites and standins and therefore leia feels disconnected from the action abrams as if feeling that her unreality must be acknowledged even has her say nothings impossible finn poe and rey unite and set up a basic love triangle which will disappoint some lgbt audiences who hoped the guys might have more of a bicurious bromance and a basic callbackheavy plot kicks in as they venture forth alongside c3po anthony daniels once again to take on ren and his darksideish types which now include a sneering richard e grant no less as allegiant general pryde and it all feels just a little underwhelming but john williams donetodeath score swells to hopefully convince you that you are indeed having an awesome experience and ridley in particular acts her heart out but 42 years after the first star wars or episode iv or whatever this cant help but feel like a bit of a fizzer partially because of the fact that back in 1977 no one had ever seen a movie like star wars  and now we see them all the damn time week in week out and yes theyre often better
Jan 3 2020,neutral, the surviving resistance faces the first order once more as rey finn and poe damerons journey continues with the power and knowledge of generations behind them the final battle commences its all come down to this fortytwo years of storytelling a trilogy of trilogies the end of the skywalker saga jj abrams returned to the franchise following colin trevorrows exit in a move that some considered to be safe  however abrams promised a newer bold approach this time around but the big question is did the movie deliver the rise of skywalker certainly takes risks and ventures into some surprising places but it all feltrushed and slightly underwhelming maybe it was the huge expectations or probably the frantic pace and messy script that abrams and chris terrio concocted but the movie never felt fully at ease with itself major plot points and characters were introduced without real explanation and at times contradicted themselves and established lore whilst other characters were sidelined almost entirely  the need to tie nine movies together and the existing elements from the sequel trilogy seemed almost too big of an ask at times that said the rise of skywalker is an awful lot of fun if you simply sit back and enjoy the spectacle  the spirit that made star wars so great is present here the action scenes are excellent there are plenty of lightsaber battles to enjoy the vfx are a joy to look at and funnily enough that breakneck pace aids the narrative at times especially early on the opening fifteenminute salvo is superb adam driver and daisy ridley put in great performances in their final runouts as kylo ren and rey and the entire cast back them up with fine displays the digitallyadded carrie fisher just about feels right too the good outweighs the bad but the movies biggest flaw is in its returning villain as heard in the trailers its a huge addition that when all is said and done complicates the previous movies and adds a video gamelike quality to the conclusion of the movie as a saga concluding effort the rise of skywalker isnt the roaring perfect sendoff wed hoped for but its still a fun sometimes exhilarating adventure and helps to remind us why star wars will live on
Jan 2 2020,positive, theres not really much to say here other than here is our episode reacting to star wars the rise of skywalker for almost 90 minutes enjoy all
Jan 2 2020,negative,it is during this battle we have one of the most numinous moments in the star wars franchise the scene lasts for about three or so seconds but its incredibly beautiful the rest of the film was dead to me
Dec 31 2019,negative,what we got was a decent film but not one to carry the torch of the star wars legacy
Dec 31 2019,positive, after four years the latest star wars trilogy is finally coming to an end while the death of major characters were expected some were still shocking and others were difficult to accept however the reallife passing of original franchise star carrie fisher hit everyone hard as it meant she would never see the end of the series to which she was such an important contributor yet general leia organa would still play a major role in the final chapter as the latest skywalker saga comes to an end in star wars the rise of skywalker having regrouped after the devastating attack on their fleet the resistance is relying on information from an imperial spy to determine their next move however obtaining the intelligence requires chewie joonas suotamo finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac to fly dangerous missions throughout the galaxy barely evading the first orders army in the meantime rey daisy ridley is continuing her jedi training with leia fisher though shes often distracted by the mysteries of her past and kylo rens adam driver intrusions kylo is on his own dark quest to become the universes ultimate ruler by eliminating any threats to his leadership which includes convincing rey to sit next to him on the supreme leaders throne  with disney announcing star wars will be taking a theatrical break this film has the added duty of definitively wrapping up the skywalker saga for the foreseeable future consequently it needs to give audiences closure and give each of the characters viewers have come to know and love over the past few years a fitting sendoff while everyone may not be happy about some of the trajectories it all makes sense and fulfills its mandate of allowing audiences to leave the theatre without unanswered questions the film opens by catching up with each of the main characters including two major action sequences as they try to complete some aspect of their mission from a hyperspeed chase through the galaxy to a brutal ground battle that leaves the forest floor littered with casualties the movie gets viewers hearts racing early on with the final push by the first order at hand there are many more confrontations in this picture as everyone is on high alert and resistance movement of any kind triggers a cavalry several new personalities are also introduced throughout the picture including a tiny adorable alien mechanic named babu frik and a new talking droid friend for bb8 called do while romance has been a low priority when compared to winning the war theres certainly some sparks flying between certain characters especially in this episode as friendships are deepened relationships are rekindled and flirtations are realized  though theyve never really gone in for traditional fairy tale endings new characters however continue to expand the universe viewers understanding of it and the key personalities as they grow with each encounter while the plotlines arent really surprising theyre not entirely predictable either some time before a major reveal they begin dropping hints of whats to come which is a great way to engage discerning audiences while still delivering jawdropping reveals theres never going to be a way to make everyone happy  particularly when it comes to some character arcs and the marginalization of others  but this film does a pretty good job of giving the people what they want copyright  1998  2023 digital journal inc sitemaps xml  news  digital journal is not responsible for the content of external sites read more about our external linking 
Dec 31 2019,positive,they kind of went back to the feel of the original star wars even the heavy undertones still felt fun
Dec 31 2019,neutral, by dan tabor film critic at the end of the last jedi we witnessed luke skywalker sacrifice his life so the remnants of the resistance could escape aboard the millennium falcon this was after kylo ren promoted himself to supreme leader by killing the mysterious snoke and offering rey a place at his side ruling the galaxy rian johnsons the last jedi made some bold choices compared to jj abrams fan servicey the force awakens this created a rift between those fans that wanted a new drug and fans that wanted another hit off the star wars nostalgia bong after director colin trevorrow jurassic world was fired deep into preproduction on the rise of skywalker jj abrams stepped into the breach to conclude the skywalker trilogy he started the rise of skywalker finds kylo ren teaming up with emperor palpatine who we find out has been hiding out on a secret sith planet orchestrating his will through his puppet snoke this whole time he offers ren the means to conquer the galaxy  an armada of planet destroying starships he calls the final order  but only if he kills rey so begins a planet hopping cat and mouse mcguffin chase as rey hopes to find an ancient sith artifact that will lead her and the resistance to palpatine with kylo and the knights of ren hot on her trail the resistance only has a narrow window to launch their final allornothing attack as the final order readies to leave the secret sith world and destroy any planet that doesnt fall into line skywalker is a dense watch as abrams attempts to mix info dumps exposition and narrative to varying degrees of success and only makes sense if youve seen all the previous star wars films the cast are all known quantities at this point with driver being the clear standout this time around even with all of the changes his is still the most consistent story arc throughout all three films as ben solo continues to be conflicted over which path to take carrie fisher who had passed away before the end of production on the last jedi also posthumously returns in a leading role culled from unused footage from jedi to help explain a major plot hole its a noble gesture honestly but it feels like fan service rather than a genuine path for princess leia organa the crux of this dense narrative is a string of reveals that work at the cost of coherence and continuity with everything that has come before i hesitate to call it lazy writing because i understand it was creative problem solving an attempted solution to an unsolvable problem jj abrams wanted everyone to leave the theater happy  but by doing so he lost the momentum and cohesion that johnson had handed off to him he turned in a film that while generally okay at best it feels like filmmaking by committee and focus group rather than as singular vision driven by story while i thoroughly enjoyed the further exploration of rey and kylos relationship which is the emotional core of the film i felt like abrams kept getting distracted by spectacle the need for big final reveals and lore rather than the humanity that drives these films
Dec 30 2019,negative,twentyfour hours later i can already feel most of that movie evaporating from my memory
Dec 30 2019,negative,way safer no doubtthe whole trilogy has been a disasterstarttofinish it did not happen thats just so clearbut this is rewatchabale more fun than last jedi and it plays off nostalgia

Dec 30 2019,positive, so here we are forty two years after the first ever star wars film opened in 1977 the final chapter of the skywalker saga is released there was a huge anticipation for star wars the rise of skywalker naturally given its place in the franchise history as the final conclusion in preparation for this my hubby and i saw return of the jedi the night before and we actually saw empire strikes back in october as part of mn orchestra live in concert series when i finished watching the movie i turned to my hubby and whispered they might as well call this franchise spoiler alert highlight to read evil space grandpas if youve seen this movie i think you know why just like what i did on the force awakens this post is not a review per se more of my random thoughts about the film and the franchise as a whole so proceed with caution if you havent seen the movie yet unsurprisingly i have a lot of the same quibbles with this one as the 2015 movie that jj abrams also directed mainly the excessive amount of nostalgia as some critics have rightly called fan pandering and lack of suspense throughout yes there are some fun moments but the big moments are pretty much predictable the key phrase no ones ever really gone uttered by luke skywalker at the end of the last jedi came up again in this movie beloved carrie fisher returns as general leia organa via the use of repurposed unreleased footage but shes not the only one in fact the entire movie is basically a road trip of sort to find a supposedly dead emperor palpatine ian mcdiarmid who now resides on the planet exegol apparently hes so not dead after all in fact hes been a puppet master to snoke supreme leader of the first order but before rey poe and fin could get to exegol they had to find a device called sith wayfinder i feel like that plot is basically a way to reunite rey  co with yet another returning character lando calrissian the crew looked practically giddy to be meeting billy dee williams in that scene and vice versa that it took me out of the movie a bit thats what nostalgia does while i enjoy seeing certain actors back in a certain franchise it distracts me from the actual story that unfolds before me speaking of the story theres a lot of more of the same in the rise of the skywalker interesting that there were some rumbles on the interweb that jj abrams was subtly dissing rian johnsons the last jedi saying that it was a story that i think needed a pendulum swing in one direction in order to swing in the other now whether abrams was throwing shade at johnson or not the fact of the matter is the two filmmakers didnt seem to see eye to eye as a more casual fan of star wars i actually like the fact that rian had the guts to do something different and subverting the franchise unfortunately im in the minority and because many diehard fans hated what rian did so naturally hes not invited back to helm this one the biggest twist of this movie is in regards to reys daisy ridley identity people keep telling me they know me no one does she quipped in frustration but her reluctant nemesis kylo ren claims he does then he just said it blatantly who her parents really are its supposed to be a gaspinducing moment but for some reason it was just meh in fact reys similar lineage situation that bears such resemblance to lukes and kylos feels like convenient read lazy writing to me the part i like most about rey when shes first introduced in the force awakens is that shes just a scavenger with no jedi blood in her and that her parents are just ordinary people in the last jedi kylo himself told her you come from nothing youre nothing which undeniably made him even more furious that she could wield as much power as he does then the ending that film the scene with the young boy also hinted that there are other ordinary people with no prominent lineage who could use the force i love that message that people are more than who theyre born to be and where they come from that we do have the power to become more than whats been imagined for us so by making rey as a palpatine obviously undermined the storyline thats been set before and render many other plot points meaningless i dont know in what other cinematic franchise is that ever a good thing i have to say that the nostalgic moments have different degrees of impact i said i enjoyed seeing leia and lando and the final arc of general leia organa is a memorable moment but the now decrepit palpatine is mostly eyeroll inducing especially since the scene of vader throwing him down the space abyss is still fresh in my mind not only would it seem impossible that he survived that fall but just when did he have time to have a son who later becomes reys dad on top of that hes also mighty enough to build an entire armada and hides all of them from every single creature until the opportune time dictated by the script to reveal it i barely have time to ponder on that as theres a ton of stuff going on in this movie the crew frenetically jumped from place to place in search of that wayfinder thingy which eventually leads to the main battle between rey and kylo no doubt the lightsaber duel of two crucial characters on top of the remains of the second death star no less looks epic with the waves and torrential rain its an atmospheric scene to be sure  its got some wow moments but overall the scene just didnt have as big an emotional impact as i thought it would spoiler alert proceed with caution as ill mention key plot details below since force awakens ive grown to appreciate adam driver more and more you could even say hes my current cinematic crush but i gotta say kylos got the short end of the stick here in terms of his character yes hes a darth wannabe from the start longing to be a powerful sith leader like his grandpa but this final movie just renders him into nothing more than a conflicted manchild it pains me to see driver whos so excellent in marriage story which i saw just two months prior barely given much to do here than looking mostly dazed and discombobulated now given how powerful reys become the outcome of the duel and what she did afterwards didnt really surprise me in a key moment in the movie suddenly han solo turned up again was it a dream a hallucination was kylo delirious does it matter in another nostalgic scene harrison ford revisited his most famous adlib in empire strikes back as his prodigal son struggled to find the words to say  that part made me smile but i find this dramatic scene more schmaltzy than genuinely moving still driver at least still has a compelling arc and a dignified resolution gone is kylo rens toxic powerhungry machismo in the end hes ben solo after all and hes got an honorary death as a jedi but where is rose tico the spunky mechanic with a big heart had a big role in the last jedi kelly marie tran was a great addition to the resistance crew but here shes hugely sidelined for most of the movie while fin is off doing his heroic duty with a new compatriot jannah a resistance sympathizer now naomi ackie is fine in the role but i cant help missing rose in the journey with the resistance fighters now after teasing us for four years whether rey will finally turn to the dark side well the final answer is something so utterly predictable once again our heroine just like the original hero of the saga is facing a family member yawn rey matters because shes part of an important allpowerful family its treading familiar and familial grounds the fact that bloodline and lineage is the key to achieving real power that is the ability to use the force perhaps the fact that weve seen all before the actionpacked battle of all of the sith vs all of the jedi barely holds a candle of the original battle between luke vs vaderpalpatine its what follows that would likely be the talking points about rise of skywalker yep its all about reylo not satisfied with just an epic battle of good vs evil weve got to have some controversial romance thrown in i wonder how the convo goes in the writers room hey wouldnt it be surreal to have vaders grandson making out w palpatines granddaughter i supposed kylos longing look every time he sees and feels rey from a distance boy that came out so creepy has suggested he has feelings for her from the start and who could forget that shirtless scene during a forcebond in the last jedi that bothered rey so much she asked him to put something on but yet i still wasnt prepared for the kiss it feels like it came out of nowhere i mean all the mutual pull between the light and dark side that haunts both these poor souls is so massive it took so much out of them with huge stakes on both sides that you would think romance is the last thing on their minds naturally plenty of fans have always wanted to ship the two of them as reylo has been the subject of a plethora of fanfiction which makes the kiss feels obligatory theres been a lot of shared motifs in star wars and shakespeareweve seen the romeo and juliet plot between anakin and padmé before so i guess their grandson is bound to share similar fate all in all the rise of skywalker is an enjoyable but also frustrating film i was caught up in the rousing nostalgic moments and even felt emotionally moved by some of them but as soon as the movies over i was left with an overwhelming sense of meh its not a bad movie per se i mean the actors did a good job in their roles production design  special effects are top notch john williams music is obviously still iconic even abrams direction is enjoyable but at the end of the day chris terrio and abrams script is serviceable at best it proves that no film no matter how beloved the franchise it can simply ride on nostalgia alone at the end of the day as a film fan we crave innovative storytelling that sparks ones imagination i dont think jj abrams gave us that with this one honestly after nine films id be hard pressed to know just what the force is supposed to be about since the franchises overall narrative is so discordant and inconsistent perhaps its a good thing this is the final installment of the cinematic skywalker saga but of course with disney no franchise is ever really gone especially one as lucrative as this one good read ruth i definitely liked it more than you it seems mainly because i felt several of the things that bothered you were actually good directions for the story take rey coming from no one particularly special thats certainly a good message but i much prefer the dramatic tension that comes with the revelation that she is a palpatine  hi keith interesting that you actually like the fact that shes a palpatine you thought the revelation was dramatic it felt like it was mentioned too casually by kylo which is odd too as he had said previously she had come from nothing i wonder when he actually learned about her actual identity  i liked the palpatine mainly because it goes well with the rest of the series if you think about the palpatine and skywalker family tension is a throughline that starts in episode 1 and runs to the end as for kylo palpatine reveals that he has been every voice in kylos head what kylo believed about reys parents was exactly what palpatine wanted him to believe i think he learned her real identity at the beginning when he and palpatine made the pact out of the three films of this new trilogy this one is my favorite but that doesnt say much since i have issues with all of them the problem with this new trilogy is that disney wanted to get the new films out as fast as possible and by doing so the films has no true identity or goal they hired a bunch of writers to write each film and when the last jedi backfired on them they hired jj back to fix the issues with some of the fanboys and girls had with the last film of course this film now also divided the fans some who loved the last jedi felt they were betrayed by what johnson came up with and the people who hated that film didnt care for the fans service that jj did for this film the original trilogy had one goal and that was to show that luke is the a jedi and hes the chosen one and for the most part all three films delivered as terrible as the prequels were those films also has one goal and that was to show people how anakin becoming darth vader george lucas was in charge of the story in all of those 6 films and disney should have done the same with this new trilogy hire that one writerproducer to be in charge of the story with one goal to tell but instead they had tons of writers who all came up with their own version of the story as ive said many times when theres too many cooks in the kitchen the food wont taste good lol interesting that we each have a favorite of the new trilogy mine is definitely the last jedi i just love what rian johnson did and the new characters had an emotional arc but even abrams and johnson realize they simply cannot please everyone  i actually didnt hate the prequels there are scenes i appreciate though overall the writing is pretty bad but yes the prequels had a clear goal of introducing vader and man the last 15 minutes when we first saw anakin became vader was extremely memorable to me and quite emotional too of course the too many cooks spoil the broth problem has always plagues many blockbuster franchises thats why its amazing what kevin feige did with the marvel movies in tying them all so well together i agree the nostalgia was excessive and at the expense of new ideas a big problem is disney didnt map out the trilogy from that start star wars writer said in vanity fair article rise of skywalker does not undo the last jedi and in an ew piece the writer explains why kelly marie tran had a reduced role but they definitely messed up the progression from e8 to e9 for the viewer watching backtoback kelly marie tran and the young boy at the end you mention are not relevant in e9 hi ya chris i know that the filmmakerswriters were on the defensive in regards to many peoples complaints but at the end of the day i dont think they could really defend a notsogreat movie that has little imagination i mean i thought the ending that explains the title is perhaps the only new idea they came up with the more i think about rey as a palpatine the more i dislike the movie and it sort of lessen my appreciation for the character that had been built up pretty strongly in the force awakens hi claratsi i like tlj the most as well but interesting that you didnt care for the characters in the new trilogy its true isnt it compared to the trio of luke leia and han these new characters just cant hold a candle to them as for the proper bad guy poor kylo is definitely a pathetic substitute even ren snoke and palpatine put together still cant compare to how amazinglymemorable vader was everything about him is just so iconic i love your comment about palpatine being parachuted in sooo true his entire scenes basically made me roll my eyes all a desperate attempt to rescue a very average trilogy agreed re kylo but i did find myself strangely enjoying his arc more towards the end a better hero than a villain  shame hed already killed his dad though the idiot i think on reflection that was the moment at the beginning of this trilogy were i may have checked out i doubt it was ever gonna recover in my eyes after that but yeh snoke  what was the point  while i did enjoy the film i do agree that the film did lack any real suspense and stakes  tlj had some flaws but at least was a step in the right direction as far as taking risks and wanting to explore many things  what jj did was cater to the worst group of people who mainly have sand in their vaginas as they could never be satisfied  honestly fuck those fans  if theyre not happy fuck em well in a way im glad that with the release of rise of skywalker i think more people began to appreciate the last jedi what rian did was extraordinary and i liked his approach in subverting the franchise while still gave us what we love about star wars film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Dec 30 2019,negative, when george lucas debuted his film star wars in 1977 no one could have predicted just how much of a sensation it would ultimately become  spawning three trilogy compilations that cover an equal number of generations standalone spinoffs such as rogue one and solo each tagged as a star wars story animated television series and an accountants dream of merchandisegenerated income now with star wars episode ix the rise of skywalker that original story line beginning with anakin skywalker proceeding with luke skywalker and culminating with a third and final skywalker  not to mention the various characters surrounding this trio so strong with the force  has seemingly come to an end it was left to jj abrams the aging wunderkind behind the star trek reboot to produce the final three films  referred to as the sequel trilogy following the original trilogy and then the prequel trilogy in addition to executiveproducing rian johnsons 2017 star wars episode viii the last jedi abrams cowrote and directed both 2015s star wars episode vii the force awakens and now the rise of skywalker much has been written about how johnsons movie departed at least a bit from the franchises standard tropes  and how much furor that caused among diehard fans few are likely to make similar complaints about what abrams offers as the finale without divulging any spoilers its enough to say that episode ix continues the quest embarked upon by rey again played by daisy ridley as part of the socalled resistance she  along with friends finn john boyega po oscar isaacs and a number of others  spends the films twoandahalfhour running time searching for the source of the new tyranny threatening the galaxy at the same time she keeps trying mostly in vain to avoid her arch foe kylo ren adam driver with whom she has a powerful connection that neither fully understands  but also that neither has the power to ignore if youve seen the previous films you can predict how things end maybe you wont be able to foresee all the specifics but its safe to say that the rise of skywalker doesnt offer any real surprises  other than the deaths of some familiar characters and the resurrection of notable others whats more noteworthy is how abrams has updated lucas storyline to abide by 2019 mores how women can now fill the role of hero how characters of races traditionally seen as tertiary can now step into the spotlight and even how the very term gender  and the notion of sexual orientation itself  can be seen as naturally fluid there is value to this of course the problem is that it all feels a bit too calculated as if abrams were merely ticking off boxes instead of portraying a star wars world in which such attitudes are intrinsic  give directly to the spokesmanreviews northwest passages community forums series  which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper  by using the easy options below gifts processed in this system are not tax deductible but are predominately used to help meet the local financial requirements needed to receive national matchinggrant funds
Dec 30 2019,positive,the film may feel so carefully sculpted that it lacks a sense of spontaneity or earthy honesty but its final scenes are beautifully played
Dec 30 2019,negative, what is star wars about really its a good question one weve pondered for 42 years star wars is so broad so dense and at times so frustratingly transparent that you can graft just about any sort of meaning onto it and yet its mass appeal is often distilled to one word star wars is about hope but what does it mean to have hope everyone will offer a different answer hope can mean defiance in the face of adversity it can mean happily ever afters it can mean togetherness family friendshipthose little things worth fighting for even knowing theyre temporary at its best star wars captures that freezing tiny moments of hope in amber luke leia and han hugging after the destruction of the death star anakin skywalker clutching the face of his pregnant wife padmé finn and poe escaping the tyrannical first order star wars the rise of skywalker  the final film in this epic saga is meant to tie a bow on the franchise which began with a new hope reasonably one would expect those messages to come through more elegantly and emotionally than ever before but the result is instead a sad case of confused identity its a film that thinks its doing what it needs to while ultimately delivering a series of rushed soulless and illdefined points of logic its hopeful if your idea of hope is tragic and cyclical to the point of feeling regurgitated there are moments of optimism immediately staked through in heart in favor of the next big set piece its a cruel and unsatisfying ending to a fortyyear legacy and one that feels openly critical of itself and everything it stands for but shrugs its way to the finish line instead the disney era of lucasfilm was fit more for profit than integrity from the getgo and the need to rush out a new episodic film loaded with the originals stars felt as bankable as it was inevitable suffice it to say the star wars sequel trilogy attracted critics but the first two films shuffled through a variety of production woes to successful appealing conclusions jj abrams the force awakens paired a new cast of characters with our legacy trioluke skywalker mark hamill han solo harrison ford and leia organa carrie fishercreating a spark of whimsical magic that overshadowed its derivative setbacks rian johnson delivered a wild animal of a sequel with the last jedi  a surprising and frankly revolutionary studio blockbuster that turned the series larger story on its head it was as divisive as it was fertile with big new promising ideas the film ended with the force decentralized from a few exclusive bloodlines and democratized reigniting hope in the galaxy unfortunately the rise of skywalker picks up on none of those loose threads the film begins with a flippant dismissal of many if not all of the last jedis themes the opening crawl explains that emperor palpatine has inexplicably returned and i do mean inexplicablywe never learn how and has been orchestrating the first order experiment from the beginning somehow he groomed ben solo into kylo ren from afar and now locks his sights on rey from jakku our unruly orphaned force user and kylos counterpart from the outset abrams shrinks the star wars universe back down to a more immediately interconnected even insular size palpatine is back because uh sure why not the story plays out as antagonistically as that abrams returning as cowriterdirector to replace colin trevorrow demonstrates a bewildering sense of his audiences wants and needs does he think we dont care about the mysterious resurrection of the sagas most selfish and mystifying villain is he purposely leaving gaps in the story for canon material to fill in did he think a single thing out beyond looks cool feels ok boom bang who knows but the movie opens with the reintroduction of palpatine them immediately launches us into the millennium falcon where finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac quickly discover that theres a mole in the first order were then teleported to a new resistance base where leia trains rey daisy ridley in the ways of the force before were oriented in this location were shuffled into another adventure jampacked with macguffins whirlygigs and ultimately dead ends the adventure is poorly defined and confusing but abrams doesnt expect us to be smart hes content to race through every wouldbe meaningful moment at the quickest possible pace exploiting that whiplash effect to distract us from the storys garbled plotting we know that our heroes are on a race to find palpatine and are looking for something called a wayfinder that will lead them to his location there are only two wayfinders and kylo ren finds the other one in an opening scene abrams creates a sense of urgency but we dont really know why and no one seems convincingly terrified that the universe is on the brink of absolute annihilation at least the original trilogy only featured one death star at a time and developed centralized locations that defined personal stakes and brewed emotion this film has a whole army of planetdestroying ships locations with no names or personalities and characters previously emphasized who are here utterly left to the wind and thats the real failure of the rise of skywalker it mishandles literally every character  except arguably c3po rey gets tacked onto a legacy story that erodes the entire thematic heart of not just the last jedi but even abrams own the force awakens by some disgusting leap of imagination shes palpatines granddaughter reys parents werent actually alcoholics who sold her for drinking money a bit never reconciled but good people who loved her enough to protect her from gramps and apparently themselves finn john boyega is suddenly and inexplicably force sensitive which is a nice little treat and possible nod to the end of the last jedi but is only really employed to detect when reys in peril outside of one nice moment with jannah naomi ackie a fellow defected stormtrooper he meets on the road his arc from indentured villain to rebel hero goes largely unaddressed worse even his relationship with poe feels weirdly underdeveloped poe oscar isaac meanwhile is very much present but thats really all he is he became something of a de facto leader at the end of the last jedi but abrams fails to hint at any sense of real authority or growth here he bickers with rey and continues to act like a selfimportant flyboy echoing a roguish han soloesque fearlessness but where his presence is maximized his importance really isnt his story and leias should be more interconnected after she taught him a valuable lesson last time around but  the loss of carrie fisher unfortunately obstructs his development as a character using a mishmash of unused footage from the force awakens they try to conjure her spirit elsewhere but it doesnt totally work that said the movie at least attempts to do right by her legacy further leias death in the film helps create two of its best moments she uses a last ounce of strength to send kylo ren adam driver a memory of his father han who reappears with some paternal advice it should be a silly moment but tonally it absolutely works sold completely by the fine work of ford and driver as father and son reconnect kylo ren finally transforms back into ben solohe tosses his jagged lightsaber into the abyss and goes off to save rey who he loves this whole sequence is preceded by a lightsaber duel where kylo is left mortally wounded rey heals him and confesses her feelings for the man he could be loveand hopeseem temporarily destined to win and they do sort of the third act is where the rise of skywalker totally loses sight of everything its trying to be rey is drawn into palpatines lair and  theres a lot of business about sith and jedi that doesnt really make sense above them the war between the final order palpatines new name for the galactic baddies and the resistance rages a total lazy mirror to the end of return of the jedi palpatine wants to funnel his strength into rey via some ancient ritual but ben shows up ben and rey fight together against palpatine rey summons the spirit of all of the jedi who ever lived and she beats her grandpa with his own superpower in a very harry potteresque showdown before dying ben uses the last of his life power to resurrect hera nice mirror of their death star scene earlier in the filmand they kiss but he then dies leaving rey once again as the galaxys only real force of hope she temporarily reunites with the resistancewho defeated the final order with the help of lando calrissian billy dee williams appearing in the movie just long enough to serve as a deus ex machinabefore jetting off to tatooine and finally rey takes on the last name skywalker and sees luke and leias force ghosts the end unbelievably a lot more happens than that abrams introduces zorii bliss keri russell a fun masked exfling of poes whos super cool but completely inconsequential to the plot kelly marie trans rose tico effectively takes a resistance desk job which feels particularly insulting after everything she accomplished in the last jedi there are more force skype scenes between rey and kylo and rey confronts her own inner darkness manifested in dark rey while abrams introduces a cute new droid named do and throws a lot of other random things at the wall that never stick like a visit with the ghost of luke skywalker during a temporary detour to ahchto its as messy as it is ambitious and abrams and cowriter chris terrios deserve some credit for spinning such a clotted web that youre frequently distracted from all of the holes in it but then theres the whole hope thing and theres really no cohesive sense of it here as a seriesender this story should resonate more than it does the last jedi contends with the past more and better than skywalker does it wrestled with the sins of the jedi and sith and kicked open a bigger door for generations to come skywalker says nothing about where they or we go from here it ends with rey abandoned and alone except for her force ghost friends on another desert planet the  one person in the galaxy who ever understood her dies and he evidently doesnt redeem himself successfully enough to become a force ghost is death really the only avenue to peace and purpose effectively han solo luke skywalker and leia organa all died to save ben who then died to save rey what is her next step the movie doesnt say or seem to know its a domino effect with nothing but tragedy at the end of every spill that idea could work if the moments in between felt rewarding or the losses served larger narrative or thematic ideas but in this story meant to be a conclusion to a single film a trilogy and a ninefilm saga they dont rey finn and poe share only a superficial sense of camaraderie their future adventures will lead to moments of happiness and enlightenment along the way but why does abrams ignore or deemphasize those feelings in the rise of skywalker hope is little more than a ghost and after more than 40 years its one that star wars is still chasing with no real end in sight
