"Aug 7, 2023",positive,See this film for Ghostbuster laughs and a new era of Ghostbusters
"Dec 21, 2022",positive," The two movies on the top of my list were gender-bending and genre-breaking movies released early in the year. With a brilliant ensemble cast, outstanding writing and directing by Jocelyn Moorhouse, a cross-dressing police sergeant and couture to die for, “The Dressmaker” was a delightful feminist take on the spaghetti Western (and a timely antidote to 2015’s hateful “The Hateful Eight.”) “A Bigger Splash,” written by gay filmmaker Luca Guadagnino, starred Ralph Fiennes and Matthias Schoenaerts as ex-lovers fighting over rock star Tilda Swinton. Other contenders included three films from the year-end Oscar race: Isabelle Huppert’s mesmerizing performance in Paul Verhoeven’s provocative “Elle,” Natalie Portman’s stunning work in “Jackie” and Amy Adams’ transcendent portrayal of a linguist who saves the world in “Arrival.” The best LGBT movie of the year was the outstanding “Being 17” by the French auteur André Téchiné. Without a wasted word or shot, the film is a master work that offers a complex portrait of two teens and their families as the boys deal with both coming out and coming of age. A close runner-up is the powerful “Moonlight,” written and directed by Barry Jenkins and based on a play by Tarrel Alvin McCraney. While the pacing occasionally stumbles and the female characters are rather stereotypical, the film is a stunning portrayal of a young black man at three stages of his life and features sizzling performances by an amazing ensemble cast and lush cinematography by James Laxton. Other LGBT titles of note were “The Handmaiden” based on a novel by Sarah Waters but transported to 1930s Korea by director Chan-wook Park; “Little Men” by Ira Sachs; and, “Florence Foster Jenkins” which found not only the obvious comedy but an unexpected tenderness in the tale of a tone-deaf diva (Meryl Streep), her supportive husband (Hugh Grant) and her gay accompanist (Simon Helberg). Despite its terrible title (which does get explained during the film), the best documentary of the year was “Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You.” Directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady use some innovative techniques to create a multi-faceted portrait of a man whose groundbreaking television series challenged America’s ideas about gender, race, class and sexuality. The best LGBT documentary of 2016 was HBO’s richly layered “Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures,” an intricate examination of the provocative artist and his enduring legacy. The best foreign film of 2016 was Pedro Almodóvar’s heartfelt “Julieta.” Working with three short stories by Canadian author Alice Munro, the openly gay Spanish auteur moves from the worlds of camp and melodrama to a sharply-detailed gritty tale of grief and loss. The best animated movies of 2016 were “Finding Dory,” starring Ellen DeGeneres as a delightful blue tang with memory issues, and “Moana,” about a Polynesian girl who saves her island while singing some great songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton”), Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa’i. The oddest cinematic trend of the year was playing with the gender and sexuality of characters in established franchises in an attempt to bring fresh blood to stale stories. In one case, it worked. Despite some horrible Internet trolling by the likes of Milo Yiannopoulus, the all-female remake of “Ghostbusters” offered a fresh and fun spin on the classic testosterone-fueled comedy and featured Chris Hemsworth as a dim-witted himbo, delightful cameos by cast members from the original movie, and a wonderful breakout performance by lesbian comic Kate McKinnon. On the flip side of the trend, three flailing franchises suddenly discovered that already established characters were gay, revelations that did little to generate box office or critical notice. “Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising” outed frat boy Dave Franco. “Independence Day: Resurgence” revealed that Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) was still alive and was in a long-term relationship with partner Milton Isaacs (John Storey). To the dismay of George Takei, a brief scene in “Star Trek Beyond” reveals that the rebooted Sulu (John Cho) has a partner and child. The 2016 Hall of Shame includes two movies that tried to erase LGBT lives. The leaden Will Smith fantasy “Collateral Beauty” went to great lengths to depict a diverse Manhattan, except for the fact that no openly LGBT people are visible anywhere in the film. The turgid courtroom drama “Denial” focused on the legal battle between a renowned historian and a Holocaust denier, but failed to mention the LGBT victims of Nazi hatred. D.C.’s expanding film culture is supported by a variety of fine presenters across the region, including the four Landmark Theatres, the two Angelika theaters and the Avalon Theatre. D.C.’s vibrant film festival scene has become increasingly diverse, with great LGBT offerings this year at the D.C. Independent Film Festival, the Maryland Film Festival and Filmfest D.C., among others. As usual, strong support for the LGBT community was displayed by D.C. Shorts, the Washington Jewish Film Festival, AFI Docs and the Middleburg Film Festival, which brings a little Hollywood glamour to Virginia’s wine and horse country every fall. Reel Affirmations, D.C.’s international LGBT Film Festival, continues to bring excellent queer programming here through its monthly XTRA film series (which included the excellent debut film “Fair Haven”) and its annual festival (which included “LOEV” by the talented Indian filmmaker Sudhanshu “Suds” Saria). AFI Silver in downtown Silver Spring regularly includes outstanding LGBT programming in its amazing blend of contemporary independent films, stunning showcases weaving together classic films from Hollywood and world cinemas, and fascinating showcases of the latest international films. To round out the list of the year’s best movies, here are some other great movies to catch on DVD or VOD (“Eye in the Sky,” “Maggie’s Plan,” “Love and Friendship” and “The Lobster”) and some great performances to enjoy in theaters (“Loving,” “Manchester by the Sea” and “La La Land.” It might come as a shock to some comic book fans, but the idea of super heroes and super villains has always been very queer. Think about it: the dramatic skin-tight costumes, the dual identities and secret lives, the inability to fit in or connect because you are distanced from the “normal” world by your powers  – all the standard tropes that define this genre of pop culture myth-making are so rich with obviously queer-coded subtext that it seems ludicrous to think anyone could miss it. This is not to claim that all superhero stories are really parables about being queer, but, if we’re being honest some of them feel more like it than others; an obvious example is “Batman,” whose domestic life with a teenage boy as his “ward” and close companion has been raising eyebrows since 1940. The campy 1960s TV series did nothing to distance the character from such associations – probably the opposite, in fact – and Warner Brothers’ popular ‘80s-’90s series of film adaptations with gay filmmaker Joel Schumacher’s much-maligned “Batman and Robin,” starring George Clooney and Chris O’Donnell in costumes that highlighted their nipples, which is arguably still the queerest superhero movie ever made. Or at least it was. That title might now have to be transferred to “The People’s Joker,” which – as it emphatically and repeatedly reminds us – is a parody in no way affiliated with DC’s iconic “Batman” franchise or any of its characters, even though writer, director and star Vera Drew begins it with a dedication to “Mom and Joel Schumacher.” Parody it may be, but that doesn’t keep it from also serving up lots of food for serious thought to chew on between the laughs. Set in a sort of comics-inspired dystopian meta-America where unsanctioned comedy is illegal, it’s the story of a young, closeted transgender comic (Drew) who leaves her small town home to travel to Gotham City and audition for “GCB” – the official government-produced sketch comedy show. Unfortunately, she’s not a very good comic, and after a rocky start she decides to leave to form a new comedy troupe (labeled “anti-comedy” to skirt legality issues) along with penguin-ish new friend Oswald Cobblepot (Nathan Faustyn). They collect an assortment of misfit would-be comedians to join them, and after branding herself as “Joker the Harlequin,” our protagonist starts to find her groove – but it will take negotiating a relationship with trans “bad boy” Mr. J (Kane Distler), a confrontation with her self-absorbed and transphobic mother (Lynn Downey), and making a choice between playing by the rules or breaking them before she can fully transition into the militant comic activist she was always meant to be. Told as a wildly whimsical, mixed media narrative that combines live action with a quirky CGI production design and  multiple styles of animation (with different animators for each sequence), “People’s Joker” is by no means the kind of big-budget blockbuster we expect from a superhero — or in this case, supervillain — film, but it should be obvious from the synopsis above that’s not what Drew was going for, anyway. Instead, the Emmy-nominated former editor uses her loopy vision of an alternative “Batman” universe as the medium for a kind of mythologized autobiography, expressing her own real-life journey, both toward embracing her trans identity and forging a maverick career path in an industry discourages nonconformity, while also spoofing the absurdities of modern culture. Subverting familiar tropes, yet skillfully weaving together multiple threads from the “real” DC Universe she’s appropriated with the detailed savvy of a die-hard fangirl, it’s an accomplishment likely to impress her fellow comic book fans — even if they can’t quite get behind the gender politics or her presentation ot Batman himself (or rather, an animated version voiced by Phil Braun) as a closeted gay right-wing demagogue and serial sexual abuser. These elements, of course, are meant to be deliberately provocative. Drew, like her screen alter ego, is a confrontation comedian at heart, bent on shaking up the dominant paradigm at every opportunity. Yet although she takes aim at the expected targets – the patriarchy, toxic masculinity, corporate hypocrisy, etc. – she is equally adept at scoring hits against things like draconian ideals of political correctness and weaponized “cancel culture”, which are deployed with no quarter from idealogues on both sides of the political divide. This means she might be risking the alienation of an audience which might otherwise be fully in her corner – but it also provides the ring of unbiased personal truth that keeps the movie from sliding into propaganda and elevates it, like “Barbie”, to the level of absurdist allegory. Because ultimately, of course, the point of “People’s Joker” has little to do with the politics and social constructs it skewers along the way; at its core, it’s all about the real human things that resonate with all of us, regardless of gender, sexuality, ideology, or even political parties: the need to feel loved, to feel supported, and most of all, to be fully actualized. That means the real heart of the film beats in the central thread of her troubled connection between mother and daughter, superbly rendered in both Drew and Downey’s performances, and it’s there that Joker is finally able to break free of her own self-imposed restrictions and simply “be” who she is. Other performances deserve mention, too, such as Faustyn’s weirdly lovable “Penguin” stand-in and Outsider multi-hyphenate David Leibe Hart as Ra’s al Ghul – a seminal “Batman” villain here reimagined as a veteran comic that serves as a kind of Obi-Wan Kenobi figure in Joker’s quest. In the end, though, it’s Drew’s show from top to bottom, a showcase for not only her acting skills, which are enhanced by the obvious intelligence (including the emotional kind) she brings to the table, but her considerable talents as a writer, director, and editor. For some viewers, admittedly, the low-budget vibe of this crowd-funded film might create an obstacle to appreciating the cleverness and artistic vision behind it, though Drew leans into the limitations to find remarkably creative ways to convey what she wants with the means she has at her disposal. Others, obviously will have bigger problems with it than that. Indeed, the film, which debuted at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, was withdrawn from competition there and pulled from additional festival screenings after alleged corporate bullying (presumably from Warner Brothers, which owns the film rights to the Batman franchise) pressured Drew into pulling it back. Clearly, concern over blowback from conservative fans – who would likely never see the film anyway – was enough to warrant strong arm techniques from nervous execs. Nevertheless, “The People’s Joker” made its first American appearance at LA’s Outfest in 2023, and is now receiving a rollout theatrical release that started on April 5 in New York, and continues this week in Los Angeles, with Washington DC and other cities to follow on April 12 and beyond. If you’re in one of the places where it plays, we say it’s more than worth making the effort. If you’re not, never fear. A VOD/streaming release is sure to come soon.  There’s something about an anti-hero that appeals to us all. Why else would so many of our greatest stories revolve around a character whose behavior goes against everything we’ve been raised to believe is right? Actually, that question probably answers itself. For many of us, the things we are raised to accept about life in the human world often feel less acceptable once we’ve gone through a few years of adult experience, which tends to put us at odds with the so-called “norms” of conformity. Naturally, this can be frustrating from time to time – and while that might not be enough to make us go “rogue” without regard law or ethics, it’s certainly sufficient to fuel our guilty fantasies. That, along with the literary skills of Patricia Highsmith, the queer novelist who created him, is why the character of Tom Ripley has been engrossing us in various forms for nearly 75 years. The eponymous anti-hero of “The Talented Mr. Ripley” (originally published in 1955) went on to feature in three additional books by Highsmith, and was subsequently brought to life in multiple small-and-big-screen incarnations, perhaps most prominently by Matt Damon in Anthony Minghella’s 1999 film adaptation. These versions managed to skirt the book’s obvious queer subtext, but queer audiences recognized it anyway. Now, thanks to creator, writer, and director Steve Zaillian, Highsmith’s starry-eyed sociopath has returned in an eight-episode series – which pares the title down to the short-but-evocative “Ripley” – that debuts on Netflix April 4, and portrays his adventures with an eye toward honoring Highsmith’s intent while delivering the kind of up-front queerness that the author could never have dreamed of accomplishing in her heyday. Not that this “Ripley” is exactly “out and proud,” though the actor who plays him – Andrew Scott (“All of Us Strangers”) – certainly is. The acclaimed Irish thespian brings his own queerness to the table in illuminating a character whose survival depends on never calling attention to himself – and though the series moves the action ahead a few years to1960, it’s still a world where any hint of “deviance” is likely to draw suspicion. That’s the last thing Tom Ripley needs; he’s a con artist, the mid-20th-century equivalent of modern-day “phishing” scammers, grifting gullible marks from his squalid, one-room New York City apartment. He’s good at what he does, an anonymous figure hiding in a sea of strangers – but when a wealthy shipping magnate tracks him down with a request for help and the offer of an all-expenses-paid excursion to Italy, he sees it as an opportunity to change his life for the better. That opportunity, as it turns out, involves a barely remembered college acquaintance named Dickie (Johnny Flynn), whose post-graduation trip to Europe has become a years-long vacation on the Mediterranean coast from which his father – Ripley’s surprise benefactor – would like him to return. Sent on a mission to convince his old schoolmate to go home, he is instead spellbound by the idyllic seaside setting and opulent lifestyle that surrounds him – and also by Dickie himself. He ingratiates himself into the young man’s life, winning his sympathies despite some initial awkwardness. Not so easily persuaded is Dickie’s girlfriend, Marge (Dakota Fanning), whose lingering distrust must be overcome if Ripley is to enact his new master plan to claim Dickie’s life of expatriate luxury as his own. Thanks to its source’s relative familiarity, “Ripley” makes no effort to hide the fact that its anti-hero is a shady guy; we see from the start that he’s a liar and an opportunist. What Zaillian manages to do, unlike others who have adapted the novel, is move past a clinical focus on Ripley’s psychology to give us a less prosaic – and therefore more complex – interpretation of the character. Much of this comes from a script that echoes Highsmith’s hard-boiled style by framing the story (and its protagonist) in a shadowy, amoral universe, enhanced by the stylish black-and-white treatment delivered by Robert Elswit’s cinematography, which leans into both the paradigm-challenging Euro “art cinema” from the period of its setting and the gritty chiaroscuro contrasts of film noir, setting up an instinctual understanding that this narrative, like its visuals, is composed entirely in shades of gray. In the show’s engrossing first episode, this is a particularly effective hook, style coupling with context to underscore the bleakness of Ripley’s daily routine in New York, which is no less soul-crushing, perhaps, than the more lawful ones into which most of us are locked. Though we see that he’s a predator, it’s hard not to relate to his struggle, and by the time we get to the next chapter and meet Dickie and Marge, we’ve already entered a mindset in which easy ethical judgments become unconvincing and shallow. Our sympathies are effectively split; we’re either on nobody’s side or on everyone’s, and maybe it’s a little bit of both. Needless to say, perhaps, this tricky transference would not be possible without the presence of a consummate actor in the title role, and Scott fits the bill beyond expectation. Though at first he reads as a bit old for the character, that notion quickly disperses – indeed, his weathered features bespeak the effects of a hard-knock life, the kind that makes a person willing to do anything to break free. More crucially, the unmistakable authenticity of his inner life is communicated with exquisite precision, engaging our empathy even as we recoil from the Machiavellian logic that guides him, and the clear conflict between his not-so-hidden feelings for Dickie and the agenda to which he has committed is made all the more stark by the ring of queer truth that underpins the performance. It’s a tour-de-force turn by an actor whose skills become more breathtaking with each subsequent role. Fanning, whose equally adept performance provides a powerful counterpoint to Scott’s, is a strong contender for our sympathies, by virtue as much of the intelligence she brings as the peril into which it will eventually put her, and Flynn’s Dickie wears the weight and damage of his upper class status like a chain he can never quite break, making us dread the seemingly inevitable fate that awaits him even as we subliminally sign on to Ripley’s endgame with a sense of guilty (but unapologetic) satisfaction. Also notable is nonbinary actor Eliot Summers (child of former Police frontman Sting), who brings another level of queer identity into the narrative as another old acquaintance of Dickie’s that throws an unwelcome wrench into the works of Ripley’s plan. Based on its first two episodes, “Ripley” certainly lives up to the anticipation that naturally awaits any adaptation of a high-profile story, and reasserts the queerness of an author who boldly pushed boundaries as far as censors of her time would allow. That’s more than enough to warrant staying with it until the end – and, if audience numbers warrant a renewal, through additional installments that might chronicle the less well-known escapades spun in Highsmith’s sequels. What cinches the deal, though, is the masterful performance that takes centerstage, which represents yet another escalation – and well-deserved triumph – in the rise of the talented Mr. Scott. Not only that, but a surprising number of these movies – more accurately described as “neo-noir” to distinguish them from the formative black-and-white classics in this murkiest of all genres – are also very queer. We’ve seen Ethan Coen’s Tarantino-esque darkly comic lesbian road trip “Drive-Away Dolls” and the UK drag queen revenge drama “Femme”; now, from sophomore director Rose Glass (“Saint Maud”) comes “Love Lies Bleeding,” which might be queerest of the bunch so far. It might be the “noir”-est, too; though there are a lot of vagaries around the characteristics that are required for applying that label, one of the most essential qualities is surely a morally ambiguous story. And morality can’t get much more ambiguous than it is in this retro-nostalgic throwback tale set on the fringes of the Albuquerque underworld of 1989. That’s where Lou (Kristen Stewart) has been for her entire life, and where she continues to stay – working as the manager of a run-down gym – out of protective loyalty to her sister Beth (Jena Malone), despite a longtime estrangement from her father (Ed Harris) and a desire to distance herself from the shadowy family “business” that he runs.  Reclusive and guarded, she mostly avoids social interaction – until an aspiring bodybuilder named Jackie (Katy O’Brian) hitchhikes into town on her way to a championship competition in Las Vegas and in need of a place to crash. There’s an instant spark between them, which quickly leads to flaming passion. Unfortunately, it also leads to an incident of explosive violence which puts both of them not only into the crosshairs of Lou’s ruthless and powerful dad, but those of the law as well. There’s no need to say more than that in terms of synopsis; in fact, it would be unfair to the film, which unfolds with an exquisitely slow burn before igniting into a climactic powder keg as satisfying as it is gripping, because so much of the thrill comes from the feeling of uneasy expectation it delivers through its gradual revelation of details. Even without knowing more, however, it’s clear that there’s a lot going on in “Love Lies Bleeding” that doesn’t quite line up with the comforting ethics of a black-and-white worldview – and that, of course, is what gives it the kind of unpredictable edge that makes it both a tautly engrossing thriller and a deliciously subversive saga of queer and feminine empowerment. This latter quality is something it shares with movies like “Bound” – the 1996 debut feature by the Wachowskis, which pushed mainstream acceptance by presenting its lesbian protagonists in a realistic manner and refusing to frame them in the then-usual trope of “queer victimhood” – and elevates to a refreshingly contemporary tone while still reveling in homage to the stylistic flourishes of their era.  Indeed, Glass peppers her film with echoes from dozens from the past that so clearly provided inspiration in both its visuals and its themes; from the twisted duplicity of Clouzot’s “Les Diaboliques” to the chaotic irony of the Coens’ “Blood Simple,” from the slick-but-gritty nihilism of William Friedkin to the disquieting body horror of David Cronenberg and the transcendental surrealism of David Lynch, “Love Lies Bleeding” borrows liberally and unapologetically from an array of cinematic touchstones almost as exhaustive as the one employed by Greta Gerwig in “Barbie” – and, like Gerwig, manages to incorporate them all in a sort of “metasphere” that allows our recognition of them to enhance and inform her own piece. Far from coming off as derivative, the effect is something akin to a “mash-up” of iconic eighties and nineties films and genres that uses their easy familiarity to both pay open tribute and tickle our nostalgic fancy, even as they are deployed as the building blocks for something with a singular identity of its own. If you think that all sounds a little campy, you’re not wrong; there’s a definite element of tongue-in-cheek self awareness that permeates it, and a deliberate will toward underscoring the grimness of its outward scenario with the sly satire of its subtext. That, after all, is something else it shares in common with many of the older films it draws upon, in which “coded” characters and plotlines often served as subtle lampoons of the absurdly conventional messaging being conveyed on the surface. Camp is one of the oldest weapons in the queer artist’s arsenal, and Glass wields it like a pro. Yet while she might use it to undermine cliches and upend expectations, the director never lets it distract – for long, at any rate – from the deadly stakes of her story. With a tight, terse screenplay (penned by Glass alongside Weronika Tofilska) that patiently sets up the dominoes for us until we’re quivering in anticipation of their fall, “Bleeding” takes time to relish in the details – the quirks of its characters, the unspoken dynamics between them, the secrets they keep and the moments they choose to reveal them – while making sure every one of them serves to wind the tension tighter. The effort pays off in a series of escalating climaxes that we know are coming yet still manage to surprise, shock, and ultimately, thrill us. Gorgeous cinematography from Ben Fordesman helps, as does a period-perfect Tangerine Dream-esque score by Clint Mansell, but in such a character-driven film as this one, it’s always the actors who are most crucial to selling the director’s vision. In this case, Stewart and O’Brian are the linchpins, delivering a pair of deeply realized performances and a sultry-yet-sweet chemistry that wins us over almost before it does their characters. Both shine, with Stewart’s growth as an actor continuing to stretch her beyond her “Twilight” years and O’Brian’s earthy femininity bringing a welcome – and provocative – layer of gender ambiguity to the mix. Backing them up are fine supporting turns from Malone and Anna Baryshnikov, whose hypnotically oddball performance as a clingy admirer who complicates Lou’s newfound romance is a highlight – as is Dave Franco’s simultaneously hilarious and repellant performance in a role it’s best we let you discover for yourself. Finally, though, it’s veteran screen baddie Harris who dominates, filling us with the kind of irrepressible dread that the most memorable movie villains always inspire – all while sporting a set of over-the-top hair extensions that immediately (and intentionally, we’d like to think) call to mind Richard O’Brien’s Riff-Raff in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Because of its skillful blend of such campy bold strokes and a genuine spirit of righteous rebellion that makes even its most broadly ridiculous moments cut with both sides of their satirical blade, we find “Bleeding” to be a new addition to an ever-growing canon of “essential” queer movies – with the disclaimer that some of its “weirder” moments might leave some viewers a bit perplexed, and those with a low tolerance to “gratuitous” violence and uninhibited sex scenes will likely want to skip it."
"Aug 21, 2022",negative," It still surprises me to see 1984’s “Ghostbusters” venerated by so many. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s a fun movie with good characters, lots of big effects, and some really funny moments. But going back to my first viewing I never considered it to be the great film that others do. Perhaps that’s why I wasn’t up in arms when I heard the announcement of a remake featuring an all-female team. It also may be why I wasn’t excited for the remake. Well, the crummy trailers didn’t help either. Sadly the trailers and the movie have a lot in common. Now before I’m accused of mean, closed-minded misogyny remember, I’m no Ghostbusters fanboy or apologist. There are certainly those who have instantly dismissed the movie due to its female leads. But there are also those who have lashed out at any criticisms of the film regardless of their validity. The truth is the movie just isn’t that good. Not because women were cast. Not because of sexism. Paul Feig co-writes and directs what turns out to be run-of-the-mill popcorn movie fare. Pieces were in place for what could have been something fun and original. Instead it follows a fairly traditional summer blockbuster blueprint – (1)origin story, (2)buildup, (3)loud, unwieldy, CGI-heavy finale. There are moments where this new Ghostbusters shows promise. The first 30 minutes or so does a pretty good job of setting up the characters and showing how they come together. To the credit of the ladies, they do their best with what they are given, some better than others. There is also a really fun performance by Chris Hemsworth. In a funny bit of satirical gender swapping, Hemsworth plays an air-headed but good looking secretary. The film has a lot of fun with that. As for the new Ghostbusters, Kristen Wiig is particularly good and her quirky self-effacing humor is a perfect fit for her character. Melissa McCarthy is surprisingly dialed-back and I enjoyed the calmer variation of her usual tiresome schtick. Kate McKinnon has some really funny moments but she is also letdown by the script on several occasions. Leslie Jones is dealt the worst hand from the writers. Her character is paper-thin and given some of the worst lines in the entire movie. But again, the ladies give it their all. Here’s the thing, you can have the most committed cast, but that means nothing without a good script. Feig and co-writer Katie Dippold do a good job of developing the team’s camaraderie but not much past that. For every mildly amusing joke there are five that fall flat and some that are simply cringe-worthy. Storywise there really isn’t much to it once you get past the origin stuff. The Ghostbusters form. Everyone’s skeptical. Ghosts attack. Ghostbusters save the day. Basically everything outlined in the trailer. Andy Garcia shows up now and then as the New York City mayor, and there is an uninteresting villain (Neil Casey) tossed in to no effect. They offer little to the story which noticeably starts losing steam about halfway through and culminates in a long, effects-heavy ending which looks good but that’s about it. So what to make of “Ghostbusters”? While it may have been the most unfairly maligned film of the year prior to its release, it may also end up being the most overhyped movie of the year. Some people wanted the film to fail and never gave it a chance from the start. Others want it to succeed so bad that they are impervious to the film’s obvious flaws. But that stuff aside, it really is a shame. Instead of doing something memorable with the great chemistry we see from the cast, “Ghostbusters” settles for being another in a long line of mediocre 80’s movie remakes. This could have been something special, but instead, it’s just another forgettable modern comedy that happens to carry the title “Ghostbusters”. I wanted to love it, but left feeling severely underwhelmed. Exactly! With four talented leads, it was hard for this to go wrong. I think Sony should consider hiring a new director and screenwriter for the potential sequel. I was initially not going to see the film for a number of reasons.  1. The marketing was a complete disaster in every single way. 2. The film-makers’ response to people hating the trailers was absolutely atrocious. 3. The theme song by Fallout Boy and Missy Elliot.  That being said, I did go and see this one as well, and I was fairly entertained.  The four leads mostly did a good job and Chris Hemsworth was funny.  However, the entire movie basically portrayed men as total idiots.  Every single one.  The constant references to the original movie bugged the hell out of me and the cameo was were awful, especially Bill Murray’s.  A lot of the jokes landed fairly well while others didn’t.  But I do have to say, Kate McKinnon stole the show for me.  She was so much fun to watch.  The ghostbusting sequences are actually quite good, even thrilling at times.  Some of the visuals were a little sketchy, but mostly okay.  The villain, though, was a complete screw-job, and the ending to the film….oh, dear.  With all that said, it was NOT the train wreck that many were expecting.  Is it a good movie?  Not really  Especially not compared to the original film, of which I am a HUGE fan. Great point about the cameos. I’m glad you mentioned it. That was something that I thought was poorly handled. They basically seemed wedged in. They also didn’t help the film develop its own identity. And we definitely agree on the villain. Absolutely horrible. Lots of wasted potential though, right? I gave the movie a 7/10, so there was a great deal that I liked, and I’m curious where they go next, but this not the best way to reboot a franchise like Ghostbusters. I may be wrong but it looks like the film may fall short of $50 million for its opening weekend. That could be a really big problem going forward. Yep, except you need a lot more love for the original.  That first movie was very dependant on the guys to riff off the script, especially  Murray.  Here it just falls flat over and over. I like Wiig’s character but she does not work as the linchpin needed to make the crazy stuff hang together. Minus points for the horrible Fall Out Boy version of the theme. The first movie had good characters but did indeed center itself around Murray. This one has no character that can carry this one. And amen to the crappy version of the theme song. Give me Ray Parker Jr. any day! I be glad when you start talking about good new movies again. This movie is about thirty year old and outdated. Next thing you tellin me they re made it with a bunch of women in it. I ain’t got time to watch all this remake stuff I’ll wait when that Star Trek come out next week and watch something new. That’s what I was hoping for. Sadly I just didn’t come away that impressed. I did like the four ladies and their efforts but I felt the writing really let them down (some more than others). I will say that I liked some of it. Hemsworth and the ways the ladies worked off him were fun. Also in not a Melissa McCarthy fan but I did like her quite a bit in this one.  Haven’t seen Ghostbusters since I was a kid – like it then, didn’t love it. Should probably do a Ghostbusters run sometime with all of it and then see how it goes. Been really indifferent about this, to be honest. Indifferent? Rightly so. It certainly hasn’t presented itself well leading up to its release. The trailers were utter garbage. It wouldn’t go as far to call the movie that, but it has a ton of problems. It sure has people talking though. As for Ghostbusters…sigh. It doesn’t absolutely nothing beyond its unique casting to set itself apart from other bland summer popcorn movies. Were you a fan of the original?  And that’s a shame. Those people who criticize the film to those degrees without even seeing it have no credibility in my book. I was hesitant after the trailers but I couldn’t make any honest assessment without taking time to see it. Unfortunately it didn’t fully work for me.  ‘It still surprises me to see 1984’s “Ghostbusters” venerated by so many.’ This is exactly how I feel. Enjoyed it enough at the time and it was the first time as a kid that I’d seen Murray in anything, but I’m certainly not up in arms about a remake either. I’d say that it’s one of the better Ivan Reitman films that I’ve seen – which isn’t hard considering how his career panned out afterwards – but I don’t know if it’d even get into my top 10 Murray films. Anyway…haven’t actually seen this yet, but I might go tomorrow or Wednesday. Sorry to hear it was a disappointment…I’m hoping it’ll go the other way for me but not counting on it by any means! Oh man, for all of the hype (both senseless bashing and lofty exaltation) this thing is nothing more than your standard mediocre popcorn movie. Don’t get me wrong, I like some popcorn flicks. But for all of the hype saying this film was going to be a fresh and original experience, it literally checks so many boxes. Hopefully you will come away with more. I certainly wish I did. I’ve seen such a range of reviews I don’t quite know what will happen! There’s nothing else out here this week in the multiplexes so it’s either Ghostbusters or Now You See Me 2 for me. The reviews and chatter surrounding Ghostbusters is mind-boggling. Such a crazy range of reactions. I don’t know which surprises me most, the rabid hatred for the thing before it even came out or the immense love for a film that I feel would normally get treated pretty rough critically. It was weird to see those extreme views a few months ago. The internet is a horrible place sometimes. I guess some people do genuinely like the film and find it funny, but I keep reading the line that people are pushing back against the misogyny and overpraising it. Still…it’ll all be forgotten about by the end of July. I caught bit and pieces of the original Ghostbusters on TV, but it wasn’t until the 30th anniversary did I watch the entire film in theaters. Really liked Bill Murray in it. The reboot never got me excited unfortunately and I don’t plan on seeing it soon. It truly is a showcase for Bill Murray. He was really good. Unfortunately there isn’t much that could be called “really good” in the remake. Pretty generic, often unfunny, and not at all memorable. You won’t miss out by skipping this one. I’m not quite sure why they made a remake of this film instead of a reboot. I had no qualms with the female cast, but I thought the movie looked like shit after the first trailer, and I made my judgments from there. Nice review tho! The trailers were just awful. They certainly didn’t help promote the movie in a positive light. And the movie doesn’t help itself. Starts promising but it doesn’t end that way. Hi Keith! Having just seen the original, I’m even more baffled by the super negative reaction to this. Ah well, I don’t even want to give those haters my energy. Well, I did like this more than you did, mostly thanks to the terrific cast. I’m glad you still enjoyed it for the most part, but yeah I wish the script were better. The ladies do their best. The script just runs out of steam at the midway point. And as you said in your review, what a terribly uninteresting villain. Didn’t read this back when you posted it because I knew I would be seeing it soon. Finally got around to it, so here I am. I enjoyed it, thought it was pretty good. However, it is also extremely flawed. Like you said, the pieces are all there for a great movie, they just aren’t utilized correctly. Your take on McCarthy is interesting. She is dialed back. I found her too dialed back. I was hoping she would give me some of her bombastic shtick. And yes, Hemsworth was the best part of the movie. I think my take on McCarthy comes from my deep dislike for her shtick. It seems like she basically does the same thing in every film. That’s why I liked what she brought to this role. But I can see where her fans may be a bit disappointed. Lots of people herald the original as an absolute classic. I really like it but have never held in as high regard as many do. It’s still really fun. The remake…not so much. The original is now one of my favourite movies (I’ve become a definite “fanboy” – LOL).
The reboot isn’t as good as the original – and some parts of the climax felt slightly underwhelming – but I personally found it a rather fun (if somewhat mindless) fantasy comedy. It’s funny nothing in the reboot stands out to me except Chris Hemsworth. I literally don’t remember anything else. It left no impression on me."
"Apr 11, 2022",neutral," There’s a funny moment in the new Ghostbusters when Kristen Wiig reads YouTube video commentary aloud: “Ain’t no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts,” and then dismisses the comment as unnecessary. Since the first trailers for director Paul Feig’s all-female reboot appeared online, detractors have been vocal about their disdain for the concept of a female cast. Feig openly acknowledges and mocks the criticism in this scene; however, he fails to address or resolve what may become the most valid complaints about the film: it’s brash, poorly written, and completely unnecessary. Indeed, the four lady leads are actually the best thing about Feig’s comedy, whereas the film’s script is sloppy, its characters underdeveloped, and its reliance on the formula of the 1982 original is frustratingly unoriginal. In trying to pay homage, Feig’s film provides little more than an assemblage of recycled ideas presented by fresh faces for new commercial prospects. And rather than provide a showcase for the four comedian-stars (Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon), the secondhandedness of everything onscreen spoils any possibility of Ghostbusters succeeding on the merits of the talent involved. An unfortunate case of déjà vu lingers throughout the proceedings, as almost every plot point and character correlates to one in the original. Once again, white scientists studying the paranormal are sacked for the fringe nature of their scholarly pursuits, and then start ghostbusting for a living. Learned physicist Abby Yates (McCarthy) reluctantly joins her childhood friend Erin Gilbert (Wiig), and Erin’s weird-for-weird’s sake nuclear engineer friend Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon), to go into business for themselves catching ghosts. Once again, the newly formed “Ghostbusters” adorn tan jumpsuits and convert a hearse into their company car. And while Feig may have reformatted the material for a female cast, he doesn’t do anything innovative in terms of race. Once again, the fourth Ghostbuster is also the sole (token) African American. Patty, played by Leslie Jones, is not an academic, but a streetwise subway operator the other three meet on assignment. After becoming a Ghostbuster, Patty occupies a racial stereotype in which she’s all buggy-eyed and runs from ghostly danger, harkening back to minstrel shows. On the sidelines, the ladies hire a gimme-a-break dumb male receptionist in Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), whom Erin drools over. Feig uses Hemsworth as a comic non-sequitur in nearly every scene—from Kevin spitting out coffee to wearing glasses with no lenses, he’s present only as a running gag (until, that is, he becomes a plot device). The plot follows the same basic trajectory of Ivan Reitman’s original, enough to call Feig’s film a remake instead of a reboot. For some reason or another, paranormal activity in New York City has been going haywire. The Ghostbusters investigate and learn angry-at-the-world loner Rowan (Neil Casey) schemes to release the underworld realm on New York. Of course, the Ghostbusters must consult the nitwit mayor (Andy Garcia) and his bossy top aide (Cecily Strong) to justify their claims of an apocalypse. And by the finale, the power-packed foursome takes on a series of “ionized” apparitions, including a towering, familiar-looking baddie. Feig’s brand of comedy may appeal to modern audiences, but it’s also the characteristic that diverges most from the original. The humor of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and the late Harold Ramis may seem quaint and subtle compared to the over-the-top comic flamboyance composed by the director. Anyone familiar with Feig’s earlier work (Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy) knows his jokes are big, Big, BIG. He likes broad humor, particularly slapstick and trendy comebacks like “Really?” and overused lines like “Let’s do this”. At the same time, he also includes a cameo by Ozzy Osbourne who shouts, “Sharon, I think I’m having another flashback!”—a moment that feels more than a decade passed its prime. Lazy, throwaway moments such as these fill Ghostbusters, as well as cheapen it. Feig’s bright cast is wasted on his frustratingly messy script, which he wrote alongside Katie Dippold. In the Ray Stantz role, McCarthy is best when she’s geeking-out over some paranormal tidbit. She’s also no stranger to behaving outrageously, having done so in Feig’s last three features, and she has a few typical blundering McCarthy moments here. If there’s a Peter Venkman in the proceedings, Wiig fits the bill, using her awkward shtick in scenes with Hemsworth. McKinnon might serve as an Egon Spengler-type, except she’s not so much nerdy as just random and strange, behaving like an incohesive oddball in a Saturday Night Live sketch that’s carried on far too long. Jones occupies the same role as Ernie Hudson once did, and that’s a shame. None of these characters feel real or endearing, they’re all one-note, and none have even the slightest character arc. And so, when Erin saves Abby in a climactic green vortex, what should’ve been a touching moment feels empty. The other characters—the ghosts—range from familiar looking to kinda neat, and finally to nonsensical. Fans will groan about (re)appearances of Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (What? No Viggo love?), but jaws will drop at the so-bad-I-can’t-believe-I’m-seeing-this appearance of Slimer’s wife (a character soon to join Jar Jar Binks and Skids & Mudflap as one of the worst movie characters ever). The ghosts themselves are rendered with top-notch computer-animation, often glowing in smoky, neon wisps of color. They look tangible in a computer-generated kind of way, but they hardly compare to the practical, almost touchable photography effects used to create ghosts in the original. The FX are even less impressive when the arbitrary “ghost” of a dragon appears. How is this a ghost? Does this Ghostbusters exist in the same universe as Game of Thrones? It’s best not to spend too much time thinking about these things. The filmmakers haven’t—there’s very little logic about how the ladies fight ghosts. In the original, ghosts had to be captured, trapped, and contained. Here, the chaotic finale vomits out a swarm of spirits, and our heroes blast ghosts dead (again) with laser guns and grenades, apparently with no further explanation required. All the while, the franchise-ness of Ghostbusters radiates from the screen. Whether its McKinnon delivering an in-film Pringles ad or the four ladies enjoying a dinner of Papa John’s, the product placements appear throughout. Maybe I’m just reacting to the silly music video that plays over the end credits, but reboots are among the most commercially gratuitous, creatively uninspired products to come out of Hollywood. And yet, as a critic and moviegoer, I am not opposed to the very concept of a reboot; it’s just that, most of the time, they prove to be nothing more than grabs for cash. Every once in a while, something like Star Trek (2009) comes along and reminds us what is possible, but most of the time you end up with overly familiar nonsense like Total Recall (2012) or Point Break (2015). Studios treat beloved properties like the latest model of smartphone (Now with a new cast and modern CGI!); they make needless changes to reestablished old material and hope to make considerable bank on name-brand recognition. In a way, we should admire Feig for trying something sort-of different; had the reboot been an all-male cast, Ghostbusters would have seemed even more unnecessary than it does. But the story, including cameos by almost everyone from the original cast (not playing their former characters), and all-too-frequent nods back to Reitman’s film, demonstrates how, despite his gender-swapped cast, Feig rests on the laurels of the original classic. Had the director made a completely unrelated supernatural comedy starring these four women, but not referenced the original Ghostbusters in any way, the result probably would have felt only mildly derivative—but no less annoyingly commercial. Instead, Feig’s reboot plays like another forgettable addition to Hollywood’s long-running nostalgia craze. Worse, the ghost-busting comes in doses of loud, busily filmed nonsense, and its humor is about as subtle as a pie in the face. Getting worse and worse as it goes, Ghostbusters offers a few laughs early on, but then descends into the worst kind of Hollywood product."
"Feb 18, 2022",positive," The fanboys can put their proton packs away, there is no need to put this film into a trap where Ray, Peter, Egon, and Winston trapped ghosts 32 years ago. Ghostbusters is not the train wreck most people were anticipating it would be. As a matter of fact, the film is quite fun and the perfect example of what a summer blockbuster should entail. The issue of this film stems from its marketing. After the conclusion of the film, I can now say with confidence that this is one, if not the worst marketed films since 2000. The trailers were poorly cut, edited, and included scenes that were not even in the final cut of the film. Sony has had its fair share of failures in rebooting franchises including The Amazing Spider-Man and last year’s Fantastic Four reboot, so it was difficult for fans to embrace a reboot just based on past attempts from Sony. Ghostbusters ’16 is to Ghostbusters ’84 what Jurassic World  was to Jurassic Park,  a reboot with a similar story, structure and visuals. The film follows the format of the original as 3 paranormal enthusiasts, Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) discover a pending ghost invasion. To save Manhattan, they become the Ghostbusters. Transit worker/trivia expert Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) joins the group and offers her expertise on mass transit and architectural history. While the film does follow the same story structure as the original, catch one ghost early on, followed by a climactic finale, Feig does a fine job incorporating a back story to the characters. We understand why Erin and Abby have such a great bond, and why Holtzmann has a large input into the creation of the Ghostbusters. Leslie Jones who has been bashed based on the trailers to the film, for her seemingly unfunny comedic tone, does a fine job in this film and is a bright spot to the film. The chemistry between the four leads is what works best in this film. The dialogue all throughout brought back memories to the first time I saw Ghostbusters and the chemistry the original four had, lead by Kate Mckinnon. She absolutely owns this film, as she brings the Venkman charm and the Egon brains and molds them into her own fun, witty, sometimes strange Holtzmann. Every time she is on screen, she steals the show. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows as Ghostbusters does have plenty of flaws. The villain is a reminder of the issue Marvel films have suffered throughout their solid run. The villain’s motivation is weak and really feels like a place holder for the ghostbusters to eventually take down. While there were subtle nice cameos of old locations from the original, the cameos of the original cast, while most being nice to see, minus Bill Murray, affect the pacing of the film. There are moments where certain events are occurring and the film pauses just to scream “hey, look an original ghostbusters”.  Slimer makes an appearance with a female version of himself and it comes off tacky, unoriginal, and most importantly unneeded. While I don’t feel Ghostbusters 16 will have the staying power Ghostbusters 84 had, it does what it intended to do. It’s an entertaining film that respected its predecessor. If you were against this film being made because of the love of the original, you will still find reasons to dislike this film; however, if you go into it with an open mind, then maybe, just maybe Ghostbusters might just entertain you."
"Aug 18, 2021",positive," The timing is certainly coincidental. In the same week that’s witnessing the release of Ghostbusters, a new scientific study (I believe conducted at Johns Hopkins University, but don’t quote me on that) has conclusively revealed that the brain size of MRAs, misogynists and other militant morons is larger than a penny but smaller than a quarter. The test, which originated in the wake of the release of 2008’s Sex and the City and entered the home stretch as Mad Max: Fury Road was hitting theaters last summer, serves as the bookend to a similar study that yielded the exact same results among racists around the time the Annie remake starring Quvenzhané Wallis was playing multiplexes. As was emphatically declared in a Thomas Dolby music video, “Science!” Yet the interesting component is that, as this reinterpretation of the beloved 1984 Ghostbusters gets underway, it appears as if maybe, for the first time in their entire worthless lives, the social suicide squad of female-fearing fanboys will be right — albeit, of course, for the wrong reasons. After a mood-setting prologue, the film doesn’t start so much as lurch forward, and the inclusion of some unnecessary and unfunny scatological humor suggests that maybe rebooting this franchise wasn’t such a great idea if the end result was basically going to be a gender-swap The Hangover with a higher CGI budget. But as the script by Paul Feig (who also directs) and Katie Dippold (a writer-producer from Parks and Recreation and MADtv) gets its bearings, as additional characters are added to the roster, and as the gags start to rely less on locker-room humor and more on the comic abilities of the cast, Ghostbusters soon takes off and never looks back. Is it better than the original? Ix nay, although the distance between the two is perhaps closer than anyone will care to admit. And despite some terrific contributions from the newcomers, there’s no ‘buster quite as glorious as ’84-vintage Bill Murray, whose deft turn was one for the comic ages. But to be clear, this is no rancid Ghost trek so clueless and self-centered that it soils memories of the original; if anything, it enhances it, with some nicely placed cameos (even the late Harold Ramis, sort of) and clever allusions to the original (be sure to stay through all the credits to catch a teaser not unlike the grabber that closed Batman Begins). Wisely, Feig and Dippold don’t make their stars female versions of the boys from back in the day (e.g. Peter Venkman hasn’t suddenly become Patricia Venkman) but rather come up with new characters for them to inhabit. Kristen Wiig is, comparatively speaking, the calm one — she’s Erin Gilbert, a scientist who tries to bury her ghost-dabbling past as she’s set to attain tenure at a prestigious university. But that’s easier said than done since her former partner in the paranormal, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), has been hawking their previously published novel on the subject all over the Internet. As expected, Erin does not attain tenure but she does develop a reenergized interest in ghosts, joining with Abby and her lab mate Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) as they investigate some unusual activities occurring around the Big Apple. And once their outfit is enhanced by the presence of MTA worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) and possibly hindered by the addition of dumb-as-a-brick receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), all the team now requires is a catchy name and a catchy logo. Wiig and McCarthy are fine playing within their normal parameters, so it’s the support staff that yields the largest dividends. Jones is very funny as a woman whose common sense occasionally (and understandably) takes a back seat to hysteria, while Hemsworth builds on the comedic promise he displayed in last year’s Vacation with an absolutely riotous portrayal of a hunk so lunk-headed, he covers his eyes whenever he hears a loud noise. Best of all is McKinnon, who never seems to stay still as she infuses Holtzmann with reams of eccentric personality. The picture becomes heavy with visual effects spectacle in the final act, but because the creatures on display are a far cry from the usual dinosaurs, spaceships and Transformers, even this section manages to remain inventive and eye-popping. The smartness of the script not only informs the nods to the original (marshmallow, anyone?) but also directly addresses the tantrums thrown by the nation’s man-boys, from a nice line about the bullying of women to the fact that the villain of the piece (played by SNL scribe Neil Casey) looks exactly like the sort of keyboard warrior who spends his Friday nights anonymously bashing women online (as someone accurately notes, “It’s always the sad, pale ones”). Whether on its own fearless terms or even as an update of a zeitgeist-charged smash, Ghostbusters proves to be an oasis of entertainment in the midst of this cinematic summer drought — a pop-culture popcorn picture designed to raise spirits in more ways than one. How can you claim that people who don’t like it are misogynists? It was a genuinely bad movie and completely unnecessary. I was looking forward to it, until I found out it was a reboot and not a sequel. 9 out of 10 remakes. reboots are worse than the original and this one falls right into that ratio.
You claim they aren’t female versions of the males? They are direct flipped-gender versions. Did you watch the original? It’s 100% obvious! The only one who wasn’t, was the secretary. They turned Janine into a ditzy muscle-bound dude.
It was filled with crass humor and the humor that wasn’t vulgar, just wasn’t funny. They relied too heavily on the special effects, which was the only thing that didn’t suck. It was pretty to look at but everything else fell flat.
I like Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon, but even they were bad in this movie. I don’t blame them. I blame the pacing and the plot.
I will admit, I was more critical of it because I thought they would to the smart thing and say they were the daughters of the original Ghostbusters or something similar, but I tried it. I watched it and I hated it.
I am especially disappointed that some complaints about the new movie is that they are ignoring the 2016 movie. Well, the 2016 movie ignored the previous 2 movies. The 2016 was a flop. Most people didn’t want it nor like it. Making a sequel to the GOOD movies was the smart way to go. If you have a foundation made of concrete, you don;t rebuild it out of glass and then get made when people choose to go back to the concrete foundation to build off of. Thanks for writing, Chuck. If you note, I wasn’t referring to everyone who saw the film; obviously, there are many (such as yourself) who genuinely didn’t like it. My comments were directed at the fanboys who (among other juvenile activities) blasted it sight unseen simply because it starred women, wrote awful, racist things about Leslie Jones to the point she had to leave Twitter, and repeatedly whined, “This movie is ruining my childhood!” (Pretty sorry childhood, right?)"
"Apr 2, 2021",positive," From the moment it was first announced back in 2014, director Paul Feig’s reboot of Ghostbusters has been the focal point of debate. A depressing amount of that discussion has centered on the decision to go with four (very funny, very talented) women in the lead roles, but the real question — for sane, rational people, at least — is the one that lingers over any reboot, remake, or sequel these days: Does the movie justify the decision to start over? Fortunately, while Ghostbusters does indeed stumble and occasionally feel more like 1989’s Ghostbusters II than the 1984 original, the final product not only does the franchise proud, but leaves you wanting more adventures with its all-new team. Co-written by Feig and his screenwriter on The Heat, Katie Dippold, Ghostbusters casts Bridesmaids actresses Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy as a brilliant particle physicist and an expert in the paranormal, respectively, who find themselves caught up in an investigation of spectral pests plaguing Manhattan. They’re assisted by an eccentric engineer played by Saturday Night Live cast member Kate McKinnon and a former subway station worker played by fellow SNL veteran Leslie Jones. To their credit, the cast of Ghostbusters does a nice job of creating some distance between their characters and those of the original film’s stars. Naturally, the team’s investigation leads to the discovery of a far more sinister threat facing the city, and the Ghostbusters soon find themselves in the role of reluctant heroes as they face off against a villain whose diabolical scheme could put an end to the world — or at the very least, New York. As far as reboots go, Ghostbusters is positioned in a comfortable place at the midpoint between slavish, shot-for-shot remakes and movies that share nothing in common with their source material beyond a title. To their credit, Feig and Dippold break new ground where necessary, but still seem to keep the original 1984 film just below the surface of their story. Many of the over-arching plot points echo the original, from the down-on-their-luck scientists treated like frauds who step up to become heroes, to the story’s reverence for New York City and its role as a nexus of sorts for paranormal phenomena. The movie also doesn’t shy away from overt call-backs to the original, with much of the 1984 film’s primary cast appearing in the reboot in cameo roles (and in the case of one particular cast member, a bit more than a cameo), and more than a few tongue-in-cheek references to elements of the first film that have found their way into the collective memory of fans. While the motivation behind all of the call-outs and cameos is obvious, at times, all of the nostalgia does weigh down the story Feig is trying to tell. Fans might enjoy the sight of so many familiar faces and lines from the original film, but those elements rarely feel organic and occasionally end up stalling an otherwise fun story right as it gets rolling along on its own momentum. To their credit, the cast of Ghostbusters does a nice job of creating some distance between their characters and those of the original film’s stars. There are few surprises to be found in the performances of Wiig and McCarthy, who play to their strengths and essentially play smarter, scientist-type versions of the characters they’ve had so much success playing in the past. Wiig’s Erin Gilbert is equal parts ambitious and awkward, while McCarthy’s Abby Yates is simultaneously confident and a little bit flakey. They’re the sort of characters both actresses do well with, and to their credit — and to the credit of Feig and the Ghostbusters creative team — they’re not simply female analogs of the male characters in the original film. Fans of the two actresses will find a lot to like about this new setting for them to continue doing what they do best. In the role of the team’s quirky tech expert, McKinnon shines as Jillian Holtzmann. At times, Holtzmann feels like an embodiment of all of the best parts of the original film’s Ghostbusters, brimming over with confidence and intelligence to spare, and not giving a damn what anyone thinks — or which safety concerns she might need to overlook to get the job done. She’s a butt-kicking science warrior on a quest to know the unknown, and she absolutely, positively isn’t afraid of any ghosts. Jones’ Patty Tolan is a subway station worker whose encounter with a ghost leads her to the Ghostbusters who eventually make her part of the team. Tolan is the closest thing to an analog the film has with its 1984 counterpart. Jones’ character is every bit the outsider that Ernie Hudson’s Winston Zeddmore was in the original Ghostbusters, and serves much the same purpose in the story. She’s the audience stand-in caught up in a wild, supernatural adventure, and although she gets more screen time than the underused Hudson did in the original film, their characters essentially exist for the same reason: to hold a proton pack and be the team’s voice of common sense and rational thought amid all of the scientific and supernatural chaos. Jones does a fantastic job with what she’s given, but her role is limited. The film’s post-credits scene (yes, you’ll want to stay through the credits) suggests that she’ll play a far more integral, active role in the team’s investigations down the road — if there is a sequel, of course. The film also features a fun performance by Thor star Chris Hemsworth, who plays the team’s meathead receptionist, Kevin. The superhero actor does a surprisingly good job with the comedy and holds his own alongside some pretty formidable funny actors, but does overstay his welcome with more screen time than seems necessary for a film about the Ghostbusters (not their receptionist). Janine never got this much time in the original. If there’s one flaw that permeates Ghostbusters, it’s the film’s reliance on some pretty heavy digital effects for its ghost characters — effects that occasionally feel too cartoony. Texture is often the key to selling digitally created elements, and far too many of the specters and paranormal pests in Ghostbusters feel like flat images on a screen instead of characters in the story. It’s a problem in more and more movies as Hollywood leans heavily on digitally created elements. The issues with Ghostbusters shouldn’t be construed as a vote against computer-generated effects (or for practical effects, for that matter) but more of an example of what could use more attention in a sequel. Feig and the Ghostbusters team have built a strong foundation for a rebooted series that — despite all of the issues that come with a nostalgia-laden property like this one — seems more than capable of standing on its own. Even where Ghostbusters falls short, the film shows a tremendous amount of potential for the characters (more Holtzmann, please) and the franchise down the road. Sometimes, the most popular movies on Netflix are not the best movies on the streamer. Case in point: M. Night Shyamalan's Glass is currently at No. 3, and that film somehow pulled off the unique feat of retroactively making Shyamalan's previous movies in his superhero franchise, Unbreakable and Split, a lot less fun. That's why we're specifically putting the spotlight on a terrific movie, Amadeus, as it celebrates its 40th anniversary this year by streaming on Netflix. We're also featuring The Bricklayer, an action thriller that will probably be on top of Netflix's movie charts by the end of the weekend. This film barely registered at the box office, but that's never stopped the Netflix effect before. Almost every big movie that was once on Peacock inevitably arrives on Amazon Prime Video. That was part of the deal that Universal Pictures struck with Amazon, so the studio shouldn't be too upset when a new arrival on Prime Video like The Exorcist: Believer suddenly becomes a bigger streaming hit there than it ever was on Universal-owned Peacock. Similarly, Universal and Illumination's Minions: The Rise of Gru is also experiencing a surge in popularity on Prime Video after its recent arrival. So horror fans and comedy lovers both have something fun to watch as they head into the weekend. Fair warning: the rest of Prime Video's new arrivals are pretty light through the end of April. But as you can see in our complete roundup of the best movies on Amazon Prime Video right now, you still have more than enough options to get through to next month. April will be a huge month for sci-fi on Netflix with the release of Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. The film is the second half of Zack Snyder's epic space opera and streams on Netflix on April 19, 2024. Rebel Moon fans will also get to see Snyder's R-rated cut of the movies, similar to how the filmmaker released his ""Snyder cut"" for The Justice League.

"Mar 4, 2021",positive," Director Paul Fieg and Company are not the Ruiners of Your Childhood. Your youthful “Ghostbusters” memories are alive and well, in your head, in your DVD drawer or digital download file folder. Ghostbros, upset their 1984 favourite is being rebooted with an all female cast, flooded the internet with low-to-no star reviews. As it turns out, the time they spent trying to torpedo a movie they had not yet seen, might have been better spent making room on their basement shelves for the new “Ghostbusters” figurines. Feig hasn’t desecrated a classic, he has added a new chapter, creating a light and fluffy concoction that moves the franchise into the future while paying homage to the past. When we first meet Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) she’s a professor at Columbia trying to hide her past as a paranormal investigator. When a ghost-hunting book she co-wrote with Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) comes to light she is let go. Like Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler before her, she leaves academia and becomes a professional New York City ghostbuster alongside Abby, proton pack engineer Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and former subway worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones). After making a name for themselves they uncover a major plot hatched by hotel janitor Rowan North (Neil Casey). Upset his genius has been ignored by the world, he plans on unleashing an army of undead to come back and “pester the world” in an event he calls the Fourth Cataclysm. He has created a vortex that will allow whatever it is on that plane to come crashing down on this plane and flood New York City with ghosts. By the climax the movie dissolves into regular summertime C.G.I. tomfoolery as the Ghostbusters battle spirits in Times Square. There is a sense of déjà vu hanging heavy over “Ghostbusters.” The new film doesn’t continue the original story, it reboots it, taking us back to the origins of the group. In other words, it’s a lot like the 1984 movie. From class four semi-anchored entities and proton streams to cameos from Slimer, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, Annie “Ghostbusters, whaddaya want?” Potts plus a glimpse of a Harold Ramis statue, the movie feels familiar but has been freshened up. The cast doesn’t try to imitate Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson. The new characters are just that, new creations plunked down into an existing world. McCarthy and Wiig, reteamed for the first time since “Bridesmaids,” are solid and Jones is a formidable presence but most interesting is McKinnon as engineering nerd Holtzmann. She is unapologetically weird, as strange as her unruly asymmetrical haircut and a glorious addition to the “Ghostbusters” family. Also welcome is Chris Hemsworth as the dippy receptionist who doesn’t have glass in his eyeglasses and says things like, “An aquarium is a submarine for fish.” He’s a walking non sequitur and very funny. Like the old Abbott and Costello horror comedies, “Ghostbusters” doesn’t have any real scares but it will make you laugh. The script, co-written by Feig and “Parks and Recreation” writer Katie Dippold, is funny, if not exactly in a slap the knee kind of way, then in a slow boil constant giggle respect. Is it an out-of-this-world hit like Feig’s “Bridesmaids” or “Spy”? No. It occasionally suffers from a weird rhythm where scenes end suddenly and at least one of the cameos feels wedged in, but the overall effect is one of a respectful resurrection of a beloved franchise. Best of all, it is self-aware. Reading on-line comments Erin comes across one that reads, “Ain’t no bitches going to hunt no ghosts.” Later Abby says, “Don’t read what crazy people write in the middle of the night online.” Are you listening Ghostbros?

"Mar 3, 2021",positive," I don’t think there was a person in the world who didn’t hear the outcry of butthurt fans after the first Ghostbusters trailer dropped. It quickly became one of the most controversial summer movie trailers, gaining nearly twice as many dislikes as likes on YouTube. The polarizing reactions came partially in context to the plot, and largely towards the casting of the protagonists as female instead of male. I’ll be the first to say that as a person who has never seen the original (sue me, I’m 24 with Chinese immigrant parents, this was not apart of my childhood repertoire) the trailer made me a little apprehensive. I’ve heard all these praises about the original film my entire life, and I definitely didn’t need an article or to see the ratings to know that the fans would dislike it. As with most reboots these days — and there have been a choking amount of them to swallow — Ghostbusters remade the original film. It was not a sequel, but a remake that is nearly the same as the original save the genders of the main characters. To me it felt a little contrived, with some funny jokes and CGI to jazz up the story. I agreed with the sentiment that keeping the racial dynamics the same felt like a step back, that the casting of the main protagonists was used as a business move to buffer the film from critics by using the defense of accusatory sexism. However, I took a step back from it, like I do with almost all the movies I review, and stayed away from the promotional material to walk in with an untarnished view. I could have had watched the original and done a comparison, but I wanted it to be unfiltered by a lens that so many have worn. Without the original movie bias, it’s been easy for me to see some of the choices that were made in creating this film. To me, this movie was a movie about four people fighting ghosts in New York. I went in with few expectations and I had a good time. With little knowledge of the plot of the original or anything about the characters other than an overplayed theme song and well-known aesthetic, Ghostbusters just felt like another summer movie to me. The plot was goofy, in the same way that movies in the 80’s are typically http://premier-pharmacy.com/product-category/cholesterol-lowering/ goofy. In the same way that movies now are kind of goofy, looking at you Now You See Me. Without knowing the plot, the twist is unexpected and adds to the strength of the movie: the comedy. The CGI was bad, but in a way that was kind of good at the same time. You don’t really need ghost CGI to look real, you know it’s fake. I think I’ve watched enough Ghost Adventures to know that ghosts are orbs and light flecks, not green and blue and shimmery. But the movie wasn’t bad, not by a lot. The leading ladies have a great rapport with one another, and it plays very well on the screen. They work off of each other’s comedic flare and stylistic humor. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig play perfectly off one another as estranged best friends/ghost hunters, Leslie Jones is on fire with her witty lines and relatable character, and Kate McKinnon nails the performance as the eccentric engineer and mad scientist. Are there issues with the racial casting? Yes, definitely. It’s almost painfully obvious when a black, blue-collar working woman is standing in a room full of white female scientists babbling on about protons that the racial profile is a dated one that doesn’t really fly with many of the audiences today. But then again, you could say that the gender profile is progressive, and yet many audiences had an almost instantaneously negative reaction to it. That is by no means a justification for the racial casting, but it’s a remains to be a vocal observation. The film itself is littered with cameos, and chock full of humor. One thing I’ll say is that I never stopped laughing while watching the film. The leading actresses are effervescent and breathe a lot of life into a stale plot. Same goes for Chris Hemsworth’s rendition of an pretty-but-dumb airhead secretary, which he acts out in superb fashion. It seems like they could be headed towards a sequel, given the way it leads into a mention of a certain well known figure from the original film in the post-credits scene. However, this seems to be a hopeful stinger mixed in, and on the whole it is a film that can stand on its own firmly, ending strongly. Final Thoughts: The graphics are probably as rough as they were in 1984, and the plot is nothing fresh, but the comedy still lands solidly and the leading actresses pull off their roles with perfect ease that make this remake enjoyable summer movie fun. (The diehard fanboys will likely still hate it, but who is surprised?)"
"Feb 11, 2021",positive,"Ghostbusters is fun, it's silly, and it doesn't take itself too seriously."
"Dec 23, 2020",negative," Since 1989, Dan Aykroyd and Ivan Reitman have been trying to bring another Ghostbusters into theaters. The pair found very little success with writing a good enough script and getting the team back together with Bill Murray very resistant to return to the franchise. However, in early 2015, Columbia Pictures announced the Ghostbusters would be rebooted with an all-female lineup and Paul Feig in the director’s chair. The end result features a lot of laughs and genuine scary moments, but falls short of capturing the same “lightning in a bottle” that the original Ghostbusters created in 1984. The film follows Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), a pair of scientist who started off their careers as specialists in paranormal activity. Over the years, Gilbert moved towards legitimate science, while Yates kept up with investigating ghosts and unexplained phenomenon with her partner, Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon). When Gilbert and Yates reunite after a number of ghost sightings in New York City, they start a business with former MTA-worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), who turns to the scientists after she encounters a ghost in a subway tunnel, to further investigate why the city is a hot bed for the paranormal. Ghostbusters feels like it belongs in the franchise as a clever comedy with a touch of horror. However, it also seems to be middling when it comes to constructing a smooth story. It really feels like everyone involved was hamstrung into making fans happy, as if the backlash really did get to them. Time and time again, the movie gets in the way of itself when it shoehorns in a number of references to the original. This is called “fan service” and it hurts the new Ghostbusters when it comes to its storytelling. Why can’t movies just be movies? Why do reboots and sequels have to keep paying tribute to what came before it? Why does a franchise movie like Ghostbusters continuously “wink and nod” to a fan base instead of paving its own path? The most frustrating part of watching Ghostbusters is when the story and laughs have to stop, so Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and the rest of the original cast can appear on screen to wink at the audience. Afterwards, the story and comedy have to re-start and move forward, only to stop again for the next cameo and reference. Although Paul Feig has been brilliant in balancing laugh-out-loud moments with heartfelt ones, Ghostbusters suffers from constant fan service. One of the things that the movie does best is its ensemble comedy surrounding the wonderful chemistry with the cast, including Chris Hemsworth, who plays the Ghostbusters inept assistant Kevin, and Andy Garcia, who plays the Mayor of New York. However, the real star of the movie is Kate McKinnon as nuclear engineer Holtzmann. From the moment she’s introduced on the screen, the character practically steals every scene she’s in with unexpected cleverness and wit. Ghostbusters is a goofy reboot that really uses its 3D formatting to good use. The new movie is presented with an IMAX 3D option, which takes advantage of the format. Images popped out of the frame to give a complete experience, as it were coming alive in front of you. Feig and cinematographer Robert Yeoman really take advantage of 3D, while playing around with what we expect from blockbuster filmmaking. It’s quite impressive! The new Ghostbusters isn’t as tight as the original but it does have flourishes of real subversive comedy. The cast and filmmakers really play with audience expectations but unfortunately they do not fully realize the potential of what they can do."
"Dec 4, 2020",negative," fter casting aside her lifelong dream of scientifically verifying the existence of the supernatural, physics professor Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) now focuses all of her efforts on gaining tenure at Columbia University in New York City. But she’s expelled from her job when former friend and colleague Abigail Yates (Melissa McCarthy), an expert in metaphysics, involves her in a rather public expedition to capture a ghost in a haunted mansion. The experience finds her unemployed but with a renewed passion for the paranormal – so together with Abigail, her technologically-proficient assistant Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), and former subway employee Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), who was recently confronted by an unfriendly apparition, the group sets up shop as the “Ghostbusters.” With a monopoly on the industry and an unusually high number of spectral beings appearing around town, they quickly perfect the art of nabbing the incorporeal. As the sightings rapidly increase, the Ghostbusters determine that something sinister is afoot, and must attempt to locate the source of the unearthly disturbances before an unspeakable terror is released onto the city. There are so many homages and cameos and references to the original film that this remake practically demands that audiences familiarize themselves with the existence of the 1984 property. Ironically, that’s the last thing this latest incarnation should require; instead, it should have desperately attempted to distance itself from its predecessor – to introduce unknowledgeable viewers to a fresh take on the lighthearted tracking and apprehending of paranormal entities. But especially with its story, which so briefly touches upon the “why” and the “how” of identifying and capturing ghosts, this 2016 reboot expects moviegoers to be well versed in the business of ghostbusting. Sadly, that’s not the biggest problem. The most disappointing component is the complete lack of chemistry between the leading foursome. They have scant camaraderie, no emotional connections, and zero repartee. When they do make jokes, they’re all of the juvenilely inappropriate kind, such as commentary on flatulence and bodily excretions. There are also a few pop culture nods and updated technologies, but the inability to land solid one-liners and the overdependence on sci-fi jargon really stifles the laughs. Despite fleetingly curious cat jokes or graphic design spoofs or the witty sexual remarks about hunky yet dimwitted receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), the role reversal gimmick wears off quickly. And when all four of the stars act as if they’re participating in different projects (McCarthy does her usual routines full of exasperating complaining and Wiig plays her typical tyrannized underdog, while McKinnon is the oddball nerd and Jones is the enthusiastic streetwise warrior), it all becomes hopelessly incompatible, with no one working toward a harmonious sense of humor. “You have done this before, right?” There’s a lot of slapstick, but none of it is exceptional; disbelief is a bigger opponent than otherworldly scheming; the theme music is remixed and reshaped for modern audiences, though it only reminds of the much-loved, campy, dated feel of the original, which can’t possibly fit nicely here; and the special effects receive a boost of CG but essentially duplicate the ideas previously manifested. Nothing about this production is particularly thrilling or funny; it’s crushingly uninspired and very, very slow. Numerous concepts are entertained but drop off abruptly, including Erin’s backstory, Jillian’s resemblance to Q from the 007 films, and explanations as to why the initial ghosts are tormented souls of dead people but the later phantasms are gargoyles or blobby balls of goo. And there’s no sensibility to the designs or explanations – which matches the absence of passion and purpose. It’s painfully evident that writer/director Paul Feig just didn’t know what to do with the notion of revisiting a cult classic franchise.

"Sep 8, 2020",positive," I became a different human being that day. A better human being. I wanted this tiny, wondrous, and miraculous human being in my arms to have every opportunity to chase every dream and to explore every opportunity her heart and mind desired. I wanted her to never live a day without realizing she was loved, adored, accepted, celebrated and valued for exactly who she was. I wanted to be a positive role model for her, something I hadn't particularly been up to that point in my life. But, I knew I had to change. I mean, sure, I knew that her parents would raise her up to be talented and strong and compassionate and intelligent. But, yeah, I wanted to be part of that journey. I wanted her to have role models who would remind her that she could achieve the impossible, tackle the terrifying and become the superhero of her own life. Growing up, she loved Xena. Heck, I think she still does. Xena is this badass warrior princess who is intelligent and strong and, well, just pretty awesome. Xena wasn't really my thing, but you know how it is when you love someone, right? You try your damndest to love what they love. And god, I loved that she loved Xena and not some wimpy ass Barbie. Now, here we are. It's 2016. She's a young graduate student in her mid 20's studying criminal justice. She is simply extraordinary. She's loyal and kind and remarkably intelligent and talented and, if I may say so myself, she's a total badass. I thought of Victoria as the closing credits rolled by after having watched Ghostbusters, the second coming of the 1984 classic that has had fanboys up in arms for months at the thought of a Ghostbusters remake with, gasp!, an all-female squad of badass, funny and intelligent women prepared to fight the paranormal and, yeah, save New York in the process. To be fair to the haters, and to make sure I don't build up this reboot too much, I will acknowledge that on one point you are absolutely right - Ghostbusters is not a new comedy classic. It's not. It doesn't reach the dizzying heights of comedy that have allowed the original to remain such a beloved film over thirty years later. But, Ghostbusters is a good film. It's a damn good film with a terrific cast, a decent story and amped up special effects that come courtesy of thirty years of technological advances. Ghostbusters will frequently make you laugh and even more frequently make you appreciate the spot-on chemistry between Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and, eventually, Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones). Erin and Abby are fractured friends who once wrote a book about ghosts before largely going their own ways in life. When the aforementioned book suddenly resurfaces, Erin loses her tenure at Columbia University and the previous tension rises to the surface again. The tension begins to subside, of course, when ghosts suddenly start showing up. It feels a little bit like having a baby, you know? It sort of masks the tension. But, hey, whatever works. Kate McKinnon's Jillian is the group's Egon, a wild-eyed yet brilliant inventor and one might argue the brain behinds the group. Leslie Jones's Patty Tolan, a transportation worker, knows New York City like the back of her hand and handles most of the squad's logistics. In yet another gender reversal, Chris Hemsworth is here as Kevin, the dreamy receptionist who seems to serve as Erin's ghostbusting muse. If there's a problem with Ghostbusters, it's that director Paul Feig tries too hard to make everyone happy and, at times, ends up muting the film's impact below what it should be. In fact, it's a bit of a shame. Halfway through the film, I couldn't help but think that Ghostbusters actually could have been a comedy classic but Feig couldn't quite let go of his need to aim to please the impossible to please fanboys. While the second half still works, it's not quite on the same level. While Ghostbusters may not quite achieve comedy classic status, rest assured that it's a mighty fine film and, yeah, significantly better than one might think after watch the mediocre to just plain suck trailers. Feig wrote the screenplay with Katie Dippold, a screenplay that nicely balances the film's abundant humor and horror-lite. It would be nearly impossible to single out any member of the cast as Ghostbusters is truly an ensemble film and McCarthy, Wiig, Jones and McKinnon are, as we've come to expect from each of them individually, incredibly committed to their performances and wildly inventive in how they interact with each other. Chris Hemsworth reveals a quietly comical side that we've not seen from him before, but I'm fairly sure we'll see it again. Ghostbusters could have gone wildly wrong. The internet trolls would have loved that. There aren't a lot of true Hollywood classics that get remade successfully. Far more often, they fail miserably. Instead, in a summer that desperately needed an energetic, fun and spirited comedy, Ghostbusters rises to the surface and kicks major paranormal, and internet troll, ass. Do you remember the look on your daughter's face when she looked up the screen and watched Rey come to life in Star Wars: The Force Awakens? It was like this magical experience for Hollywood to finally create a female character who was intelligent, sensitive, heroic and completely badass."
"Jul 13, 2020",negative," After all of the talk surrounding its lead up, Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters (2016) remake is finally hitting screens. And for the buzz generated between it being a remake of a beloved film and the gender swapping of the main characters, the final product turned out to be…not bad. Actually it’s pretty fun in spots. In a summer season that has been loaded with disappointment, this stands as one of the few good ones. In fact, the problems that plague Feig’s film is in its insistence to call back to the original. The screenplay (by Katie Dippold and Feig) seemed hesitant to steer away from the familiar course, tossing in a ton of elements directly lifted from Ivan Reitman’s classic. Some scenes are shot in the exact same locations, and bits of dialogue are translated almost word for word. The basic plot outline is nearly identical. This causes problems for Ghostbusters (2016) in establishing its own identity. There is so much fan service going on here, just like in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). How did the filmmakers expect us to view this on its own terms when they continually remind us of Ghostbusters (1984)? The biggest issue is the constant cameos of the original cast. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts make appearances (the late Harold Ramis shows up as a bust). While seeing their faces was a delight, they added nothing to the narrative. The momentum comes to a screeching halt whenever they show up. Murray has an extended cameo that has no relevance to the main plot, and after he makes a joke or two his character (which is not Peter Venkman) is completely forgotten about. But there’s no denying that the talent brought together here is first rate. Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are four of the funniest comedians working today, and the camaraderie between them is great. Some of the best moments are through their interactions, and how each of their differing personalities clash or gel. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are the standouts, as scientists Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates respectively. A few years earlier, Erin and Abby collaborated on a book about paranormal activity. In the present, Erin works to gain prominence in the scientific field while Abby continues the research they started. When real ghosts start popping up around Manhattan, Erin and Abby join forces once again to notify the world of the pending danger. Leslie Jones provides good work as Patty, an MTA worker who knows the ins and outs of New York. She joins the team to provide insight on buildings, roadways, and tunnels – she’s also responsible for retrieving the famous Ecto-1 hearse. A lot of credit should also go to Chris Hemsworth as Kevin, the Ghostbusters’ absentminded receptionist. In a funny role reversal, Hemsworth lays waste to his hunky macho persona, giving us a glimpse of his surprising comedic talents. He’s actually allowed to let loose here (unlike his work in the Thor films) and has fun doing so. The audience at my screening loved Kate McKinnon as Holtsmann, the wacky scientist who invents the team’s ghost battling weaponry. During the credits, when her name came up she got the biggest applause. There’s no doubt of McKinnon’s skill, as she has been a highlight of recent Saturday Night Live seasons. But sadly, I have to disagree with my screening audience. McKinnon’s character was awful; an over the top caricature mugging for the camera every moment she came on screen. She did garner some comedic bits, but most of her efforts fell short. With her exaggerated facial expressions and goofy voices, Holtsmann belonged in a different universe, let alone a different movie. It’s as though she couldn’t have one regular conversation without inserting a quirky gesture just for a laugh. I’m aware that I’m probably going to be in the minority on this one, but so be it. What about the ghosts? They were fine, in that computer generated sort of way. Early haunting scenes have a nice spooky feel to them – “spooky” being the keyword, not “scary.” The special effects have that usual glossy sheen; those expecting the grit and grime of the original will be disappointed. The ghosts are completely passable. Some recognizable friends such as Slimer  show up, once again reminding us of Ghostbusters (1984). The artificiality strongly shows in the third act. During the climactic battle, the slow motion and CGI work combine for something akin to a light show rather than an epic fight to save the world. With the controversy that came with the release of Ghostbusters (2016), the gender swapping is – for the most part – one of its strengths. It’s when we examine everything else that things start to unravel. This still has the problems many recent comedies have: a lack of strong narrative flow for the benefit of extended improvisational scenes. But those hiccups are balanced by the number of laughs. This was an entertaining but entirely disposable summer blockbuster, take that for what you will."
"Jul 3, 2020",positive," 
I've always been a big Ghostbusters fan, but I wasn't going to watch this one until it arrived in the 99 cent bin.  After reading this review I'm ready to watch it tonight.

"Jun 30, 2020",positive," While I personally remember minute details about going to the movies as a kid, there are very few filmgoing experiences that hold fond and lasting memories for the rest of my family. “Ghostbusters” is one of those movies. On top of being a fantastic film, we remember it because a storm passed overhead while we were in the theater. When we came out, the combination of the post-storm clouds breaking apart and the setting sun had turned the sky many strange colors, which almost mimicked the clouds over Spook Central in the movie we had just experienced. It’s a memory we still talk about today, and it’s one of the few movies that my parents have been willing to go see again every time it has been re-released in theaters over the past few years.Needless to say, it’s also one of the more influential films to me, personally. I have affectionately named my cubicle The Nerd Desk, for all of the silly pop culture figures and items that fill a lot of the space. The amount of “Ghostbusters” items is second only to the amount of “Back to the Future” paraphernalia.I mention all of this to show that I have every reason to be one of those naysayers who condemned the new version before it was even released. Based on the pedigrees of everyone involved, though, I never was a Negative Nellie. I have kept an open mind from the announcement of the reboot all the way to its release, and what I found in the finished product surprised me.Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a physics professor up for tenure. When she finds out that her former friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) is still selling a book they wrote together about the existence of ghosts, something that would hurt her chances for tenure with the very conservative university staff, she pays Abby a visit in order to get her to take the book back out of print.Erin finds her still in the pursuit of proving the paranormal, now with a new partner, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). She ends up tagging along with Abby and Holtzmann to check out a haunting report. After experiencing a rather up close and messy encounter with a real ghost, the trio launch into their new venture as Ghostbusters.They hire the hunky, yet dumb as a box of rocks, Kevin Beckman (Chris Hemsworth) as their secretary and set up shop. Their first real client is Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a subway employee who has seen a ghost in one of the tunnels at work. She also had a strange moment with a man just before her spectral encounter. He is Rowan North (Neil Casey), and he is using homemade devices to break down the barriers between our world and the hereafter in order to cleanse the world.“Ghostbusters” is a genuinely entertaining film. It’s quite funny, actually spooky at times and even fun and exciting, especially when it’s combining the modern with the throwback moments. The women are a well-matched comedic collective, especially the nutty performance from McKinnon. What differs in the comedy this time out is that all of the leads are given a chance to shine, rather than how they gave Bill Murray most of the great lines in the original. Not that that was a bad thing, since it definitely proved to be the right move for that version, but the choice here not only expands the humor possibilities, it also expands their characters’ personalities.Since it’s a reboot, most of the story is given to setting up the Ghostbusters team, while less attention is paid to the villain’s plot. This is where the movie is weak. Rowan is not a very compelling character. They try to set up reasons for what he’s doing, but he only comes across as a character thrown in so the movie can say, “See this guy? He’s your baddie.” It feels like they assumed the core audience of “Ghostbusters” fans would identify with Rowan’s motivations, but we all know what happens when you assume. He does become more interesting during the third act, but it takes a certain something, and someone, for this to happen.Luckily, Rowan’s storyline is only a small part of the overall movie. Setting up the team, including a realistic look at the evolution of the proton packs and the rest of their equipment, and their struggle to be taken seriously in a sea of ghost hunter TV and internet shows is entertaining enough to carry the rest of the film. Especially when handled by these four very funny women.I also have to commend director Paul Feig for his own geekiness. Not only does he obviously have respect for the original, shown through the many nice nods peppered throughout, but he is a true film geek. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in his use of 3D. While most films converted to 3D these days give off the air of being above using the gimmick of throwing things at the audience, Feig fully embraces it.That’s what 3D was designed to do and he knows it. Ghosts reach out of the screen, all kinds of stuff flies toward you and, best of all, the proton streams shoot into the theater. They have even gone so far as to letterbox the 3D version so that some of the effects can spill outside the movie, itself. It’s almost Disney theme park-level 3D entertainment, minus having things physically happen to you. The ten-year-old in me was literally bouncing up and down in the seat going, “This is so cool!”I cannot say enough about how awesome the 3D is in this film. No matter what you think about the casting or rebooting a classic or whatever your gripe towards this version is, if you are a true “Ghostbusters” fan you should go see it just for the amazing 3D. It brings the general “Ghostbusters” world to life in the way you probably always dreamed it could be done. Who knows, maybe you’ll also be surprised by the high quality of the film, too.No, this new “Ghostbusters” will neither replace the original, nor will it “ruin your childhood.” However, it is a really good start for a potential new expansion of the “Ghostbusters” universe. When it comes to remakes and reboots, in general, we could’ve gotten a lot worse. Oh yeah, and make sure you stay through the end credits.

"Feb 13, 2020",positive," As moviegoers, we’re conditioned to sigh in resignation whenever we hear about a remake. “Oh, God, there are no original ideas in Hollywood anymore,” we say, as we roll our eyes so far back we can see our brains.  But remakes have been a part of American film since the beginning. Cecil B. DeMille made The Straw Man in 1914, remade it in 1918, then remade it again in 1931. If remakes were an issue for you, you probably should have started complaining about them 98 years ago. It bears mentioning that just because a remake exists, it’s not simply an inferior copy of the original. John Carpenter’s remake of The Thing is leagues better than the original. Only someone who’s clinically insane would claim that David Cronenberg’s remake of The Fly is a lesser effort compared to the original. Sure, there’s garbage remakes, like the ill-advised reboots of Total Recall and Robocop. But when judging the quality of a remake, you have to do it based on who’s involved. So here’s the conclusion we have to draw from that. Nothing is sacred…and that’s okay! When it comes to movies, nothing should be sacred, because by placing a beloved film on a pedestal, we rob talented filmmakers of the chance to put their own spin on it. Besides, going back to our examples, just because the remake of Robocop is stupid and pointless, there’s no way it can retroactively affect the quality of the original or do harm to your cherished memories. That brings me to Ghostbusters. There are some people that believe 1984’s Ghostbusters is an untouchable and unassailable classic of modern film. That belief even leeches over into 1989’s Ghostbusters II and the numerous animated television series. As a result, they believe this franchise is gold-plated in terms of quality.* But when they heard that a remake was coming down the pike and that four women would be the leads, a chunk of fans lost their damn fool minds. The trailer was the most downvoted in YouTube’s history. Fans of the original passionately refused to see it. Like flat-earthers or Trump supporters, these folks don’t let little things like logic get in the way of their convictions. That’s a pity because 2016’s Ghostbusters is light, funny, and pretty good overall. We meet Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), a physicist at Columbia University. She’s sharp, and she’s on the cusp of getting tenure. The only problem is that, years ago, she co-wrote a book on ghost hunting. The book has been republished and is showing up on Amazon. It’s the kind of thing that could bring her dreams of tenure crashing down. She does the only thing she can do, which is to beg her co-author and former best friend, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) to remove all traces of their book. She finds Abby working as a paranormal researcher at a downscale college. Alongside Abby is Jillian Holzmann (Kate McKinnon), a fascinatingly weird nuclear engineer. Abby and Holzmann have made significant progress in designing equipment to handle paranormal phenomena. The three women become involved in a ghost hunt at a historic New York mansion, and this kicks off an explosion of spectral occurrences. Along the way, they’re joined by Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a friendly MTA worker** and amateur NYC historian. They also hire Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) as their receptionist, a man who is both incredibly handsome and bafflingly stupid. But we wouldn’t have a movie without an antagonist, and ours is Rowan North (Neil Casey), a bitter nerd who is harnessing ectoplasmic energy in order to destroy the Big Apple. The newly-formed Ghostbusters must get to the bottom of Rowan’s supernatural scheme and save the city because that’s how these things work. First, it’s very funny. Very, very funny. We all know that humor is subjective,*** especially in this day and age. But the majority of the jokes here, as surreal as they occasionally get, are rooted in character and context. Even throwaway bits, like a tour guide played by Zach Woods talking about an “anti-Irish” fence, work well because they’re connected to specific behavior. While there may not be any lines here as instantly iconic as, “He slimed me,” there are comedic moments that easily go toe-to-toe with the original. Is it good? Yeah, mostly. Director Paul Feig, along with co-screenwriter Katie Dippold, has been honing a unique comic voice for a while now. Last year’s Spy was a terrific comedy, and much like Ghostbusters, it was saddled by a mediocre trailer that effectively hid what a solid film it was. Feig and Dippold make films about strong and relatable women. While a lesser filmmaker would have saddled Erin or Abby with a dull romantic subplot, the emotional spine here is their friendship. Erin turns her back on the paranormal and sprints towards academia after the reaction of her book, while Abby becomes more of a true-believer. The film charts the way these two reclaim their friendship, and it’s refreshing seeing a movie where the main characters genuinely like each other. Feig is able to efficiently balance the laughs, character work, and a few good scares. The cast, overall, does good work, and they all play effectively to their strengths. Feig seems to bring out the best in Melissa McCarthy, and instead of playing her usual pottymouthed slob, she’s charmingly earnest. Wiig’s Erin is the straight woman mostly, but she mines laughs from pent-up desperation. As Patty, Leslie Jones brings energy and infectious joy to every scene. But there are two performances in particular that make this movie a must-see. Mostly known as the God of Thunder for Marvel, Chris Hemsworth possesses formidable comedy chops, and he’s been itching to use them. His Kevin is astonishingly dumb, and better yet, he has no idea how truly stupid he is. Whether Kevin is showing off his questionable skills as a graphic artist, or attempting to master the difficulties of answering the phone, he’s the second most entertaining character in the film. However, Kate McKinnon’s Holzmann is genius. Like Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool or Johnny Depp’s Captain Jack, Holzmann is a character that’s so unique, she immediately becomes legendary. She’s the tech geek of the Ghostbusters, constantly fiddling and tweaking the hardware to learn new applications. Mischievious, brilliant, hilarious, and a little dangerous, Holzmann fools around with wildly dangerous equipment because it’s fun. Even when she’s lurking in the background of a scene, you can’t take your eyes off her, and she gets huge laughs continuously. Her character pushes things to the next level, and Feig uses her precisely the right amount. So what’s not so good? The film starts off so strong, but by the third act, the energy starts to get overwhelmed by too much CGI. While I love the concept of flipping the bird towards haters by making the villain one of them, Rowan North is a pretty uninspired bad guy. Yes, he’s convinced of his own superiority, and yes, he wants to use an army of spooks to exact revenge. So what? It’s as if Feig and Dippold spent so much time honing their leads, and they remembered at the last possible minute that there needed to be an antagonist. Also, some of the cameos are clunky, and the theme song by Missy Elliott and Fall Out Boy kind of sucks. Really, none of that matters. For everything that doesn’t work, there’s so much more that does. These Ghostbusters are solid, and this film effectively riffs on the original and creates its own thing. For those willing to engage it with an open mind, they’ll be rewarded with a big slice of goofy summer entertainment. *It’s not gold-plated, or even bronze-plated. The original is a classic, but Ghostbusters II is a lazy and shameless cash-grab. No wonder Bill Murray wanted nothing to do with making the proposed Ghostbusters III. ***Some pseudo-Men’s Right’s Activists have tried to claim, with a straight face, that Chris Hemsworth’s dopey Kevin is a character that’s actually sexist towards men. That…is just adorable."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"2016's Ghostbusters comes as a sip of water in a historic drought. Feig has pulled off the impossible by successfully reworking an unlikely masterpiece, and everyone involved deserves major kudos."
"Dec 5, 2019",negative," There is a scene in Paul Feig’s reboot of Ghostbusters where Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) is scrolling through some comments at the end of a YouTube video. Yates hopes the clip, featuring a frightening stand-off with a ghost in the subway, is proof that phantasms actually exist. Instead, she reads this comment: “Ain’t no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts.” It’s a sly reference to the heat the film has faced from fan boys of the 1984 original, upset that this reboot features female leads. I was afraid to give Ghostbusters a negative review or forever be called a misogynist. No, I don’t hate women. Ghostbusters is simply a terrible movie.  Hollywood is not capable of leaving any concept, good or bad, dead (or undead) and 32 years later we have a new version of Ghostbusters. Feig once again tries to populate a genre that features male leads with women. This isn’t the first time someone tried to replicate the lightning-in-a-bottle success of the original. There was a crappy sequel and a half-hearted stab at an animated series. So what could Feig and co-writer Katie Dippold learn from those blunders? Was simply swapping the gender of the lead characters enough? Happily there is no correlation between the female characters and their male counterparts. There is no direct stand-in for Venkman or Stantz. Each of Feig’s cast is given an entirely new role, though most of them are not very believable. Kristen Wiig stars an Erin Gilbert, a professor at Columbia who is up for tenure. When a book she wrote in the past (with Yates) about paranormal activity surfaces, Gilbert is shown the door. Umm, okay. So she reluctantly joins forces with Yates and her partner, the hyperactive Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), when she learns that a local mansion may be haunted. It isn’t long before Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a former MTA worker, rounds out the group. As more and more hauntings plague New York, the women find themselves in high demand. Wiig and the gang are likable enough (although McKinnon really chews up her scenes) but the big problem here is the plot. Sure, Zuul and the Gatekeeper/Keymaster business from 1984 isn’t that great of a story, but at least a cohesive thread held the film together. This version of Ghostbusters feels like a series of loosely connected scenes that usher the audience along until we reach a climax of mass destruction akin to something you see in a Marvel movie. A lot of poorly done special effects and very little heart. This is a movie built to make money and Feig stumbles a bit when aiming for that PG-13 rating. More profanity and more wedding dress shitting, please. It’s strange because there are some genuinely scary bits to the movie. Why dial back the comedy? With the chastity cuffs firmly on, Feig is forced into mediocrity. Then there’s Chris Hemsworth, who takes on the Annie Potts role as the Ghostbusters’ secretary. However, his Kevin is so dumb, it’s amazing he can function in the world. Yes, he’s handsome and Wiig’s character is constantly making a fool of herself hitting on him, but Kevin is so dumb it’s unbelievable. Like, not knowing how to answer the phone dumb. The best part of the first Ghostbusters films is it feels like real people thrown into an extraordinary situation. When you have a character as poorly drawn as Kevin, it is impossible to suspend your disbelief when the ghosts come in.  Worst of all, the movie just isn’t funny. Even if it tries to separate itself from the 1984 film, most of the original cast shows up in increasingly awful cameos. More concerned with special effects than plot, Ghostbusters doesn’t even let Wiig and McCarthy do what they do best. Instead, they more or less stand around until the next ghost comes along for them to scream at. Sorry, folks, your fears that this film is awful will not be allayed. You may not be afraid of no ghost. You won’t even be afraid of having your childhood dreams dashed. You will just be disappointed.  Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Oct 23, 2019",positive,"We found them all more than capable of taking on the action as well as the comedy. It just could have been put together and paced better, but it's still fun, especially if you see it with a big audience."
"Oct 21, 2019",positive," What do you say about a film that inspired almost a million YouTube users, many of the masculine variety, to give thumbs down? I’m sure scores of women felt like me and it got their dander up.  This weekend director Paul Feig’s gal-fronted reboot of Ghostbusters is releasing across the country and, fingers crossed, will bring out female fans in droves, in support of women in film, and not least to smack down and dissuade the kind of girl-bashing behavior so pervasive online prerelease .  But is it any good? The short answer is it’s good enough to enjoy, but not as great as representing total vindication. There are certainly moments that shine so brightly the entire audience glows like, say, Slimer. In particular, Kate McKinnon’s character Jillian Holtzmann, and Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan are wonderful, and without question, raising their stock to A-listers. Chris Hemworth makes himself nearly intolerable by being so funny and entertaining he nearly steals the movie. This is not a sequel or a remake.  These four female ghostbusters have their own back stories, their own quirks, and exist in their own shared world.  Interestingly, the New York where they ply their trade is somewhat out of time.  We don’t see lots of cell phones or trappings of the now, and only the occasional plot-driven reference to the internet.  Kristen Wiig is Erin Gilbert, a professor of physics working to get tenure at Columbia, trying to live down and forget a book about the paranormal she wrote with her childhood friend.  Melissa McCarthy as Abby Yates is that friend, who still does research in the basement of a barely accredited college, with the help of genius loose cannon Holtzmann. When an investigation into a haunting leads to a video that gets Gilbert fired, the three decide to continue their work together.  Bored transit agent Patty Tolan (Jones) joins the team after having an encounter with a belligerent ghost on the metro tracks, and the rest is ghost fighting, quip tossing, and slime cleaning fun, especially when dumb as dirt hottie Kevin (Hemsworth) acts as their entirely inept receptionist. There are a few weaknesses that bring the proton power down…Cameos come fast and fierce, as do other nods to the original franchise, and they tend to pull the audience a bit out of the proceedings. While McKinnon’s character is an oddball hoot and entirely magnetic, some of her moments seem to hang out in the stratosphere in a way that makes them feel out of place and badly paced.  Some jokes don’t seem to land particularly well.  The movie is probably a good ten minutes too long. On the other hand, the camaraderie is off the charts.  I can’t remember ever feeling more excited to see four people in costumes together, especially as a woman who yearns for cosplay options that don’t involve over 80% of exposed skin.  This isn’t just women kicking butt, this is women kicking butt without any help from men, or talking about men, with confidence, fearlessness, and humor.  The moment where McKinnon’s character wreaks havoc while wielding two weapons is really worth sitting through the looser aspects of the rest of the film. The next time the powers-that-be in Hollywood say women can’t open and carry a film, I hope they will be reminded of this one, and strong box office numbers mentioned as proof.  Ghostbusters may not be a film for the ages, but it’s definitely deserving of a thumbs up…maybe even a million of them."
"Oct 2, 2019",neutral," Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig; The Martian) is a professor at Columbia University, who years ago wrote a book on the paranormal with her former partner, Abbie Yates (Melissa McCarthy; Spy). Abbie has continued that research at a much less prestigious college. When that book surfaces, Erin is faced with a claim that one of New York's agent landmarks is haunted. Upon further investigation, the ladies come face-to-face with a ghost. When a second ghost shows up in the NYC subway, Erin and Abbie, along with Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon; Saturday Night Live), and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones; Saturday Night Live) set up shop ready to capture and study these apparitions. Unfortunately, the Mayor wants to discredit them to avoid mass hysteria until the vortex is charged and a portal is opened unleashing ghosts all over the city. I was cautiously optimistic when this movie was announced but less enthusiastic once I saw the trailer. This version is a little scarier and decidedly much less humorous than the original one. The story isn't well thought out or well written and can't live up to its predecessor. McCarthy isn't funny and her voice is annoyingly nasal. Wiig is slightly better but mostly uninspired. Jones adds a few moments of hilarity and a streetwise toughness that works most of the time, but the real star is McKinnon. Her portrayal of the intelligent inventor with a tinge of slightly mad scientist is refreshing and chaotic. She adds an element to the dynamic that is ingenious and disturbing, and she stands out in every scene she is in. The other saving grace of the movie is the cameos from almost every significant member of the original cast. Those moments are nostalgic and terrific. Conversely, the sexist role reversal with the dumb, hot, yet inept male secretary (Chris Hemsworth; Thor) had the potential to be funny, but sadly falls flat. The graphics were one of the few shinning moments in the film with fantastic looking ghosts that aren't cheesy or cheap looking. However, sometimes they we too well done and could be scary to younger audience members. The direction also misses the mark, and it is very obvious in scenes such as the dance sequence that could have been epic but was cut and stuck in the credits to keep audiences in their seats. Not only should the dance have been kept in the film, but it would have been better if they had broken into the Thriller dance. Just one of many missed opportunities throughout the movie that helped makes it the disappointment it ultimately becomes. If you have never seen the original films, you may enjoy this reinvention; but for those of us who fell in love with the movie in 1984, the new Ghostbusters can't hold a candle to what paved the way. Allison Rose, a Senior Correspondent and Critic at FlickDirect, is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from Hofstra University. She brings her film expertise to KRMS News/Talk 97.5 FM and broadcast television, and is recognized as a Tomatometer-Approved Critic.

"Sep 23, 2019",positive," This isn’t to say that the reboot is unrecognizable. On the contrary, it delivers pretty much everything you’d expect to find in a Ghostbusters film. There are jokes about bodily fluids. There is ectoplasm spraying everywhere. There are power beams blasting away. There are plentiful cameos, not excluding the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man. (Tip: Stay all the way through to the credits for the best appearance.) Although it’s ostensibly about busting ghosts, the plot of the original Ghostbusters involves disparate forces working together to stalk leading woman Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver.) Protagonist Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), evil antagonist Zuul, and the nebbish neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) all shower Dana with unwanted sexual attention. Dana seeks help from the Ghostbusters because Zuul has possessed her apartment; Venkman takes the case in large part to get close to her. Venkman makes inappropriate comments basically whenever she’s in hearing distance, but Dana needs his help, so she can’t just tell him to go to hell. It’s a textbook case of harassment. At one point he even nibbles on her shoulder when she’s unconscious; like the rest of his smarmy come-ons, this is presented as a joke. Louis also pursues her. When he becomes possessed, he actually gets to have sex with the possessed Dana. Again, this nonconsensual violation is presented as amusing—and even sexy. The original film’s unhealthy obsession with Dana is the reason that, at times, it feels like a horror movie rather than a comedy. There’s a real, disturbing sadism in the scene where the chair in Dana’s apartment grabs her and she’s swallowed by her kitchen. This cruelty fitted in uneasily with film’s supposedly light tone. And the ending, with Dana and Venkman as a couple, is particularly sour. After being violated, Dana is delivered by the film as a victory prize to her harasser. How is this a happy ending?” Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is smitten with the perfect physique of receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), and even makes a couple of inappropriate-for-a-boss comments that recall Bill Murray’s Venkman. But she quickly realizes that Kevin is, as she says, “dumb as a bag of rocks,” so she gives up on sex and settles for admiring him from a distance. The rest of the women have no apparent significant others (male or otherwise). In place of stalking, the new Ghostbusters substitutes female friendship and trust. When Erin was young, an old woman who lived next door died and her ghost visited Erin’s bedroom for a year. She was terrified, but no one believed her—except for Erin’s schoolmate Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy.) While the first Ghostbusters blithely ignored Dana’s trauma, the reboot takes pains to acknowledge and address Erin’s. None of these changes are accidental. Yes, the reboot shows a lot of affection for the original film, but there’s also a critique of it. Bill Murray shows up as a professional skeptic; his smarmy, condescending treatment of the female Ghostbusters is right in line with the smarmy, condescending way he treated Dana in the first film. In the remake, his hyperbolic comeuppance is one of the films’ better twists. The villain narrative quietly recalls the original film as well. Rowan North (Neil Casey) is a nerd with a grudge; a quiet loner filled with rage that his genius isn’t recognized. It’s easy to read him as a dig at the misogynist internet trolls who were so upset about the reboot’s casting choices. Indeed, the movie explicitly mocks its critics in a characteristic bit of self-awareness. But Rowan also resembles the original heroic Ghostbusting dudes. The first film presented nerdy genius guys as its heroes; the second makes it clear that male geeks with a grudge aren’t always so benign. From the treatment of Murray to the unapologetic embrace of sisterhood, there’s plenty in the film to enrage fans who feel threatened by a female-led Ghostbusters. But the truth is, in most respects, the reboot’s reworking is for the best. Today, the snickering harassment in the original comes off as dated, cramped, and not much fun to watch. The reboot, paradoxically, feels much more comfortable in its own skin. It’s as if, in exorcizing the original’s misogyny, Ghostbusters has at last managed to find the soul it thought it had all along."

"Aug 23, 2019",positive," The new Ghostbusters reboot has hit cinemas after months of trailer-bashing from nervous fans. It has an all-star cast of excellent comedians, and it's clear ""they ain't afraid of no ghosts"". In case you've been living under a rock for the past year, this new Ghostbusters has an all-star cast of talented comediennes in the lead roles, with Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wigg leading the charge. Given Hollywood studios and mainstream multiplex audiences seem more afraid of all-female cast than they are of ghosts, I love that this movie even exists.  It's a top-notch cast and I love the Ghostbusters story - but the humour just didn't fire for me and neither did the nostalgia-button-pushing cameos. "
"Jul 9, 2019",positive," Sadly, but as expected, news that writer/director Paul Feig’s reboot of Ghostbusters would feature four women in the lead roles was met by the kind of childish misogyny that has come to exemplify the worst of the Internet. Fragile manbabies cursed with boundless insecurity and access to Wi-Fi have made hating this movie suffice for their lack of personality, intentionally tanking the film’s IMDB rating (before it was even released) and crusading in comments sections, which have long been sanctuaries for the cowardly and hate-filled. Ultimately, the best rejoinder to this legion of douchebros is the one Feig delivered: Ghostbusters is pretty damn good. Cue the sad trombone for Men’s Rights Activists: Gone are the ghost blow jobs and dancing slime from the original films. Feig’s reboot begins in a New York City whose citizens know neither that the paranormal is popping off nor who to call when it does. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), a fusty academic, is up for tenure at her prestigious institution when she discovers her old friend, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), has released an embarrassing book the pair co-wrote about scientific evidence regarding ghosts. Erin storms into Abby’s office to confront her, only to get strong-armed by Abby and her new partner, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), into going to a haunted mansion. After seeing an-honest-to-goodness, slime-barfing lady ghost, the trio agree to work together and are soon joined by Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a history buff who forces her way onto the team. The squad hires a muscular mongoloid named Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) to man the phones and soon find themselves confronting a dangerous breach between the lands of the living and dead. Proton packs are engaged, Slimer shows up to throw hot dogs down his throat hallway and an epic battle against an oversized white dude not named Donald Trump ensues. The four leads are magnificent. McCarthy reins in her increasingly all-used-up, over-the-top comedic bravado. Wiig is likeable and approachable as the film’s emotional core. Jones’ brash and savage style is deployed strategically to great effect. And McKinnon steals the show as a label-defying mad woman with the perfect blend of oddness and badassery. Sure, the climax is a big paint-by-numbers CGI cluster, but by then, the actresses have instilled such good will, it’s easy to let go and have fun. The film’s shortcomings are predictable and understandable. It’s actually too beholden to the original, with no less than five cameos and scores of dialogue callbacks. The villain, although appropriately a loner dude willing to destroy everything because the world doesn’t make him feel like a special boy, is wholly forgettable and boring. Still, this is a film with a laser-guided purpose: establishing a new status quo and endearing us to our new ‘busters. What Feig and company did by inverting gender expectations was create a reboot with intent and purpose, bringing a wholly new vibrancy and dynamic to expected events. Here’s hoping for a long-running series with this group, much to the chagrin of blubbering women-haters typing one-handed on Reddit."
"May 3, 2019",positive," GHOSTBUSTERS is that rarest thing – a remake that is as much fun as the original (some would say more) that also honors the memorable original. Take that, internet grumblers! Fans who were worried about this remake can relax – the results are very funny. The comedy is great, and non-stop, packed with clever affectionate references to the original. The logo and the catchy theme song are back (with a few remixes added), and the goofy humor of battling ghosts with technology is all there. Kristen Wiig re-teams with her BRIDESMAIDS director Paul Feig and co-star Melissa McCarthy, for a hilarious romp that is like a superhero movie without the ponderous stuff. These folks know it is ridiculous and they are just here to entertain. Better yet, it should put to rest that question about whether women can be funny – they definitely are in this film! Wiig plays physicist Dr. Erin Gilbert who is on the verge of gaining tenure at Columbia University, when her past comes back to haunt her. That haunting emerges in the form of a book on ghosts that she co-wrote back in high school with her then best friend Abby Yates (McCarthy). Abby has decided to finally publish their joint effort online, as a way to fund her paranormal research. Abby is also working in academia, but at a, um, much less prestigious institution. In her research as a professor of the  paranormal, Abby is hoping to prove the existence of ghosts, with the help of weird but gifted engineer Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). A call about a haunted mansion launches the three on a quest to capture a ghost, but a haunted subway brings them together with transit worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), who quickly joins the team. Patty’s knowledge of New York City streets and history, and practical viewpoint, helps ground the others, and the four soon find themselves battling an invasion of ghosts flooding New York. Adding Chris Hemsworth as the gorgeous but dumb receptionist was the final perfect touch. The story is similar but not the same as the original. Roughly, Wiig and McCarthy play loose versions of the Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd roles, with McKinnon as the Harold Ramis character and Jones in the Ernie Hudson role. But actually, these are their own unique characters inhabiting those niches. Ivan Reitman, who directed the original GHOSTBUSTERS and its sequel, serves as producer, and stars from the first film appear in cameos (watch for a bust of the late Harold Ramis). It is all done with a sense of great fun, and affection for the first one. Turns out, remaking GHOSTBUSTERS with a female cast was an inspired idea for a reboot. The characters in the original film were outsiders, people who are dismissed and who have to prove what they can do. This time, those outsiders are women, but again they are people trying to break through, to gain recognition – an on-going theme in the world, particularly in film recently. Instead of playing female versions of the old characters with pink bows in their hair, Feig and his stars wisely makes these new characters…just people. Strangely, that choice gives the film a contemporary girl-power edge, and a little rebellious undercurrent. The film is an ensemble effort, with each cast member contributing her bit and without one lead role, although Wiig’s sweet, sincere Erin comes close. For comedy, McKinnon’s eccentric, grinning Holtzmann sometimes threatens to steal the show. Jones’ Patty gets in there too with well-placed wisecracks. McCarthy, who can often stray into icky humor, keeps a lid on that and adds just the right amount of madness and mayhem. Even Hemsworth holds up his end, adding his comic bit – who knew he had that in him? Occasionally the comedy subtly jabs at the controversy that casting women sparked on social media. Of course, there will still be those who are not pleased – taste in comedy is very individual. Murray and Aykroyd were big name comedians when they made the original, and this is one of their best. Plus remaking any beloved film, even a comedy, is risky business. But for most, the new GHOSTBUSTERS will entertain, in summer comedy style. It is all great escapist fun, perfectly in the spirit of the original. A final note to the reader: you will want to stay for the credits, and all the way to the end. They feature a couple extra scenes, a very funny bit with Hemsworth dancing, and little jokes are peppered in the background as the credits roll by. The end is capped with a little teaser about a sequel. Just as DEADPOOL had this year’s funniest opening credits, GHOSTBUSTERS has this year’s most entertaining end credits."
"Apr 16, 2019",positive," Some fans have already made their decision, but if you go into the movie with an open mind, this is one of the better remakes Hollywood has produced in recent years. It's fun and funny, breezy and playful, and finds its own voice while staying respectful of the original. The special effects do a neat job of updating the floaty, gaseous ghost effects of the original, and modern CGI means the film doesn't have to cheap out on apparitions. (Have you ever noticed how few ghosts there actually are in the original?) It's even legit spooky at times. Sure, it's mostly chucklesome rather than laugh out loud, and it's nowhere near as quotable as the prototype. While the original ""Ghostbusters"" is a great comedy, ""Schindler's List"" it ain't, and treating it as some kind of sacred text is pretty laughable. This affectionate reinvention isn't going to make your copy of the original movie spontaneously combust any more than the past 30 years of lunchboxes, cartoon spin-offs or spurious toys. Like the original, the new flick's strength is its core casting. Once again it unites four comic actors who form, basically, a gang you want to be part of. Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon don't try to re-create the characters so memorably inhabited in the original movies by Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Instead they form a new team to unite against both ghosts and a skeptical world. While none of them runs away with the film the way Bill Murray did in 1984 -- Wiig's character in particular is a bit of wet blanket for much of the movie -- the breakout star is Kate McKinnon. The camera constantly cuts to her reactions as if it can barely keep up with her scene-stealing energy. And yeah, they all happen to be women. The new ""Ghostbusters"" doesn't so much pass the Bechdel test -- an informal measure of how women are represented in fiction -- as ace the Bechdel test. It should win a Bechdel Prize for showing the rest of the world how it's done. It shouldn't be novel, but it is. ""Ghostbusters"" is fun and silly, and if you don't like it you don't have to watch it. No need for mass hysteria. The film opens in the UK on 11 July, in Australia on 14 July and in the US on 15 July."
"Apr 12, 2019",positive," Today I saw the movie that broke the internet. For months the battle over the Ghostbusters remake has been raging strong.  It has a female cast, some idiots trolled, people involved overreacted and then a bunch of lousy trailers came out. Plus, like Independence Day it’s another movie that others feel much more nostalgia for than I do. You can see my best shot pick and thoughts on original Ghostbusters here. So is this new version the monstrosity that some people hoped for? (Yes some idiots hoped it would be bad). No, in fact, I liked it very much! Going into Ghostbusters I looked for a few things. 1. I wanted charismatic, likable female cast, 2. I wanted to laugh, 3. I wanted some entertaining ghostbusting action. This film gave me all of that. I left with a big smile on my face. So let’s start with our leading ladies. We have Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. I like that they aren’t exact copies of the 4 original Ghostbusters. McCarthy and Wiig are long time friends who have written a book on the paranormal. They had great chemistry together and I thought McCarthy stole every scene she was in. I know some are tired of her shtick but it’s really not here. There isn’t a single fat lady joke in the whole movie. She’s just funny. All of the ladies have great chemistry together and things like Leslie Jones being from the street was actually well done. For the most part character-wise what worried me in the trailer didn’t come to fruition.  Kate McKinnon verges on being a little annoying but I was ok with it. A lot of people have complained about the depiction of men in the film. I think this complaint misses the subtle humor these roles have. I can’t even tell you how many movies I’ve seen where every female character is a dimwit, shrew or hooker. Now they turn it around. That’s part of the joke! It’s called turning the tables to make people think and maybe laugh a bit at the way we see gender played out in film. Chris Hemsworth isn’t just the idiot, he’s a satirical jab at every dopey receptionist babe we’ve seen in a thousand other films. Let’s get to the humor. I must own I actually haven’t seen many Paul Feig films because they are usually hard R ratings. Here he is working in PG-13 territory and for the most part I laughed a lot. The banter between the ladies was very funny and dry. Also Chris Hemsworth is hilarious in every scene he is in as the dopey receptionist. I also liked little moments like when Melissa McCarthy can’t get her broth to wanton ratio right from the Chinese restaurant. Things like that made me laugh. Now the action it is not as horror influenced as the original but I liked it. I thought some of the designs of the specters was cool and how the women had to use their brains to take them down was also cool. I particularly liked a set of ghosts that were giant balloons that felt very day of the dead influenced. It was also cool to see all of the new gadgets that McKinnon’s character invents. I think young girls will see this movie and have fun playing scientist and killing those ghosts! It’s the same thing that makes me excited to see girls playing Rey. I had Ariel and that’s basically it. Nothing tough and fighting like this. That does bring me to a negative I had in the movie. Most of the movie is so kid-friendly that it bummed me out when unnecessary crude and vulgar humor was thrown in for no reason. Like a character gives another the middle finger repeatedly. Why did that have to be in there? I don’t need that for my little girl. You also had a joke about female anatomy I could have done without. That said, those crude and vulgar jokes are much worse in the original so it’s not really a surprise. There are also a number of cameos and callbacks to the original and some of them do feel forced. It didn’t bother me that much but it is definitely fan service. I particularly could have done without Slimer and his wife driving around. I honestly hope there is a sequel because I think that will be even better. I think these fan service moments are out of the way and we can move on to an entirely fresh story. Overall, if you can turn off the critics I think you will have a good time.  Is it the greatest movie of the year? No but honestly neither was the original- at least to me.  They are both fun summer movies with quippy dialogue and scientists taking down ghosts! Give it a shot. I don’t think you will regret it. I’ll see this when it comes to DVD, but I’m not really interested in it as I’m also not really a big fan of the first 2 films. So, I don’t have any desire in this franchise. And I’m hoping to like the film with my low expectations. I dunno. Their SNL stuff doesn’t usually make me like, although I have liked Kristen Wiig’s voicing of Lola Bunny in The Looney Tunes Show. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth are amusing, but the script hangs the rest of the cast out to dry.  The personalities of established stars McCarthy and Wiig have been lobotomized by the script. They severely minimize their normally quirky appeal here. Perhaps that’s admirable. This is an ensemble piece and it allows others like McKinnon and Hemsworth to shine. However, in the process we lose what makes their comedic personas so invigorating. You read my review, you know I was all primed and ready to just love this.  Unfortunately it just didn’t set itself apart enough. So many cameos.  Ok I’ll admit it was fun seeing Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts again.  (WHAT! No Rick Moranis?!?!)   But the script just kept reminding me of the past.  An interesting remix I suppose, but this has already faded from my mind. Interesting because Wiig and McCarthy were my favorite. But you’re right about it being an ensemble feel. I dont know for whatever reason I was laughing. But I can see what you mean too. It’s not the most memorable movie. Do you think the sequel will be better now the cameos and fan service are out of the way? I do.
For some reason this year I’ve been really soft on a lot of comedies. I liked this, Central Intelligence, and even laughed at The Boss and a little bit in Zoolander 2. Go figure! But still comedies I didnt like such as the Do-over and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.  Glad you enjoyed it. It’s been interesting to follow everything going on with this film (Midnight’s Edge have been doing videos about it on YouTube, as they did with Fant4Stic) and it really all seemed to be building up to a disaster (again, Fant4Stic), with even the studio looking a bit desperate – so the fact that the movie’s been generally well received is a big surprise. I’m still not going to see it at the cinema but I will check it out at some point in the future. Yeah some of those creatures were a little scary. McCarthy really did nail her jokes. When she got all those wontons at the end I laughed. Ha!"
"Mar 29, 2019",positive," It could have gone so many ways. But there are countless genuine great laughs throughout Ghostbusters, which continue the whole film through – the sign of a truly great comedy. Kate McKinnon is a firecracker who steals every scene with her strange wired energy and lust for explosions, and Chris Hemsworth’s “dumb pretty receptionist” role is a stroke of genius from Feig and Dippold, flipping gender stereotypes to comment on them without us even registering what they’re doing. As the safety of New York City gets increasingly fraught the fear feels real, and there are plenty of jumps. There is perhaps a need for a stronger grounding of the plot in these moments, but there’s soon another wave of high-action proton gun-shooting to wash away these worries. Remaking such a classic was always going to be a gamble, but Feig and Dippold manage to establish a perfect balance between referencing the old and leaving their own mark – the use of the original music, fed in subtly throughout the film, is a perfect example of this. Keep your eyes open for plenty of cameos, which err on the side of fun rather than cringe-inducing. Getting to see four normal-looking women on screen, of all shapes, sizes and colours is rare, let alone seeing them be action heroes who save the day. And Ghostbusters isn’t preachy about it at all – it presents the fact that they’re women as entirely normal, which might be the most revolutionary thing of all. Snappy jokes, kickass women and great fight sequences all make Ghostbusters a fun-as-hell blockbuster, which you won’t want to miss. It’s a silly, funny, scary romp into the other side, that leaves you grinning with pure joy and marveling at some positive female role models. SYNOPSIS: Doctors Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates’ scientific theories about the existence of ghosts seem to be proving themselves true, but they must learn to control – as well as understand – the horrors coming through from the other side.  Sian is a writer and performer based in South East London, who sometimes puts on plays and sometimes tells jokes. She’s been writing articles since she was about 14 and her dad took her to film screenings and made her bring a notebook. The first film she ever saw was Hercules during which she filled her nappy, which her dad deemed ‘an adequate review.’ She’s been filling her nappies in cinemas ever since."
"Feb 16, 2019",positive,"Ghostbusters isn't as good a movie as the original, but there's no shame in failing to reach the level of a classic. It's still a fun and funny film with plenty going for it particularly a wildly talented cast that is pretty obviously having a ball."

"Jan 15, 2019",positive," This “Ghostbusters” finds lifelong friends and paranormal enthusiasts Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) reunited when a series of ghost sightings in Manhattan sparks local interest. After months of lackluster advertising I went into the new “Ghostbusters” fully expecting to hate it. There was just nothing about any of the trailers prior to the release that appealed to me. So, imagine my surprise that this new incarnation of the beloved 1984 comedy actually works. Is it on the same level as the original? Certainly not. But it is still a film that stands quite well on its own merits. This “Ghostbusters” finds lifelong friends and paranormal enthusiasts Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) reunited when a series of ghost sightings in Manhattan sparks local interest. Working with a nuclear engineer named Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and subway worker Patty Dolan (Leslie Jones), Erin and Abby uncover a plan to open a paranormal porthole that would allow the undead to take over the world. “Ghostbusters” does a good job of creating its own identity while staying faithful to the charm of the original film. (The cameos from original cast members are very creative and drew some of the biggest applauses in the screening I attended, as did the other nods to the original film). At the heart of the film is the relationship among the four leads, and all four actresses are more than up to the challenge. Their chemistry is very good and their comic repertoire helps to keep it all zipping along. McKinnon is the standout in the pack, as the slightly aloof but brilliant member of the group. It’s a breakout role that should lead to even more movie roles for the “Saturday Night Live” cast member. I’m sure there will be some die-hard fans of the original that will still find faults with this “Ghostbusters,” but if you go in with an open mind you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. Another film opening this week is “The Infiltrator” (B), a crime thriller that has plenty of familiar elements in play but also has an ace-in-the-hole in the form of a dynamic lead performance from Bryan Cranston. Based on a true story of a government operation that led to the arrests of many of the key players in Pablo Escobar’s drug empire in the mid-1980s, Cranston plays Robert Mazur, a U.S. customs agent who helped orchestrate the bust. With the help of a rogue cop named Emir (John Leguizamo) and a rookie agent (Diane Kruger), Mazur was able to shift the drug war in ways that hadn’t been seen up until that time. Directed by Brad Fullman, “The Infiltrator” is a bare-bones crime thriller (much like one of Fullman’s previous films “The Lincoln Lawyer”) that doesn’t stray too far from the genre’s formula. The supporting cast, which also includes Benjamin Bratt and Amy Ryan, could have been fleshed out a little more to add a little more substance to it all, but ultimately the success of “The Infiltrator” comes back to Cranston. It’s a performance that allows Cranston to channel his Walter White, a mild-mannered guy at heart asked to be something totally opposite when he goes undercover. A scene where Mazur’s cover is nearly blown while at an anniversary dinner with his wife is among the film’s best, showcasing Cranston’s ability as an actor. “The Infiltrator” is rated R for strong violence, language throughout, some sexual content and drug material and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 12."
"Jan 9, 2019",positive," The controversies around the Ghostbusters reboot have been so varied and often upsetting that talking about the film itself unfortunately seems like small beans at this point. I’ve been getting into polite disagreements with folks on the internet (yes, polite) ever since the film was announced, and particularly once it was clear that the crew would be all-female. Detractors have run the gamut from concerned old-school fans to out-and-out hostile trolls who are determined to make certain that no one finds a “chick Ghostbusters” film funny or worth anyone’s time. (They are currently on Reddit, planning to tell everyone that all positive reviews were paid for. Guess I’ll be added to that list, then.) But if we throw all that aside, here’s my simple verdict: The movie is great. And not just because it stars a female cast (though that’s a big plus). It’s actually because—get ready for my confession—the original Ghostbusters drove me kind of crazy. Before people descend to pick over my bones, allow me to clarify. I thoroughly enjoy the film. Nostalgia rightly situates it as one of the best sci-fi/horror comedies on offer. But I learned that I didn’t have quite the same reverence for it as my friends and colleagues due to one niggling little catch: The film had practically no worldbuilding or set up. Zilchy-zilch. None-zo. That’s not a dealbreaker for most fans, clearly, but it was for me. I was irritated by the fact that the film refused to answer so many basic questions: Why do these guys know each other? How did they start doing this research in the first place? Who gave them funds for their equipment? Was the paranormal common enough, but ignored in their world? I know, it’s a comedy and I’m not supposed to care, but I did. I cared. “Watch the cartoon, then!” everyone said, and I did sometimes, but I could never get over the fact that the film itself refused to build out at all. Also, the cartoon was way different. The new film does all of this legwork. It doesn’t allow those choices to displace the humor or the action, but it tells us who these women are, and how they come to work together as friends. It tells us why the world ignores the paranormal, and who helps to keep it that way. In effect, it erases every qualm I had with the original. That likely won’t matter to many viewers, but boy, did it matter to me. So on that note alone, I was prepared to look on it favorably. This movie is funny. And it’s funny in the same way that the first films were, being that the humor all comes down to the cast’s individual quirks as comedians. When you add the fact that all of the team are women, it’s brand new territory, particularly in the realm of SFF comedy. They are a dynamic and unique crew, and every single one of them is hilarious. The standouts here are Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon; after the post-trailer concerns that Jones’ character was the only woman of color in the group and also the only non-scientist, it was rewarding to finally see Patty Tolan in all her history nerd glory. Her know-how isn’t down to stereotypical street smarts, but a genuine love of New York history, and she inserts herself into the group by sheer force of logic and pragmatism. “You need Patty,” she tells them at one point, and it’s indisputable. Yes, we do. We need Patty. Kate McKinnon’s Jillian Holtzmann offers a character I’ve been searching for my entire life—a female mad scientist, with all the oddities and deeply questionable decisions/experiments that persona comes with. This sort of character is practically always conceptualized as a man, and here we have Holtzmann, unmistakably strange, totally reckless, likely queer (she hits on Erin multiple times, is all I’m saying), and possessing no filter whatsoever. She’s perfect. I needed her when I was twelve, but I’m just as happy to have her now. The biggest thing I can fault the film for is Paul Feig’s editing style, which can often muddy the progression of events. There are far too many scenes in this film where the jump to another frame reveals that something happened in the space of two seconds… that we never witness. It can make following the action a little rough at times, but it certainly doesn’t distract from the laughs. Fascinatingly, the film seemed to divine precisely the sort of people who were going to have a problem with its premise. The villain of Ghostbusters is in many ways a reflection of the exact type of fan who railed against the movie’s inception in the first place. Rowan North (Neil Casey, Inside Amy Schumer) goes on about how he’s been overlooked and bullied, planning to bring about an armageddon of his own making to punish the world for being cruel to him. But of course, he has chosen to respond to this bullying by becoming a bully himself. And then there’s the fact that the Ghostbusters—all of them pointedly women—understand what it’s like to be bullied and disbelieved and disadvantaged, and stand there as a tribute to the opposite philosophy. All of them stand up to him and stop his plan from coming to fruition, even though the world refuses to believe them or treat them with respect. There’s Kevin as well, the group’s dim receptionist who is hired mainly for his good looks (and for being the only applicant), who offers an extreme comical inverse of the “token female in a guy movie” trope. Kevin serves practically no purpose to the plot whatsoever. He’s there to be pretty and get caught up in the antics—but he has very little initiative, and the one time he shows a bit of agency, he only causes more problems. Chris Hemsworth makes the role work by clearly understanding exactly what joke he’s contributing to, grinning and posing and occasionally getting in a sly nod to his superhero alter ego, Thor. Though there are bound to be folks who think that reversing this particular trope is a mean move, it works precisely because everyone is aware of the gag. So, the movie is compelling and entertaining. If that’s your only concern before stepping into a theater (as it should be for an action comedy), then there’s no reason to avoid it. If your concern is lack of respect for the source material, it’s basically a non-issue; this Ghostbusters is very much its own film. While it gives the occasional nod to fun gags from the first movie, the universe is entirely different and has another story to tell. It doesn’t hurt that the cameos made by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts are all fabulous, and that the late Harold Ramis gets a sweet nod, too. But most important of all, this film delivers on something that is still often denied to women on pop culture terms—basic accessibility. So many people who didn’t want this film claimed it had nothing to do with an all-female cast, but more a lack of originality—why do we have to remake great things? they said. Why can’t you just come up with a new idea? Why do you have to take something I love and make it something else? The answer is simple, in my opinion. When something is a cultural touchstone, you want to participate. The other primary reason I never liked Ghostbusters as much as so many of my friends? It was a boys’ club, intensely so. I could no more relate to those characters than I could relate to Rambo, but the premise of Ghostbusters was still something that I had a passion for. It was a fantasy, a ghost story—that I could only play secretary to. And I’d be lying if I didn’t say that hurt, especially as a kid. And now that’s no longer true. Now there are women who are Ghostbusters, and they are every bit as fun as their male counterparts. The barrier has been broken—and it was fun to kick down. So if you’re looking for a little more than “that was so funny!”, there’s your answer. Ghostbusters is a funny summer flick that everyone can enjoy… but it’s also more than that. It’s a restructured touchstone. It’s a bigger club. It’s a little girl in a gray jumpsuit on Halloween who comes to your house to defend you from the paranormal, rather than collect candy. Emmet Asher-Perrin is pretty sure that Holtzmann cosplay is in her future. You can bug her on Twitter and Tumblr, and read more of her work here and elsewhere."
"Nov 19, 2018",negative,From top to bottom this movie fails both as a remake and as a stand alone film.
"Nov 13, 2018",positive," There was a huge negative response when it was first announced there would be a remake of the classic Ghostbusters with an all female cast. Once trailers began to come out it seemed that most of the crowd began to get on board. I had high hopes for this female cast and they definitely delivered to a certain extent. Ghostbusters opens with a well done spooky haunted museum which I have to admit was very funny and an excellent way to open the film. We are then introduced to Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wig) who in her past co-authored a book about paranormal activity with her ex-best friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Erin is currently trying to reach tenure at Columbia University and needs the book to be taken offline so it does not discredit her. Abby is currently continuing their research with her new partner Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). It is then that the ladies are introduced to their first ghost at the haunted museum and the rest after that is history. We are later introduced to Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) from another ghostly encounter and the cast is now complete. I was surprised to see a quiet Kristen Wig in this film. From her time on Saturday Night Live and movies like Bridesmaids, I expected to see an all out physical comedic performance from her. The same goes for Melissa McCarthy, who even those she was one of the main characters of the film her scenes were not very memorable. The friendship connection was great between Wig and McCarthy but I feel as though these women could have given us a lot more even with a PG-13 rating. For Kate McKinnon, on the other hand, I truly believe she stole the show with her mad scientist outbursts and some special karaoke moments in the film. McKinnon also gives us an awesome action sequence in the film that had me wanting, even more, screen time from her. Leslie Jones also holds her own in this film and takes a break from her typical characters on Saturday Night Live to give us a different personality from her. It was refreshing to see that she can play other roles that don’t require her to be over the top. Chris Hemsworth was another standout in this film with his receptionist role as Kevin. If you haven’t seen him in Vacation you wouldn’t know that he can be very funny as well when he’s not protecting Asgard. He did a great job at playing the hot yet not so smart guy and delivered numerous funny lines in the film. Overall, I thought the movie was good and definitely had its funny moments. You will also see some familiar faces in some much-needed cameos.  I loved the action scenes I still expected more from this stellar comedic cast but I did not feel that money would be wasted seeing this film in theaters. I would have to rate this film a PAY to see in theaters. I’d say Wait. I was excited for the idea of a bunch of women kicking butt however this just wasn’t done right. I didn’t like the action and the fact that Leslie Jones (the bw) had to be the only non-scientist just street smart. Very typical Hollywood remake but not well executed on."
"Nov 9, 2018",neutral," Filmmaker Paul Feig’s ‘Ghostbusters’ reboot pretty much followed the characteristic aspects of his previous films (‘Bridesmaids’, ‘The Heat’, ‘Spy’) all incorporating a self-awareness of female-oriented friendship and the estrogen-driven escapades rooted in inspired goofiness. So given this familiar foundation of Feig’s big screen blueprint one would expect that his creative input into the continued ‘Ghostbusters’ franchise for the millennium moviegoers would result in the heralded hype his film project is now enjoying at large. Sure, the feminine-charged ‘Ghostbusters’ seemed like a radical concept and would obviously trigger the nostalgic sentiments and comparisons of the classic 80s comedy spearheaded by beloved on-screen paranormal hucksters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Nevertheless, singer Ray Parker Jr.’s lyrical catchphrase ‘Who you gonna call?’ within the ‘Ghostbusters’ theme song needs to be addressed accordingly. The answer: the handlers behind the original ‘Ghostbusters’ film that could uplift the disjointed high jinks and synthetic silliness of Feig’s current comedic ghostly she-power schlockfest. It is only natural that ‘Ghostbusters’ had high expectations for Sony Pictures to perform well, given the aggressive marketing tactics, early release of the ‘Ghostbusters’ movie trailer (which was heavily panned online) and the aforementioned cinematic legacy of the original film’s fanatical following and reputation. However, this third installation of ‘Ghostbusters’ feels curiously flat and strained in its stillborn witticism. The creep factor borders on campy and cheesy, although this effectively worked for Ivan Reitman’s 32-year old spook-ridden farce in the eighties, for which in today’s cinematic circle is inexcusable due to the edgier and challenging special effects that could have played up the whimsy and wonderment of this breezy, bubble-gum coloured romp with seemingly low-grade spark and sizzle. Feig’s interpretation of the ‘Ghostbusters’ universe could have been fresh and favorable especially with the colorful casting of his capable four female principals in the Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy along with ‘Saturday Night Live’ personalities Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Unfortunately for these noted funny ladies, they were saddled (or slimmed if you will) by a transparent script almost as invisible as the pesky ghosts they are trying to pacify. The recycled by-the-numbers hilarity and hysteria does not make this brand of ghost-busting quite distinguishing. Chemistry-wise, the Ghostbuster gals seem to revel in the collective merry-minded mischievousness and genuinely try to bring energy and outrageous antics to this flaccid frightfest. Still, the mixture of ‘Ghostbusters’ gooey gumption with a dash of egghead feisty femininity never seems to translate into anything beyond the tired gimmick of promoting another excuse to tap into yesteryear’s profitable fun and frolic that made the wise-cracking Murray and his klutzy cohorts so amusing and welcomed in their rollicking ghostly gem from the Reagan-era. Quite frankly, the notion that ‘Ghostbusters’ is unfairly being knocked for its misogynistic overtones fueled by bias Internet-based fanboys not accepting that nerdy womanly scientists cannot fill the shoes of their revered male counterparts from the previous two predecessors is somewhat misleading. Sure, the decision to cast an all-female Ghostbusters team turned some curious heads but, for the most part, many thought this to be rather intriguing and experimental. The actual disdain can be pinpointed to the fact that Feig’s flimsy boo-spewing fable is grounded in clichéd and forced chuckles, weak-kneed jokes and gags, lazy writing and uninspired visual neon lighting techniques that look like a cheapened explosion from a vintage late 70s New York discotheque. Unfortunately, ‘Ghostbusters’ wallows in mediocrity and fails to capture the acquired giddiness and imagination so pronounced in the prior entertaining installments. Even if the original actors in Murray, Aykroyd, the late Ramis and Hudson had decided to reprise their roles under Feig’s problematic production, the results would be the same, an aimless reboot without any definitive bite or backbone for a cobbled comedy that is slight and stretched thin to its toothless core. Amazingly, ‘Ghostbusters’ cannot decide if it should remain faithful to its humble roots (it does help trivially that iconic ‘Ghostbuster’ notables make scattered cameos, sans Rick Moranis, including that glorified scene-stealer in the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man as well as hot dog gulper Slimer) or venture off into something resembling its own goofy identity and distinction. Either way, the third time around simply meanders in over-produced, noisy emptiness. The so-called plot in ‘Ghostbusters’ focuses on college professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig presumably in the Murray/Dr. Peter Venkman role) and her fascination with ghost activities that end up costing her an academic career in the process. Specifically, Erin’s controversial book that she wrote along with co-author Abby Yates (McCarthy) served as the basis for her firing. Abby’s obsession with ghosts still has her invested with this spirit phenomenon that she researches defiantly with her kooky associate Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) in tow. Eventually, it would take the trio’s status of joblessness (not to mention a run-in with a slim-spewing ghost that loves soaking humans with its sticky green goo) to collaborate on going into business as paranormal exterminators out to showcase their expertise in ‘busting ghosts’. In the meanwhile, there is something brewing in the twisted mind of supernatural-loving freak Rowan North (Neil Casey). After all, he is the lost soul responsible for unleashing the onslaught of riff-raffish apparitions upon New York City courtesy of his miserable, lonely existence. Now it is up to Erin, Abby and Jillian to eliminate Rowan’s sinister agenda and eradicate the spooky pests that he has manipulated to cause the city-wide panic. As Internet sensational darlings, the Ghostbusters are committed to step up to the plate as the sassy saviors they were meant to be since going into the ghost-busting industry. The later arrival of street-wise transit worker Patty Tolan (Jones) completes the Ghostbusters’ quartet. Patty, whose run in with one of the slimy ghosts in the subway tunnel was pivotal to joining the three scientists, has something to offer the ghost-chasing brainiacs: a.) her knowledge of the city’s whereabouts and b.) her funeral director uncle’s hearse that serves as the official transportation for the Ghostbusters. Overall, the third outing regarding this toothless entry ‘Ghostbusters’ notoriously lacks the robust impishness and rapport of the male character counterparts that were devilishly drawn together and cemented by Murray’s droll humor. Here, the ladies come off as bland and indifferent, at least for the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the team in Wiig’s Erin Gilbert and McCarthy’s Abby Yates. McKinnon’s Jillian Holtzman is the only truly spry Ghostbuster who is credible as an off-kilter genius ditz with off-the-wall likability. Some may gravitate towards Jones’s stereotypical brassy black chick with the brash quips and animated overreactions. Although Jones brings in the high-wire urbanized smirks in contrast to her quieter, geekier counterparts, it is cringeworthy watching her play an over-the-top, towering, mouthy cultural exaggeration that is woefully embarrassing for the sake of this dismissive, hedonistic hoot. Ironically, it is the hunky Chris Hemsworth that fares decently as the handsome himbo Kevin, the dim-witted Ghostbusters male assistant that serves as the doltish eye candy for the cerebral lasses, particularly for the smitten Erin. Another SNL alum, Cecily Strong, checks in as the menacing mouthpiece from the Mayor’s office that tries to discredit the popular ghost-busting technicians as ‘sad, thrill-seeking women’. Feig, serving as both the film’s director and co-screenwriter (along with ‘The Heat’ scriber Katie Dippold) has no cohesive vision for the listless ‘Ghostbusters’ and could have used some critical pointers in studying the proven anatomy of what made Reitman’s nostalgic vehicle so engaging that still thrives after three decades since coming into the movie audience’s consciousness. From the lame and limping laughs dipped in cartoonish crudeness (ie a male ghost gets a rousing jolt to his ‘junk’ courtesy of his heroic ghost-busting detractors) to musical acts Fall Out Boy’s/Missy Elliott’s relentlessly unrecognisable, erratic and choppy remake of the aforementioned Parker’s infectious ‘Ghostbusters’ theme song in this regurgitated comedy that has no excuse for catering to a lackluster rebirth while die-hard and casual fans patiently waited for a festive follow-up from Murray and crew for thirty-plus years. To randomly quote a classic ‘Ghostbusters’ lyrical line: ‘I ain’t ‘fraid of no ghosts’. This may be the case but one should be very afraid of this heavy-handed banal boofest for wasting their time, anticipation and consideration.

"Nov 4, 2018",positive,A great team deserved a greater story.
"Nov 2, 2018",positive,"Just like the first one, Ghostbusters '16 benefits simply by putting a supremely talented comedic director and cast together and letting them do their thing."
"Nov 2, 2018",neutral," Someone is trying to amplify ghost activity in Manhattan. In an attempt to study these happenings, a group of skilled women get together and start a new business. The team includes a paranormal researcher, a physicist, a nuclear engineer, and a New York City subway worker. Together they will investigate the ghost sightings and try to determine what is causing them. Will the Ghostbusters be able to save the city from a ghost invasion? The marketing campaign for this film was not well done. The trailers made it look cheesy and most people assumed that this would be one of the worst films of the year. While I agree that the trailers were not great, I was still optimistic about the new all-female version of Ghostbusters. I’m happy to say that this film delivers! When doing a remake or a reboot it is important to create something new and exciting while also paying homage to the original. The Ghostbusters of 2016 is a hilarious film that someone who has never seen the original can watch and absolutely love. At the same time there are numerous nods to the 1984 Ghostbusters, including many great cameos, that bring a healthy dose of nostalgia for the viewers that grew up with the original film. It is almost comparable to the Goosebumps (2015) movie as well in that it was made for old and new audiences to enjoy, while being completely self aware and adding in jokes about itself. Ghostbusters (2016) has a great story line. The filmmakers do a great job of creating dynamic characters whom the audience really gets to know. It is clear which 1984 Ghostbusters are used as inspiration for the 2016 Ghostbusters, yet they clearly have their own personalities as well. They also do a great job creating a mystery as to how and why the supernatural occurrences are increasing in number and severity, leading up to the epic finale. The plot has many aspects that reminded viewers of the previous films, but it can stand on it’s own because the story is something audiences haven’t seen before. It is fun, exciting, and kept me laughing almost non-stop from the opening scene up until after the credits (helpful hint: stay until after the credits are done rolling). All of the characters in this film are incredibly well cast and absolutely hilarious. We all know from the film Bridesmaids that Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy have amazing on screen chemistry and are guaranteed to make us laugh. They do not disappoint in this film with Wiig as the physicist, Erin, and McCarthy as Abby, the paranormal researcher. The two lesser-known actresses are excellent as well. Leslie Jones (Saturday Night Live) does an amazing job as the NY subway worker, Patty. She brings a healthy amount of sass to the cast as well as bringing the street smarts and knowledge of New York history to the Ghostbusters team. The Ghostbuster who stole the show for me is Kate McKinnon (Saturday Night Live) as the outrageous Holtzmann. McKinnon manages to take the idea of a mad scientist to a whole new level. There isn’t a moment when McKinnon is on screen that my eye wasn’t drawn to her and she had me cracking up. All of these women were the perfect choices for an all female version of Ghostbusters. I also have to mention that Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) delivers some great laughs as the dimwitted receptionist, Kevin. While I am generally not a fan of CGI, this film would have been virtually impossible to accomplish without it. The ghosts in this film are similar to the original in that they are somewhat transparent and mostly green in color. In this film they also added blue tones to the look of the ghosts. The biggest difference is that the original film used CGI effects to turn actors into transparent ghosts. In this film the CGi is a bit more cartoon looking so when you see the ghosts it doesn’t look like an actor, but something entirely made by computers. I didn’t love the cartoon-like look, but again it would be very difficult for the filmmakers to achieve the film without the CGI aspect. Ghostbusters (2016) is an uproarious film filled with laughs, intrigue, and girl power.  It will bring in a new audience that has never experienced Ghostbusters before, while also appealing to those who know and love the franchise. Before the film came out the internet essentially took a big crap on the film, whether it was because people opposed an all-female cast or because the trailer let them down. I’m here to tell you that this is one of the best reboots I have seen in a very long time. I don’t anticipate the film having a huge opening weekend, thanks to the marketing, but hopefully those who do see it will spread the word that this is a genius film. Go to the theater, enjoy the film, spread the word. The Ghostbusters are back in town."
"Nov 1, 2018",positive," Up front, I just need to make it clear that I am a massive fan of Ghostbusters. It has been one of my favourite films since I first saw it when I was six years old. I love the movies, I love the cartoons, I love the toys, and nothing brings me more joy than when I can find an excuse to quote the movie in everyday conversation. But ever since it was announced Ghostbusters was getting a reboot, the Internet has been in uproar not only because of the usual childhood sodomising claims, but because the filmmakers had the audacity to make the titular group of paranormal investigators all female. All of this at first could easily be blown off as the usual sexist Internet trolls blowing things out of proportion, but then that first trailer came out and all hell broke loose. Suddenly, this new Ghostbusters became a marketing nightmare and even anyone with any legitimate criticism unfortunately became associated with the aforementioned trolls. But now that the film is finally available to the public and I have witnessed it, I have a very strong urge to break composure and address the naysayers with some colourful language, but I’m going to remain civil and simply say I liked this movie. Quite a bit, actually. Here’s why. In describing the new Ghostbusters, the key phrase I’d use is “similar, but different.” The film is structurally comparable to the original, especially in the first half as our heroes discover the presence of ghosts and set up their business to fight back against them. You’ve got the university dismissing the Ghostbusters for their preposterous findings, accusations that they are actually frauds causing these apparitions for monetary gain, the slow discovery that the spike of paranormal activity is leading to an apocalyptic event, and government figures who ignore their findings in the face of this crisis. But to call this film a rehash of the original is like calling The Force Awakens a rip-off of A New Hope: it’s clearly intentional. From that basic template, this new Ghostbusters takes the series in a different direction and that is mainly done through having its own unique voice. It takes the core concept of the franchise and injects it with Paul Feig’s outlook and sensibilities, creating a film that certainly respects its source material but also wants to do things its own way. With that, the sense of humour is definitely more akin to his movies than the Ivan Reitman originals or similar films of that era and genre. The jokes are a lot faster and cruder, full of more adlibs and asides, than the more sarcastic and absurdist comedy that fuelled the original. But the key thing you’re all concerned about is far simpler: is it funny? That’s hard to judge because everyone’s funny bone is tickled differently, but for me I can happily say I laughed consistently throughout the entire runtime. Sure, not every joke hits, with most of the duds being the ones they used in the trailers (seriously, was Sony’s marketing department trying to make this movie look bad?), but enough of them do that it keeps the movie consistently entertaining. The movie does begin to outstay its welcome as it reaches its third act, especially given the slightly bloated two-hour runtime, and the many different pieces of fan service vary from chuckle-worthy to cloying, but none of that is enough to stop the movie from being a fun, entertaining ride. Recapturing the magic of the original Ghostbusters cast is something you just can’t do, and so again the filmmakers have done something different with their new batch of heroes and I’m not just talking about their lack of Y-chromosomes. There are definitely elements of those original characters in the new team, with Melissa McCarthy’s Abby having an enthusiasm for her work comparable to Ray and Kate McKinnon’s Holtzmann being an awkward introvert genius in the vein of Egon, but these are otherwise original, funny and likable characters that stand apart from their masculine predecessors. In many facets these comediennes are just playing exaggerated versions of their real-life personas, but no more so than Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson were. Kristen Wiig’s Erin is certainly the most unique of the group, coming into this situation with more trepidation than excitement, and her inner conflict as she tries to find that balance between respectable scientist and paranormal geek makes her a deeper character and a great role model for those fighting against their own quirks in an attempt to be “normal”. McCarthy, as she did in Spy, thankfully uses her usual abrasive persona sparingly for comic effect rather than just being a walking trove of colourful insults, and her relationship with Wiig gives a strong emotional core to the story as two friends driven apart by conflicting priorities. Leslie Jones’ Patty makes for a good grounding presence as the layman of the group who honestly gets more character development in this one movie than Winston ever did in both of the originals, but I do think she will be a divisive presence; if you already don’t like Jones’ sense of humour, this won’t change your mind. But the breakout MVP of the main cast is most certainly McKinnon, finally putting her Saturday Night Live chops to good use and stealing every frame of film she appears on. She’s a hilarious wildcard of a character, with nothing that comes out of her mouth being predictable or sane. Seriously, if nothing else, I hope she at least gets some more shots at the big leagues because she bloody deserves it. The supporting cast in comparison, however, feels a little undercooked. Neil Casey’s scheming Rowan does bring to mind Peter MacNicol’s Janosz from Ghostbusters II, but unfortunately not only is he not a particularly original character but he lacks development. It’s a real shame because there is a lot of potential with his character and towards the end he does start to become more interesting and even funny, but eventually it just devolves into another “blast the ghost” finale. Andy Garcia and Cecily Strong have some funny moments as the Mayor of New York and his conniving assistant respectively, especially in how confusedly they try to deny the existence of paranormal phenomena despite the obviousness, but they come into the story a bit too late to be effective. Michael K. Williams and Matt Walsh are basically just glorified extras with nothing particularly interesting to do, Charles Dance is funny whilst he’s there but is never seen again after his two scenes, and the various cameos from the original cast members are mostly just throwaway gags. Nevertheless, the salvation of the supporting cast comes from the most unlikely of places, and that is the simple but elegant brilliance of Chris Hemsworth’s Kevin. His entire shtick stems from the simple joke of “he’s an idiot”, and the sheer lunacy of how far his stupidity goes never ceases to get a laugh. Even when other jokes fall flat, you can always count of Kevin to get that smile back on your face. The “similar, but different” approach the film takes also applies to the film on a technical level, appropriating many of the visuals of its source but repurposing them and giving them a new twist along with some welcome additions. The redesigns of elements like the jumpsuits, the proton packs and the Ecto-1 are ultimately harmless changes, but the new tech the film adds some much needed variety to the actual busting of ghosts and gives the action something a little more panache than just a bunch of guys standing still and firing lasers. The ghost designs are perfectly fine and match up well to the style of the original films, though I do wish there were more practical elements to the ghost effects instead of the full CG blowout. However, the effects themselves never seem unconvincing and for the most part fit in well with the more colourful tone of the film. The film’s overall look is far brighter and slicker than its forbearers, but it’s a shift in aesthetic than is again more fitting to the film’s tone. Theodore Sharpio’s score for the film is certainly nowhere near as iconic as Elmer Bernstein’s compositions for the original, but some of the pop music choices for the soundtrack are inspired. Oh, and for those who don’t like Fall Out Boy’s cover of the classic Ghostbusters theme (I’m kind of indifferent to it), don’t fret too much; it’s only used briefly in one montage scene and the Ray Parker Jr. original remains front and centre. Let’s all face it: there was no way any new version of Ghostbusters could match up to the original. Remember, the core creative team tried to with Ghostbusters II and even they couldn’t manage it. It’s a unique lighting-in-a-bottle film that could not have worked at any other time, and expecting the same thing to happen again in completely different circumstances is pretty much insane. So the fact that this new Ghostbusters isn’t as good as the original is absolutely no shock to me, but the fact that it succeeds on its own terms does bring me a great deal of delight. It’s a film that is keenly aware of its legacy and wants to honour, but it also wants to do it on its own terms. It takes the premise of Ghostbusters and makes it its own, bringing a different sense of humour, a different cast of characters, and a different outlook on the world. The gender change to the main cast is absolutely the last thing wrong with this movie, and if there is any justice in this world their chemistry and humour will only inspire Hollywood to bring more casting diversity to Hollywood blockbusters. Will every fan of the franchise be pleased by the final result? Given the backlash before even a frame of footage was shot, I can unequivocally say no. But for anyone willing to accept the film for what it is trying to do rather than measuring it against a film it isn’t trying to be, then I’d say there’s a far stronger chance you’ll come out liking it. If you have even the slightest affection for Ghostbusters, you owe it to yourselves to go see the movie and decide for yourself. If you don’t like it, that’s perfectly fine with me as long as your opinion doesn’t completely stem from a preconceived place of hate."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," It’s unfair to compare the 2016 reboot of Ghostbusters to the 1984 original. That film was possessed of a singular type of chemistry and coincidence that remains impossible to quantize or replicate. Even the cast and the crew of the original was unable to do it for 1989’s Ghostbusters II. The new film is its own creation, even if it is outwardly and reverentially devoted to the original. It’s just as effortlessly funny, and the cast is just as solid. In some cases, its even better than the original, something that the legions of easily-offended “Ghostbros”  aren’t going want to hear. As before, we have a team made of three scientists and a civilian who have taken it upon themselves to combat the rising tide of supernatural mayhem threatening to engulf New York City. Drs. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) co-authored a book on ghosts years prior to the opening of the film, but while Erin has disavowed the book and tried to become a respectable professor, Abby has continued researching the paranormal alongside brilliant, mad (and brilliantly mad) scientist Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). When the sighting of an apparition brings the two friends together again, Erin’s belief in ghosts is rekindled, and the three go into business as ghost hunters. The trio becomes a quartet when they are joined by MTA worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), who has an encyclopedic knowledge of New York City, and end up being “assisted” by their very pretty but very air-headed secretary Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). Oh, and if you didn’t catch it in the previous paragraph, all the Ghostbusters are women. This is more important to the audience than it ever is to the narrative, however. Director Paul Feig has made a career out of female-driven comedies that often toy with genre expectations, like The Heat or Spy (both of which also feature McCarthy).  Ghostbusters is no different, and like those films, it isn’t a film about female characters but a film about characters who simply happen to be female. This shouldn’t be a radical concept in 2016, but given the unprecedented and disproportionately sexist backlash against the film that’s accompanied it since day one, that’s apparently the case. Feig and co-wrier Katie Dippold never make the film about the Ghostbusters being women, and that’s part of what makes it work so well. Aside from one character patronizingly referring to the Busters as “girls”, nobody questions their legitimacy because of their gender. This allows the characters to exist organically in their surroundings, to breathe and become their own creatures without constantly having to fight a battle on behalf of all women everywhere. There are no romantic subplots unless you count Erin’s quite understandable (but completely one-sided and awkward) crush on Kevin, and the film passes the Bechdel Test with flying colors. A very large part of what makes the film feel so natural are the lead actresses, four of the most consistently funniest women working on screen today. McCarthy and Wiig have a very distinct chemistry, and they easily sell the relationship between Erin and Abby. Both characters are tailored to each actress’ comedic style without either seeming like another variation on their previous roles. Similarly, Leslie Jones riffs on the out-loud persona she’s cultivated during her time on Saturday Night Live, but Patty is a much richer and more complex character. She’s just as smart as the scientists she teams up with, but her knowledge comes more from practical experience than theory, and she helps ground the other three characters from becoming lost in what-ifs and scientific jargon. Even Chris Hemsworth displays a remarkable level of comic timing and physicality that breathes giddy life into his otherwise one-joke himbo. The clear stand-out of the cast, however, is Kate McKinnon, proving once again why she’s been SNL’s most valuable player almost since her first season with the show. In the wrong hands, Hotlzmann could have been a wild caricature, but McKinnon gives her an easy, almost deadpan charm that makes her weirdness seem genuine and almost infectious. She effortlessly steals every scene she’s in, even with just a reaction shot from the side of the frame, and she has the same improvisational edge Bill Murray displayed in the original without any of the self-satisfied smarm. She delivers huge helpings of techno-babble with aplomb and a confidence that’s almost frightening in its solidity. Holtzmann is macabre, manic, and pansexually flirty in equal measures, and it's doubtful that anyone but McKinnon could have made her work so brilliantly well. What ends up keeping the film from truly flying high, however, is not the cast, the director, or the script but the unfortunate subtext of real life and cinematic constraints. A number of jokes from the trailers aren’t in the final cut of the film, and it’s glaringly obvious where they should have been. A number of editing cuts seem abrupt and haphazard, and it mars the pacing and flow of far too many scenes. It really seems as if the studio took the film at the last minute and cut bits out to keep the runtime as close to under two hours as they could (and Feig claims that his first cut clocked in at over four hours). The film also has an unfortunate and completely unfair amount of baggage it has to deal with from the internet backlash against it, something it comments on repeatedly with everything from jokes about YouTube comments to having as its main antagonist a pasty and socially maladjusted geek named Rowan (played by Neil Casey) who plans to unleash spectral Armageddon on the world simply because he gets picked on by other people. On its own, this is fairly innocuous, and it plays out well over the course of the story, especially when compared to how the Busters have similarly been discounted and ridiculed by others for their work but have chosen to do something productive about it. But given the atmosphere in which the movie has been released, it takes on a metatextual and almost satirical vibe that doesn’t fit with the rest of the film and threatens to pull viewers almost completely out of the narrative. It's as if the Busters are literally fighting their real-life haters, and while that should be admirable given the circumstances, it prevents the film from existing purely and totally on its own. A lot of that is forgiven during the climax, however, a thrilling, city-wide, well-choreographed, effects-heavy smack down that highlights the personalities of each of the Busters through something as seemingly simple as their choice of weapons (their arsenal is much more varied than the 1984 original). The reboot is never going to supplant the original, but it is a much more worthy successor to that film than either the official sequel or any of the embarrassing animated spin-offs that have been attempted over the years. Whether it's the ghosts that plague New York City, the specter of nostalgia, or even just the trolls of the Internet, these girls kick a whole lot of ass without ever once losing their sense of humor. If all reboots were this much fun, summer at the movies might not be quite as scary. “Any time Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Orlando Bloom want to have an archery contest at Comic-Con, just let me know, and I’ll be there.”"
"Aug 27, 2018",positive,"The new Ghostbusters film is a smart, spectacular addition to the series."
"Aug 24, 2018",positive," When Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat) decided to dip his toes into the Ghostbusters franchise he probably didn’t expect the disgustingly hateful wave of backlash he received from Meninist crybaby’s and Bill Murray fanboys the world over, making the 2016 reboot of the 1984 ‘classic’ (that no one really cared so passionately about until this was announced) the most disliked trailer in YouTube history and spurred a mass IMDB vote-down. Placing women in the leading roles shouldn’t be considered a ‘brave move’, but Ghostbusters was painted as just that, a feminist film to end all prejudice, a scathing attack on nerds and dude-bros and surely the end to Feig’s career. What people forgot to address was that this was all bullshit; Ghostbusters is simply a comedy about a group of scientists fighting off ghouls in Manhattan. Childhood friends Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) haven’t seen each other in years, until a leaked copy of their book divulging their theories on the supernatural threatens Erin’s job at Columbia University. When Erin confronts Abby about the matter she also meets Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), a mad scientist type and Abby’s new partner, who is working with Abby on the pair’s old theories. Because of the scandal of the book Erin she loses her job and ends up reuniting with Abby and Holtzmann after a ghost scare is rumoured downtown, they proceed to set up their own company dealing with the removal of paranormal entities. It’s typical Scooby Doo Mystery Inc. fanfare from here on out, a few cases, a rocky relationship, a new addition to the team in the form of Patsy (Leslie Jones), a subway worker spooked by the goings on and the fun mash-up scenes where we watch Holtzmann build and test their various paranormal detecting/defeating equipment, but it’s fun and its nostalgic, cheesy and kind of adorable seeing these women famed for gross adult humour knuckle down and get on kid-humour level. Our bad-guy takes shape in the form of Rowan, a lone creepy outsider (just like the critics of this Ghostbusters reboot, funny that) who wants to achieve ultimate power by creating a portal in the middle of Manhattan and letting ghosts and monsters rule the streets (please tell me you’re still following the live action Scooby Doo vibes!?), but the girls are hot on his tails with proton packs, guns, lasers and the iconic hearse van, kicking off some wicked action sequences paired with some early 00’s CGI monsters. Although Ghostbusters doesn’t move forward with the times in plot or special effects but that’s why it works; a homage to slime and goofy effects that riddled films in the 80s, 90s and 00s. It’s refreshing to see the return of the live-action children’s film, something silly and grand that isn’t shrouded in the Disney Pixar canon and as a standalone film Ghostbusters knows exactly what it is, remake or not. Will it stand the test of time? Probably not. But for now it’s a much needed break from endless animation. Whether you are a lover of cartoonish special effects or not, it’s the comedic performances of the leads that drive the film. Chris Hemsworth’s off-brand turn as Kevin the receptionist is a harmonious highlight, every last second he’s on screen is milked within an inch of its life for laughs, but pays off in an innocent and mildly flirtatious manner. The decision to not push Erin’s crush on Kevin into romance territory was a fine move indeed. However, the usually side-splittingly hilarious Wiig and McCarthy are often left in the whirlwind of big-screen newcomer and SNL wizard Kate McKinnon’s Holtzmann, whose whip-fast quips, pantomime facial expressions and impromptu dances shine through and are sure to land her a place on 2016’s most popular Halloween get-ups. Her slightly maddening jibes and eccentric personality take away some of the fun from Wiig and McCarthy’s performances, but not their credibility as leading ladies. Holtzmann’s irrevocable coolness accumulates in the slickest scene of the film, a long take showing her stomping through ghouls with her Proton Pack to the Ghostbusters theme song with a precision and flair I can only pinpoint to the hallway fight scene in Park Chan-Wook’s Oldboy. She’s not the only cool cat of the bunch though, Leslie Jones still manages to shine through though with her bubbly charm and Cheshire Cat grin, though being the only woman of colour in the new line-up, it’s sad that her role was diminished to a subway worker with no scientific or supernatural background/interest, even though her passion for the team is cemented, the representation of black women in a scientific field would have been a welcome and ‘progressive’ addition to the plot. Scientific jargon is used widely by the team, obviously a lot of it made up for the purpose of the Ghostbusters work and machinery, but it was never explained what it meant during conversations as most science based films do, using a ‘less-intelligent’ member of the cast to open up that conversation, in this case Kevin, whom nothing was explained to. It was a brilliant little way to assert the girls’ knowledge and intelligence, in a world where women are too used to explaining themselves. It’s a feat to see such intelligent women on screen, unapologetic in their vast knowledge and to encourage girls to work in STEM fields, to show them that they can be fighters, but still be smart. Ghostbusters isn’t a grand feminist statement and probably won’t change attitudes to women on screen, but it’s a perfect popcorn family film for all ages, uniting the nostalgia buried within adults and the glossy wide-eyed spectacle of the movies for kids it’s a sure fire hit for anyone wondering how to entertain their children this summer. What Feig has successfully done is put women in the centre of the picture, in a male driven genre. It doesn’t display a super progressive cast or even a very intricate plot, and that shouldn’t matter. It’s a kid’s movie, it’s exciting and fun and scary and funny and for that 10 year old girl sat in the front row, merely seeing those women up there is enough. Chloe Leeson is the founder of Screenqueens. She is 20 and from the north of England (the proper north). She believes Harmony Korine is the future and is pretty sure she coined the term ‘selfie central’. She doesn’t like Pina Coladas or getting caught in the rain but she does like Ezra Miller a whole lot. Her favourite films are Into The Wild, The Beach and Lords of Dogtown. But DON’T talk to her about Paranormal Activity. She rants about cinema screenings @kawaiigoff. This was a great read, thank you, Chloe. I can’t wait to finally see this film with my own eyes.

"Aug 23, 2018",positive," 
  WAS there ever a film so haunted by an original than Ghostbusters? From the time a reboot was announced, with an all-female cast of spectre hunters – pause here for Munchian scream at the feminist cheek of it – anyone would think Hollywood was planning to remake Citizen Kane with sock puppets.
 
  In reality, apart from a cracking, Oscar-nominated song, the 1984 comedy directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Sigourney Weaver had its flaws, among them a third act that lasted almost as long as some have been waiting for the Second Coming. If it wasn’t for the song, and the “Who you gonna call?” hook-line, the first Ghostbusters (hands up who even remembers the 1989 sequel?) might have been just another enjoyable enough comedy, fondly remembered but nothing groundbreaking.
 
  Paul Feig’s 2016 version hits the same mark. It has some ace lines, and some cracking performances, but it is also irritatingly baggy, unfocused, and has a character so annoying I would rather wake to Nosferatu than willingly submit to five more minutes in her company.
 
  The picture starts promisingly with a tour guide telling visitors about a haunted house from olden times that included a room where “PT Barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants”. Feig, the director of Bridesmaids and The Heat, here writing as well as directing, always gives good snark. You can tell some of the lines have been polished till they gleam.
 
  The tour does not end well, leaving the curator to seek the services of Erin, a physicist played by Kristen Wiig. Once a believer in ghosts, now a respectable academic trying for tenure, Erin does not want the gig. But fate hurls her together with her old ghost-hunting partner Abby (Melissa McCarthy), who has never lost her faith in an afterlife. These two are joined by Patty (Leslie Jones), a subway worker looking for a new challenge, and Holtzmann, a wacky inventor type (played by Kate McKinnon). How wacky is this character? Phenomenally. She’s the team equivalent of the Fast Show’s Colin Hunt, the office joker complete with silly specs and non-stop girning. Some have found her one of the best things about the film – make your own mind up.
 
  There are, predictably enough, nods to the first film. One or two work, others are clunkers it might have been best to leave on the drawing board.
 
  Far more successful than the cameos or the cliched inventor character is Leslie Jones, a comic actor I would definitely want to see again. She could carry a film on her own. Wiig and McCarthy already do that, of course. Both graduates of Bridesmaids, they spark off each other like the old pros they are. Also worth mentioning in dispatches is Chris Hemsworth, playing a nice but dim receptionist who could have come straight out of a Diet Coke advert. When it comes to eye candy in Ghostbusters, Hemsworth is it. Another winning touch of role reversal there from Feig.
 
  The technical stuff, the conjuring up of ghosts, ghouls and ectoplasm, is impressive, reflecting the decades that have passed in special effects since the first film, but what we have come for is the comedy, and this Ghostbusters is not quite enough of a blast compared to say, McCarthy and Feig’s special agent spoof Spy, or Wiig’s weird but wonderful bleak comedy Welcome to Me. A few great lines – and when they are good they are very good – do not a 116-minute comedy make. Not even the practised sparring of Wiig and McCarthy can disguise a shortage of jokes in the script. Riffs go on too long, scenes are over-extended, and gags stretched thin. And yes, perhaps in some misguided homage to that first film, the finale goes on forever and a day.

"Aug 22, 2018",positive,"""Ghostbusters"" is actually fun, with callbacks to the original present without making itself out to be an exact copy. It has its own brand of charm and is pretty entertaining for a summer flick."
"Aug 22, 2018",positive," I so don’t get the controversy over this film. The 1984 original did indeed become iconic, but it’s certainly ripe for a reboot after 32 years. Don’t Batman, Superman and Spiderman get a little work done and then come back to plague us three or four times a decade? This fresh take on a comedy classic, starring some of the world’s greatest comediennes, is at least something we haven’t seen before. What’s so wrong about letting the girls have a go at it? There’s absolutely nothing wrong with it, as it turns out. Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon are spot on choices to replace Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson as a quartet of Manhattan-based paranormal investigators who arm themselves with whacky gadgets to combat the odd uptick in ghosts and ghoulies and things that go bump in the night. The addition of Chris Hemsworth as their himbo receptionist is sheer genius. Now this is not to say that the 2016 version of Ghostbusters is the perfect film. I place the blame for that squarely on other shoulders of Paul Feig, who directed and co-wrote the script with Katie Dippold. While Feig was able to elicit razor sharp performances from the actors, he took a charming and amusing first half, then overstuffed the rest of the film with so many ray gun blasting special effects I felt like I’d stuck my finger in a light socket by the time it was through. And while the stars all gave game performances, they would have been better served with a sharper script that better defined their characters and dialogue. Many bits just trail off, without the crisp punctuation of the original, and the characters’ all have funny mannerisms that never quite gel into identifiable personalities. But perhaps I’m expecting too much from the summer’s most anticipated popcorn flick, according to a Fandango moviegoers survey. See it in 3D for stunning pop outs, and just close your eyes when the ghost busting rays start to sizzle them. Ghostbusters is definitely night out worthy.

"Jul 16, 2018",positive," While it would have been nice to have seen the likes of Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Winston Zeddemore pass the baton to a new generation, Harold Ramis’ death in 2014 would forever change the face of the franchise.  Never mind just how hard it is getting Bill Murray to sign on board for anything.  With that out of the way, let’s discuss the film. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon are among four of the most talented women in comedy.  Bridesmaids director Paul Feig, who penned the script with Katie Dippold, is at the helm of the franchise update.  What helps is that these folks are playing new characters and not trying to do their impressions of the originals.  McCarthy and Wiig may be comedic forces of nature but McKinnon brings her own quirkiness to the role while Jones outright steals the show!  It’s absolutely fun watching the four of them working together. At the start of the film, physicist Erin Gilbert (Wiig) and parannormal expert Abby Yates (McCarthy) have been out of touch for a bit.  The two wrote a book together but they became the laughingstock of the science community without having proof.  By the time that Erin reunites with Abby, Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon) is helping out Abby out as an engineer.  While investigating activity in the subway, they encounter and then recruit Patty Tolan (Jones) to the team.  Patty’s knowledge of New York plays to the team’s advantage. Let’s talk about Kevin.  Chris Hemsworth adds such a funny layer to the Ghostbusters secretary, Kevin Beckman.  We already knew from Thor: Ragnarok that there was a funny side to Hemsworth.  What he does in Ghostbusters goes above and behind.  Improv isn’t an easy skill to master but Hemsworth is able to hold his own against talented improvisers.  As a character, Kevin’s looks are able to off-set his lack of a decent IQ.  Oh, he can dance, too.  Oh, can he ever! Revisiting the franchise some thirty years after the release means the technology gets a scientific upgrade.  The proton packs aren’t the only things to get an update.  A 1981-83 Cadillac hearse replaces the 1959 Cadillac ambulance to serve as the Ecto-1. Listen, I’m not a fan of reboots.  What I’m not going to do, however, is bash a film because all four leads happen to be female.  There’s more to life than sexism and that’s a fact.  If people don’t like this film solely because it’s an all-female reboot, that’s on them.  The question that I have to ask myself is this: how does this film do on its own merits?  The film’s spirit holds up to that of what we saw in 1984. One positive thing that comes from casting the four women in leading roles is that films like this can help when it comes to women working in STEM.  When young girls see women as scientists on screen, they get inspired to go into those fields.  Whether this is something that filmmakers considered going into the film, I don’t know. Two years after the film was released in theaters, Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters: Answer the Call holds up just fine.  It’s just a shame that the box office take won’t allow us to see more of their stories.

"Mar 7, 2018",positive," After all the hype around an all-female remake of a beloved dude franchise and the subsequent misogyny that hailed down on the trailer to make it the worst-rated of all time — as if all the 900 X-Men movie trailers are masterpieces — it began to feel like the Fate of Middle-Aged Women in Hollywood and the Future of Feminism and All Potential Earnings of My Unborn Daughters' Daughters were at stake with Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot. Given that baggage, I was hoping I'd love it and terrified of what it meant if I didn't. Would I have to justify myself to other women who felt I was hurting the cause? Would I be forced to shut down smug men's rights activists by explaining that I can be both be a feminist and someone who thinks Ghostbusters is meh? As a feminist, there are few things less tedious than dissecting how ""feminist"" or ""unfeminist"" a piece of pop culture is. Ghostbusters, now in theaters, is not some savior of feminism. But why does it have to be? It was pretty funny, self-aware, and even subtly subversive at times. There's a queef joke, a nod to the whiny, man-child YouTube commenters who write things like, ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts,"" and it lampoons the ""ditzy secretary"" role women are forced to play by instead objectifying the very hunky Chris Hemsworth. It's a modern recast of the nerdy sci-fi drama, injected with an undercurrent of female power.  Some critics, like The Hollywood Reporter's Caryn James, argued that Ghostbusters ""isn't female enough"" and suffers from ""bland expository dialogue"" that doesn't adequately celebrate the richness of female friendships. The Economist posits that the film misses an opportunity with a movie ""meant as a seismic shift,"" claiming it's instead an ""enjoyably forgettable goofball of a film."" I get these criticisms. Part of me agrees with them. If given an option between more personality or less in a film, I'll always go for more. It wouldn't be fair to evaluate this movie without acknowledging that. But if this movie falls short of creating a ""seismic shift,"" I'd rather focus my concern on why it's expected to in the first place. Why should this one movie's critical and box-office success dictate the future of female-lead films? Given that major studios so far have zero female directors lined up for movies through 2018, that female actresses get paid less than their male counterparts (as in other fields), and middle-aged women are considered past their prime while older men still have sex appeal, it does feel like so much is riding on every pro-woman movie, book, TV show, or song. But let's not fall into the trap of expecting perfection every time either. This is a pretty fun movie that gets a lot right, not a pathetic shell of a film that tries too hard or is tone-deaf or does a disservice to women. The movie isn't making some declarative, heavy-handed, grandstanding statement about female strength or gender equality or the power of female friendship. It's not biting satire, and it doesn't get emotionally deep or poignant. It's just showing some badass, funny women being badass and funny on the screen, which is in itself progressive, even in 2016. (In fact, many male critics seemed unable to appreciate how significant and thrilling it was for women to simply to watch other women leading a blockbuster.) As the film's screenwriter, Katie Dippold, told Cosmopolitan.com, ""I grew up with so many movies where every movie was about someone trying to find their husband. I'm constantly looking for more movies with camaraderie ... letting people grow up watching movies where it's not about chasing a husband ... that's kind of been my whole mission."" Perhaps that's not enough to start a ""seismic shift,"" but I bet you more than a few girls will watch this movie and get excited about science and action movies, and that's still something. "

"Dec 5, 2017",negative," Following a ghost invasion of Manhattan, paranormal enthusiasts Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates, nuclear engineer Jillian Holtzmann, and subway worker Patty Tolan band together to stop the otherworldly threat. It is completely ridiculous that the gender politics controversy surrounding Paul Feig’s (Spy, The Heat, and Bridesmaids) Ghostbusters reboot has spiraled out of control to the point where I must begin my review by saying up front that while I do not particularly think this film is great, I am not misogynistic or sexist. Some of my most highly praised movies of last year here starred women (Brie Larson gave the best acting achievement of 2015 in the emotionally charged Room, Emily Blunt was a strong presence in the narcotics thriller Sicario, and I even enjoyed Melissa McCarthy in last year’s action comedy Spy). Furthermore, some of the best movies of all time future women being complete badasses, whether it be Sigourney Weaver in Aliens or Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. I also very enjoy watching this little show you probably have never heard of called Game of Thrones, and yes, Emilia Clarke and her dragons are a powerhouse spectacle to behold. With all of this preamble out of the way, Ghostbusters is admittedly definitely not the dumpster fire disaster most expected it would be going into it based on the horrendous trailers. For starters, it was immediately refreshing knowing that Patty (Leslie Jones) is not just a one-note stereotypical loudmouth black woman, but a loudmouth black woman that contributes to the group with a working knowledge of the subway system and some interesting history of various old buildings around Manhattan. Is her character great? No, there is practically no character development at all, but it could have been so much worse. Speaking of characters, that is the primary flaw with this new take on Ghostbusters. Of the four women, only Erin (Kristen Wiig) actually feels like a person that has motivations, a backstory, and some sort of transformation throughout the proceedings of the film. Even though it isn’t explored to the amount of length necessary (if it was, a certain part during the final battle would have felt a lot more emotional instead of par for the course in Hollywood blockbusters), it is something, while the other three ladies basically get nothing. We know Abby (Melissa McCarthy) is a childhood friend of Erin, and even less about the characters played by Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Kate McKinnon in particular gives one of the most obnoxious performances of the year, going way too far over the top with her bizarre and abnormal personality. She is constantly making strange facial expressions, talking with far too much annoyingly complicated paranormal technical jargon that probably makes no sense, and is the literal definition of photo-bombing an entire movie. Early on the girls spot their first ghost, to which the camera cuts to Kate McKinnon randomly eating from a can of Pringles. On one hand, it is just very stupid product placement from Sony, and on the other hand you are just left screaming inside your head mentally wondering why she is eating chips and wondering where she even got them from in a span of five seconds. None of this is meant to be a knock on the acting capabilities of Kate McKinnon, because I don’t think she is necessarily to blame at all. The first few times she acts weird is most definitely endearing, and it is evident that she knows how to portray the thin character she is given, but the script and possible impromptu nature of shooting accidentally goes overboard, when less would have been more from this performance. However, for all the bashing I kind of just did, I will admit that she has by far the most entertaining action sequence of the movie. Also, this will come as a surprise to literally no one, but Melissa McCarthy essentially plays Melissa McCarthy. She yells a lot, talks back to everyone she comes in contact with, complains about her fast food orders, and somewhat feels out of place. To be fair, everyone feels somewhat out of place considering all of the characters are so wildly different from one another that they never really come together in a way that gives them chemistry as a cohesive unit. Now let’s get to the other heavy flaw, which is the fact that the dimwitted receptionist played by Chris Hemsworth that the women hire (it’s also worth noting that they do this just because of his good looks and beefed up body full of muscle) steals the show. And yes, I am aware that the very thought of that is going to send in the misogynistic hate brigade, but I don’t care, because some of his lines are so stupid and brilliantly delivered that he made me laugh more than anything in the movie. He also actually has more chemistry with the Ghostbusters than the actual Ghostbusters do with each other. Anyway, the special effects and designs of the ghosts are a bit of an uninspired mess and not particularly engaging to look at. It is nice that the colors chosen are typically bright, but the designs themselves are lacking, not necessarily coming across as imaginative or even somewhat frightening as some of the apparitions in the original film. It’s all just kind of there, and not even a cameo from Slimer is enough to make their presence fun. What I will say is that I actually didn’t mind the idea for the final entity to defeat. However, the actual villain of the movie is a complete waste of time and one of the most unmemorable villains of the year. I almost wish the movie didn’t even have a villain, and just featured horribly rendered ghosts. Many of the citywide large-scale battles also contain numerous composition shots depicting green-screen plain in sight, but it is somewhat forgivable considering that director Paul Feig isn’t really experienced yet with handling special effects heavy blockbusters of this caliber. Ghostbusters also does not contain a great deal of misandry at all. If there was one fear more terrifying than the rest going into the movie, it is that it was actually going to be two hours of jokes hating on and degrading men for no real reason other than the social justice warrior craze that fuels the Internet today. The truth is that the presentation and characters here are more about female empowerment rather than sticking it to the man. Yes, men in the movie are either ridiculously stupid or holding the women back, but it feels more like coincidence than done solely to anger men. I still however do believe that an inter-gender team would have been most interesting. What does mitigate Ghostbusters from being flat-out terrible is that although structurally the narrative is a mess, and it doesn’t really feel like a Ghostbusters movie, Paul Feig has a decent handle on comedy, so if nothing else, the movie is a decent experience in the style of humor you would expect from him. There are quite a few funny moments and hilarious pieces of dialogue, but unfortunately none of it comes together to form a movie that makes this a worthy franchise reboot."

"Oct 20, 2017",positive," So, a mere 32 years after the hugely popular original and 27 years after the inevitable sequel, the third Ghostbusters film arrives and, as you may already have noticed, it’s very much a case of all change.  Out go the original male characters – a decision brought about largely by the death in 2014 of Harold Ramis, co-writer and co-star of the first two films – and in comes a new, all-female, ghost-hunting gang led by Bridesmaids stars Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig.  And very good fun, too, with director Paul Feig who, with Bridesmaids, The Heat and Spy under his belt, is the comedy film-maker of the moment.  Look out, too, for Annie Potts who played Janine, the ghostbusters’ lippy receptionist in the original films and who returns as a lippy hotel receptionist. I can happily report that Sigourney’s here, too, although you’ll wait virtually the entire film to discover that and, if you’re anything like me, come out wishing we’d seen more of her – and sooner.  Nor is Ramis forgotten. His son, Daniel, plays a small cameo and my teenage son assures me he spotted a bust to Dr Egon Spengler, the character Ramis played, in the offices of the ramshackle research institute where two of our future ghostbusters – Abby (McCarthy), a life-long believer in all things paranormal, and Jillian (Kate McKinnon), a brilliant but eccentric engineer – both work. She’s a lecturer in conventional physics at a New York university and desperate to get a tenure, so when she discovers that a book on the paranormal that she wrote – with Abby – in her impressionable youth is being promoted and sold online, she fears professional humiliation.  Very soon, all three of them are out of jobs – just as the original trio were in the first film – and looking for something new to do. Ray Parker Jr's Ghostbusters hit song nearly won an Oscar for best song at the 1984 Academy Awards, but it was beaten by Stevie Wonder's I Just Called To Say I Love You. Premises are sought (‘Oh look, a stripper’s pole,’ exclaims Abby as they consider an old fire station, another tribute to the original) and transport is obtained (this time an old hearse rather than an ambulance).  She’s a very funny woman but Feig, who co-wrote the screenplay with Katie Dippold, really should have given her something more original to work with than what she has here. This may be a film that empowers women and laughs in the face of internet bigotry – listen out as one online comment, ‘Ain’t no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts’, is shockingly quoted – but I’m not sure it does a lot to challenge racial stereotypes. Presumably, as some sort of response to the predatory sexism employed by Murray’s character in the original, our female foursome recruit a dumb, blond male Australian, gamely played by Thor star Chris Hemsworth, to be their receptionist.  ‘You’re hired!’ shouts Erin as soon as she lays eyes on his hunky gorgeousness at the beginning of a scene that starts brightly but – like one or two other moments – eventually goes on too long. Don’t get me wrong, there’s more than enough lightweight fun here to keep a summer audience entertained, and Feig, Dippold and their talented cast deliver some very funny lines.  But the basic Ghostbusters template is familiar, as is the central story of an insecure but brilliant nerd who wants to bring back New York’s dead. McCarthy – mostly playing nice rather than her customary nasty – seems to have been under instructions to dial it all down a bit, too. McCarthy’s used to being the star but here it’s McKinnon, who won’t be well-known to most British audiences, who catches the eye, with a performance as odd as Murray’s was three decades ago but nothing like as creepy.  Amazingly, it is now 14 years since the strange squirrel-like creature that we would come to know as Scrat made me cry with laughter with his futile, cataclysm-inducing attempts to bury his beloved acorn at the beginning of the first – and best – Ice Age film.  As Ice Age: Collision Course – the fifth film in the series – limped towards its halfway mark, it occurred to me that Scrat is the only thing still funny in a franchise now a good millennium or two past its sell-by date.  How Jupiter got its red spot, Saturn its rings and Mars lost its water… they’re all down to Scrat, who, having inadvertently tumbled into an alien flying saucer, zooms around the cosmos in pursuit of that acorn, causing galactic chaos as he goes. The asteroid belt is his fault too, and so is the huge meteor now heading towards Earth, threatening the strange and decidedly unscientific mix of dinosaurs and mammals that has been the creative bedrock of the Ice Age films.  Yes, Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) and the rest of the mammoth gang, together with Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the sabre-tooth tiger (Denis Leary), all face mass extinction, which is distinctly bad timing, as Manny’s beloved daughter, Peaches (Keke Palmer), is about to get married. The story jumps all over the place, the screenplay is festooned with modern American colloquialisms and, just when you think it couldn’t get any worse, up pops Simon Pegg voicing the English-accented weasel Buck and being even more annoying than his American counterparts.  Jesse J contributes an equally charmless late cameo as a youthful sloth beauty (be still, Sid’s beating heart) ensuring that the latest – and I sincerely hope – last Ice Age film goes down as a transatlantic disaster. You can see the sort of thriller that Precious Cargo wanted to be, what with its basic set-up of two thieves – one good-looking and male, the other inevitably beautiful and female – who can’t decide whether they love each other or hate each other and are basically only happy when they’re stealing.  But so many things go wrong in the execution of this not unpromising idea that the end result is as unimpressive as it is unlikeable. Television regular Mark-Paul Gosselaar (think of a cross between Ryan Reynolds and Keanu Reeves) plays Jack, who’s trying to build a new life of crime without the dangerous love of his life, Karen (Claire Forlani).  And then Karen double-crosses a dangerous Mr Big (Bruce Willis) and suddenly she’s in desperate need of Jack’s help – first simply to keep her alive and then to pull off the only heist that can get her out of this mess. "
"Oct 10, 2017",positive,"The sense of fun remains strong throughout, even as the movie falls down a bit at the end. Everyone is obviously having a ball, and it's tremendous fun watching these four women together."
"Sep 26, 2017",positive," Landing the plum assignment of rebooting Ghostbusters, the writer-director realized that he was dealing with a product that a lot of fans held dear. It was up to him to find a way to revive the franchise in a way that respected the original without slavishly remaking it. And he succeeded admirably, borrowing just enough from the 1984 film (written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis) and twisting the elements in clever ways. To prove that the line of succession was peaceable, he enlisted cameos from every major member of the original cast (sans the late Ramis and Rick Moranis, who left acting 20 years ago). Of course, anytime a movie gets remade, there ‘s going to be some griping about it from the fanboys. But the level of bile that was directed at this one was way off the meter. Earlier this week the imdb.com rating was  3.9. That’s before it was even released. Usually just the opposite is true: pre-release ratings tend to be high because the only ones casting votes are fans who can’t wait to see it. Why all the hate? You can try reading the comments on imdb and other sites if you have the time and the inclination, but while most of the aggrieved deny it, it probably comes down to this: Girl Ghostbusters. That’s right, Feig and the film’s producers had the temerity to cast the story with four female leads. Was that stunt casting? Maybe. But if so it was smart. Could you put together a male ensemble these days that would guarantee any kind of opening box office and generate enough chemistry to keep viewers coming back for sequels? Doubtful. Feig cast Kirsten Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, whom he has worked with before on Bridesmaids, Spy, and The Heat, all substantial hits. To round out the quartet, he added SNL players Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, who are arguably the best things about the movie. It’s hard to believe that so many people could get so upset by something as trivial as this. Then again, it’s hard to believe that so many people are so invested in what was a second-rate movie in the first place, one that skated along entirely on a combination of Bill Murray’s snarky persona (which by 1984 was already wearing thin) and some flashy (for the time) special effects. Second for second, the music video for Ray Parker Jr.’s title song was more entertaining than the film. Is the new Ghostbusters a masterpiece of film comedy? No, but I have no problem saying that it’s better than the original. It’s sloppy, and doesn’t do enough to work Wiig and McCarthy into their roles. But it’s genial fun throughout. It has a fair number of jokes based on rude bodily functions, true. But there are just as many that zip right past. I laughed at the very first bit of dialogue, a tour guide’s description of a 19th century Manhattan mansion that had such contemporary luxuries as “a face bidet and an anti-Irish security fence.” I love Chris Hemsworth’s explanation of why his eyeglasses have no lenses. (As what Seinfeld once called a “mimbo,” he steals most of his scenes, which is probably why most of a hilarious sequence in which he leads hundreds of zombified New Yorkers in a dance was consigned to the end credits.) And while it may pass most viewers by, hardcore Gothamphiles will get a kick out of the climactic sequence’s use of long-gone Times Square landmarks, like the RKO National Theater. Feig, who ought to be revered by fanboys as the creator of the TV show Freaks and Geeks, gets the last laugh on his detractors. In a scene where one of the ‘busters is looking up something on the internet, she is advised to ignore the comments section: “You shouldn’t read what crazy people write online in the middle of the night.” Good advice."
"Sep 26, 2017",negative," Easily angered denizens of the internet, especially those of you clinging to the 1984 Ghostbusters as though it’s the new and improved Dianetics and you’re all the second coming of L. Ron Hubbard — you’ve been had. All that huffing and puffing and moaning about how one of your classics was being ruined with the addition of girls (because everyone knows girls have cooties, like, duh, OK) and it all turned out … fine. That’s it. The new Ghostbusters from Paul Feig, starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, is perfectly fine. It is very much a Paul Feig Movie: not his best, but bearing all the signature trademarks we’ve come to expect from him. But before we get further into that, a word about Jones: Our worries about her, about the way she would be used, were overblown. Frankly, the Leslie Jones who appears in Ghostbusters isn’t all that different from the Leslie Jones who appears in Top Five, which, like Ghostbusters, is also set in New York. The most cringe-inducing aspects of Jones’ performance have already been revealed in the movie’s trailers, and when consumed in context with her co-stars, I’m inclined to shrug my shoulders. Maybe I’ve just been worn down, but at this point, my sentiments regarding Jones amount to get money, Leslie. Get money. Jones is a six-foot tall, 42-year-old dark-skinned black woman in one of the biggest films of the summer. She inspires the deepest of rep sweats, but we still need her to win. Feig is best known as the director of Bridesmaids, the 2011 film written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo, that arrived at the perfect time to send up the wedding industrial complex by illustrating what it does to friendships across class boundaries. It launched McCarthy’s career as a movie star. And although Bridesmaids was wildly successful, McCarthy initially faced the same issue Jones recently publicized on Twitter in June: No one would make a dress for her for the 2012 Oscars. McCarthy and Feig went on to team up on The Heat and Spy. Class and female friendship are the two consistent through lines in Feig’s films. McCarthy plays underdogs or working-class heroes who have been overlooked. In The Heat, she constantly gives Sandra Bullock’s character a hard time for being too soft, and McCarthy takes Bullock to visit her working-class family in South Boston. In Spy, McCarthy plays a secret agent who finally gets her chance to do field work because no one else is available. Her cover, designed by her colleagues, is that she’s a shlumpadinka American cat lady with hemorrhoid pads and stool softener in her purse. So it’s understandable that Feig, who grew up in a working-class suburb of Detroit, would want to do with Jones what he’s done with McCarthy and make her a working-class hero, too. Patty is an MTA agent who sees a ghost and wants to join McKinnon, McCarthy, and Wiig, who all play scientists. Feig could have arguably been more sensitive about how race affects our interpretations of class, but Jones, McKinnon, McCarthy and Wiig all feel like previous versions of themselves that we’ve seen either in other movies or on Saturday Night Live. Abby (McCarthy) is earnest and determined and jokes about food. Wiig uncomfortably babbles around Kevin the office sex idiot, played by Chris Hemsworth. The gun-licking Jillian, god bless her, is a glorious parade of McKinnon’s freakiest Saturday Night Live affectations. And there’s nothing unexpected from Jones, either. There is some injustice to the fact that in a movie built on girl power, Hemsworth has most of the best lines. If anything, the girl power aspect of Ghostbusters is what does it in, if only because you’re left wishing Feig had leaned into it even more. The second act is a bit wishy-washy and unfocused. It suffers from a lack of clarity around its villain, Rowan (Neil Casey), a would-be typical misogynist that the film, for reasons unknown, simply doesn’t want to identify as such. When we finally come to understand Rowan’s motivations for wanting to destroy New York by opening up a catastrophic ghost vortex, it mainly boils down to him being a crazed misanthrope. Instead of making it obvious, the movie hints at the fact that Rowan is the type who hangs out around Men’s Rights Activist forums — he envies Kevin’s body and the attention it gets. He becomes a giant, menacing, white blob clobbering the buildings of New York with his own ghostly weapon of mass destruction. “It’s always the sad pale ones,” Abby quips. Frankly, if you’re going to make a new Ghostbusters with a female foursome as the leads and you’re facing a backlash from clanging dungeons of the woman-hating internet, it seems like it would make for an epic opportunity to troll them, and yet, this is where Ghostbusters lacks its bite. There are some attempts to work the gender controversy surrounding Ghostbusters into the script. Just about everyone standing in the way of the Ghostbusters, except for Cecily Strong’s character, is a man. At one point Patty is reading comments under a video the group has posted on the internet because they’re mostly positive. Picking the first one, she ends up reading aloud, “Ain’t no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts!” From the moment it was announced, the conversation around Ghostbusters has been followed by a cloud of sexism, which was obviously unfair. It was always going to be a difficult task to separate the movie from its politics, which is why it probably would have been a better choice to simply face them head on, with zero ambiguity. Instead, where Ghostbusters — a perfectly serviceable summer comedy — falters is that it’s simply too polite. Soraya Nadia McDonald is the senior culture critic for Andscape.

"Sep 15, 2017",positive,"Like [Bill] Murray and [Dan] Ackroyd before them, Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy have rightfully earned their place as comedic icons of this generation."
"Sep 12, 2017",positive," In the build-up toward the release of the reboot of 1984’s Ghostbusters, much has been made about the decision to go with an all-female cast. That buzz reached fever pitch once Paul Feig became the director. Known for his breakaway hit Bridesmaids, which deftly showcased the comedic charms and dramatic potential of Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne and the Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy, he seemed to be the perfect choice. And his continued collaborations with McCarthy (The Heat and Spy) have been among her better projects during her post-Bridesmaids stretch run.  But in the pre-release phase, the reboot ran into a branding/marketing dilemma that haunts all such projects — nostalgia for the original. How could anyone ever dare to replace the sheer lunatic genius of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson?  So, let’s get to the nitty gritty. Does Feig’s Ghostbusters put all the naysayers in their place by addressing the notion that women can, in fact, be funny? As with most critical discussions, complexity prevents me from delivering a definitive answer. Feig penned the screenplay with Katie Dippold, who scripted The Heat, and it is plain to see that they adored everything about the original because they have crafted a devoted homage to it. That is not to say that they have presented audiences with the kind of shot-for-shot recreation Gus Van Sant did with his “version” of Psycho, but like most reboots of the day, this Ghostbusters could be labeled a thoroughly modern update. And as such, it would have been far more intriguing if Feig and Dippold had directly addressed the topicality of their ghostbusters facing a world where they are being dismissed not simply for their research into the paranormal realm but also because they are women. A gag or two that hint at casual sexism drift into the mix, but they are Casper-like sightings, lost in the behemoth of the broader jokes and torrential downpour of special effects raining all over the screen in the finale.  Where the film succeeds, though, is with its talented cast. Wiig and McCarthy — as Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates, the primary dynamic duo of paranormal science — solidly anchor the narrative. Feig provides a degree of comfort for them to settle into an ongoing banter that, while sometimes hilarious, also allows for characters to show some heart. Their work here doesn’t break new ground for either performer, but it offers recognizable humanity that, at least for me, was missing in the breezy comic interplay of the original. The real star is McKinnon as engineering genius Jillian Holtzmann, the tech specialist who develops all of the gear used by the team. From the first moment she appears onscreen, McKinnon becomes the definitive scene-stealer, inhabiting both the character and each frame of film she’s in as if the movie was always supposed to be hers. She portrays a pansexual imp, the Mxyzptlk (to reference a Superman character) in this world of ghost-fighting superwomen. Truth be told, McKinnon is this universe’s hybrid of Marvel Comics’ Tony Stark (the quip-happy tech savant of Iron Man) and Star-Lord (the roguishly sexy member of Guardians of the Galaxy), and Marvel would be wise to take note of her."

"Aug 28, 2017",positive," Decades from now, sociologists will study the Ghostbusters Wars. They'll try to reconstruct the events that led to internet campaigns, downvote brigades, Twitter abuse, and the publication of thousands of articles both condemning and defending a fluffy and funny movie months before anyone had even seen it. They might wonder if this crisis was sparked by a specific moment in American history. Was it the surreal and overlong primary season that precipitated this depth of feeling? Or the feeble economy? Or the grim progression of mass shootings? The demonization of sugar? But the Ghostbusters Wars actually can't be about any of these things, not just because we're a frivolous people, but because movies — unlike television — are glacially slow responders to the pressures of the present. Case in point: The Tom Hanks vehicle Sully is coming out a full seven years after Chesley Sullenberger landed U.S. Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River. Movies lumber. They're accidental time capsules for the half-decade we left behind; that's their power, but also their problem. Here's what really happened: The Ghostbusters remake, released Friday after months of controversy, got caught at the unpleasant intersection of two ley lines in the culture wars. One is the giant backlash against the feminist pressure that made the movie possible in the first place. It's a backlash that shares a lot of DNA with the Gamergate movement, but there's more to it. While gamers vs. feminists might constitute the immediate backdrop to the Ghostbusters Wars, the movie is fighting a bigger demon: the angst of a generation obsessed with its own nostalgic ghosts. Remakes themselves are ghostbusters. They make consumers of the product they're supplanting anxious. If you're old enough to have experienced the original, what any remake communicates is that your pleasure — your sense of fun — is literally incomprehensible to a new generation. It needs to be translated. Worse, it needs to be updated, tuned to the present clime. Remakes don't just measure our age, then; they measure the distance the culture has drifted from a phenomenon with which we once connected. If someone copies a film we value and ""improves it"" by introducing differences we interpret as morally corrective, we bristle. This is especially true among the demographic whose nostalgia has been most frenetically catered to. This demographic doesn't respond well to feeling old and left behind and preached at. The whole thing leaves a sour taste. Such a demographic might get defensive and describe an enjoyable but extremely silly (and pretty incoherent) movie from the '80s that they liked when they were kids using overblown terms like ""classic"" or ""game-changer."" Indeed, critics of the new Ghostbusters movie had a hard time talking about a film they hadn't seen without talking about how the original defined their childhoods. What's good for the goose is good for the gander, so here's what it meant to me: not much. As a girl-kid in the '80s, I loved Slimer and the proton packs and the logo and the Staypuft Marshmallow Man. That was it. The Ghostbusters were boring (except Winston — I liked Winston). I remember vaguely envying the messy dirty fun the fellas got to have, but I didn't find them that funny. Maybe their humor didn't feel available to me? In any event, it seemed clear that our fun-streams could never cross. But I've also discovered my memory of the original had some gaps: While preparing to write about this remake, I mentioned to my partner that one thing I liked about the original Ghostbusters was how little it mattered that the four principals were guys. ""Gender isn't important to the plot!"" I said. Swapping to women would be simple. He stared at me and suggested I rewatch the original. I did, and wow: It is a much more symbolically dudely text than I recalled. Bill Murray creeps on college co-eds, asks the librarian if she's menstruating, and his best insult to the EPA guy is that he has no penis. Plus, those nozzles on the proton packs are certainly suggestive, and some of the ghosts are downright pornographic. Still, it's a fun film! Rewatching it in these acrimonious times, I appreciated how secondary Ghostbusters' sexism felt to its playfulness. Shooting ghosts by peeing on them together! YEAH! The Ghostbusters didn't hate women at all; they just didn't have much use for them unless it was for flirting (or weapon-testing). Their jouissance was untainted by the fury that animates Gamergate-types for whom this version of masculine innocence is no longer available. There's a beauty to that, to guys from the '80s, untroubled by feminist complaints, who get to play-hunt and make jokes and pee at ghosts together. It helped that the ghosts barely registered as a threat; up until the very end, the Ghostbusters were getting the glory of firefighters for being the spectral equivalent of dog-catchers. You could be goofy and stupid and funny and hailed as a hero. Awesome. No 2016 remake could reproduce all of these conditions. Especially not with women. The level of security you need to feel to be your loopiest, most playful self isn't often afforded to women in film or TV (shows like Gilmore Girls and Murder, She Wrote are notable and interesting exceptions). Nor, frankly, is the absence of anger. Given the hurricane of abuse critics hurled at everyone involved in the all-women Ghostbusters following its announcement, it was hard to imagine a version of the film that wouldn't be at least a little angry. So I'll admit it: I was worried. I feared the remake wouldn't be able to capture that magic mix of ebullience and deadpan ease that made the original so fun. It had to overcome a lot of stuff the original wasn't burdened with. But it did. The new Ghostbusters is absolutely faithful to the original's drunk sense of joyful play, thanks mostly to Kate McKinnon's dementedly brilliant Holtzman and Leslie Jones' charisma as Patty. There aren't as many body jokes, but there are some. The movie also manages to sustain this humor while addressing some ways in which the world might work differently for female Ghostbusters: The foursome is never embraced by the city the way their male ancestors were (instead they're repeatedly humiliated and discredited by the mayor, who takes public credit for their work). The film nods early and often to its trolls with references to YouTube and Reddit. It's an amazingly apt adaptation that I think improves on its source-text. From the aesthetics (whoever designed the ghosts worked extremely hard to match the '80s-era phantasms using modern technology) to an absolutely brilliant appropriation of the GB logo, the movie rollicks around the original's stomping grounds, but it never stomps. It's a loving tribute. As far as anger goes, in Melissa McCarthy's hands, even the film's more pointed jabs are made with a matter-of-fact ease. It will be interesting to see how the Ghostbusters Wars develop — whether the people who so deeply resented the concept will keep raging after seeing the thing itself. They may! The new Ghostbusters is hilarious, but its humor may not be to everyone's taste. Lili Loofbourow is the culture critic at TheWeek.com.

"Aug 16, 2017",negative," Nick Cave has been singing about mortality for decades, and he's really good at it. Whether the narratives are biblical or pulpy, the victims innocents or death row convicts, the circumstances comprehensible or cruelly random, Cave's songs are on intimate terms with the infinite ways a life can be extinguished. And yet, ""Skeleton Tree"", his latest album with his estimable band, the Bad Seeds, is a relatively concise song cycle shadowed by death that feels different than all the rest. Read the full review. On ""22, A Million,"" Justin Vernon reimagines his music from the bottom up by letting technology — synthesizers, treated vocals, electronic sound effects — dictate. The songs retain their melancholy cast, but now must fight for air beneath static and noise. Read the full review. ""Lemonade"" is more than just a play for pop supremacy. It's the work of an artist who is trying to get to know herself better, for better or worse, and letting the listeners/viewers in on the sometimes brutal self-interrogation. Read the full review. Now ""Schmilco"" (dBpm Records) arrives, a product of the same recording sessions that produced ""Star Wars"" but a much different album. Though it's ostensibly quieter and less jarring than its predecessor, it presents its own radical take on the song-based, folk and country-tinged side of the band. Read the full review. ""Blonde"" is a critique of materialism with Frank Ocean employing two distinct voices, like characters in a play, a recurring theme throughout the album and perhaps its finest sonic achievement. A party spirals out of control, the music rich but low key, a melange of organ and hovering synthesizers. Ocean uses distorting devices on his voice to add emotional texture and to enhance and sharpen the characters he briefly embodies. The upshot: They're all little slices of Ocean's personality with a role to play and they each sound distinct. Read the full review. Warpaint's unerring feel for gauzy hooks and slinky arrangements germinated over a decade and flourished on the quartet's excellent 2014 self-titled album.

Read the review. The “Ghostbusters” reboot is the most divisive mainstream comedy in years, for pretty stupid reasons. Half the boy-men in America, whether or not they grew up wishing they co-starred in the 1984 original, wrote it off in 2014, minutes after director Paul Feig tweeted the news of a female-driven cast comprised, ultimately, of Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. The other half of these proud paranoiacs, whose religious tenets dictate that no women should be allowed near a reboot, wrote it off, more viciously, the second the movie’s first trailer appeared online. It wasn’t much of a trailer, as many men and women have conceded. Too much noise, not enough funny. Now we have the movie itself, which remains an apocalyptic threat to an untold number of easily shattered adolescent male childhoods, all grown up yet eternally young (and stupid) in spirit. Over the weekend, “Ghostbusters” made a respectable-but-not-great $46 million. It could still break even, depending on what sort of dent it makes overseas. But it cost a lot, nearly $150 million after rebates and incentives applied to the production budget, and that’s not counting the marketing and advertising. That money is one of its problems. Even those who enjoy “Ghostbusters,” and there are plenty of women and plenty of men, don’t find much to like about the final third, when the visual effects — expensive in execution, sub-“Scooby-Doo” in conception — sit on the thing the way the zombie ghost of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man parks it on the heroines, in one of the better sight gags of the picture. Honestly, any full-on pans of the new “Ghostbusters” are wasting their vitriol. Enough of the throwaway, hit-and-run jokes, both visual and verbal, connect to prevent the movie from stalling completely. I also don’t get the higher-end praise. Sticking too closely to the ramshackle original, which I’ll leave others to call a classic, the reboot carries a dutiful quality. This is where the money gets in the way; a cheaper movie with the same cast, and the same director, had a better chance of developing something truly new, or new/old. Everything good the new “Ghostbusters” has to do with gender, beginning and ending with McKinnon. And everything bad about it has nothing to do with gender: its size, its overreliance on visual effects un-spiced by wit. As Jillian Holtzmann, the impishly lascivious ghostbuster with the yellow-tinted goggles and a come-on for every woman (and a man or two) within quick-witted earshot, McKinnon kills. Some of it’s overkill; her reaction shots and takes are bigger than Kabuki, sometimes, and often you watch her because she’s simply doing so much more than her co-stars. But there’s real invention in her free-floating characterization. She’s the special effect in “Ghostbusters.” Over the weekend, the gender lines were drawn, in the sand. Males and over-25-year-olds gave the film an uninspiring B exit score in the CinemaScore polling, where Bs are more like Cs and often spell financial trouble. But on a typical Facebook feed there were merry accounts of moms taking their daughters, and sons, to the movie as an act of solidarity. McKinnon operates in the new “Ghostbusters” the way Bill Murray operated in the old one. She’s cooking up little side dishes of commentary where, and when, she can. Without McKinnon, or Murray, the “Ghostbusters” movies wouldn’t be much. The fact that the ’84 version became a phenom is as strange, really, as the 2016 version becoming a war between idiot men and all kinds of women."

Thanks for reading The Tyee today — we hope this article added to your day in some way. Our team of independent journalists takes pride in doing in-depth reporting and taking time to get it right.
 
We're able to focus our attention on publishing impactful journalism in the public interest, and publish it for free for all to read, because we have the support of Tyee Builders. Tyee Builders are readers who contribute a bit of money — at a level and frequency of their choice — to support our editorial budget.
 
This core of supporters — making up about 1 to 2 per cent of our daily readership — enables us to pay our writers, keep our articles free and open to all, and not bombard our readers with annoying ads while you try to read.
 
Instead of focusing on what kind of articles will attract the most advertising dollars, we can spend time devoted to researching and writing stories that our readers find most valuable and make the most positive impact in our region.
 
You made it all the way through the article – I hope that means you liked it (or if not ‘liked’ it, gleaned some useful information from it). Tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy, so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work.
 
Listen, I’ll get to the point – the article you just read was made possible because our non-profit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it. And we can only afford to do that because of our business model, which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called Tyee Builders.
 
The traditional business model for journalism in Canada has been completely disrupted, and we’re witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications, lay people off, and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy. And it doesn’t help that tech giant Meta has blocked Canadian news on their Facebook and Instagram platforms.
 
Between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit The Tyee contribute financially, but amazingly, that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget. And it means we can operate without a paywall, too. 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality, fact-based journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in B.C., Alberta, and across Canada. We think that’s pretty remarkable.
 The good news is that the remake of Ghostbusters isn’t terrible. Its heart is in the right place, and it’s winning enough that one can be occasionally bemused, if not genuinely amused. Although I could count the number of real laughs on the fingers of one hand, it was better than I expected it to be, which is not to say that it’s actually any good. The new estrogen-laced version of Ghostbusters is pretty much the same as the original (the testosterone version, let’s call it). It’s vaguely entertaining, with a few good lines and some comedic interplay from four funny people. Put another way, the first film had “outies” and the new film has “innies,” but other than that there isn’t too much difference. If that’s enough for people, that’s fine, but for all the Sturm und Drang that precipitated the film I was hoping for something slightly more interesting. But before we get to the business of understanding why the film is vaguely disappointing, let’s deal with the story itself. Kristen Wiig plays Erin Gilbert, an uptight academic on track for tenure at Princeton. Awkward and stiff, Erin is the kind of woman who wears the world’s smallest bowtie and often seems caught and strangled in her horrible tweedy suit. But there is more to Erin than a boring haircut and a beige-brown straightjacket with a peplum skirt. When her past comes back to haunt her in the form of a book on the supernatural, penned with a former friend and colleague named Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), the wheels creak into motion. Unlike Erin who has tried to go straight, Abby is still plugging away on their once-shared passion for ghosts. In a somewhat dodgy academic institution, Abby and a fellow scientist named Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon) are bent on finding ways to prove the existence of another (spookier) realm. Erin wants Abby to bury the book, as it threatens her chance to go legit, but Abby is not interested. Things like failed friendships, betrayed loyalty and complex emotions are sketched out. But before you can say, “Ugh, squishy lady feelings,” the women get the call that there has been a Scooby-Doo type visitation at an old museum. It only takes one encounter with a miasmic entity and Erin is sucked back into the life, covered with green goo and screaming, “Ghosts are real!” into a camera lens. After the video of her ectoplasmic session is splashed all over the Internet, the trio is drummed out of the hallowed hoary halls of academia. Since no one has a real job any longer, they decide to start a business dubbed the Department of Metaphysical Examination atop a Chinese restaurant, as one does. A transit worker named Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) who has endured her own mysterious encounter in the New York subway system is their first client. Because she comes with encyclopedic knowledge of old New York and a handy-dandy hearse, Patty is made a full member of the team. Add in a man-candy receptionist named Kevin (the toothsome Chris Hemsworth) and a nasty men’s rights advocate named Rowan North (Neil Casey), and we’re all set! Rowan’s evil plan is to unleash a vortex of hell, free the undead, and set them loose in NYC to tip over postal boxes, refuse to pay subway fare and generally cause a ruckus. Bring on the ghosts with the most. And that is precisely what happens, with few big surprises. McCarthy and Wiig pretty much reprise the roles of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. Like the original film, a person of colour is added to provide some street cred. At least Leslie Jones, unlike Ernie Hudson before her, gets to be a fully functioning member of the team. But the comedic timing of the four leads, in particular McCarthy and Wiig, clumps along when it ought to jazz riff. The filmmaking itself is also weirdly off-rhythm. Some scenes end so abruptly, it’s like they were chopped off with a knife. Others linger so long that I was tempted to have a quick kip. One must also endure the requisite corny cameos, which are almost universally unfunny. They are trotted out like a medley of golden oldies, an Aykroyd here, a Murray there. A few jokes land, but most just kind of float along. Strangely enough, the film almost succeeds by trying too hard, being super chipper and good-spirited. Now, ain’t that just like a woman? Except that director Paul Feig is still sporting a penis, apparently. My hopes for Mr. Feig have dwindled with each subsequent film that he has made. Bridesmaids was plenty of fun, but The Heat, Spy (horrific) and now Ghostbusters have been mostly a series of diminishing returns. Is there any more to be said than that? Not really. It is curious to read some of the early reviews of the film. You can almost see critics shrugging as they write their pieces. There was a minor kerfuffle over early scores on IMDB from dudes giving the film low marks before it had even been released. In contrast, women have organized screening parties to fight back and give the film a strong opening weekend. Overall, the critical consensus has been quite gentle. Even the strongest critiques have little more to say than the film is repackaged nostalgia with a feminist twist, so marketed and pre-tested that no one could really get their panties in a twist. Who cares, really, other than a few trolls who live with their mothers under a bridge? The film gives the trolling types some comeuppance with a few pointed jokes. Each of the actresses is allowed to strut their stuff, although it must be said that Kate McKinnon tucks the film in her back pocket and easily strolls away with it. As Holtzmann, a goggle-wearing, vaguely androgynous science nerd with more than a dash of gunslinger, McKinnon seems like she is operating on a different plane from the other women. She channels unusual comedic rhythms and plays with the beat of jokes so that they never land quite where you would expect. She also owns the only genuinely exciting scene in the entire film. During the final climactic showdown, Holtzmann deploys a battery of whizzy new gizmos and coolio weapons she has designed against an army of the undead. She also gets the best lines, to wit: “Safety lights are for dudes.” Certainly it is nice to see women be heroes. I just wish the film had a few more of these more innovative moments. The entrance of something original instead of regurgitated provides a glimmer of hope, but it doesn’t last long. The film lapses back into a lukewarm pudding of warmed-up jokes and tired plot tropes, and one goes back to sleep, both metaphorically and figuratively speaking. This something that I have come to think of as the Star Wars feeling, that sense of watching two films simultaneously, the remembered version and the newest iteration. Together they create some strange form of cognitive dissonance, where everything that was once new is seen again, through the lens of nostalgia, which softens and warps. But if I had to pick one thing about the film that is most depressing, it is that it plays it so safe. It is careful not to be too offensive, or too feminist, or too much of anything really. It’s a nice girl movie, and somehow that makes it weirdly defeatist, in that girl power/spice lady way of taking something that was once radical, terrifying and revolutionary, and pulling its fangs out so that it can only gum you. Is that too much like a woman to complain, when you get the thing you supposedly want? Like so much of contemporary culture, the drama that surrounds a thing often obscures and inflates what is essentially something simple, and often kind of dumb. Think Chewbacca Mom, or whatever current Internet meme has snagged the collective attention of the populace. We bat at the new shiny thing for a while and then we get bored and move on. Yes, there were some squeaks and squawks about people, well, men, having their childhoods destroyed by an all-female Ghostbusters crew. But as a wise woman once said, “People forget that the original film was just another stupid ‘80s Bill Murray comedy.” Leave it to one of the dudes exiting the theatre where I saw the film to sum it up.

"Aug 14, 2017",positive," At the beginning of the 1989 film Ghostbusters 2, we find our heroes — as you do in the first act of a sequel — disgraced. In just five short years, the droll scientist Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) has somehow gone from saving his entire city from a King Kong–sized anthropomorphic marshmallow to hosting a low-rent public access TV show called World of the Psychic. The subject of that evening’s episode: the Apocalypse. One of the guests is a mousy woman named Elaine, who claims to have gleaned some valuable information regarding this topic from an alien she met at the bar of the Paramus Holiday Inn. “According to my source,” she tells Venkman, “the end of the world will be on Feb. 14 in the year 2016.” Ask some YouTube commenters and they’ll tell you she was only off by a month. On March 3 of that infernal year (you know, this one) the first trailer for the Ghostbusters reboot was released. Perhaps you’ve heard something about the film’s controversial casting: All the main characters are played by convicted mass murderers. Haha no, I’m kidding — they’re just women. But — thanks in large part to an organized group of haters with a particularly phallic axe to grind — the clip quickly became the most “disliked” trailer in the history of YouTube (nearly a million thumbs down and counting). Plenty thought the reaction had to do with misogyny. Others said the trailer just wasn’t that funny. Ivan Reitman, the director of the first two Ghostbusters movies and an executive producer on the reboot, said the backlash had more to do with nostalgia than sexism. “I think there’s way too much talk about gender,” he told Mashable last month. “I think that many of the people who were complaining were actually lovers of the original movie, not haters of women.” Still, Ghostbusters (which, for purely copy-editing purposes, I really wish had been given a silly Fast and Furious–style title like 3Ghost 3Bust3rs) cannot resist poking some meta-fun at these trolls. About 20 minutes into the film, when a video of the Ghostbusters goes viral, straight-laced Columbia professor Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) makes the mistake of reading the comments: “ain’t no bitches be busting ghosts.” Her childhood friend and fellow paranormal expert, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), tells her not to pay attention to all the chatter — after all, they have a job to do. There are a few more in-jokes like this if you make a point to listen for them, but they do not overwhelm the movie. Wokebusters this is not — and that is often a good thing. Toward the end, the film’s resident himbo (an actually very funny Chris Hemsworth) makes a joke along the lines of, “Women, they’re never on time, amirite?!” It was only then that I realized how completely devoid of this kind of lazy, gender-stereotyped humor the film had been to that point. And anyway, when he delivers that line his body has been seized by a demonic spirit, so we are to forgive him for momentarily going a little Dane Cook on our asses. For those of us who were actually excited at the thought of a group of talented women portraying the ragtag heroes of their childhood, Ghostbusters has the potential to be nothing short of #Squad porn. Still, in practice, the group chemistry sometimes fails to spark. They often seem to be acting in different movies — the most entertaining of which almost always belonging to Kate McKinnon. Thanks to their respective reigns as SNL’s resident female genius, you’ve heard a lot about Kate McKinnon being “the new Kristen Wiig,” but getting to see these two side by side puts their relative personalities into relief. Wiig’s talent is in minutiae and awkward pauses; McKinnon’s is boisterous and, I think, much more suited to a big, loud movie like this. Melissa McCarthy is, in a welcome turn for her, the (relatively) straight man (save for a hilarious recurring bit involving wontons.) But McKinnon is the breakout star of the film, proving that she’s less like Wiig than she is like Lucille Ball on psilocybin mushrooms. It says a lot that her first important line of the film is a queef joke, and somehow things only get more bizarre from there. With her zany grin, windswept pompadour, and fuck-your-manspreading body language, she’s so thoroughly confident in her own anarchic weird that it becomes a force of magnetism. Leslie Jones is quite funny too, leaving behind a feature-length string of quotable non sequiturs (a basement “smells like burnt baloney and regrets”). But her character doesn’t do much to help the subtle race problem the franchise has always had — the Original Three Ghostbusters are always the white people, and in the reboot, they’re the scientists. Jones plays an MTA worker named Patty, and though her knowledge of New York City does become a valuable asset to the team, her role feels the least developed of the (uniformly pretty underdeveloped) characters. Patty abandons her job to start hanging out with the Ghostbusters, with no consequence, explanation, or exploration of her life outside the group. The other three characters seem implicitly bonded by their paranormal expertise, while Patty seems to spend much of the film talking to herself. Would it really have been that hard to cast Leslie Jones as a scientist, or Kate McKinnon as an MTA worker? Solving one casting problem doesn’t necessarily solve them all. The decision to make an all-female Ghostbusters seems very of the moment. We are living through a time when our ideas about gender are on shifting sands — when we must get used to powerful women existing and taking up space, or be left behind. A woman is likely to be our next president. Three very Ghostbuster-like women currently hold it down on the Supreme Court. Beyoncé exists. The flip side of this is that “female empowerment” is becoming its own kind of boutique commodity — a product to be bought, sold, and tweeted about, rather than a quiet, ongoing way of life. Every time a woman does something even sort of cool, we are pressured to respond with a “YAS QUEEN!!!!” resounding enough to shake the heavens. How can we possibly be anything less than SO SO SO PSYCHED about the “female” Ghostbusters movie and still call ourselves feminists? This way of thinking, Andi Zeisler says in her recent book We Were Feminists Once, “suggest[s] that feminism is not a set of values, ethics, and politics, but merely an assessment of whether or not a product is worthy of consumption.” And yet, this is a summer blockbuster, not a candidate for public office — and so I say yes, sure, see it. Consume this product. Because in the end, what I like best about this film is that it transcends this conversation; it actually feels a little ahead of its time. It resists the modern urge to be grandstandingly #woke, to constantly and relentlessly remind you of its feminist bona fides. Save for the aforementioned (and, don’t get me wrong, great) queef joke, it doesn’t try to pander to a female audience. I’d have preferred to see these four women in a slightly looser, less plot-tethered movie — where they were free to riff a bit more, deepen their roles beyond stereotypes, and not have to spend the last 25 minutes justifying the price of the 3-D IMAX Experience — but what can you do. Ghostbusters is somehow both smarter and dumber than the maelstrom surrounding it: It’s just a silly, expensive, and utterly fantastical movie about three scientists and one MTA worker who bust ghosts. The most progressive thing about it is that the movie does not constantly remind you that they’re all women. Somewhere right now, a small child is watching it, not even noticing that they’re all women. A true story, told almost annually around my family’s Thanksgiving table: The morning my sister was born, I threw a tantrum because I wanted a brother. I was 3 years old. I told my grandparents that I would get out of bed that day under only one condition: if I could wear my Ghostbusters costume to the hospital. No, I didn’t feel the need to dress up as cellist-turned-art-restorer Sigourney Weaver just because she was the “lady” in the movie. I didn’t ask my mom to turn my jumpsuit into a dress or make it pink (yes, my mom made this costume from scratch; shout-out to my mom). I just thought Ghostbusters were cool, and come Halloween I wanted to be one. It was as simple as that. And yet: I still welcomed my sister into this world with tears because she was not a boy. I cringe at this now, but I think I just wanted someone to play Ghostbusters with me. Somewhere along the line, I’d picked up the notion that a brother was more likely to want to play Ghostbusters with you than a sister was. All of which is to say: This shit really matters, until it doesn’t. What will gender equality finally look like at the movies? Is it simply a matter of plunking women into existing, previously male-helmed franchises? Or does it have to do with treating women’s stories as just as important and potentially universal as men’s — acknowledging that The Revenant is not inherently better or deeper than, say, The Devil Wears Prada? (One woman’s opinion: It is neither.) Ghostbusters’ arrival into our multiplexes and (God help us) our social media feeds has prompted much bigger questions than one movie could ever hope to answer. But it also represents the subtlest lifting of the burden placed on the movies that will come after it, a small step toward that moment when a female-driven blockbuster can be seen as something less than a referendum on the entire state of a gender. That’ll be the day. Or maybe it’ll just be the true date of the Apocalypse. Rachel and Callie discuss the Bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes. Then, Jodi hops on to talk ‘The Valley’ and ‘Vanderpump Rules.’"
"Aug 3, 2017",positive," Watching the “Ghostbusters” reboot was like going to McDonald’s. It is disposable, thoroughly enjoyable and distinctly American mass-produced entertainment. I savor the flavor of a Big Mac with the same casual attitude that I and the others attending my screening chuckled throughout this movie. This makes it all the more remarkable that it has been inextricably linked with controversy over gender politics and nostalgia culture that, really, demonstrate one thing: We have become a society of consumers, defined by the political as well as cultural brands we buy and buy into. When you dissect the controversy related to the “Ghostbusters” reboot, it predominantly stemmed from two sources. One was undeniably misogynistic, a knee-jerk reaction against seeing such a major franchise associated with women, thanks to gender conservatives being used to seeing only 15 percent of movies star female protagonists. The other was the one focused on by James Rolfe (i.e., Angry Video Game Nerd), who mainly complains that he wanted a movie that continued the initial franchise and hinted that it was disrespectful to reboot the property with a title that could confuse it with the original film. These two sentiments, combined with a trailer so maligned that it quickly became the most unpopular in YouTube history, created a perfect storm of attention surrounding this movie. You could be drawn into the nostalgia for a beloved blockbuster franchise (as well as those inclined to dislike them), or you could take symbolic stands on the intersection of gender politics with popular culture … left or right-wing. As far as the politics are concerned, it means we should be relieved this movie isn’t terrible, as the outright misogynists said it would be. It has a 75 percent rating on critical aggregate RottenTomatoes and a 60 rating on Metacritic and, though not likely to supplant ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" is still poised to garner respectable box office results this weekend. Then again, what does it say that we would consider it a setback — or at least highly unfortunate — if the movie was considered to be an embarrassment? What if it actually had been terrible … Could we be honest with our own tastes without being labelled as sexists? The resulting movie was, based on my viewing, a product perfectly calibrated to avoid that outcome. It aims to be a good family film for the summer movie season, and it fits right in with the buttery popcorn I ate while watching it. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth were easily the best thing about the film, and any promise the franchise has in the future will rest on capitalizing on their chemistry and allowing them to improvise. As such, in terms of delivering a quality “Ghostbusters” product, it’s hard to really complain about this film on its merits. Hence it addresses the gender politics angle of its inception through juxtaposition gags (the leered-at target of sexual objectification is a man played by Chris Hemsworth) and some swipes about negative message board comments and virginal misanthropic nerds. It also, admirably, creates a story in which the female protagonists’ gender matters not much at all to how the plot unfolds. All of this is commendable, although in my opinion done better in other female-led franchises (“Aliens,” “The Hunger Games,” “Frozen”).  Similarly, James “Angry Video Game Nerd” Rolfe has no reason to be upset at the idea of needing to ask whether the term “Ghostbusters” hereafter refers to this movie or the 1984 one. It pays due homage to the original … because of course it would. Those references to Slimer, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the logo, the theme song and other aspects of the “Ghostbusters” brand are necessary to draw in the nostalgia audience. That’s how you connect a reboot to an existing franchise. It’s what one of the most successful rebooted franchises, Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, did in its own melodramatic and cerebral way — although as reboots go, “Ghostbusters” struck me as qualitatively closer to the most recent “Star Trek” efforts.  If the bottom line is that Sony can get your money by making you want to see a new film associated with the “Ghostbusters” brand, so be it. If they get you because you enjoy the style of comedy provided by Paul Feig, Melissa McCarthy, et al, so be it. If a bunch of misogynists overreact to the film and they can sell tickets through a desire to express solidarity with the case of gender representation in cinema, all the better. The real story here is that “Ghostbusters” demonstrates just how effectively we have been segmented, culturally and politically, through the brands with which we identify. As a result we have so commodified culture and politics that purely consumerist decisions feel more meaningful than they really are. For what it’s worth, at the screening I attended, young people seemed to get more out of it than the older ones, but most of the thirty or so people there chuckled consistently laughed at the jokes, myself included. The movie is a solid B. And yet it has and will no doubt continue to elicit fulsome praise and bigoted denunciations alike, regardless of its quality, because that is how our culture has trained us to react to the various cultural and political nerves that this film triggers.

"Jun 26, 2017",negative," From the moment it was announced, everyone on the internet voiced an opinion of the all-female Ghostbusters remake. Legions of fanboys complained the film would ruin their adoration of the 1984 original. Others leapt to its defense, excited that a strong team of women performers would get a chance to school the naysayers. But while it’s wonderful to see women as the heroes of an action movie — playing roles they aren’t typically offered — that’s not the only thing required to make Ghostbusters a success. It also has to be good. Unfortunately, the film squanders the talents of its cast on a poor script that’s bogged down with poor jokes, underdeveloped characters, and a juvenile approach to feminism that doesn’t advance the conversation. In the new Ghostbusters, uptight scientist Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) has difficulties advancing professionally because of a book on ghosts she co-wrote with one-time friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). After Erin is approached by a historical site caretaker for help de-haunting a mansion, Erin, Abby and Abby’s assistant Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) start up a ghost-busting business, where they’re joined by transit employee Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) and pretty-boy secretary Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). The group’s business drastically increases thanks to a nutcase loner intent on causing an apocalypse (Neil Casey, acting as a clear stand-in for internet trolls). One of the original film’s strengths was its distinct, fully-formed personalities of its characters, as was getting to watch those personalities bounce off each other. And that was what made the idea of an all-female remake so intriguing, particularly since McCarthy, Wiig, Jones and McKinnon are all superb comedians. Unfortunately, the characters of the remake are underwritten, and their personalities are more like individual collections of quirks. Wiig is uptight for reasons we never fully understand. The underutilized McKinnon is simply weird for the sake of being weird, sometimes literally dancing around in the back of the frame in search of something to do. Jones’ Patty Tolan is more down-to-earth, but still behaves in ways that don’t quite make sense. Ghostbusters ’ approach to feminism is likewise disappointing, in part because of the poorly-mined relationships between its leads, but also because writer-director Paul Feig and co-writer Katie Dippold mistake stereotype-flipping for empowerment. Chris Hemsworth’s Kevin, for example, has no redeeming qualities except his good looks, sending up both the actor’s strong-man image and the dumb blonde eye-candy trope. This is a clever idea in theory, but it’s still objectification, and unnecessary at that. While flipping the script might seem like a clever way to call attention to this particular brand of sexism, it doesn’t encourage constructive discussion, only conflict. It’s also definitely not the compassionate approach we’re supposed to consider as viewers of faith. All this might sound like harsh criticism for a film that’s meant to be light and fun. But a movie that’s trying to improve the overwhelming white-straight-maleness of films (particularly one this high-profile) requires some extra thoughtfulness in its making. Shutting down misogynists and trolls just by teasing them isn’t going to get the job done. Ghostbusters has to prove its worth by being objectively better than the haters, both in terms of quality and attitude. Unfortunately, it doesn’t get there on either score.

"Jun 20, 2017",positive," Why indeed?  After all, these ghostbusters are – gasp – female, a notion so catastrophic that a zillion trillion Blog Boys have had something akin to a collective meltdown. That Heiss is played by Bill Murray, one of the original ghostbusters back in 1984 (and, again in the so-so sequel), only adds to the “take that, misogynist idiots” joke. Simply by appearing in the new “Ghostbusters,” Murray is giving his tacit blessing to the new version, as do his former co-stars, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson (Harold Ramis, alas, is deceased, but the new movie is dedicated to him, a nice touch). Paul Feig’s reboot doesn’t re-invent the wheel. But it is plenty funny and it goes down easy. And compared to the rest of this summer’s so-called silly stuff (“Neighbors 2” anyone?), it’s an oasis of amusement. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) play former best friends who once wrote a book together about the paranormal. However, Erin has since gone “straight” and is currently trying for tenure at Columbia University. They are brought back together when spooky things start happening all over Manhattan. First, there’s a vengeful apparition in an old mansion. Then something ickily ectoplasmic confronts city employee Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) in a subway tunnel.  “He’s gonna be the third scariest thing on that train” she observes when the thing hops on a car bound for Queens. Rounding out the quartet is Abby’s partner, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), a crackpot inventor who’s always coming up with new ways to zap the supernatural to smithereens. That her thingamabobs don’t always work as planned goes without saying, but her enthusiasm and commitment are hilarious. Andy Garcia is fine as the falsely jovial mayor who just wishes these women would go away and take their spooks with them. Cecily Strong is also good as his ever-loyal assistant who condescendingly dismisses the ghostbusters as “these incredibly sad and lonely women … it’s like they read ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ and ran with it.” The most surprising performance comes from Chris Hemsworth. The erstwhile Thor is gut-bustingly funny as the himbo the women hire as their secretary. It’s as if he studied Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent and, well, ran with it. It may be the best work he’s ever done. Still, the movie rests in the hands of its four stars and they work like crazy to bring it all together. Wiig reaffirms her funny/cute persona; Hollywood needs to build more movies around her. Or at least hand her a sitcom as it did for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Newbies McKinnon and Jones acquit themselves well. Jones gets most of the good lines and, as she so often does on “SNL,” she makes each one a slam-dunk. ”I thought this was going to be like a book club,” she says when she first joins the others. As for McKinnon, well, there’s no telling what she’ll do next – in this movie or her next one. Wire-haired and wild-eyed, she’s like Aykroyd’s techno-nerd as played by Harpo Marx. The only one who suffers just a tiny bit is McCarthy and I chalk that up to her generosity as a performer. She’s already proved she can carry a movie (“Spy”) and that she can steal one (“Bridesmaids”). “Ghostbusters” doesn’t give her enough opportunities to, well, bust loose – mostly because she’s the one holding it all together. Did we need a new “Ghostbusters?” Probably not. But we do need more of McCarthy, Wiig, Jones and McKinnon. Together or separately. Either way works for me.

"Jun 13, 2017",positive," Ghostbusters was always going to have a tough hill to climb. Even before Paul Feig signed on, fans were skeptical about the very notion of another Ghostbusters movie. After he did, there were fans upset at the idea of female Ghostbusters and fans unhappy about getting a reboot instead of a sequel and fans still annoyed that a new Ghostbusters movie was happening at all. This project has been under intense scrutiny since before a single frame was shot, and the fuss and furor over it has only intensified as the release date approaches. But the movie itself isn't terribly concerned with all that. Feig's Ghostbusters is more interested in carving out a new space than it is in retracing the steps of the original. While it may not reach ""instant classic"" status, it's still an entertaining addition to the franchise, bursting with humor and personality that's all its own.  In some ways, Ghostbusters is a change of pace for director Paul Feig. It's his first time working on a big-budget franchise or dabbling in horror elements, and it's his first non-R-rated film in ten years. In other ways, though, it fits comfortably alongside the rest of his resume. Like Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy, Ghostbusters is a comedy with a strong ensemble and a laid-back, improvised feel. The cast and crew are stacked with talents who've worked with Feig before, including The Heat screenwriter Katie Dippold and Feig's favorite muse Melissa McCarthy. And while Feig may not be known as an action director per se, he has some experience in the genre thanks to The Heat and Spy. It's probably not surprising, then, that Ghostbusters is at its best when it feels most like classic Feig. The early scenes — where our leads are just starting to come together but before the main supernatural plotline has really kicked in — are the strongest. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon have crackling chemistry together, and it's a pleasure just to watch them hang out. Since Ghostbusters is PG-13, the humor is necessarily a bit cleaner, but on the whole the comedy doesn't feel too different from Feig's other work. Once again, it's all about big personalities bouncing off of each other, launching into semi-improvised riffs and the occasional bit of slapstick-y physical comedy. 
Once Ghostbusters starts to dig deeper into its main storyline, though, it finds itself on shakier ground. Ghostbusters essentially combines a typical Feig comedy with a franchise blockbuster, and the marriage isn't always smooth sailing. Feig and his team make a solid effort: the action scenes are capably shot and choreographed, the gadgets are fun, and the monsters range from amusing to genuinely creepy. They also take care to sprinkle some fun character beats throughout. Still, the setpieces sometimes feel more obligatory than organic — as if they're there to fulfill the expectations of a big-budget blockbuster rather than because they make sense for this particular movie. Some of that time and money and energy would have been better spent on Ghostbusters' strengths, namely its characters and its comedy.

Ghostbusters' other concession to franchise filmmaking are the nods to the earlier movies scattered throughout, including cameos from certain cast members. They're largely unnecessary, but they're not really intrusive either. Otherwise, Ghostbusters is content to stand on its own, and does so quite well. It doesn't coast on nostalgia, or take for granted the affection surrounding this franchise (which is more than we can say for a lot of the terrible sequels and adaptations we've seen this year). Yes, it has the built-in advantage of a familiar brand name. But it does the work of building its own world and characters from the ground up.

Yes, it has the built-in advantage of a familiar brand name. But it does the work of building its own world and characters from the ground up. Speaking of those characters: Of the core cast, McCarthy and Wiig are a bit more dialed down than we've seen in some of their other films (including Bridesmaids), allowing their co-stars to go a little bolder and bigger. Jones is the heart of the team, bringing a warm and upbeat energy to their adventures together. But the real standout is McKinnon as Holtzmann, an engineer who marches to the beat of her own (very high-tech and probably deadly) drum. With luck, Ghostbusters could do for her what Bridesmaids did for McCarthy. McKinnon steals the scene with her very first line, before we even see her face — and when we do get to see her she gets even better, because McKinnon is blessed with an elastic, expressive face that never stops working. In any given scene, it's worth keeping one eye on whatever she's doing. Even when Holtzmann isn't actually speaking, a blink of her eye or a twitch of her mouth says everything you need to know. Ghostbusters' other breakthrough performance comes from Chris Hemsworth, who's good and game as the Ghostbusters' extremely dim-witted receptionist Kevin. Even in his Marvel movies, Hemsworth is better — more convincing, more distinctive, more interesting — portraying Thor's surfer bro side than he is at Thor's noble hero side. Ghostbusters feels like further evidence that Hemsworth ought to borrow a page from fellow Aussie Rose Byrne, and embrace his talents as a comedy star. He gets some of the biggest laughs of the entire movie, including one I'm still giggling about days after I saw the movie. At the end of the day, those who hoped the new Ghostbusters would be just like the original will probably be disappointed. The comedic sensibility is more Paul Feig than Ivan Reitman, the characters and their relationships to one another are completely different, and it all feels more like a 2010s blockbuster film than a 1980s comedy adventure (for pretty obvious reasons). But those willing to roll with the changes will find an entertaining comedy-adventure full of new characters, new gadgets, new monsters, and new possibilities."
"Jun 13, 2017",positive," The key to the Ghostbusters reboot is that it works not so much as a comedy (it’s fitfully amusing) or as a big-budget adventure but as an unforced celebration of feminism. The four heroic women suffer some sexism, but not enough to get in their way significantly (they mostly power through and do what they want anyway). If they’re not taken seriously, it’s not because they’re female but because they insist in a secular age that ghosts exist. At heart it’s a story about two friends since childhood, who grew up to be scientists Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), and who have grown apart since co-writing a book on the paranormal, which Erin has disavowed. The whole creaky, noisy spectacle leads to the moment when one of these women literally jumps into the abyss to save the other. That’s what it’s all about, in the end; saving the world is okay, but sisterhood matters more. Ghostbusters has a sketchy script (by director Paul Feig and Katie Dippold), which functions largely as a clothesline for supernatural gags, but then so did the script for the sacrosanct 1984 original. (Aside from Peter McNicol’s performance, I’d just as soon forget about the wanting 1989 sequel.) I think Feig and Dippold, probably with the encouragement of the actresses, really just wanted to tell a small-scale story about the bond between smart women, and in Ghostbusters they seized the chance to do it on a massive scale, on a $145 million budget. God knows most of the legitimately funny bits could have been filmed in a one-bedroom flat for five dollars. But movies like that don’t get greenlit any more. Movies that cost $145 million and have a connection to a beloved franchise do. Feig enjoys stories about friendships between women, and he has told them again and again in the last few years, in Bridesmaids and The Heat and Spy. Two minority women, the African-American subway worker and armchair city historian Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) and the crypto-gay nuclear engineer Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), round out the quartet of ghostbusters, and they all go to the limits of existence for each other. They’re afraid but forge ahead anyway, the true definition of bravery. Ghostbusters was not as big a hit as it should have been, or else McKinnon would have handily stolen the summer and perhaps the year. She gives us a scientist highly entertained by the buzz of her own brain; weird noises and asides keep leaking out of her — she’s placidly unstable and very much giddily alive. Jones’ Patty largely recalls Richard Pryor’s routine about black people’s comically pragmatic response to the supernatural (get the hell out) while managing to feel much less like a token afterthought than Ernie Hudson’s black ghostbuster in the original. This Ghostbusters doesn’t feel like its predecessors, or look like them; it lacks the original’s cool, slick ‘80s lamination — the director of photography is Robert Yeoman, who provides the warm, bright hues of every Wes Anderson film (and all the aforementioned Paul Feig movies). The phantasms glow sickly green, and spew green slime; the improved technology gives us more visually elaborate ghosts but can’t give us a reason for their ghosting around. There’s a plot thread about some nerdy mad scientist trying to start the apocalypse (ah, that old thing), and the movie itself seems fatally uninterested in everything to do with it. This nerd gets killed about an hour in and spends the rest of our time hopping from body to body, eventually settling inside the ghostbusters’ hunky but dim secretary Kevin (Chris Hemsworth, enjoying being stupid). I don’t imagine Paul Feig cared about the whys and wherefores of the ghosts; I know I didn’t. Yet Ghostbusters is commendable for its respect for intelligence, its regard for friendship; its Stronger Together emphasis feels like a balm in the cold days post-Hillary. (It may be best apprehended as an artifact of the era when a female president seemed tantalizingly imminent.) Unlike the original, it doesn’t proceed from a writer’s genuine hungry obsession with all things inexplicable. The ghosts symbolize loud, chaotic elements seeking to split up our heroes, so they have more going on under the hood than they did in the original, where the ghosts didn’t mean much of anything except gag fodder. Here, the ghosts have a certain beauty and pathos, and are sometimes scarier than their ancestors (though Slimer makes an appearance, as do many other fan-service ghoulies and actors). The movie is more readily comparable to Feig’s other work than to its forefather. It’s a comfortable night out (or in), pleasing and unchallenging."
"Jun 2, 2017",positive," Paul Feig's Ghostbusters is a movie that embraces every silly aspect surrounding it. Ghostbusters is far from a perfect film but it's full of hysterical moments and goofy scenarios that makes it one of the most fun movies of the summer so far.  Ghostbusters is at its best when its main stars — Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon — are on screen together. It's a movie that relies on the antics of an ensemble for some of the bigger jokes to land and when Feig lets the comedians work off of one another's momentum, it feels like the film we were hoping for. There are slight pacing issues with the movie, which leads to moments of brief boredom, and that comes as a result of trying to turn the comedy into an action film. The actual ghost-busting scenes can be feel pretty tedious, but that moment of weariness is alleviated when Feig decides to refocus on the comedy. Ghostbusters has always been a movie about misunderstood misfits with a strong sense of belief running amok in New York City more so than a film about the paranormal. For the most part, Feig realizes this and the film delivers line after line of quirky dialogue perfectly suited to each comedian. McKinnon's oddball style of humor beautifully compliments Jones' loudmouthed hollering, while Wiig's facial reactions to McCarthy's sarcastic bite keeps some of the film's slower parts moving forward with ease. Much like one of Feig's other movies, Bridesmaids, there's a chemistry between the actors that's infectious and it's their obvious enjoyment on screen that seeps into you while watching, making it impossible not to laugh along and root for them. There are certain similarities between Ivan Reitman's 1984 film and this version of Ghostbusters. Both take place in New York City, feature Columbia University as a starting point, have a crazed madman obsessed with humanity's downfalls and, of course, ghosts. But the small similarities almost act as background in Feig's film. It's the differences where the movie finds itself and breaks away just enough from Reitman's version that the concept of Ghostbusters feels fresh. After years of being apart following a fallout, Columbia professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig) reunites with high school best friend and fellow paranormal investigator Abby Yates (McCarthy). During an outing to visit a supposedly haunted house, the two — and Abby's assistant Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon) — encounter an apparition, justifying all of their work over the years and substantiating claims made in a book they co-authored nearly a decade earlier. As they investigate more rumors about ghosts appearing around the city, they meet subway booth operator Patty Tolan (Jones) who decides to join the three scientists and scope out where the ghosts are coming from. The film couldn't exist if one character was more important than another and even Chris Hemsworth's smaller role feels just as important to the success of the movie as the main cast's. One of the best parts of the movie, surprisingly enough, was Hemsworth's portrayal of dodo-brained assistant, Kevin. It's one of the few times Hemsworth doesn't rely on physical humor to carry a character and although the attention focuses mostly on his good looks, he manages to make his character feel like more than a two-dimensional sex object, easily delivering some of the film's best jokes and scenes. Once the initial awkwardness of realizing they're forming a strange troupe of paranormal chasers wears off, the group becomes inseparable, spending all of their time trying out new weapons they can use on various ghosts or eating Chinese takeout from the restaurant below them. It's when Ghostbusters begins to find its groove and where Feig comes into his own. Feig is a master of working with an ensemble, as seen in his other work including Bridesmaids and episodes of Freaks and Geeks, and Ghostbusters is a movie that relies on the talents of everyone on screen working in harmony. Even more importantly, however, is how serious Feig takes the silliest aspects and reiterates their points to make us care about them, too. The entire premise of Ghostbusters is absurd and when making an absurdist comedy the only way to make it succeed is to treat it with the utmost seriousness. Feig does this, and for the most part, it's what makes Ghostbusters such an endearing watch. The team is so enthralled by what they're doing, and proving to the world that ghosts are real, capturing as many as they can for scientific purposes, that it's hard not to believe in their vision and root alongside them. Even though the premise of driving around New York City in a tricked-out hearse looking for ghosts is downright ridiculous, there's a level of urgency and seriousness coming from Feig and the cast that makes it even funnier. That's the other thing about Ghostbusters: it's a comedy, through and through. The least interesting thing about Feig's version of the movie was also the least interesting thing about Reitman's: the ghosts. When Feig decides to spend his time on the paranormal hunting aspects of the film, it loses some of its magic. The scenes are big, loud and intense, and much to the cast's credit, they do a good job of trying to keep the comedic aspects alive while fighting off ghosts, but even then it feels lackluster. Feig tries to transition seamlessly from goofy comedy to sci-fi action, but never quite succeeds. The closest he comes is in a hilarious encounter between Jones and a particularly interesting apparition, and the only reason it works well is because the scene focuses on the comedy of Jones fleeing the ghost more than the jump-scare preceding it. Even the film's climactic, all-out battle between ghosts and busters feels tedious. It's a little too long and you spend most of the time wishing it was over so the cast could get back to bantering. It's a necessary scene, considering the entire premise of the film, but there's nothing particularly interesting about it and when juxtaposed to the less intense parts of the movie, it doesn't feel like it fits well, either. But where Feig loses focus on some elements of the movie, he more than makes up for with others, including making the gang appear as badass as possible. Without revealing too much about the scene, there's a fantastic moment with McKinnon toward the end of the movie featuring a large group of ghosts. It feels like the moment Feig had been building up to all along and it shows off the power of these four women. Feig never calls attention to the fact that this ghost-busting team is entirely female because there's no reason to. It's not a ridiculous notion that three of the most brilliant scientists can be women, nor is it absurd to think that they could handle taking down ghosts around New York City. Since that doesn't feel strange, Feig never comes out and points fingers at the fact that they're women, but simply tells a story about scientists trying to save New York City. In doing so, Feig has created a very funny, and above all else, fun movie about a team of ghostbusters who happen to be women. The focus is on their scientific ability and keenness to investigate the paranormal, not their gender. That being said, there's no question that these women are at the top of their game and the coolest of the cool. Whereas the original ghostbusters — Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson — felt goofy and charming, there's a level of respect the new cast demands. In their quest to prove themselves and their science to the world, there's a certain attitude the team carries that screams they should be taken seriously. They also never lose their sense of comedy, and deliver hilarious punchline after punchline, embracing the self-deprecating scenes along with the most empowering. Feig's Ghostbusters won't be an iconic film in the same way Reitman's was, but it is both hysterical and fun that doesn't fail to entertain."

"Jan 2, 2017",positive," Remember when Sony rebooted Sam Raimi’s take on Spider-Man (2002) with The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)? Their whole conceit at the time appeared to be “What if you didn’t know the story?” so they just told it again. Only everyone actually did know the story. The result was an instantly forgettable retread, useless but for the printing of money. While that may have been the whole point, it left a lousy corporate aftertaste. It took the world gargling with some Marvel Studios mouthwash (aka Captain America: Civil War) to make people excited about Spidey again. The good news is that this mega corporation appears to have learned from its mistake. Ghostbusters NOW does not moronically assume you don’t know Ghostbusters THEN. Sure, it’s the same story again — the Ghostbusters set up shop, refine technobabble gadgets, fight against a supernatural invasion of New York and the bureaucrats that get in their way — but writer/director Paul Feig and his cowriter Katie Dippold (who wrote The Heat together) have correctly guessed that the fun of the movie will be in the makeover...  The story gets a new look, freshened up details, and most famously, four female Ghostbusters and a male receptionist in place of the original’s four men and a female receptionist; that gender inversion proved more revolutionary that any rational human might have expected because a lot of manbabies have been freaking out on the internet ever since. It is here where I should probably remind you that I think the original is fine, but nothing more. Its reputation as a great comedy is the work of supernatural mass possession, and/or nostalgia. Neverthless people hold it sacred. Those people apparently include everyone involved with the new film. Given that Ghostbusters (2016) takes every opportunity it can to wink in the direction of Ghostbusters (1984) as if you know it by heart, it’s a mystery as to why they didn’t just write a new story that takes place 32 years after the original rather than revising the origin to take place now. But that’s Hollywood logic: they’re obsessed with origin stories even in franchises that are on film number 3, the case here, or 7 (as with The Force Awakens and its veritable retread of Star Wars‘s plot). That aggravation aside, it was hard to even stay a little bit mad at the film since it starts well with a tour of a haunted house (with actual jokes for minor characters!) and stays funny for good stretches thereafter. It also knows how to keep a single gag going through multiple scenes as with its clever obsession with the iconic Ghostbusters logo. The cast works hard to entertain. The original film leaned so hard on Bill Murray’s effortless deadpan for its laugh-out-loud moments that it sometimes felt like a one man show that the goddess Sigourney Weaver was occassionally interrupting to steal scenes. The new version spreads the joking around much more equitably and why not? Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Leslie Jones are all dependably funny women and the screenplay makes sure they each get a big solo moment. But it’s Kate McKinnon as the lusty for science (and…?) “Holtzmann ” who generates the biggest laughs. Sometimes she conjures them from thin air without any joke there. Chris Hemsworth has a blast mocking his ridiculous attractiveness as their dumb hunk receptionist and the film rewards him with a showstopping finale. The ladies keep him around just for the pretty which is more of a gentle mocking  than a mean-spirited potshot at Hollywood’s perpetual Male Gaze. In one of the movie’s most memorable gestures, Holtzmann licks one of her weapons; her own genius turns her on. But, keeping it real now, no one will love this movie as much as this badass loves science. I don’t want to oversell it. Let us not speak of the hideous new version of the 1984 theme song. Let’s not dwell on the unfortunate fact that the only black Ghostbuster is the sole non-scientist again. And we won’t check the running time since Paul Feig makes super funny movies (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy) but always risks letting them outstay their welcome. But “Answer the Call,” anyway as the tagline commands. The best reason to see Ghostbusters (2016), aside from crushing the spirits of misogynists who want it to fail, is that it’s sweet and silly where the original opted for sarcastic and smug. They may have nurtured the script with that 1984 template, but by its very 2016 nature it becomes a different beast. And the feminist revamp, if we can even call it that, is of the affectingly subtle variety. These four women respect each other and work together to get better at Busting those Ghosts. It may not be the freshest popcorn entertainment in the world, but in this particular mainstream movie summer, it’ll more than do. I just came from seen this movie and I agree that Kate McKinnon is MVP, but right behind her is Leslie Jones, who does marvels with her character and has some of the funniest dialogue.  But the movie, in my opinion, is overly long and without a strong center around which to create tension.  It is a good time at the movies (a little scarier at the beginning) but it could have been so much more. If it weren't for the middling reviews, I was actually planning on seeing this. But an average retread of an average movie doesn't sound like something odd be interested in.  I had the same problem with this as most comic book movies: incredibly underdeveloped villain. The ladies were great and I laughed a great deal (kudos on the MVP pick), but there was never any tension -- that even the original provided. Any chance you could get your readers to check their spelling, etc. before they submit?""I just came from seen this movie"" rather than ""seeing"".""sound like something odd be interested in"" rather than ""something in which I'd be interested"".Spelling errors and bad Grammer make this Gramper angry! @RJL - I'm assuming most of us here comment on our phones which are prone to auto-correcting in the worst way. And when you're always on the go, it's sometimes difficult to go over your text before you post.  If you had told me 3 years ago that a female remake of ""The Ghostbusters"" would cause a full on meltdown from so many immature sexist fanboys I would not have believed you. However they really did react badly and fortunately the female version is on it's way to being a success. These fanboys probably have trouble with the fact that women can vote as well. Imagine being alive 20 years in the future and being able to tell people that you were present during the year that was the last gasp of the patriarchy. I just hope this last gasp doesn't go on too much longer. With that said, at least they switched it up with a female cast - even if it looks like they otherwise mostly stuck to the same story. I hope it fails, just like I hoped the Garfield-Stone spiderman films would fail. McCarthy & Team could be making much better ORIGINAL films instead. I saw Ghostbusters on Friday afternoon. It’s fun and silly, as you would expect a mid-summer family movie to be. Its sheer good-naturedness makes the fanboy outrage seem all the more weird and overblown. However - and it pains me to say it - there are large failings in pacing and actual storytelling in the film. It felt too much like a series of sketches tied together to make a plot, and where the original actual works is combining some genuinely effective scares with a combination of humour and storytelling. Zuul, the hauntings and the possession sequences in the original were very effective, whereas the glossiness of this and elements of humour just don't really work as well. I felt that Melissa McCarthy - oddly - was the weakest part of this and it doesn't fall down on her, but what her character was given. I totally love that it's an all female reboot. The haters are just sexist toads. But there were a lot of missed opportunities in this. It might be more to do with the state of big budget filmmaking today, but it left me wanting so much more. Not the original, just something that struck that balance more. You know im reading this review and all these comments most of them Are very one sided not to mention the article writer. Im a girl 28 years  and i thought this movie was terrible one of the most terrible films ive seen!!! Does that make me a woman hater being a woman NOOO the script is a pile of garbage and gag after gag made me almost walk out. Got nothing to do with being all woman or that crap. And i see me women on youtube that dont like it either. Stop saying its all men that hate this move because they hate women because that is just not true. Yes some did say they didnt like the all female thing, but read and watch everything and it you find out ""people"" dont like it because of many other reason beside the women thing. If you want strong female charachter sigourney weaver in alien films, god force awaken girl in star wars, the new rogue one movie with strong female lead, but no one talkes about those stong female roles, not the slap stick crap( and i likes these actors also!!) in ghostbusters.. Jessica, most of the haters came out against this movie before they even saw it. That is the difference. And that is blatant misogyny. Period. I thought it was quite funny, although the ghostbusting finale was a bit overlong and uninteresting.  Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were definitely the standouts. See what i mean you totally disregard every else i say. OH ITS BLATANT MISOGYNY. And yes i did watch the trailers and thought omg what is this!? But i gave it a chance because yes i am woman and i did see the women hating comments but its not all the comments so dont just make it black and white like sony and paul feig make it out to be. No one can probably criticise this movie without being a woman hater. God dammit this PC BULLCRAP is disgusting sometimes. I loved it. It was so much fun, those ladies are incredible. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones especially, but I loved Cecily Strong too. I've never seen the original and found the constant breaks for fan-service annoying (I didn't understand them but the girls next to me were freaking out so I assumed the people they were freaking out over had been in the original film), but that's my only complaint. I have no interest in seeing the original anyway, why bother with the dudes when I can have these amazing ladies?! I saw it last night. It was decent. This is a seriously talented quartet, but I felt that other than McKinnon they weren't given especially funny characters to play. I saw the original as a kid but don't have any particularly significant memories of it--it was never a favorite of mine.  That said, I hope it does well financially because I'd love to see these ladies get offered good film work and for there to be more female-fronted comedies. The only people to make an issue out of the all-female slant of this film are a vocal and virulent group of men that *regularly* make an issue out of things like this. It's not ""all the comments"" but it was more than a fair share and more than enough to shape the dialogue around this film. Denying that is just delusional.  That being said: this is a fun film, perfect summertime fare. It's entertaining and bounces along before some third-act drag. Kate McKinnon absolutely steals the film with her wonderful and specific weirdness- we learn next to nothing about her character but McKinnon is able to create a fully-fleshed brilliant weirdo out of it. I wish more performers were as unique and weird as McKinnon has proven herself to be- she is a one-of-a-kind performer and that makes her work equally one-of-a-kind. From her SNL work (hers is the best take on Hillary anywhere, to say nothing of her work as Ellen, Bieber, or original characters) to Holtzmann, McKinnon is just a gem. I hope Hollywood knows what to do with her. Just saw this last night, and what a refreshing time at the movies. This is what a summer blockbuster used to be--fun, silly, scary, good-natured, with memorable characters you really love watching. My one complaint was that it could have had a few more great jokes, but all in all, this was a really fun time at the movies. These chicks busted ghosts with a fierceness."
"Jan 1, 2017",positive," SLIME TIME The film whose trailer is the most disliked in YouTube history
(947K thumbs down) turns out to be the smartest sort of silly summer fun. 
Talk about coming full circle. Or history repeating itself. Or just plain getting old. The original 1984 Ghostbusters was one of the first movies I reviewed as a professional critic. Think of it: 32 years ago. Born five months before its release, Kate McKinnon was literally in diapers.
 
That might seem like a long time, but it's probably just about the right interval to wait before readdressing a classic. Too many films that aren't remotely classics are remade these days, even as the original's still streaming on Netflix. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), for example. Has the public really indicated its desperate need for a new Croft flick, or is Hollywood just more creatively bankrupt than ever?
 
I digress. The great Paul Feig (Bridesmaids), along with his pretty darn great cowriter Katie Dippold (The Heat), has resurrected, reimagined and rebooted the beloved comedy and done so with both tremendous respect and exemplary finesse. This is a picture with more nice touches than a shiatsu massage.
 
First and foremost, there's the inspired decision to flip the genders of the principals. Feig's films have always maintained that female police officers, high-level government staff and secret agents can be every bit as competent — and loony — as their male counterparts. Why not, then, make them Ghostbusters?
 
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a cast this hilarious. If there are four funnier females than Kristen Wiig, McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy making movies today, they're making them on another planet. These are the queens of comedy.
 
Prudently, the script wastes minimal time on setup. Faster than you can say, ""Don't cross the streams,"" the four women have gone into business together, rented an office over a Chinese restaurant and worked the bugs out of their proton packs. Their outfits are a gift from Jones' Patty, a former MTA employee who presumably figures that if they're going to save New York City, they might as well look like they work for it.
 
Pals Erin (Wiig) and Abby (McCarthy) have always shared a fascination with the supernatural. Jillian (McKinnon) has always been a gearhead. And Patty's just seen a ghost in a subway tunnel and is afraid. She signs on to help wipe out the specters.
 
""Someone's created a device that amplifies paranormal activity,"" McCarthy discovers — something that's not great for Manhattan but really good for business. This would be a nerd of evil named Rowan North (Neil Casey), whose plan is to unleash an ectoplasmic tsunami on the city. In one of the she-boot's most wonderful scenes, our heroes confront the mayor (Andy Garcia) and plead with him to take action. ""Please don't be like the mayor in Jaws,"" begs Wiig.
 
Needless to say, the effects are more sophisticated than they were in 1984 (if rivers of fluorescent vomit can be described as ""sophisticated""), the gadgets are more impressive than ever and the surviving members of the original crew pop by for cameos. The most extended — and funniest — is Bill Murray's. ""Is this a good time?"" he asks with a smirk, playing a professional debunker paying a surprise visit to Ghostbusters headquarters. Of course, it's always a good time when Murray pops by.
 
The Times Square finale is a thing of CGI beauty, with the four women facing down a delightfully frightful mashup of old and new spooks. Standouts include holdovers such as Slimer, along with more recent developments like sinister Macy's parade balloons.
 
That crucial balance of the old and new is just one of many things the director gets exactly right. From the iconic theme music to the laid-back, take-nothing-too-seriously tone, the DNA of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis' gut buster flows through every frame of Paul Feig's Ghostbusters.

"Dec 31, 2016",positive," Wielding an electronic ghost detector that resembles a little rotating neon vulva, a triumphant Melissa McCarthy leads this female-powered Ghostbusters reboot. The remake clearly has a chip on its shoulder over fanboi venom. It acknowledges the ""raped childhood"" posts all splattered over the internet. Learning that the Ghostbusters would feature an all-women cast, thousands of male fans whimpered about PC Hollywood. At the risk of validating the online declarations of fools, director Paul Feig includes scenes of the heroines having their ghost-hunting business dragged through the comments sections of popular websites. One troll's unimaginative jab reads: ""ain't no bitch gonna hunt no ghosts"". In this round, Kristin Wiig plays Erin—an academic trying to get tenure as a physics professor at Columbia University.  Her hopes are dashed after a book she co-wrote years earlier about the supernatural materializes online. The book was uploaded by her miffed former writing partner, Abby (McCarthy), who is now working at a lab in an off-brand tech school in the suburbs. Abby's new partner is a super-scientist who calls herself Holtzmann; Kate McKinnon plays this pretty, cocky blonde weirdette as the kind of brat who puts her feet on the mayor's desk. McKinnon pulls a lot of faces to try to steal scenes from her two top-drawer comic co-stars, without much success. The trio is joined by a blustering subway worker named Patti (a lovable Leslie Jones), who saw a haunting at her station. The four team up to learn more about the afterlife. Meanwhile, a bitter and pale bellboy (Neil Casey) is trying to launch an apocalypse. Chris Hemsworth plays Kevin, the ladies' male bimbo of a secretary. Hemsworth has provided some of the funniest moments in the Avengers series, but he's not an out-and-out comedic actor. Trying to do slapstick, he's off-putting. The new Ghostbusters is a patchy film, pockmarked with head-scratching moments. Even to give some more time to Bill Murray, as a James Randi type, why would you accidentally-on-purpose let a dragon ghost loose?  But this remake is a different kind of patchy than its popular, sloppy hit predecessor—it doesn't have the jittery, cocaine-laden quality to the writing, the dead spaces, the sudden maudlin episodes. McCarthy is a demonically talented slow-burn artist. Whenever the movie stalls, she slaps it into action. In 1984, cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs aimed for a Transylvanian look for NYC, during a dirtier era for that city. By contrast, director of photography Robert D. Yeoman (a Wes Anderson vet) makes the movie a visual carnival. The phosphorescent green goo all over the place is matched with blazing magentas and sapphire spectral glows. The colors are bright and glittery. In the night skies, the ghosts look like the future of fireworks. The finale fight is something made to see twice and freeze-frame later, just to be able to see the multiple Times Squares of the 20th century all crammed into one time-vortex. The kid stuff—the ectoplasmic ooze, and the dull, slimy Slimer—is counterbalanced with some subtext. These ghost-busting ladies seem to have symbols of patriarchy to fight: a killer pilgrim, and a spidery and nasty Uncle Sam on stilts. It's a pleasure to see Wiig's attractive forlornness used in the service of being a kind of superhero; she even gets to fly, Supergirl style. The movie stalls at times, and the heroines never seem properly introduced to the villain. But there's a special tang to the film. The first Ghostbusters was about small businessmen getting over-regulated by the nosy government. This time around, both the city and the academics are trying to shut these ghost-fighters down. But the new Ghostbusters has a different kind of point to make. In her childhood, Wiig's Erin saw dead people. She was tormented by the vision of a ghost standing in her bedroom, and then mocked when she told the story. Even in our times, it's hard for women to be believed when they're telling something that happened to them ... if we must speak of raped childhoods."
"Dec 28, 2016",neutral,"While there isn't a cynical note in the entire film, it feels like a safe, flavorless recipe prepared from gourmet ingredients."
"Dec 26, 2016",neutral,"All up it's a so-so comedy offering, with just enough entertainment value to not make you wish you'd waited for the stream or DVD."
"Dec 19, 2016",positive," What is the new Ghostbusters? It isn’t a sequel, it isn’t a remake, it isn’t even an ordinary rebrand. It is, I suppose, a new form of cinema, a feminist rebrand, complete with four women playing the roles originally taken by four men, a shiny new script written by the chick who wrote The Heat, plus, I’m imagining, a vast committee of Hillary Clinton-style female studio execs who pounded the scenes into a perfect female product."
"Dec 12, 2016",positive," Three women stand around a recording device listening to a communication from the other side. Abby, a paranormal scientist who works out of the basement of a high school, claims that her team has finally done the impossible and caught a ghost on tape. Erin, her frenemy and one-time colleague, leans in closely, not sure what to expect. A fart rings out loudly.  That’s a scene from the new Ghostbusters, a film with pleasures that are both small and revolutionary. Directed by Paul Feig from a script co-written by Katie Dippold (Parks and Recreation), its commitment to equal opportunity crassness is central to the movie’s mission statement.  In Ghostbusters, women behave in ways that are often deemed exclusive to male characters. They debate about science. They worry about their careers. They make queef jokes. Feig, who has previously directed Spy and Bridesmaids, commonly explores what it means for women to act like men. In Spy, Melissa McCarthy plays a CIA analyst who dreams of being a field agent in an industry where most spies look like Jude Law. Bridesmaids features so much scatological humor that it becomes political. Ghostbusters, one of the funniest movies of the year, is so daffy and effervescent that it appears weightless, as if the film could float away at any moment. But that disguises its immense importance at a time when many felt it shouldn’t exist. The all-female reboot of the 1980s comedy classic has been one of the most intensely scrutinized movies in history. The film’s trailer is the most disliked video ever on YouTube, while Ghostbusters earned a 4.0 from IMDb users. This is despite the fact that until this week, almost no one had seen it. In the film, Kristen Wiig (Diary of a Teenage Girl, Saturday Night Live) stars as Erin Gilbert, a professor who is up for tenure at her college. The plans are derailed when her childhood best friend (McCarthy, now a Feig regular) ropes her into investigating a local haunting. Before Erin went into university academia, the two were paranormal researchers. They even co-authored a book together. After discovering the sightings are real, the pair enlist Abby’s co-worker (Kate McKinnon), an MTA worker who has access to her uncle’s hearse (Leslie Jones), and the world’s worst male secretary (Chris Hemsworth) to fight the undead. Ghostbusters is extremely generous to its stable of actors, each of whom is given ample opportunity to shine. Jones, a towering presence on-screen, is ferociously good as Patty, who quits her subway job for the promise of female friendship. She was under the impression the foursome was a book club and pictured them listening to Stevie Nicks together. Early reaction to the film’s trailer drew attention to the fact that the character seems to draw from an outdated stereotype—the streetwise, token black character—and that she’s the only member of the group who isn’t a scientist. But Patty, like the rest of the film, is handled with intelligence. A self-described non-fiction nerd, she’s like a walking encyclopedia. Wiig and McCarthy, who reteam for the first time since Bridesmaids, are dependably fine as another pair of women with a complicated relationship. Wiig, who has recently carved out a niche for herself as one of cinema’s finest character actors in movies like The Skeleton Twins and Welcome to Me, wisely plays it close to the vest, showing a gift for understatement. One of the best jokes in the whole movie goes almost unnoticed: A male colleague at her university tells her she needs to rethink her wardrobe (she dresses like a physicist) and she misunderstands the edict. “Too sexy?” she asks. When she visits the Amazon page for her book, she’s pictured wearing a slight variation on the same outfit. Clearly Erin has a look. One of the reasons that Ghostbusters works as well as it does is that its comedy is rooted in a genuine sense of character, its humor driven by a real understanding of these women’s personalities. McKinnon, SNL‘s most talented active cast member, steals every scene she’s in as a Q-like scientist with a delightfully off-kilter energy: Holtzmann is never too busy hunting ghosts to eat a potato chip or play dress-up. Appearing out of nowhere in a purple bouffant and costume shades, Holtzmann scares the daylights out of Erin. “Is it the wig or the hat?” she asks. The plot, as tends to be the case in big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, is something of a formality. A misanthropic hotel worker who believes himself to be a genius (Neil Casey) devises an evil plan to open a portal to another dimension, thus unleashing a maelstrom of ghosts on New York City. The proceedings hew closely to the original, featuring a bevy of gratuitous cameos from members of the original crew. Some of them are groaners, but you may be too busy laughing to notice the movie’s flaws—or its smattering of plot holes. For instance, the girls are able to rent out a Chinese restaurant as their home base. How exactly is a team with no funding able to afford workspace in New York, especially if they’re too broke to get their own car? In a year filled with failed sequels and reboots (Alice Through the Looking Glass, take a bow), it’s refreshing to see a film that is not only reverent toward its source (perhaps to a fault) but also willing to put its own distinctive stamp on the material. Like the recent Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Ghostbusters isn’t a hollow copy of its predecessor but a loving recreation, a gift to a new generation of fans. Fanboys might be worried it will ruin their childhoods, but for everyone else, Ghostbusters is a proton back blast.  Nico Lang is an essayist, movie critic, and reporter who specializes in the intersection of politics and LGBTQ issues.

"Dec 5, 2016",positive,"A very neutral and profoundly unexceptional thing, but likable enough."
"Nov 15, 2016",negative," It's hard to tell which was more depressing: the whining from alleged males about how their precious Ghostbusters had been defiled by featuring a new all-female cast or the curiously dull trailers that have circulated around the web. Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) are not concerned with any potential harm that might be infl icted upon them by supernatural beings in Ghostbusters. Now that Paul Feig's reworking of the 1984 hit is finally on the big screen, it's actually disappointing to say the new film is far more enjoyable than the unbearable Ghostbusters 2 (you know a movie sucks when its sole virtue is a Bobby Brown song) or that terrible cover that Fall Out Boy made of Ray Parker Jr.'s original theme song. Feig's last few films, like Spy and Bridesmaids, have impressively balanced gross-out humor and compassion for his sometimes troubled characters. With the former, Feig also demonstrated an eye for staging action scenes that made his movies look far more expensive than they actually were. With his new take on Ghostbusters, Feig and just about everything else in the film seem subdued by special effects that are both cluttered and obligatory. Feig's comedies have tended to be character driven, and that's hard to set up when viewers are expecting legions of ghosts to not be afraid of. To their credit, Feig and co-screenwriter Katie Dippold drop lots of little nods to Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis' original tale, but for the most part act as if the previous film and Parker's catchy question never happened. In this version Kristen Wiig plays Erin Gilbert, a Columbia University physics professor who's on the verge of getting tenure. Because her career is on the line, she hopes that the world will forget an obscure book she wrote with her childhood pal Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) about the paranormal. The two former friends wind up reuniting when they discover the phenomena they explored but couldn't prove in print are now happening all over New York. Joined by wisecracking gadget guru Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a transit employee whose brain has a built-in Google Maps, the new Ghostbusters develop ways to combat and trap malevolent spirits despite the fact that the city and the media discount their existence. With limited resources, they have to settle for hiring the male equivalent of window dressing. Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) can't take a message to save his life and is a fountain of bad ideas. Then again, with his abs and dance moves, he almost makes up for the fact that answering the phone isn't part of his skill set. The team members find their workload increasing because a disgruntled janitor (Neil Casey) has been summoning specters to attack people he thinks have wronged him. Feig and Dippold have the unenviable task of making up a worthwhile new story while keeping fans of the first movie -- like me -- happy. Some of the gags seem lazy (perfunctory cameos by Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver), but others are inspired. Hemsworth has a ball lampooning his superhero image, and Bill Murray's brief turn as a Ghostbuster skeptic is expectedly funny. As she does in just about every episode of Saturday Night Live, McKinnon walks away with the film. Her geeky but ornery countenance is a lot more fun to watch than the sketchy longtime friendship between Wiig and McCarthy. Developing that relationship could have resulted in some more fully realized sequences and given the story more depth and laughs. Wiig and McCarthy, for the most part, serve as decent straight women to McKinnon and Jones, but it seems as if Feig is underutilizing his formidable leading ladies. Perhaps he could have spent less time showing off armies of flying apparitions. After a while, it's easy to become more exhausted than haunted by all the ghosts.

"Oct 28, 2016",positive," Ghostbusters (2016), the reboot / remake / revival of the 1984 frat boy comedy starring Bill Murray as a sardonic con man in academia turned nuclear powered paranormal investigator, was the most controversial film of the year if you measure such things by Facebook rants and Twitter burns from arrested adolescents. Why? Because it stars four women in the roles originally played by four men. Which is apparently is blasphemy in the fanatical fringe of the church of popular culture. It’s a hard case to make when you actually see the film, a playful romp through a haunted New York City by four extremely funny women improvising banter through a half-baked script. Falling somewhere between remake and reinvention, it takes the basic premise, tosses in a new bad guy, adds lots of CGI phantoms and the usual apocalyptic assault on NYC, and… well, that’s pretty it. Which is enjoyable enough as these things go but a little disappointing from a film that reunites filmmaker Paul Feig with collaborators Kristen Wiig (of Bridesmaids) and Melissa McCarthy (The Heat and Spy), tag-team leads who generously share the laughs in a genuine ensemble comedy. Wiig is a physicist whose tenure track is derailed when her buried ghost-obsessed past comes back to haunt her thanks to her former high school BFF McCarthy, still struggling to give her paranormal research an academic stamp of approval. Kate McKinnon is the team’s secret weapon, a maverick nuclear engineer who whips up proton packs, atomic-powered ghost traps, and other cool inventions. She’s not so much a mad scientist as a gleeful eccentric with a manic energy that comes out in sideways glances, wicked grins, and spontaneous moves that suggests she’s dancing to her own private soundtrack. Completing the team is Leslie Jones as a subway worker and amateur New York historian who provides the blue collar practicality. There are plenty of cameos from the original film, from cast members Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver to the grinning green Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and precious few surprises. But there is one unexpected delight: Chris Hemsworth, taking a break from the regal authority of Thor, plays their bubble-headed hunk of a receptionist (aka “stripogram Clark Kent”) with the glassy-eyed abandon of a born improv comic. The big special effects set pieces lack the whimsical invention and twisted absurdity of the original film and the running jokes are tired before they hit their stride but these women have chemistry and quickly build a compelling sense of solidarity. They are a fun group to spend time with. If only they had a movie worthy of their comic potential. The film has been rebranded Ghostbusters: Answer the Call for home video but it’s the same film, at least in the theatrical version.

"Oct 11, 2016",negative," For the past couple of decades, there was always a high demand for another “Ghostbusters” sequel. The original is considered a comedy classic, and while the second film didn’t quite live up to the first, the fans couldn’t wait to see our heroes reunite to take on more ghosts. However, even though the demand was high, another sequel was never made after the 1989 follow up. Instead, what we would end up with over 25 years later is a reboot that no one really asked for. After all, the original characters were beloved by a generation of film-goers, so how would they react to having everyone replaced for a new origin story? It seemed like a very risky move, but director/co-write Paul Feig decided to accept the gamble, delivering the simply-titled “Ghostbusters” for a new generation. Upon discovering that his historical mansion is haunted, Ed Mulgrave (Ed Begley Jr.) seeks the help of Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig), a professor who co-authored a book on paranormal activity years before. Embarrassed that someone has discovered it, she denies that it was her and seeks out her old friend and collaborator, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), who is now a paranormal researcher. While Erin tries to get Abby to stop advertising their book, she mentions the possibly-haunted mansion, which excites Abby and her research partner, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). Shortly afterward, all three of them find themselves at the mansion, face-to-face with an actual ghost. The experience causes them to start up their own ghost-hunting business, which is soon joined by Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a subway worker who leads them to another ghost sighting in a tunnel beneath New York City. Meanwhile, we are shown exactly who is behind all of the recent ghost activity. As it turn out, a man by the name of Rowan North (Neil Casey), a genius who works at a local hotel, has been attempting to amplify the paranormal energy around the city to help unleash a plethora of ghosts upon it. Obviously the Ghostbusters can’t allow this to happen, but will they be able to stop him before it’s too late? I have to admit there was a large amount of personal skepticism when it came to the notion of a “Ghostbusters” reboot, especially after the trailers first came out, which made it seem as though the film was going to be a complete disaster. That being said, it’s at least slightly pleasing to say that the film is not the total train wreck that was expected, though the result is not exactly enough to get it up to “good” either. You may recall that the humor in the 1984 classic was much more natural, and was delivered by great actors like Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, and while the characters here aren’t a total misstep, they just aren’t as likeable as the original team. It certainly doesn’t help that the material they have to work with isn’t nearly as good, but given that the screenplay is by Paul Feig (“Spy”) and Katie Dippold (“The Heat”), it hardly comes as a surprise. However, again, the film is not particularly bad. The story is engaging enough, though it can’t quite help being what it is: a retread of the origin of the Ghostbusters, though with a far-less-intriguing villain. Speaking of the villain, that was something of a problem in itself. We have a genius who has been mistreated by the world, so he decides to unleash a ton of ghosts upon New York City as punishment. It’s one of those revenge plots that you have to try not to think too hard about, or else you’ll find yourself wondering why, out of all the possibilities, he would choose to pursue this one. There is a certain charm that permeates the film, especially when it comes to the multitude of cameos that can be noticed throughout. I won’t spoil them here, but you should probably know who to expect anyway. However, some of them are so quick that if you blink, you just might miss them, so keep a sharp eye out. There’s also a good deal of nostalgia to be found throughout the storyline as our new group of heroes use their proton packs, traps, and other gadgets to fight the ghosts, which, along with other parts of the narrative, make it feel as though there was a good “Ghostbusters” film hiding in here somewhere, but unfortunately these filmmakers just couldn’t quite get to it. What we end up with is a reboot that has a few things to like about it, but also a few too many things that are holding it back from being a satisfactory return to the long-dormant franchise. It really makes one wish that they had been able to get the surviving members of the original crew back together for another outing, updating us on how the characters have been over the last couple of decades, and giving the fans exactly what they’ve wanted for so long. Feig’s attempt to bring it back in this fashion wasn’t a terrible idea, and it certainly could have worked with better writers on board, but the result is merely a mostly-forgettable film that just isn’t able to recapture the magic that made this series so entertaining in the first place. “Ghostbusters” comes to Blu-ray in a 2.39:1, 1080p high definition transfer of excellent quality. Throughout the film, the image does seem a little too bright at times, but for the most part, it’s clear and sharp, allowing for a fine viewing experience. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is outstanding, giving you all of the dialogue, sound effects, and score in great quality. Overall, the film has been given pretty good treatment that will leave viewers satisfied. Commentary with Director/Co-Writer Paul Feig and Co-Writer Katie Dippold: An intriguing commentary in which Feig and Dippold take you behind the scenes of the making of the film. Paul Feig’s “Ghostbusters” reboot isn’t the outright disaster that was expected, for it does contain some humor that works and a good deal of charm and nostalgic value, but it still ends up being a mostly-forgettable outing thanks to a lot of jokes that miss, an unremarkable story, and a bland villain with a nonsensical revenge scheme. It wasn’t a terrible idea to bring in new characters in an effort to revitalize the series, but in the end it can only get so far with its lackluster screenplay, leaving behind a film that just can’t come close to the original’s legacy."
"Oct 5, 2016",positive,"Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are all absolutely, brilliantly hilarious -- I couldn't tell you which one made me laugh the most."
"Sep 27, 2016",positive,"Not as bad as many have said but it's not this summer's best movie. Despite that, this new version will free us from the ghosts of boredom. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Sep 21, 2016",positive," To all the Internet manbabies convinced that Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters reboot will be the worst thing ever to hit theaters on the basis of RUINING MAH CHILDHOOD: Sorry not sorry, you big dopes. It’s actually a damn fun movie. I know, I know. To all the Internet manbabies who instead say, “bwuh bwuh bwuh, but what if I don’t like it because of the trailer, why do feminist bitches have to crawl up my urethra all the time?”— literally no one ever said thinking Ghostbusters doesn’t look good necessarily makes you sexist. Britney Spears wants you to shut up. Now, for the most part, we’re all liberal hippie Michael Jackson enthusiasts SJW assholes here at the ‘jibez. So—hopefully—seeing as I am surrounded by like-minded individuals, I will not need to go into too much depth recapping how the vitriol against this movie has been distinctly gendered in flavor. We’ve been over it already anyways. If you have any more questions/comments/complaints, feel free to send them via post with a SASE to PO Box Up Your Own Ass. So here’s the deal. Ghostbusters. It’s a very entertaining movie! It is not a perfect movie, but considering the state of summer 2016 so far, “doesn’t make me want to light my hair on fire” is pretty damn good. Instead of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson, we get Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, and Kristen Wiig saving New York City (though the ‘busters in one scene eat Papa John’s, and WHAT SELF-RESPECTING NEW YORKER, I ASK YOU etc.) from a massive spectral threat. The villain this time is not Zuul but the completely human and alive Rowan North (Neil Casey), who invented a machine that can, for all intents and purposes, create ghosts. Rowan North is like if Reddit became a person, except without the cursing or rape threats. (PG-13, y’all.) He does not have a neckbeard, physically. But he is a neckbeard, spiritually. He’s a bullying victim turned bully, a man who thinks his intellect entitles him to obedience and respect from people he believes to be inferior to him in every way. When he doesn’t get it, he lashes out. He has definitely used the word “sheeple,” and not ironically. Rowan makes a few comments to the tune of “oh, you women” (“You shoot like girls!”), and there’s a scene where dialogue was slightly tweaked as a reaction to early criticism. But, for the most part, Ghostbusters doesn’t get too meta. These new Ghostbusters aren’t “women in a man’s world.” They’re just… women in the world. They know what they’re doing. Their gender is rarely spoken of by the other characters in the movie, as something that would prevent them from going out and kicking some ghostly ass. It’s kind of refreshing. As with its predecessor, Ghostbusters is funny as hell. For Christ’s sake, it’s Wiig, McKinnon, Jones and McCarthy, plus the guy who directed Spy and Katie Dippold, one of the writers for Parks and Recreation. It was going to be funny. A quick aside on McKinnon: I don’t know where I was on the Kinsey Scale before seeing this movie, but I’m sure as shit at a different place on it now. McKinnon’s Jillian Holtzmann, the weirdo tech genius of the group, is (to quote Kristy’s review) “one-part Egon earnest nerd-thusiasm with two-parts Ian Malcolm (from Jurassic Park) sex appeal.” I feel like a changed person for having seen it. God opened a door for me, and I walked through it. She spends half the movie eyefucking people. It is everything you wanted from the trailers and more. Feig’s Ghostbusters isn’t as good as Ivan Reitman’s. It drags somewhat during the setup-heavy first 20 minutes, and the climax is a bit overstuffed—I preferred the low-key “four guys on a rooftop” of the original to the city-spanning action we get here, which is more typical of 21st century blockbusters. The original Ghostbusters had a spark to it that this one just doesn’t, because it’s a concept that we’re all so familiar with by this point. And, speaking of comparisons, the new Ghostbusters doesn’t help itself with the constant references, cameos, and callbacks to the ‘84 film. Acknowledge your source material, fine, but you really don’t need to work “I ain’t afraid of no ghosts” or “Who you gonna call?” in there if doing so brings your movie to a distracting standstill. Cameos for their own sake aren’t funny. Cut it out! (Literally and figuratively.) That said, Ghostbusters is still a very fun, solid action comedy—even the 3D is good, and that’s not something I normally go in for. There’s no ghost blowjob, as in the original, but there is a scene where a ghost gets shot in the dick. Fun times for the whole family!"
"Sep 13, 2016",positive," It's been more than 30 years since the Ghostbusters first hit the big screen with a then-original mix of comedy and supernatural action. Intriguingly, this new film is neither a sequel nor a remake; it's a reboot of the franchise, which loosely adapts the original 1984 premise to all-new characters. Thankfully, the screenplay is smart and funny, and the cast is flat-out hilarious. It opens as university professor Erin (Kristen Wiig) sees her hopes for tenure evaporate when a book she wrote years ago with her childhood pal Abby (Melissa McCarthy) resurfaces, affirming their belief in ghosts. So Erin seeks out Abby, and discovers that she's still researching the supernatural, now with the sharp-witted gadget maker Jillian (Kate McKinnon). With spirit sightings on the rise in New York, the three decide to launch a ghost-busting business, joined by city expert Patty (Leslie Jones) and bimbo receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). But the apparitions popping up around the city are getting increasingly malevolent, and it's clear that an apocalypse is brewing. The basic plot is lifted from the original movie, which is referenced in virtually every scene. Most of this is rather distracting, because a more original storyline would have been a lot more involving and the in-jokes will be lost on younger audiences. But it's fun to see the original cast members turn up here and there in random cameos. Like Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, this film also features veterans from Saturday Night Live. Wiig already has a varied movie career (this reunites her with Bridesmaids costar McCarthy and director Paul Feig), and this film gives scene-stealers McKinnon and Jones their first proper big-screen roles. Together, they have a terrific sense of camaraderie, which engagingly layers real warmth under the sassy attitude. It's great to see a film led by women who don't feel the need to find boyfriends or husbands. And Hemsworth is hilarious as their airhead eye-candy. Filmmaker Feig keeps everything moving at full speed, filling scenes with eye-catching effects and a continual barrage of witty verbal and visual jokes. Several scenes feel oddly chopped together, with subplots that appear and disappear and running gags that don't quite catch on. But thanks to the energetic likeability of the central quartet, none of that really matters. And as it goes on, the film becomes even funnier and genuinely scarier than the original. Which bodes well for the launch of a new franchise, as long as the writers have somewhere interesting to send these characters."
"Sep 12, 2016",positive,The new installment is pretty damn funny and stands as tall as the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.
"Sep 9, 2016",neutral," 's take on the supernatural comedy is conceptually shrewd, a feminist twist on a beloved classic, casting Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones as the wielders of the oh-so-phallic proton guns used to zap and wrangle spooks and specters. But Feig and Katie Dippold's screenplay is a slipshod mess of forgettable gags tossed into a generic plot puffed up with unremarkable special effects. It's also besieged with references to the 1984 film, which backfire, because including them doesn't stoke nostalgia as much as it begs unfavorable comparison. To be clear, nobody watches the original for its depth of character - Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were little more than charismatic, goofball conduits for witty and quotable catchphrases. Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon and Jones look like they're making up the characters on the fly as they recite weary cliches. ""Say hello to my little friend!"" Wiig half-heartedly yells as she blasts the bejeezus out of a CGI ghost, in a scene I remember only because I was taking notes. Wiig plays Erin Gilbert, a physicist discredited in academia for her studies in the supernatural. She mends an acrimonious friendship with Abby Yates (McCarthy) after they witness a full-on metaphysical phenomenon. Erin, sort of skeptical except when she isn't, seeks physical proof of the paranormal, and she gets it, when a ghost in New York City's Aldridge Mansion vomits green spew in her face. If that's not enough, the sliming is repeated twice more in the first act, as if the movie's goop budget exceeded the salaries of its writers. McCarthy and Wiig's bland turns as literally buttoned-up eggheads are eclipsed by current ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member McKinnon, whose Jillian Holtzmann is a spunky, punk-haired inventress in omnipresent goggles. Rejected by institutions both legit and rinky-dink, the trio pass on an old Manhattan firehouse - it's $21,000 per month to rent! - and set up their gear above a Chinese restaurant, fielding calls for unearthly activity. They gain a relatively gregarious fourth member in Jones' former subway clerk Patty Tolan, as well as some infamy, which leads to jokes about crass internet commenters - a direct reference to the backlash Feig received upon announcing an all-female ""Ghostbusters"" cast. Feig has a reputation for helming strong femme-comedies with tight narratives and punchy jokes - Wiig vehicle ""Bridesmaids,"" McCarthy's ""The Heat"" and ""Spy,"" more apt comparisons than the '84 ""Ghostbusters."" Perhaps it's worth noting that the director's weakest effort isn't his original idea. This remake - not a sequel or a prequel, it's a pure regurgitation, set in its own reality where Bill Murray plays an entirely different character - flounders when it should crackle. The direction is sloppy: Scenes dawdle and dilly-dally when they should poke and jab; there's little narrative flow or suspense as the Ghostbusters zap glowing Satanic gargoyles and evil-spirit-possessed parade balloons while pursuing the disaffected dweeb (Neil Casey) behind the mayhem. Chris Hemsworth turns up as the Ghostbusters' extraordinarily dim-witted secretary, another example of a flash of inspiration that feels underdeveloped, and never really pays off. You can see the seams in the film's calculation, sense its desire to inspire girls and women with strong role models. But it fails to capitalize on all that talent, the charisma curiously capped. It also stumbles in its subjective objective to be funny - I laughed twice, when I should be losing count - recycling old jokes from the first ""Ghostbusters"" and from other movies, instead of creating new ones.
