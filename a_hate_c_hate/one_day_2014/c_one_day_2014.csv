"Feb 15, 2024",positive," 15 years since David Nicholl’s book became a mega hit, and 13 years since the less great film version, we’re now treated to televisual epic of an adaptation. In a move closer to the book, each episode focuses on one of the chapters – one day in the lives of Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) over the course of two decades. A bittersweet exploration of love, loss and longing.  The story of a community of women in 1980s post-punk London who met doing art, music, politics and sex, and how they went on to change their world by becoming artists, performers, musicians and activists. So bloody badass.  There’s nothing to be gained from be clanging in on the current state of MCU, enough – more qualified – voices have done that. All I will say is that The Marvels deserved more love than it got and is one of the more accessible, you don’t *need* to have watched all/any of the other films to enjoy this science fiction romp following three super women (Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani) as they team up to save the universe.  While caring for her brother along with her audacious mother (Laura Linney), a teenager (Nico Parker) strikes up a friendship with an eccentric activist (Woody Harrelson) who is protesting one of the most landmark medical cases of all time. A really charming coming-of-age story made all the more heart-rendering considering this is writer-director Laura Chinn‘s fictional account of her life in the early 2000s as a Florida teen with a severely ill older brother. Arriving to Prime Video with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 74% freshness, an infuriatingly and unjustly infrequent high score for a 21st Century romcom, should suggest to you that this is one to check out asap. When Ana (Camila Mendes) is upgraded to first class on a work trip, she meets handsome Will (Archie Renaux), who mistakes her for her boss (Marisa Tomei). The white lie that sets off a glamorous chain of events, romance, and opportunity, until her fib threatens to surface."
"Feb 14, 2024",positive,Lone Scherfig navigates the ebb and flow of Dexter and Emma’s relationship with a sure hand. 
"Oct 27, 2020",negative,"Unfortunately the end result is a half-baked, virtually humourless, romantic muddle that doesn't do the much-loved book justice."
"Sep 18, 2020",negative,"Anne Hathaway is uneven, overwrought, and frequently butchers the British accent as Emma."
"Jan 28, 2019",negative," July 15, 1988.  After a meet cute on the night of their college graduation, Emma and Dexter begin a lifelong friendship, spanning over two decades and different countries. Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a middle-class bookish with a more realistic and at times pessimistic outlook on life.  Dexter (Jim Sturgess) is a charmer from a wealthy family who could be anything he wants to be.  Every July 15 we’re shown snapshots of their lives – aspiration, career, love, loss, divorce, death – together and apart. Hathaway fits the role of Emma, although it takes getting used to her British accent.  While we get to see Dexter’s side with his family, we do not get the same benefit with Emma.  With booze and drugs and women, the character of Dexter isn’t likeable; it is to Sturgess’ fine performance and boyish charm that he’s very much tolerable. While Emma’s fashion sense and inner confidence blossom, it’s actually Dexter that we see the evolution the most. The weary, older Dexter in the later part of 2000s is a world apart from the fresh-faced, eager Dex when he first appears. There are adorable and tear-jerker moments for sure.  The first July 15 carries great promise of what’s to come.  Although when part of the ending reveals the last half of their first day together, it’s hard to believe that they would decide to remain just friends.  The flirtatious French jaunt earlier in the years is fun and the later reunion an emotional one. Based on a novel written by David Nicholls, the story does not translate well onto the screen.  As the years progress, we see changes in Emma and Dexter and their surroundings, but it feels like the scenes are merely events moving along through the motion. In attempt to fit in as many years as possible, the result is almost like being read narratives about what they do.  Instead of delving deeper into certain segments of their lives, investing in the characters and connecting more with their relationships in the process, the film inexplicably leaves pivotal milestones offscreen. The execution makes it nearly devoid of what makes a story interesting; the build-up, character and relationship development, and payoff.  The last third act leading to the ending is very anti-climatic.  And the ending appears to be out of nowhere, aiming for a shock value.  It’s a shame for a story that has so much potentials to be a classic like “The Notebook.” Nathalia Aryani is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved film critic (rottentomatoes.com/critic/nathalia-aryani).

"Jan 8, 2019",neutral," It’s a common cliche of both romantic comedies and romantic dramas: The one you’re meant to be with might be the friend you’ve taken for granted all along. Unfortunately, that’s not the only well-worn trope used in “One Day,” though it is indeed a rare film: one made by a talented director and clever writer with two beguiling actors that isn’t particularly engaging. Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) spend their first day together on July 15, 1988. The two Brits graduated the day before from the University of Edinburgh, and after an evening of drinking with friends, go home together. A clumsy attempt at going to bed follows and the pair decide to be just friends. But relations between a man and a woman are rarely that uncomplicated — especially when one begins the friendship with feelings for the other.
  It’s easy to see why Emma falls in love. Dexter — and the man who plays him — is incredibly charming at first, with an easy confidence that still allows him to poke fun at his privilege. But it doesn’t last. As Dexter succumbs to the drugs and girls that come with fame, he gets more and more obnoxious. By the time it appears that these two might finally get together — after a marriage, a childbirth, and a divorce — you can’t possibly understand why she’d still want to.
  It’s not the fault of Sturgess or Hathaway, who are as appealing as ever. We’re meant to see Emma and Dexter as opposites who attract, yet we learn nothing about Emma’s family or formative years. We just know, from the odd joke, that her people don’t have as much money as Dexter’s. These characters lack depth, which makes it hard to credit their transformation.
  Screenwriter David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, also wrote the likable comedy “Starter for Ten.” Director Lone Scherfig made the intelligent drama “An Education.” Let’s hope “One Day” is just a single aberration in two capable careers.

"Nov 15, 2018",positive," Film critics can be such heartless bastards at times. I’ve read many assassinations of One Day (2011) in the last 24-hours, and although I expected lots of whining and over-intellectualised prose, I was hoping Lone Scherfig’s follow up to An Education (2009) would have gained more favourable reviews.I have one simple rule when it comes to critiquing other people’s work: if you make me cry, then you have achieved something remarkable. Laughs are ten-a-penny and thought-provocation is no great shakes, but if you can stir-up someone’s emotions and get the tears flowing freely then your creation is worth a damn. For the last 20-minutes of One Day, I was a weeping wreck. Some reviewers have expressed anger and claimed they felt manipulated into caring about the protagonists, but I find that perspective ridiculous. All good cinema manipulates the emotions and it’s snobbish and pompous to slate a film  just because it’s not a masterpiece of acting and direction. Based on David Nicholls’ bestseller, One Day is the tale of Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), two students that spend the night together after their college graduation and become friends. Each year, on the same date for the next twenty years, we revisit Dexter and Emma to see where they are in their respective lives. Sometimes they are together on that day and sometimes they are not. Cue lots of heartache, broken relationships, life lessons and longing looks. Essentially, One Day is your standard Hollywood romance for the thirty-something generation. The soundtrack of the film is the soundtrack of my youth, with everything from Primal Scream, Tears for Fears and Tricky making a welcome appearance. Anne Hathaway’s accent is somewhere between Jane Horrocks and the resident of an obscure Irish village, but she’s pretty, solid and once again stakes her claim to being one of the most endearing and watchable actresses around. Jim Sturgess has never really impressed for me, but he does show glimpses that he is capable of more, though many will find his character to be a little too odious to care about. Give the man a chance and I’m sure he will win you round. The pacing of One Day is sadly not what it could be. Some years get more screentime than others, and those that dealt with Dexter’s fame and substance issues could have been fleshed out. As for the couple’s chemistry, I found the relationship to be totally believable, but I can appreciate that there are those who won’t buy it. I recognised my own experiences and romantic history on screen and I have no doubt that is why I became so emotionally invested; but for me, that is another sign of greatness. Lone Scherfig is doing little more than using the characters as a mirror to the audience. If you’ve ever been in love, then your mind will drift to that person which creates a powerful cocktail of real and on-screen sentiment. All great love stories have that power. The likes of Ghost (1990) and The Notebook (2004) will never be at the top of any ‘greatest films of all time’ list, but they will be watched and re-watched for decades to come because people like to be reminded that romance isn’t yet dead. One Day will be playing in living rooms to the sound of sniffles and crumpled chocolate wrappers for many years to come and that, for me, is worth applauding."

"Feb 28, 2013",positive," For everyone who’s grown tired of the summer onslaught of superheroes, save-the-world plots and explosions, Hollywood finally offers some decent counter-programming in the form of the brainy romance One Day. Based on the novel of the same name by British writer David Nicholls and adapted by the author, the film introduces us to two people in their early 20s who are about to spend July 15, 1988 – the night and day after their university graduation – together. Bookish Emma (Anne Hathaway) possesses a caustic wit that masks a deep insecurity as well as a schoolgirl crush on rich boy Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who radiates self-confidence and the surety that he’s going places in life because no one’s ever told him no. She wants to be a writer, and he wants to be famous. The two forge a connection despite their many differences and thus begins a close and often times combative friendship that flirts with true love. From there on, the movie looks in on Emma and Dexter on every subsequent July 15, from 1989 through to the present day, taking us through 20 years of July 15ths – St. Swithin’s Day in England- offering a series of snapshot portraits of two often separate lives, from young adulthood to early middle age. We see Emma grow in confidence, just as Dex’s self-esteem takes a hit with the failing health of his mother (the radiant Patricia Clarkson) and his fading television career. From year to year, we also get to observe how their life and relationship choices, both sensible and foolish, leave lasting impressions on each of them and inform their bond with one another, as July 15 becomes the most important day in both their lives. Danish-born director Lone Scherfig has tread these waters before, namely with her spot-on portrayal of keening adolescent love in 2009’s Oscar-nominated An Education. With One Day, she continues her track record of sure and insightful direction by including accent notes in the story that quietly release the pent-up power of a relationship that grows and strengthens over time without relying on typical Hollywood histrionics or rain-soaked declarations of love. This is a movie about a life that happens while you’re busy making other plans and even despite the star-crossed lovers undertones; the central relationship feels surprisingly real. Hathaway and Sturgess have an undeniably lovely chemistry both as friends and lovers, and despite the fact that Hathaway’s accent takes a tour across the British Isles, they both do well with the material, infusing their realistically flawed characters with charm and relatability. The supporting cast is also a treat to watch: Clarkson plays Dex’s doting mother with grace and humour, while Romola Garai (Atonement) and Rafe Spall (Shaun of the Dead) take on the thankless roles of the significant others that are not meant to be and elevate the limited screen time they’re given. On the downside, some may find the rapid passage of time and frequent scene changes jarring and too quick to really settle in with the characters on a truly deep level. Checking in with Emma and Dex just once a year could have easily been a momentum killer and yes, occasionally certain scenes will leave you wanting a just little bit more. Ultimately though, the gimmick works because the actors sell it. They will you to believe in them and in Emma and Dex’s troubled yet transformative relationship.  It’s a simple story that feels like a sweeping romance and that’s enough to make One Day well worth two hours at the cinema this weekend."
"Jan 14, 2013",neutral," Not a lot of love affairs, real or cinematic, can have it said of them that they end better than they begin.  But “One Day” ends with a heartfelt flourish that was sorely missing from its first 90 minutes. This episodic romance works in fits and starts, and captures a bittersweet faux British turn by Anne Hathaway, plainly mismatched in being paired with real-life Brit Jim Sturgess. The conceit in novelist-screenwriter David Nicholls’ tale — two friends drunkenly tumble into bed on the night of their graduation from college. But nothing happens — so they say. He’s game, then she’s game, then he isn’t. So they talk, instead. Since they are both Brits, they note the date — July 15,  Saint  Swithun’s Day.  The book and film catch up with them over the years as they catch up with each other on Saint Swithun’s Day. Emma (Hathaway) settles into a waitress job at a Mexican restaurant, resisting the overtures of the clumsy would-be-comic Ian (Rafe Spall). Dex (Sturgess) takes on the guise of the “one that got away” and who keeps getting away. He travels. He lands TV host jobs. And over the course of the next 18 years, they do-si-do around the idea that they should be together. He flails about through fame, then infamy, shallow affairs and addictions, and she “settles” — letting her low self-esteem hem her into a life of quiet doe-eyed desperation. The banter is pleasant enough, but there’s a funereal air hanging over the would-be affair. Her routine settles in — “Head home, cup’o tea, weep.” He’s meant to build her up, save her. “You can’t throw away your life just because you think it’s funny.” But there’s just no magic in any of this. For a movie seemingly designed to have this wistful, romantic arc to it, “One Day” never quite reaches that opening “meet cute” moment. She reads the popular novels of the day (“Unbearable Lightness of Being” at one point), and he pleads with her to “be spontaneous,” never once suggesting that he’s the sort of chap she’d want to be spontaneous with. Hathaway is an old hand at British accents and is convincingly demure, uptight and English. Patricia Clarkson, playing Dex’s mom, doesn’t have to play the first two and fails at the third — a rare off-key off-accent performance for her. It’s a frustrating film, never light enough on its feet to be cute, never heartfelt enough to achieve “You had me at ‘Hello.’” Lone Scherfig (“An Education”) can’t find the pulse of this story, the romance. It’s a British adult version of “Flipped” in which the guy doesn’t seem self-aware enough to realize in any decent interval of time how special the girl is and how he should stop letting her down. Dex and Emma have their ups and downs, but it’s never obvious why she carries a torch for this guy after she’s aged out of her girlish “He’s so handsome” attraction. That results in a romance that is wistful, half-hearted and melancholy, a love affair without the spark that ignites such love affairs. And if we can’t root for the couple, what is the point of the couple?"
"Sep 28, 2012",negative,"  In the positives column, Rafe Spall is a great addition as luckless comedian Ian, managing  the tricky task of making some who isn't funny appear funny, and Ken Stott brings the required gravitas as Dexter's dad (how he landed Patricia Clarkson as a wife is a gag that translates well from page to screen). There are a number of wonderful character moments not from the book that raise a smile (Emma's awkward cartwheel on the beach, Dexter's cringeworthy interview with a bunch of rappers, Tilly Killick's karaoke) but One Day is largely a faithful and surprise-free adaptation of the source material.  Surprise free apart from 'that bit', obviously. Which is just as gut-wrenching and completely fucking horrible as you expect. But then, I'm coming pre-loaded with 20 years' worth of back-story, which I shouldn't let affect my judgement. Hathaway and Sturgess obviously enjoy an easy chemistry and the time-skipping format does at least keep the pace zippy, albeit at the cost of some of the more character-building moments (Dexter's letters, Emma's school affair etc). Determined to get another point of view, I texted a friend who also saw One Day and asked her what she thought. Her response was as follows:  Well, there you have it, it wasn't just me. Maybe two stars is stingy: add a star if you haven't already read the book. But then, you could just read the book. Yeah, definitely do that. But don't say I didn't warn you. "
"Dec 22, 2011",neutral," An average romantic dramedy, ""One Day"" tips its hand so early in
the game that you won't be a bit surprised by anything that
ensues. Anne Hathaway stars as Emma, who graduates from college the same
day as Dex (Jim Sturgess, ""Across the Universe""). That day happens
to be July 15, 1988, (St. Swithin's Day, which is observed in
England) and that's when we see the couple in succeeding years. Their awkward beginning forms the basis for a lengthy
friendship. He comes from an aristocratic family (mom is played by
the always-enjoyable Patricia Clarkson), and he figures he's bound
for something great. Emma, who lacks confidence, doesn't share his
aspirations. She ends up working in a Mexican restaurant, although she would
rather be a writer. Dex becomes a late-night TV show host, hooked
on cocaine and drink into which the fast lane has propelled him.
Still, the two seek comfort in each other, particularly on July 15,
during their annual meeting as best friends. They encourage each other through bad choices in intimate
partners and through good choices that steer their lives toward the
better. They also help each other deal with losses. In other words,
they continue to be in each others' lives as they mature and just
plain grow up, taking responsibility for their lives and for
teaching each other lessons. Hathaway, as always, is gorgeous to watch. She always radiates a
genuineness that is so engaging that you won't mind the fact her
British accent isn't always on the mark. Sturgess is fine as Dex,
who comes off more and more as a spoiled cad who doesn't think much
about tomorrow or, for that matter, planning the next hour or
so. Some of this is fun to watch, particularly when the two are
feeling romantic toward each other, although neither will confess
the feelings they have. There is chemistry at work between these
two nice-looking leads. And the European settings are as luminous
as the two stars are striking, which makes for some beautiful,
eye-catching moments. But the movie, which occasionally moves back and forth in time,
is so easy to predict that you may feel let down at the end. It's not a bad movie. It's just not a particularly memorable
one. If you want to see this theme played out in a way that will
make you laugh and cry, watch the classic ""Same Time, Next Year,""
with Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn. That is a movie to remember."
"Dec 7, 2011",negative," It should have been a match made in heaven. Teaming up the stars of two of the more avant-garde and risque romantic movies for the past few years – Love and Other Drugs and Across the Universe – with a Danish director who had already made an acclaimed, period-set literary adaptation. Unfortunately the end result is a half-baked, virtually humourless, romantic muddle that doesn’t do the much-loved book justice. A cross between When Harry Met Sally (can they ever really just be friends?) and 500 Days of Summer (a distillation of a relationship’s falls and rises), One Day lacks the former’s wit and the latter’s invention. Part of the problem is that there’s little chemistry between the leads and the story’s brief running time and episodic nature doesn’t help that. Sturgess can’t transcend the fact that Dexter is basically an upper-class prat, while Hathaway just struggles with the accent and a terribly underwritten character. Scherfig tries to enliven proceedings with clever Teachers-esque titles and a soundtrack that includes everyone from Tracey Chapman to Tears for Fears and Del Amitri to Fat Boy Slim, but you can’t help feeling this dreary tale could have done with a bit of fancy editing or narrative reconstruction."
"Dec 1, 2011",positive," The most entertaining and engrossing romantic film to hit theaters in ages, One Day details the comings and goings of platonic friends Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) over a period of about two decades - with the movie catching up with the pair on the same day once a year. It's a decidedly unusual premise that's employed to consistently enthralling effect by filmmaker Lone Scherfig, as the director, working from David Nicholls' script, deftly transforms Emma and Dexter into likable, engaging figures right from the get-go - which, in effect, does force the viewer to immediately sympathize with and root for the would-be couple's ongoing exploits. The palpable chemistry between Hathaway and Sturgess undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in the movie's success, and there's little doubt that the episodic nature of the narrative, which admittedly does take some getting used to, ultimately proves instrumental in cultivating a remarkably complete picture of the ups and downs in the protagonists' lives. By the time the unabashedly tear-jerking finale rolls around, One Day has certainly established itself as an uncommonly captivating, thoroughly moving romance that stands among the best that the genre has to offer. Based on a novel by Lissa Evans, Their Finest follows several WWII-era filmmakers as they attempt produce a morale-booasting propaganda picture - with their efforts consistently (and predictably) confounded by a series of frustrating complications. It's immediately clear that filmmaker Lone Scherfig, along with scripter Gaby Chiappe, isn't looking to cultivate an atmosphere of subtlety here, as Their Finest, from its opening minutes, has been suffused with an overly polished feel that's been geared towards the lowest common denominator - with Scherfig's increasingly desperate efforts at cultivating a feel-good vibe growing more and more unpleasant (and distracting) as time progresses. There's little doubt, too, that the movie's wholly uninvolving nature is compounded by a series of bland lead performances, with, especially, Gemma Arterton and Sam Claflin unable to infuse their respectively one-dimensional characters with anything even resembling energy or charisma. (It's a situation that's compounded by a third-act emphasis on the pair's almost hilariously lifeless romance.) And while some of the behind-the-scenes stuff on the film shoot is admittedly interesting, Their Finest's total lack of momentum results in a narrative that lurches from one dull, padded-out set-piece to the next - which ensures that Scherfig's eventual efforts at transforming the movie into a full-fledged tearjerker fall hopelessly flat. It's ultimately difficult to envision a less effective treatment of somewhat promising material, with Scherfig's slick, by-the-numbers approach inevitably rendering the movie's few positive attributes utterly moot (eg a  typically charismatic performance by Bill Nighy)."
"Sep 18, 2011",negative," Lone Scherfig (most recently known for directing An Education) with this adaptation of the successful romantic novel of the same name, brings to life a tale of two people that is told by checking in on them on July 15 every year through two decades. Starting in 1988 with their graduation from university in Edinburgh, we follow idealistic Emma (Hathaway) and the charming Dexter (Sturgess), who get acquainted on graduation day and begin a friendship that follows them through the decades. As the years roll by, we see them in various situations, but always held together by the connection they share. Perhaps some things just do not translate to the big screen, or perhaps the slightly new narrative twists (added by author David Nicholls, who also wrote the script) were one modification too far, but One Day lacks the emotional impact the book was famous for. The leads work well together but are held back by cheap sentimentalism when we should be on a journey with the characters. Opting to lend more from ""weepies"" gone by than the source material, Scherfig still manages to evoke a lump in the throat by the end. Still, this story of two lives intertwined should be far more powerful than it is."
"Sep 16, 2011",negative,"Such a simple and small premise would and should yield a simple and small movie -- something not so heavy and epic, but more lovely and amazing."
"Sep 8, 2011",positive,Sherfig's visual knack is better than she realizes; she should stop dressing it up within an inch of its life.
"Sep 2, 2011",positive," Same time next year: Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess play friends whose rocky relationship is revisited on the same day each year in One Day. Those who were enchanted by the novel storytelling structure in the 2009 romance 500 Days of Summer (where moments throughout the 500-day lifespan of a relationship are randomly accessed) should find the device employed here similarly engaging. After hooking up on graduation day in the late 1980s, young Brits Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) embark on a life-long friendship, the progress of which is chronicled on the same day each year. Despite the story’s episodic, stop-start framework it's a surprisingly smooth, well-sculpted journey as the status of their parallel lives - full of dashed dreams, personal disappointments, career derailments, family entanglements and relationship adventures - are continually refreshed every few minutes. With the cohesive nature of the narrative no doubt the result of David Nicholls adapting his own novel, Danish director Lone Scherfig (An Education) deliberately veers away from comedy to deliver a surprisingly earthy, soulful romance. Warmly recommended as a thoughtful date movie for the mature-minded. General."
"Sep 2, 2011",negative,"It's a profoundly moving book. Still, the movie is strangely remote, and straining for tears."
"Sep 2, 2011",negative,"A frothy cappuccino of a film with lots of tears, quivering lips and cathartic embraces and little substance."
"Sep 2, 2011",positive,"It doesn't quite deliver on its promise, but this remains a witty, touching and largely enjoyable adaptation."
"Sep 2, 2011",negative,"What should've been an epic romance, a challenger to The Notebook, becomes a melancholy, disconnected drama, despite the talent on display."
"Sep 2, 2011",negative,"The most desperate, cloying weepie seen in many a long time."
"Sep 2, 2011",positive," Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by the same writer, David Nicholls, don’t be surprised to see quotes like “this decade’s The Notebook” plastered left, right and centre on post­ers for One Day, but per­haps surprisingly, it is ac­tually quite entertaining. After spending the night together on gradua­tion night at college, thus starts a romance that spans more than a decade, following Emma (Hatha­way) and Dexter (Stur­gess) year on year as they fall into and out of each other’s lives. Even when it seems most unlikely, how­ever, a powerful love in their heart always keeps the pair seemingly des­tined for one another. One Day is a stand­ard chick-flick, front and centre, but only checking in with the pair on the same day each year, it feels different to the usual big city, glamorous tale. Pulling away from feel­ing utterly clichéd (and far out-doing the terrible trailer), One Day develops nicely and it’s pleasing it takes so long for the cen­tral couple to eventually get together, spreading the emotional weight out over the whole film. While at the start Anne Hathaway’s English accent is a little suspect, she soon grows into it, and as ever, it’s hard not to find the talented ac­tress utterly absorbing. If you’re looking for a deep­er meaning, you won’t find it, but Jim Sturgess is likeable too, and you quickly grow to root for the both of them.

"Aug 31, 2011",positive,"There's not really a chance to go very deep here, but the two leads are so strong that they make us believe in them anyway."
"Aug 31, 2011",positive," Is Danish director Lone Scherfig creating a new genre of revisionist romantic films? Her three English-language films on the surface all appear to be mainstream romantic dramas with their soft-lighting, seductive soundtracks, appealing characters and warm ambiance. However, underneath the boy-meets-girl narratives are challenging and uncomfortable themes that seem designed to deliberately undermine romantic conventions. Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself (2002) is about suicide, An Education (2009) is about a relationship between a teenage girl and an older man with dubious motives, and now One Day is about missed opportunities and failing to embrace the moment. Even Scherfig’s break-through film Italian for Beginners (2000), made under the stylistic restrictions of the Dogme 95 movement, features a lot of grief and death amid the various romantic storylines. While One Day is Scherfig’s least accomplished film, it still contains what is becoming her trademark blend of enticing film style and dark thematic undercurrents, resulting in a film that is both romantic and unsettling. Adapted by And When Did You Last See Your Father? scriptwriter David Nicholls from his own 2009 novel, One Day is intriguingly structured. It tells the story of its two protagonists across twenty years by only depicting events that occur each year on 15 July. Inevitably some of the events that occur on that day are conveniently of monumental importance, but mostly the days are used to provide an impression of how the characters have progressed, or failed to progress, twelve months on from when we last saw them. This extreme elliptical device does result in two decades flying by very quickly. While the novel presumably dwelt on the significance of each day with more depth, in the film it does feel more like a series of snapshots designed to simply flag where we are at in the narrative. The two protagonists are Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who have an awkward encounter early in the morning on 15 July 2010 after their graduation and then spend the next twenty years navigating their resulting friendship. They are obviously attracted to each other sexually and romantically, but as One Day is a drama and not a screwball comedy, the audience are left uncertain if they will ever move out of the friend’s zone. A major problem with One Day is it struggles to maintain interest in whether or not this will happen, due to the unevenness of character development and presentation. An immense amount of sympathy is established early on for shy and low self-esteemed Emma. On the other hand, Dexter comes across as obnoxious and self-absorbed and it’s difficult to see what Emma likes in him even as a friend. Scherfig knows how to make an audience empathise with theoretically dislikeable characters, as she demonstrated with the Lars Kaalund character in Italian for Beginners, but Dexter doesn’t have enough depth to make the audience care about what happens to him. Dexter’s flaws should make him the more interesting character but he’s not. Meanwhile Emma is largely reduced to his object of desire. And yet, despite the patchiness (including an out-of-place Meet the Parents sequence involving a family game gone wrong) and the heavily signposted and melodramatic plot points, One Day concludes magnificently. The final scenes in the film significantly redeem a lot of what had come previously and distinguish it as a Lone Scherfig film rather than a slightly above average romance with a quirky approach to narrative. By colliding the past and the present through editing, Scherfig fills in a lot of the gaps about why Emma and Dexter continued to be in each other’s lives and how that will resonate in the future. By doing so, Scherfig does what she does best – slyly subverts the romance genre. The sting in the tail is that One Day is not a film about the whims of fate, but a film about the disappointments and regrets that result from not acting on opportunities when they are presented and being blind to what is around you. It’s about squandering good fortune, wasting life pursuing trivialities, settling for second best and the cruelty of self-realisation coming later in life when it is needed much earlier. There are some beautiful moments in the final fifteen minutes or so of One Day, giving it a brilliantly melancholic resolution to an otherwise mild film. Great Review! Sturgess and Hathaway are fun to watch together, but the rest of the film just feels like a gimmick that was done wrong, and brings nothing new at all to the conventions of the romantic drama. I saw this film last night here in South Florida.  The reviews (and viewer comments) here have been pretty bad, but I hadn’t seen them prior to the screening.  This film is getting an undeservedly bad rap, for some reason.  Maybe it’s because we’ve had so many romantic comedies here this past summer (in the northern hemisphere)–Friends with Benefits,  Crazy Stupid Love—  that people aren’t ready for blunt realism, albeit with lighter scenes as well.  It succeeded in encompassing the twenty years, even though critics didn’t like the device.  It’s not only a film about lost opportunities, but also about succumbing to what’s most easily available, even though that might be a bad idea.  There are powerful scenes here.  As you observe, the final fifteen minutes are very moving and redeeming, and showed that the director actually crafted the previous 90 minutes rather well. I thought the performances of the leads were excellent.  I also liked Sturgess in Across the Universe,  another doomed film here.  The films I like never make money.  Hathaway also did very well in Brokeback Mountain,  an exception to the money rule. I share you sentiments Tom. I had a number of problems with this film, but I still found a lot to admire. I would certainly sit through it a dozen more times rather than suffer through Friends with Benefits ever again! While we are talking about great Anne Hathaway films, make sure you check out Rachel Getting Married if you haven’t already. It’s an incredible film and she is fantastic in it. Thanks so much for recommending Rachel Getting Married. The reason I value your reviews is because, as you observe, when I like a film I’d rather see it again, instead of seeing something that isn’t up to par.  I began doing this quite by accident when I was comparing screenings of the digital v. celluloid versons of films (digital was the winner) and was surprised at how much I enjoyed seeing them again for their artistic merit. I enjoyed the review I saw on Box Office Punch Up, I think it was nice to see how the film compared to the book. I thought the film was distinctly average myself but my friend adored it!"

This means that you will become the official legal registrant. 3. Congratulations!You are now the proud owner. We can assist you in transferring the domain to a domain name registrar of your choice, giving you the freedom to manage and develop it according to your preferences. Short and Memorable: Premium domains are often shorter and easier to remember than regular domains. This can make them more attractive to businesses or individuals looking to establish a strong online presence. High Search Volume: Premium domains often receive a high volume of search traffic due to their popularity and relevance to certain industries or niches. This makes them more valuable for SEO purposes. Brand Recognition: Premium domains may already have a recognizable brand associated with them, making them more valuable to businesses or individuals looking to establish a brand identity. Limited Supply: Premium domains are limited in supply, and once they are registered, they may not be available again for a long time, if ever. This makes them more valuable due to their scarcity. While the cost may be higher initially, the potential benefits of owning a premium domain can far outweigh the price paid in the long run. Not all domain names are created equally. We have a wide selection of domain names. From 2 words exact match domains to ultra-premium single-worded domains. We get hundreds of emails enquiring about our domains. We regularly receive offers of between £10 – £500. It’s worth noting that we would never consider selling any of our premium domains within that price range. If you pay the full amount at the time of purchase, the ownership of the domain name will usually be transferred to you within an hour. However, if the purchase is made outside of business hours, the transfer will take place on the following day. If you opt for installment payments, you can use the domain name from the first payment, but you will not have full ownership until the final payment is made. Yes, when paying in full, we utilise a UK-based company to facilitate the transaction process. The method employed is known as an Escrow service, which involves a neutral third party holding the payment. This approach safeguards both parties involved in the transaction. It ensures that the domain name is transferred to the buyer only after payment has been made, and that the seller receives payment only after transferring ownership of the domain name. Escrow payments for domain names are commonly used in scenarios where the buyer and seller may not be well-acquainted or when the transaction concerns a high-value domain name. If you are planning to use your new premium domain on your existing website, it requires a few changes. It is a relatively easy process but every scenario is different and a lot depends on your level of knowledge. These are created once the domain is hosted with your domain registrar and or hosting company. They charge a fee for hosting email accounts and websites. There are many companies to choose from, for these types of services. This gives your business a more professional image compared to using a generic email address such as Hotmail. However, some web hosting companies may impose limits on the number of email accounts you can create per domain and may charge additional fees for extra accounts. UltraCulture.co.uk serves as a fantastic domain name for a multitude of reasons. To begin with, its brevity and catchiness make it perfect for any brand or enterprise. The straightforward nature of this domain name also ensures that it is a breeze to type and circulate, thereby boosting its recognition and recall value.
Moreover, premium domain names are in high demand, and they can significantly increase the value of a brand. Premium domain names exude a sense of reliability, authority, and sophistication, which are essential factors in cultivating confidence among customers or clients.
Additionally, a first-rate domain name such as UltraCulture.co.uk can elevate your brand or business above the sea of competition, leaving an indelible mark on prospective customers or clients. This aspect is particularly crucial in sectors where competition is fierce.
In summary, a snappy, unforgettable domain name like UltraCulture.co.uk can prove to be an incredibly potent instrument in establishing a robust online presence and nurturing your brand. By investing in an easy-to-remember and user-friendly domain name, you can enhance your visibility, cultivate brand recognition, and assert your authority within your industry."
"Aug 30, 2011",positive,"You are hereby advised to ignore the bad reviews and check out this fairly stunning meditation on life, love, and friendship."
"Aug 28, 2011",negative," This disappointing film, adapted by David Nicholls from his truthful, highly entertaining novel first published in 2009, covers some 16 years in the life of Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway), a working-class bluestocking educated at a Yorkshire comprehensive, and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess), a handsome upper-middle-class Wykehamist. They spend an intimate, sexually unconsummated night together after graduation from the University of Edinburgh in 1988, and subsequently they meet or correspond annually on its anniversary, the numinous St Swithin's Day, 15 July. He's socially confident but shallow and intellectually insecure, and graduated with a 2:2 in anthropology. She's socially insecure but intellectually assured, politically alert and principled, and got a double first in English and anthropology. Dexter rises rapidly in schlock, ""yoof TV"" and then sinks in a sea of booze and a haze of cocaine. She drifts (amusingly for us) into a variety of odd jobs before teaching, and then finds herself as the author of children's books. We wonder what attracts a smart, wisecracking girl to such a dislikable man, but then such affairs do occur, and there are intimations that this worm is going to develop some backbone. Reading the novel one becomes aware of the films it resembles. Like Same Time, Next Year the characters agree to meet annually while living separate lives. Like When Harry Met Sally they affect to believe that sexual intimacy is the enemy of true friendship and draw up a code of practice to support this ethic. Like The Way We Were, a couple from different backgrounds and with contrasting temperaments and sensibilities live through turbulent times, their private lives reflecting public events. Like Love Story there's an underlying threat of a cruel fate about to scupper the lives of this mismatched yet oddly yoked pair. The novel compares more than favourably in wit, sophistication and social insight with these movies. The film version, however, is much like them: thin, superficial and sentimental. Its Danish director Lone Scherfig, who seemed confidently at home swimming in the currents of class-conscious Britain while making An Education, is here thrashing around in the un-nuanced shallow end. The casting and direction of the beautiful Anne Hathaway as the pretty, bespectacled, determined Emma, a sort of Yorkshire cross between Dorothy Parker and Mary McCarthy, borders on the disastrous. Her accent is all over the map. The best that can be said is that she sometimes resembles the youthful Maureen Lipman, herself from Yorkshire, at times bespectacled and possessed of fine comic timing, but who here appears to be rehearsing her repertoire of regional accents."

"Aug 26, 2011",negative,Mawkish romance.
"Aug 26, 2011",positive,Even the hardest-hearted will surely shed a tear.
"Aug 26, 2011",positive," The pair decide to keep things platonic, but then elect to meet annually on the same day. Over 20 years they share tears, laughter and give each other shoulders to cry on as life throws up a series of curveballs. It's clear from the off that Emma fancies the pants off Dexter, but he's more interested in sleeping around. In fact, the characters couldn't be more different. She's a gawky but down-to-earth girl who dreams of becoming a published writer but finds herself stuck in a dead-end restaurant job. He's a cocksure charmer who becomes a TV presenter with severe drink and drug problems. Exploring the familiar problems of finding The One and your place in the world, the achingly middle-class tone is very similar to the old TV series Cold Feet, also written by Nicholls. The one problem - and it's a big one - is that you never get the sense that Emma and Dexter were made for one another. It's hard to buy into them even as friends since they have so little in common. This means that - and I'm not giving anything away here - come their inevitable tryst, it just seems plain wrong. I just don't like you anymore."" BEST BIT: Rafe Spall is great as Emma's boyfriend. WORST BIT: Flat chemistry between the leads. IF YOU LIKED..."

AND so finally, it arrives on the big screen. One Day has been described as the romance of the current century, so it’s little surprise the film adaptation has been one of the eagerly anticipated films of the year. Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess take the leads as bookish Yorkshire lass Emma Morley and charming ladies’ man Dexter Mayhew, who have a drunken encounter on their graduation on St Swithin’s Day in 1988, and make a pact to remain friends. “When I sleep with someone, I either end up crying or weeping. We might bump into each other in the future. We’ll just be friends,” remarks Em, after a lame attempt at seducing Dexter, to which he replies: “Let’s keep in touch.” True to their words, the two friends do stay in touch throughout the next few years, as Dex travels around the world while Emma slaves away in a Mexican restaurant in London. Their friendship, revisited on July 15 across the years, is tested, first in 1992, when they decide on a spontaneous whim to go away on holiday together. Despite the friends working in London – Dex channelling a young Jonathan Ross as his TV career hits a peak, where he steals the crown as the ‘king of car-crash TV’, while Em, who is now dating stand-up comic Ian (Rafe Spall), trains as a teacher – they often lose touch before reconnecting again. Unsurprisingly, the film, directed by An Education’s Lone Scherfig with a script by the beloved book’s author David Nicholls, rushes through the characters’ lives over 20 years, as they deal with the joys and heartbreaks of life. Hathaway – who has been described as too ‘glamorous’ for the part – does a pretty good job, although she switches between Yorkshire and London accents, with her American twang slipping out in certain scenes. Although Spall steals the show as Ian, the other characters, such as Romola Garai as Dex’s wife Sylvie and Patricia Clarkson as his mother, feel largely underused."
"Aug 26, 2011",negative,"If middle-class existentialism is not your cup of tea, no amount of charm and nineties' fashion is going to save this film from seeming pomp."
"Aug 26, 2011",positive," Lone Scherfig’s One Day is another on that increasingly frustrating list of movies that I liked, but wanted to love and didn’t quite. Oh, I think it’s certainly a good film—a good film that Focus Features has killed any chances for success by releasing it on too many screens at once—but it ought to have been a great one. Having spent two days trying to figure out why it doesn’t quite work, the best I can come up with is to blame everyone. By this, I mean that the writer, the director and the stars are all slightly at fault. No single one of them does anything that by itself thwarts the film’s ambitions—the writer comes closest—but each of them contributes enough small missteps that the aggregate becomes impossible to ignore. The premise—and the hook—is simple. Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) spend the night of college graduation—July 15—together and then part. (The story behind that parting isn’t revealed until late in the film). The film then drops in on them—sometimes they’re together, often they’re not—on future July 15ths over a period of 20 years. (People keep thinking this is somehow  like Same Time Next Year and it isn’t in the least.) The idea is that we will learn about the two and, of course, wait for them to realize that they’re not only in love with each other, but are “meant” to be together. Conceptually, that’s both clever and daunting. In execution, it works in broad strokes, but doesn’t—at least for me—have the emotional punch it ought to have, not even when it takes its theoretically surprising turn. It’s hard to fault the acting—and, no, I don’t give a damn whether or not Anne Hathaway has a real Yorkshire accent. Hathaway is as good as the role allows, but there’s only so much that can be done with Emma and the way the character is sketched in. We learn, for example, that she once called Dexter’s father (Ken Stott) a “bourgeois fascist,” but we never learn why, nor—apart from her self-conscious middle-class status—do we get a glimpse of her views that would lead to it. She—and the film—however are very adept at painting a picture of Emma as someone who “settles” for things. She nearly settles for working in a restaurant, she does settle for teaching rather than writing, and she settles for a nice, but terminally dull, boyfriend (Rafe Spall). In many respects, the major thing—despite the screenplay’s insistence on something else—that Dexter does for her is make it hard for her to settle. Dexter himself is a trickier proposition. It takes his mother (Patricia Clarkson) a good while to conclude he’s “no longer a nice person,” and even longer for Emma to decide, “I still love you, Dex, but I don’t like you anymore.” (No, that’s not a spoiler, that’s way before the ending.) It takes the viewer much less time to conclude that Dexter is pretty much a self-absorbed jerk. Jim Sturgess barely manages to skate by the middle sections of the film on his innate likableness, but only barely. The film—and the fact that he looks increasingly battered—rectifies this, but a somewhat sour taste for the narcissistic, spoiled rich boy turned smarmy TV host remains. The worst of it, though, is the facile manner in which everything is tidied up through a single improbable conversation that I can’t reveal here. And then we have another case of a movie that seems to have not one ending, but a series of them. Any one would have been fine, but taken one after another, I ended up feeling like W.C. Fields being subjected to endless choruses of a song in The Old Fashioned Way (1934)—to a point where I nearly muttered, “Oh, you’re really finished this time”—which is not, I’m sure, what was intended. But don’t misunderstand, I did like the movie. I did admire the attempt at something different. And I do think it a shame that it will never have the time to find its audience in the way a limited release might have afforded it. Catch it while you can.

"Aug 26, 2011",neutral," Just about everyone will, at some point or another, have had one of those friendships that could amount to more. The universality of unrequited - or mutual but unacted upon love - is such that anyone who has reached adolescence should find the central premise of Lone Scherfig's latest strike a chord, which is why it is such a shame that the movie as a whole is so emotionally dissatisfying. The will they/won't they pair at the heart of the film are Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess). She is a down-to-earth working-class Yorkshire lass - with glasses, which means she is smart - while he is upper middle-class - with a floppy fringe, which means he is a Hooray Henry who is also smart but is wasting his talents. Both of them, of course, will turn out to have hearts of gold beneath their failings. After a drunken fumble on their 1988 graduation day in Edinburgh that seems to amount to little more than sleepover cuddle rather than sex, the pair go their separate ways vowing to keep in touch. The film then dips in and out of their lives over the next 20 years, catching up with them on a single day each year, taking the temperature of their lives and their friendship. While the idea of charting a long-term relationship via just one day a year may well work perfectly on paper, it's a much trickier concept on film. The choppy nature of the narrative makes it hard to engage with. Some years, for example, are inevitably more interesting than others, meaning that we long to linger with Em and Dex longer than we do, while other years seem to barely further the story at all. The passage of time is also an unwelcome distraction, with some of the fashions seeming to stem from the wrong year altogether - the idea, for example, that Emma would be wearing a full-length under slip in 1988 is nothing short of laughable. In fact, the scenes in 1988 feel more suited to the time period of Scherfig's far-superior An Education, than something from the late Thatcher era. Disbelief is suspended by a thread so fine it is in danger of snapping almost constantly. First you marvel that someone as pretty as Hathaway would be so bereft of boyfriends that she sees the David Walliams-alike sweet but hopeless Ian (Rafe Spall) as the only alternative to Dexter. Then you wonder why on earth they cast Patricia Clarkson to have a stab at an English accent - a brave failure, as is Hathaway's - when there are any number of excellent British thesps who would have been better suited to the role. Finally, you wonder just how many endings it is possible for a film to have before the credits are allowed to roll. Despite this, there are hints of the early Richard Curtis-style sweetness that might have been, if the film's emotions weren't constantly being overwhelmed by its unforgiving structure. Sturgess - channelling Johnny Vaughan - and Hathaway, have convincing chemistry when they are given the opportunity, but the rest of the world they inhabit never feels truly believable. It is clearly striving to say something profound about love and loss but, ultimately, One Day is just too weak."

"Aug 25, 2011",positive," David Nicholls’s One Day is that rare thing – a romantic novel that male readers are drawn to at least as much as women. In an era of great pessimism about the future of books, it’s a work that inspires devotion as much as admiration, that drives its fans to buy multiple copies to give to friends. It’s also an Anglo-American creation that marries a When Harry Met Sally storyline to deeply English material. Adapted by Nicholls himself, its title refers to St Swithin’s Day. That’s when, every year over the course of two decades, Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew, University of Edinburgh students who spent their graduation night together in 1988, meet up, bemoan their love lives, or sigh thoughtfully about how their friendship has developed. Children of the Eighties, of which Nicholls is one, will likely recall Billy Bragg singing: “The Polaroids that hold us together/Will surely fade away/Like the love that we spoke of for ever/On St Swithin’s Day.” Emma is played by Anne Hathaway (Becoming Jane, Brokeback Mountain), an actress who is, as many people have pointed out, An American. It’s a measure of how deeply loved Nicholls’s book is that this piece of casting has been portrayed in some quarters as a kind of treason. The mousy Yorkshire girl who blooms into a successful writer has become “Our Em”. Personally, I would have liked to have seen Rebecca Hall, who was such a revelation as the gauche, bookish undergraduate in Tom Vaughan’s Starter For 10 (2006), from another novel by Nicholls, play Emma. Still, Hathaway has the pale, consumptive look that was so common among students in the Eighties (and may well return in this austere, fees-heavy decade). Her Emma also wears the anti-Brideshead Revisited uniform of the period: wire-rim glasses, clomping big boots, crap denim jackets. She has an anti-nuclear nightshirt and listens to Tracy Chapman records. What would she possibly see in a Winchester-educated yuppie like Dexter (Jim Sturgess)? A man who, after he becomes a well-known chat-show host, is described by one newspaper as “the most annoying man on telly”? It’s a question the film never really asks, yet alone answers. Hathaway’s accent has been widely mocked. Make that accents: she shifts somewhat erratically between the soft-headed Northernisms you might hear in a Victoria Wood comic monologue and the posh Estuaryisms that Renée Zellweger popularised in Bridget Jones’s Diary. This isn’t a major flaw though, and it’s easy to be too harsh; many British people code-switch these days, and Emma, who spends much of her twenties working in a restaurant, would be used to “performing” before diners. The bigger flaw is that neither she nor Dex is able to draw us into their fears, feelings, raptures. Or to suggest that they’re even capable of real emotions. Their hairstyles and outfits change, but they themselves evolve very little. Often, the settings are more charismatic than the leads. Cinematographer Benoît Delhomme captures the dingy artificiality of the Mexican restaurant in London at which Emma works, the dead-aired creepiness of the production studios at which Dexter preens as a buffoonish New Lad in the mould of Chris Evans and Terry Christian, the airy escape Emma finds in Paris. It says something about the lack of spark between the two leads that the most compelling performer, far more so than Patricia Clarkson, miscast as Dexter’s cancer-stricken mother, is Rafe Spall as Ian, a struggling comedian with whom Emma shacks up. A cross between one of the jumbled losers in a Mike Leigh film and the seemingly insipid but actually quite sharp and kindly Steve, Miranda’s husband in Sex and the City, he offers an endless stream of dire gags, ticky gestures and endearing outburst. His confession to Emma – “I think you’re the absolute bollocks” – is the sweetest thing anyone says in the movie. Lone Scherfig, in Italian For Beginners (2000), which she made according to the austere rules of the Danish Dogme 95 movement, and even in her very engaging treatment of Lynn Barber’s memoir An Education (2009), is a director who’s happy to stay away from darkness. The cankering sense of failure and the vertiginous grief that Nicholls relayed so movingly in the novel are absent here, snuffed out perhaps by the film’s episodic structure. What’s left is a pleasant, occasionally amusing, tragically tasteful romantic drama. That’s not an insignificant achievement, but it does create an odd situation in which One Day, the book, is more cinematic than One Day, the movie. It’s a brave director who takes on a film adaptation of a well-loved romantic novel, in particular a publishing phenomenon such as One Day, David Nicholls’ tale of long-delayed love and loss. Viewers who have read the book are wont to have imagined their own preferred versions of the characters, and are ready to pounce angrily on any perceived inauthenticity. In this case, the director Lone Scherfig – who made such a good job of the nuances of Sixties Britain in An Education – might have hoped for some indemnity against criticism by having Nicholls himself as a screenwriter. If so, she had reckoned without the controversy caused by casting Anne Hathaway, the American actress, in the role of Emma Morley, the down-to-earth Yorkshire girl who carries a torch from her university days for posh, troubled Dexter (Jim Sturgess) even as he moves unsteadily through life with all the direction of a car with a broken Sat Nav. Although Hathaway veils her striking prettiness rather well in the earlier scenes, thanks to the Eighties sartorial penance of shapeless clothes, big glasses and Doc Martens, the accent remains a drawback. It veers unpredictably between received pronunciation and ee bah gum, occasionally coming on Yorkshire so strongly that in one scene I thought her character was doing it for a joke. The problem with this, aside from having a disorienting effect upon the audience, is that it thereby fails to nail the novel’s subtle distinctions of class. Dexter is born with the natural sense of entitlement of the upper-middle class, and has a corresponding tendency to be careless with what he’s got; Emma must, according to Yorkshire cliché, pull herself up by her bootstraps. He’s got the charm, and she’s got the character, until they find themselves nearly 20 years on, still craving what the other has. The snapshots of their relationship through the years, of unspoken yearnings and botched signals, are deftly handled, although the shifting eras could have been tackled with greater zest. Yet if Hathaway’s diction sometimes fails her, the look in those liquid brown eyes can still speak volumes. Jim Sturgess, as Dexter, performs the considerable feat of making his character more likeable than in the book. Sturgess has an instinctive quickness as an actor, and here manages to convey both the crassness of Dexter – whose cockiness becomes a coked-up patina of self-loathing as his telly presenting career crashes and burns – and his complicit appeal."

"Aug 25, 2011",positive," David Nicholls's best-selling novel One Day has been given the TV treatment on Netflix, and the new series has been breaking viewers' hearts since its release on the platform last month. One Day tells the will they/won't they, decades-spanning story of two polar opposite students – Emma and Dexter (played by Mod and Woodall respectively) – who meet at university and strike an unlikely friendship that soon becomes something more. If you've already binged the new adaptation, don't worry: there's another version of the devastating story you can watch – the 2011 film adaptation starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. While Woodall and Mod are enjoying career boosts for their portrayals of the romantic leads in the new Netflix series, the 2011 movie didn't quite have the same effect for Hathaway and Sturgess. But why not decide what you think for yourself? Read on for everything you need to know about how to watch One Day, as well as whether it's available to watch on Netflix. The 2011 movie is available to rent or buy on various digital platforms including Prime Video, where you can rent the film for £3.49 or buy it for £3.99. One Day landed on Netflix on Thursday 8th February. Sign up for Netflix from £6.99 a month. Netflix is also available on Sky Glass and Virgin Media Stream.

"Aug 24, 2011",negative," I haven’t read One Day the book, so I didn’t know not to expect a Same Time, Next Year sort of gimmick. That’s the 1978 dramedy in which Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn’s adulterous couple meet just once a year for a tryst and a catchup and a reflection on life, marriage, growing older, and all that rot. Instead, in One Day the movie we get a completely different gimmick: we peek in on the lives of Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) one day each year, always on July 15th, from the occasion of their graduation from university in Edinburgh in the late 1980s through the solidification of their adult lives in the late 2000s in London.
It’s a particularly gimmicky sort of gimmick, and a deeply dissatisfying one, because it’s not as if Emma and Dexter don’t see each other on many of the intervening days. There seems to be no reason for the gimmick, except for the coincidence of major events that bookend the story… but there’s no narrative urgency that requires these events to take place on the same day. Except to shoehorn them into the gimmick. There’s a lot of would-be wrenching stuff that One Day tries to pull that it doesn’t earn. We’re meant to see Emma and Dexter, who orbit around each other in a not-quite-platonic, not-quite-romantic friendship for many of these years, as a “perfect union of opposites” who’re are destined, somehow, to end up as lovers — the conversation about Dexter’s yin-yang tattoo smashes us over the head with this notion early in the film. But getting us emotionally invested in such an eventuality, and gripped with suspense waiting for it to happen, requires that we actually like these two, that we believe in them individually, that we want to see them as a couple, and that we buy that there’s unresolved sexual tension between them. Would that that were the case. I find Jim Sturgess (Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole, 21) relentlessly appealing in a nice-guy sort of way, which is perhaps why I never accepted, not for one minute, that he turns into a sleazebag TV personality in his 20s who cares for nothing but himself and his own hedonistic pleasures. Anne Hathaway’s (Rio, Love and Other Drugs) onscreen charms do not extend toward the brainy: we’re meant to see Emma as frumpy and literary, neither of which she is capable of exuding. (Hathaway’s accent — Emma is from Yorkshire — is fairly dreadful, but it wouldn’t have been enough to sink the movie if that was all that was wrong with it.) She can’t help how pretty she is, of course, but a bad haircut and a pair of Harry Potter glasses can’t hide it, either. Sturgess and Hathaway don’t look like a mismatched pair of unlikely lovers, which is how we’re supposed to see them: they look like two beautiful people who will fall in movieized love because the script demands it of them. And they never feel like they’re destined for each other, except in the manipulative ways of poorly written movies that drag you inexorably toward their only possible conclusion. The script is a major problem: author David Nicholls adapted his own novel [Amazon U.S.] [Amazon Canada] [Amazon U.K.], which isn’t always a good idea. There’s one moment early in the film, when Emma, who dreams of being a writer, is resolved to continuing to work in the dumpy Mexican restaurant she’s stuck in (because who makes a living as a poet?) and Dexter “helpfully” tells her: “You can’t throw away years of your life because you think it’s funny.” That probably works in the novel, and I bet Nicholls loves this line. He must, for him to have lobbed it into the screenplay without anything to support it. If Emma is supposed to be someone with a snarky sense of self-deprecation who would somehow find a way to work ironically in a Mexican restaurant (while, say, writing a novel), there’s no sense of that here. We never get any notion of Emma as a writer at all… she merely goes from wanting to write to suddenly having written a bestselling novel. Deep, meaningful life’s work that magically gets done. Profoundly important relationships that we never see grow. Maybe we needed to see a few more days each year. All that, though, could probably be forgiven if only we were electrified by Dexter and Emma onscreen. The unforgivable problem with One Day is that it is dreadfully miscast. I want to give director Lone Scherfig a pass on this, because I’ve loved her other films: An Education is a remarkable and rare look at female adolescence, and Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself is an unforgettable black comedy. But as director, she’s responsible for casting. She must have seen that Hathaway and Sturgess have no chemistry together. She must have seen that both of them, talented as they are, are wildly wrong for these roles. These stars, through no fault of their own, turn something that should be yearningly romantic into a wet blanket of sulking misery."
"Aug 24, 2011",positive,"Impressively directed and sharply written, this is an engaging and ultimately powerfully moving romantic drama with a superb supporting cast and terrific performances from its two leads."
"Aug 24, 2011",negative," It's just 24 hours out of a person's life, but that can be a long, momentous and rather depressing time – as Ivan Denisovich will tell you. David Nicholls's hugely loved bestseller One Day, whose distinctive orange jacket design adorns beaches and train-carriages all over the country, has now, unfortunately, been turned into a slushy, mawkish and weirdly humourless romance with a sub-Richard Curtis style and more endings than Lord of the Rings. The big emotional climax is unearned and the all-important high concept is now a bit blurred. The point of the book is that each chapter gives us a snapshot update of the same two people on the same day every year: 15th July. Pretty Yorkshire lass Emma and handsome-yet-vulnerable smoothie Dexter spend the night together on this date in 1988, their graduation day at Edinburgh University. They never become a couple, but the story follows their twin lives on this day over the next 20 years: sometimes together, sometimes poignantly apart. It's a terrifically neat idea on the page: on screen, little titles pop up to tell you which year we're on, but without those, I frankly wonder whether anyone without previous knowledge of the book would particularly notice the ""one day"" organising principle. It looks much like any other movie storyline. Brooklyn-born Anne Hathaway plays Emma, and there have been mutterings about her Yorkshire accent. Well, it's not as terrible as all that. Compared with Josh Hartnett, who had to play a Keighley lad in the 1999 Brit comedy Blow Dry, Hathaway sounds like Geoff Boycott in drag. And Jim Sturgess is perfectly all right as Dex. Their relationship has some sweet touches. But the movie never has much space to breathe, and there are only one or two real laugh lines in the entire film. I couldn't help remembering Marc Webb's flawed but interesting romantic comedy 500 Days of Summer, in which key days from a love affair between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are presented to us out of order: the shuffling technique defamiliarised the personae and gave the audience some perspective. (Perhaps back-to-front dramas such as Pinter's Betrayal and François Ozon's 5x2 do the same thing.) Well, this isn't what One Day is about: each day comes in sequence, yet gradually incremental changes turn out to be easier and more enjoyably described in a book than dramatised in a film. Rafe Spall and Romola Garai have supporting roles as people with whom Em and Dex dally while in denial about their romantic destiny, and they do a decent job, as does everyone else. But the day has not been seized."

"Aug 23, 2011",positive," He is familiar to people living in the middle Georgia area as the ""entertainment man"" since his entertainment reviews run in newspapers and are shown on television there. "
"Aug 23, 2011",positive," The one day is July 15th, and in 1988, as they both graduate from the University of Edinburgh, Dexter and Emma have a friendly night together. There is sex and, on Em’s part, at least, there is love. This is still a movie in which the girl is reckoned to feel love sooner, and with more loyalty. Dex assumes he is handsome and commanding enough to be an adventurer and a flake, with a field to play and no urge to commitment. But I’ve only told you the half of it (or less than half). They are also Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess, two pretty actors with a lot of talent, but quite helpless with any notion that they might be making an attempt on real and ordinary people. This is from a best-selling and allegedly beloved novel by David Nicholls, who has done his own script for a movie directed by Lone Scherfig (a Danish woman, who directed An Education). I haven’t read the book, and I don’t think I will. But the structure of the movie is cute and inane: Over the years, we keep up with Em and Dex every July 15th. Why? Well, I suppose it seemed like a sweet and artful idea to someone, and it does permit all manner of fatuous graphics to tell us here’s that lovely day again, all of which get in the way of a more interesting possibility—that we might truly follow a relationship over a period of, say, twenty years. What kind of friends or lovers only think of each other on St. Swithin’s Day? Why is the real pattern of obsession, drift, memory, and forgetting reduced to a weird Hallmark occasion? And why should anyone cater to this fancy when two edible young stars are in sight, with every sign of developing intelligence? They know, and we know, that they’re coming together, because movies can’t resist concepts like “true love” and “made for each other.” Yet in life, of course, such creeds are not reliable, and people do all manner of things in defiance of casting and the intractable laws of movie alliance. We insist on being stupid. I’m not going to spoil One Day’s story, except to say that the movie acts as its own spoiler with a drastic intervention that may be a nervous defense mechanism against the film’s accumulation of sweetness, as well as a way of getting off. After all, July 15th could go on and on, past retirement and dementia. A movie needs a resolution, the biggest advantage the form has over life. None of this sounds promising, especially if you consider that these two people live through the years without any marked sense of the world and what is going on. It’s true that Dex becomes an odious television host on what is called a show for young people, and in fairly broad strokes we see how his early flakiness prompts a kind of moral downfall. So Em goes through a stage when she loves him but really cannot like him. All the greater pity that Em’s gradual progress from working in a Mexican restaurant and being a school teacher leads to her becoming a novelist. I can buy that, but I deserve to know about the book she writes (it seems to be a success), how it shifts the balance in her mind and promotes an adult personality. Any real novelist would know enough to write Dex off—and even to make him a warning figure in an expose novel. But that courage or critical observation would break the cultural class system of “made for each other,” which weighs more heavily in One Day than the British economy, Blair and Iraq, global warming, or the rampant advance in Britain of electronic technology, to say nothing of the new aristocracy of shits. In other words, Dex and Em are never allowed entry to the real world such as we’ve seen in the 7-Up series of documentaries. And yet the film is worth seeing, in great part because I think Ms. Scherfig has genuine talent. You see this most of all in the careful treatment of some of the supporting characters—above all, Dex’s parents, who plainly were not made for each other, but who have learned ways of working it out. That is a great lesson for the rest of the film. For instance, our made-for-each-other couple do come together after years of being passing ships. Then for a moment clouds of dismay and unease drift across the bright blue of happiness—and that would have been worth exploring, because thwarted longing can be easier to sustain than close company. In the end, however, the reason to see this very lightweight film, and the reason why it may touch you, is because Hathaway and Sturgess have become the objects of our emotional investment. There are difficulties with Hathaway: She is meant to be British but can’t help sounding American at times; try as she might, she doesn’t have it in her to repress her bright-eyed radiance; she ages in only minor and flattering ways—no one puts on weight; and she isn’t allowed to acquire the demanding selfishness of a creative personality. Never mind, Hathaway improves all the time, and I can believe there might be something grand coming. As for Jim Sturgess (last seen in Peter Weir’s The Way Back), he is a clever, deft actor. When he has to listen to his dying mother (Patricia Clarkson) tell him that he needs to change his ways, struggling feelings cross his lovely but debauched face like toothache. Together, Hathaway and Sturgess deliver one important dividend: They make us feel we have been on a journey with these people. You could watch One Day and feel excited by a stunning proposition: suppose you made a movie about two real friends in the twenty or so years after they graduate! Instead, One Day is just a gimmicky “new” way of doing an old-fashioned love story. But we’ll hear much more of Sturgess, Hathaway, and Lone Scherfig."
"Aug 22, 2011",neutral," This is Jeff Bayer, and I don't update this site very often. If you'd like to listen to my current movie podcast you can find it at MovieBS.com. PLOT: Based on the novel by David Nicholls, Dexter (Sturgess) and Emma (Hathaway) spend the night together after college graduation and then are shown each year on the same date for many years after. Sometimes they are together, sometimes not. WHO'S IT FOR? Fans of the book will appreciate seeing this come to life. Also, if you're a fan of missed opportunity loves stories you'll enjoy it. EXPECTATIONS: Hathaway normally delivers, while I haven't felt the same about Strugess. Plus, it seems like a good gimmick to tell a romance. Scherfig directed An Education and I loved that film. ENDING: They try not to end the movie on a downer, which is a good call, but I really could have used that feeling at the beginning of the film. QUESTIONS: Did the movie start at one minute after midnight on July 15? Also, why make Dex so unlikable without giving me a reason to root for the two of them to be together? REWATCHABILITY: No thanks, though my wife will be reading the book. So it might be fun to watch the film with her and learn the differences from book to film. One Day feels like a gimmick that unfortunately never quite works. It's July 15 over and over again. Throughout the years Dex is selfish, sex crazed, a drug abuser and extremely unlikable. Emma likes him. Correction, Emma loves him at times. Do you know what this does for me? It makes me dislike Emma a little bit. How could she like this guy so much? Not only that, I'm not a super-sappy nice guy who always feels like I finish last. I know this because I also don't care for Ian and can't stand that Emma leads him on. It's a romance I never want to happen. I don't ever feel like I get to know the people around Dexter and Emma. The perfect example is on one July 15 when Dex is visiting with his new girlfriend's family. It's some game where you whack someone in the face with a newspaper. Dexter doesn't listen and takes an early swing, nailing his girlfriend. That kind of physical comedy is funny but has NOTHING to do with me feeling connected to these people. The gimmick means you're only in these moments for a little bit of time. I found myself waiting for the next, knowing they couldn't spend too much time in any specific place with 20 years to cover."
"Aug 22, 2011",positive," "" two appealing stars and a director of talent throw themselves against a glib, high-concept story until you're worn out from hoping it turns out better. There's promise in it, but no matter how gracefully or handsomely or smoothly made it is, it never offers more than that promise. And as it fizzles along, you stop rooting for it bit by bit, even though it recovers some near the end. Adapted from David Nicholls' novel, ""One Day"" tells the story of Emma and Dexter, who graduate university on July 15, 1988, and mark the date by nearly sleeping together. Instead, they become friends -- albeit with a constant strain of romance between them -- and the film revisits the twists and turns and shapes of their lives, which sometimes intersect, on each July 15 for the next two decades. There are jobs and lovers and spouses and houses and madcap vacations and joys shared and accidental pains inflicted. Bookish Emma is more enamored of playboy Dexter than he of her, but even in the satyric revels that constitute his life he feels the strength of their bond. Over the years, various moments between them throb with romance, but they never quite get there. And so each goes on to the wrong relationship (or, in his case, a series of them) with the nagging sense that the right person has been there all along. Emma is played by Anne Hathaway and Dexter by Jim Sturgess, and you couldn't ask for more personable or comely performers in the roles. Hathaway does a credible English accent and manages, as in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" to look mousy or ravishing as required. Sturgess, playing a broader range than in ""Across the Universe"" or ""21,"" is able -- though, fittingly for his role, he still sort of coasts on that young Paul McCartney/puppy dog thing he's got going. Alongside them, Rafe Spall (son of Timothy) invests Emma's mismatched beau with a real savor of inner pain camouflaged -- badly -- with a façade of merriment. Handsome, likable stars can't overcome an artificial story about two college chums (Hathaway and Sturgess) who nearly become lovers one July 15 and are revisited annually on that date for 20 years. Scherfig (""An Education"") has craft and skills, but the storytelling is leaden and distancing. But the performers can't puncture the phoniness and artificiality at the heart of the film. That job falls -- or should have -- to director Lone Scherfig, who most recently delivered the dazzling ""An Education,"" which plays with somewhat similar themes and tones but without any sense of make-believe or manipulation. Scherfig still displays fine craft: The film is quietly beautiful and, occasionally, gorgeous. But she can't make the characters come alive in such a cardboard situation. In a sense, ""One Day"" is a bottle quite like ""An Education,"" but Scherfig never fills it with the least bit of lightning. The flaw, finally, might be in the material. Having not read Nicholls' novel, I can't comment on its literary merit or on the fidelity of the adaptation. But I sense that the device of the recurrent midsummer visits to the characters might feel less contrived on the page than on the screen, where time spans are more abbreviated, characters' states of mind and heart are less readily revealed, and ironies of fate are more crudely telegraphed. Unfolding as chapters in a novel, a series of momentous July 15ths might acquire weight. In this film, though, it feels obligatory and shallow. And ""One Day,"" despite its attractiveness, never manages to find a way to bring the conceit fully to life.

"Aug 21, 2011",negative," If you're looking for a great romance, this isn't it. ""One Day"" is a drag. I wish it had been only one day. But it is many, many days spread over nearly 20 years. The poster for the film shows Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess embracing in the street in a hot and heavy kiss. This is what we like to call false advertising. If only there had been a memorable embrace by anyone in this movie, anything to latch onto. The gimmick, derived from David Nicholls' novel, is that students Emma and Dexter sort of hook up on the last night of college in England in 1988, and then try to meet on that same date, July 15, every year through 2006. For a film like this to work, you need an immediate connection to the characters. Or you need the two characters to be extremely charming, clever and likable so that it doesn't really matter what they are up to. Or you need what they're up to to be so diverting that it doesn't matter much if the characters lack connectivity or likability. ""One Day"" offers none of these things. Emma and Dexter meet, and meet, and meet. She is a waitress and wannabe writer. He is a tacky TV host. They love each other but mostly as friends, and Emma has strict platonic rules to follow when they are together. Emma and Dexter lack chemistry and they find that their visits often lack luster. (If they're bored by their recurring encounters, imagine how we feel?) Cliches abound. Dexter is into drugging and drinking. His mother is dying of cancer. Emma shacks up in a loveless relationship with a dullard. Time marches on, marked by changing hairstyles and bad British accents. Typewriters become laptops. It's kind of a contemporary ""Same Time, Next Year,"" minus the witty dialogue. Nicholls cannot blame some soulless screenwriter for twisting his words because he wrote the screenplay. I suppose director Lone Scherfig, who did a terrific job with ""An Education"" in 2009, was hoping we would greet each new rendezvous with heightened anticipation. Instead, they become moments of dread. When 1993 flashed on the screen, I thought, ""Oh, dear God, does that mean we have to sit through 13 more of these?""

"Aug 21, 2011",negative," 
	I've read several articles about this movie that compare it to When Harry Met Sally because the two leads are friends before they become lovers. I can see why they would say that, but the relationship between Emma and Dexter is much closer to Katie and Hubble in The Way We Were than it ever is to Harry and Sally, although never does this movie even approach the greatness of that 1970s classic. Nor, for that matter, does it come close to When Harry Met Sally. There are some nice moments in it, but I would never call it a classic. 
	The gimmick of the film - and it very much feels like a gimmick - is that we see two people on July 15th every year for 20 years. It starts with the night of their graduation, when Emma, a nerdy, politically active girl (we're told) and Dexter, a popular golden boy, almost sleep together, but  then decide - well, he decides - that they should just become friends instead. 
	Over the following years, Dexter becomes a television presenter, party animal and kind of a selfish asshole. Emma gets stuck in a dead job and in a relationship with a very unfunny standup comic. The years roll on and Dexter's career tanks while Emma's suddenly takes off as a writer. They remain friends, although it's obvious that she has deeper feelings for him than he does for her, until one day it all changes. 
	It's been said time and time again on the pages of this site that the most important aspect of a romantic film is that the audience needs to care whether the leads get together and they need to see that these two should be together. Frankly, I never thought these two should get together and I only really cared because Emma wanted it so much, even if I never did see just why she wanted him so much. 
	I think a big problem with the story is that it should have started a few years earlier. Like Hubble, I have the feeling that Dexter peaked at University and the rest of his life was a slow sinking from that. Emma, on the fringes of college life would have looked at him and aspired to his ease and popularity. Instead, when we first meet Dexter he behaves rather insensitively and he continues to be insensitive to Emma's and everyone else's feelings for the rest of the film. 
	Anne Hathaway delivers another brilliant performance, although her English accent is rather dubious. It's so vague that I had no idea she was supposed to be doing a northern accent until I read an article that told me so. Despite the occasional flattening of her vowels however, she is lovely as Emma. Maybe she can't do the English voice, but she does do the repressed English longing quite well. 
	Her other half doesn't fare so well. Sturgess does a decent enough job as Dexter, but he's nothing special. He doesn't have enough charisma to make up for the character's faults and so I was left constantly wondering what Emma, and everyone else, saw in him. 
	By sticking to the film's gimmick, the story is forced to do one of two things. Either every important thing that happens to the two of them must happen on that date or the story is going to have to skip some important events. The script opts for skipping important events, which is fine, except that it skips the night the two finally have sex for the first time! Picture When Harry Met Sally without the scene where the two of them sleep together for the first time and then having Sally just casually mention it in a later scene. That's how I felt when it happened here. 
	The book this movie is based on has been a best seller for the past two years and received critical praise. I can only assume, despite the script being written by the author of the novel, that something was lost in the translation. 
	I have that same feeling about the book being much better than this movie version. In an interview David Nicholls, the author of the book and screenplay, stated that the biggest difference between page and screen is the fact that you cannot film a character’s inner thoughts the way you can describe them with words. I personally disagree with that statement (a well written script should convey exactly what the characters are thinking) but it at least explains why the movie never delves very far beneath the surface actions of the characters. Most likely the book gives more insight into just what Emma sees in Dexter. 
	I agree that Anne Hathaway gives another stellar performance. She nearly overcomes her character’s vague motivations, such as why she stays so long in a dead-end job and why she gets involved with the stand-up comic in the first place. Both of these decisions hint at a lack of self-esteem yet that issue is never fully explored. 
	What empathy the movie musters for the characters is due entirely to her. Her subdued yet heartfelt pining for Dexter almost makes you care what happens to them. There are a few moments of genuine emotion but overall I was disappointed.  FYI, her accent sounded fine to my ears but then I haven’t spent nearly as much time listening to the English speaking as my brother Scott has. 
	And the July 15th angle definitely seems like a gimmick. And since the movie makes such a big deal about the passage of time it seems odd that such scant attention is paid to the actual details of the changes in world events, technology, fashion and music over the years. And with the exception of Dexter going a bit gray at the temples neither he nor Em noticeably age over the course of 2 decades. 
	Patricia Clarkson has a few good scenes as Dexter’s cancer stricken mother and Ken Stott is good as Dexter’s loving but stern and emotionally repressed father. We are never shown Em’s parents or told much about her back-story except that she is clearly working class while Dexter comes from money. 
	The only thing that One Day reminded me about When Harry Met Sally is that Harry told Sally that a man and a woman cannot be friends as the sex always gets in the way.  The fact that Emma wanted Dexter so much and he just wanted to be friends is ridiculous.  On their first date he gets naked and jumps into her bed.  When on vacation he convinces her to go skinny dipping.  He never lost sexual interest in her.  Had they in fact had sex that first night, they would have likely never had any deeper of a relationship.  
	The writing and editing is horrible.  The scene where Dexter needs desperately to speak to Emma but cannot get ahold of her is incomplete.  His father has just told him off and he needs a friend while she is off on a date.  Before they talk it cuts to another year.  The gimmick of the years is annoying.  They flirt with each other to nauseam.  By the time they get to Paris I wanted the movie to be over.  
	Patrick wrote that scant attention is paid to the actual details of the changes in world events, technology, fashion and music over the years.  I disagree.  Many details are thrown in such as the different popular songs and the video game from 1995.  When cell phones became popular Emma tells Dexter he will get cancer from it.  
	The film's biggest flaw is that Dexter is a dick.  He is rude as hell to Emma at a restaurant.  When an old college classmate offers him a job, Dexter insults him.  When playing a game with a girlfriend, he stupidly hits her so hard she bleeds.  I did not like this shallow, self centered idiot.  Emma could do so much better than him.  
	Dexter is an extravert while Emma is an introvert.  He took her places and gave her experiences she would never have had without him.  She meanwhile provides a female companionship that is is not made complicated by sex.  It is a rather flimsy basis for a relationship.   I never became emotionally invested in Emma's and Dexter's song and dance, and was thus not moved by the ending.  The book maybe great, this film however, is anything but."
"Aug 20, 2011",positive," ONE DAY is an unconventional love story told in an unconventional style. The conceit of dropping in on them once a year on St. Swithins Day (July 15) to check their rocky progression from the 1980s through to the 21st century is as arch and penetrating as it is effective in stripping the story of any trace of flabby exposition and getting to the heart of the infinite complexity of relationships. Events piled on events are less important than the neat summation from year to year of where Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) stand in relation to themselves and one another.  It begins in 1988 as the two graduate from college and fall drunkenly into one anothers arm. Its less impersonal than it sounds, at least for Emma, though events prevent them from sealing the deal, as it were. They decide to become friends, the which they do with a fervent devotion that survives miscues, cross-purposes, third-parties, and the ebb and flow of their fortunes. Its obvious, even to them, that they are soul mates, but of what specific variety eludes them as Emma waits for Dexter to grow up, and Dexter waits for Emma to find her inner worth. Its not an easy wait, and there is at no time any guarantee of a happy ending. Dexter discovers the allure of the blonde girlfriend; Emma discovers the mixed blessings of surrendering to Ian (Rafe Spall), the desperately unfunny stand-up comedian (Rafe Spall) who makes himself far too emotionally available and cant believe his luck when it seems to pay off. Written for the screen by David Nicholls, from his novel of the same name, the script reflects its literate origins. Its intelligent without being self-conscious, using telling details and witty wordplay, such as Emma describing the smell of her shabby first London flat as that of onions and disappointment. The excellent writing is illuminated by equally excellent performances. Hathaway evincing a ferocious honesty and growing strength beneath the vulnerability of Emmas self-deprecating bon mots, Sturgess finds the sweetness at odds with itself in Dexters boorishness, not just with Emma, but with his Dexters disapproving father (Ken Stott) and gentle mother (Patricia Clarkson), whose unconditional love for her son doesnt wear blinders. Spall brings a vivid complexity to Ian, making clear his palpable understanding that he and Emma are wrong for each other, but is, nonetheless, unable to resist the temptation to try. Its the perfect tragic counterpoint to the soul mates misconnecting, and by comparison, makes those misses all the more wrenching. ONE DAY is a love story that redefines what perfect timing is. Unblemished by soggy sentiment, it is nonetheless a film with a full, voracious heart tempered with a surprisingly clear head when it comes to romance. Funny, tragic, droll, and very, very smart, its the thinking persons love story. "
"Aug 20, 2011",positive,Book-based drama is too heavy for younger teens.
"Aug 20, 2011",negative,One of the most painfully unromantic 'romance dramas' I've ever seen.
"Aug 20, 2011",negative,"The fractured chronological foundation doesn't translate to film, with the character arcs stifled by the fragmented glimpses at their stories."
"Aug 20, 2011",negative," The title of the film One Day refers to July 15, though in truth, it refers to over two decades worth of that date. Beginning on July 15, 1988, when Brits Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) graduate from college, attempt a one-night stand and then decide to remain lifelong friends instead, the picture checks in on the lives of the pair every July 15 through the present day. It's a high-concept gimmick that could go either way, and this one ends up parting straight down the middle. Emma starts out gawky, reclusive and toiling in obscurity, while Dexter is confident, charismatic and famous. The ensuing years impart the expected A Star Is Born career switcheroo, but the focus is mainly on the personal lives of these two best friends and whether they'll eventually decide if they should become romantically entwined or if they should even be buddies anymore (as Emma notes during one of Dexter's obnoxious phases, ""I love you, Dext; I just don't like you anymore""). Considering director Lone Scherfig's previous film was 2009's excellent An Education - one of the best films of recent years - it's impossible to consider the frequently choppy One Day anything besides a disappointment. Still, that's not to say it's a total washout: The movie nicely captures the whiplash collision of youthful optimism with strenuous reality, and Hathaway and Sturgess are fine together and even better in their individual scenes. I would be even easier on the film if it wasn't for the last-act tragedy, a grotesque and clumsy development that's less a logical procession of the story and more a shameless stab at multiplex manipulation and pandering."
"Aug 20, 2011",negative,Hathaway had better chemistry with James Franco during this year's Oscars than she does here with the terminally lame Sturgess
"Aug 20, 2011",negative,"     Confession:  I never read David Nicholls’ best-seller on which this romantic drama is based, and I simply cannot fathom why anyone would want to see such a depressing dirge about two young Brits whose lives seem to intersect every July 15th, St. Swithin’s Day, for 20 years, beginning in 1988.     Ambitious, aspiring writer Emily Morley (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) meet just as they’re graduating from university, ready to launch forth into the world. Determined to continue their hastily forged friendship, they try to spend July 15th catching up and consoling one another. She’s frumpy and bespectacled, indicating ‘bookish,’ while he’s a wealthy, irresponsible womanizer. Of course, she’s secretly in love with him, despite having her hopes dashed with predictably regularity.     Eventually, Dex becomes a trendy late-night TV host, while Emma writes a successful children’s book. But their personal lives are a mess.  Drug-addled, hard-partying Dex impregnates and marries Sylvie (Romola Garai), an upper-class socialite, while dowdy Emma moves in with Ian (Rafe Spall, son of actor Timothy), a wannabe stand-up comedian.  It’s obvious that both of these relationships are doomed from the getgo. Meanwhile, Dex loses his devoted mother (Patricia Clarkson) to cancer.     Adapted for the screen by novelist David Nicholls and helmed by Danish director Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), it’s infuriatingly episodic, even tedious, never developing the characters beyond a tear-tugging layer of schmaltzy superficiality as the yearly scenes increasingly become shallow, redundant sketches about finding one’s soul mate.   Even more bewildering is the total lack of erotic screen chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. Don’t directors do screen tests anymore – to determine such things?     Having made such an auspicious debut in “The Princess Diaries,” Anne Hathaway has floundered through her past couple of roles (“Love and Other Drugs,” “Valentine’s Day”), despite making a fashion splash co-hosting this year’s Academy Awards with hapless James Franco . Jim Sturgess is best known for “Across the Universe.”"
"Aug 19, 2011",positive," With Anne Hathaway, Jim Sturgess, Patricia Clarkson, Ken Stott, Rafe Spall; Running Time: 108 minutes; Rated PG-13 (for sexual content, partial nudity, language, some violence and substance abuse); Written by David Nicholls; Directed by Lone Scherfig. ONE DAY is going to strike some people as a treacly tearjerker. For others it will be one from the heart. Those who like it will have to ignore its contrivance and focus on its emotional core, which is the story of two friends who become playthings of fate, with the true love they might have found in another story somehow always just out of reach. Screenwriter David Nicholls has adapted his own novel about two British college graduates who meet on July 15, 1988 and spend the night together. We follow them over the years on that date as their paths cross and recross. Emma is a mousy would-be writer who, in true Hollywood tradition, is played by the gorgeous Anne Hathaway, only wearing glasses. She gets a job waitressing in a greasy spoon and falls in with Ian, a co-worker and aspiring standup comic (Rafe Spall). Meanwhile Dexter (Jim Sturgess) gets a job hosting a youth-oriented television show and is so in-your-face that he becomes the TV personality that people love to hate. Neither Emma nor Dexter is living up to their potential, but as the years go by, life happens. Dexter’s mother, Alison (Patricia Clarkson), falls ill. Emma and Ian move into together. Dexter marries. Still the two stay in touch, making us think that this will be one of those stories where love and happiness doesn’t occur at first, but at last. This is the sort of story for people who can relate to the “one that got away,” or the great love of one’s life that was unrequited, or perhaps even the great love that briefly flowered but could not last. It is a story of memory and rueful regret, and the recognition that even if it was not meant to be, the other person in such a situation can still touch our lives in profound and long-lasting ways. With the movie covering more than two decades it’s also about growing up and growing older. What seems like success in our twenties may not seem the same in our forties. The things that appear impossibly out of reach at one stage of our lives may become achievable goals later on. As Emma and Dexter get older their priorities change, even as their friendship endures, and that’s an important part of the story as well. Anne Hathaway herself is a good example of these themes. Over the last decade she’s gone from movies like “The Princess Diaries” and “Ella Enchanted” to movies like “Rachel Getting Married” and this. She still does lightweight films like “Valentine’s Day,” but she’s reaching out for greater challenges as she gets older, even holding her own opposite Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada.” As Emma she explores the frustrations of young adulthood and the growing confidence that comes with successfully taking chances as she gets older. Jim Sturgess is less well-known – not yet a star – but he’s been quietly moving from film to film, building up his résumé with some good performances in movies like “21” and “The Way Back.” This may be his highest profile work yet. His Dexter is someone who could get by on glibness and good looks but wants more than that out of life, even if he’s not quite sure what. His character has to face a few hard knocks after coasting through his early life, coming out wiser for it. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books, the most recent being Jar Jar Binks Must Die… And Other Observations About Science Fiction Movies. He teaches film at Suffolk University and lives in Somerville."

Slots come with spinning reels and a variety of symbols that payout prizes when matching patterns land. Their mega jackpots, exciting bonus rounds, and endless types/themes show why slots lead to casino popularity. Some favourite titles include Starburst, Gonzo’s Quest, and Bonanza. In roulette, players bet on where they think a ball will settle across a spinning numbered wheel. While seemingly simple, understanding inside vs outside wagers can help balance risks and rewards. Popular variants like European, American or Multi-wheel games exist. Employing basic blackjack strategy charts significantly lowers the house edge as players attempt to beat the dealer’s hand without exceeding 21 through hitting or standing. Atlantic City, Spanish 21 and Pontoon offer exciting twists. Poker blends gambling luck with elements of skill around personal hand rankings, reading opponents, when to raise/fold, and potential bluffing across its most popular version – Texas Hold ’em – alongside Omaha, Stud and more variants. In baccarat card game rounds, participants wager on which hand between player or banker will win based on closest to 9 points per traditional deck scoring. Natural winners, tie bets, and 6-8 deck options add engagement. Live dealer technology streams real human croupiers managing roulette, blackjack, baccarat and other classic table games in real-time with interactive features. Multiple camera views amplify authenticity. Crash games feature exponentially rising payout multipliers until the round suddenly crashes. Strategic timing for placing bets and cashing out before the collapse is key. Instant win scratch card style games offer simple entertainment with prizes that are randomly triggered and need no skill input. Many online casinos tested and ranked by Gambling in Canoe offer game demos in free-play mode before players transition to wagering real cash. Below, we summarize the key advantages and disadvantages of defining both formats to help you decide your preferred gaming experience. While casinos provide the branding and interface, the games and functionality are powered by specialized software developers. We outline major studios setting industry standards for mobile compatibility, game quality and innovative features. Play’n GO launched in Sweden in 1997, specializing in mobile-first casino game development, now releasing new optimized slot titles weekly spanning virtual bingo and table games too. Leading casino software pioneer Microgaming originated in 1994 on the Isle of Man, supplying acclaimed classic slot titles, jackpot networks like Mega Moolah, plus virtually every table game type. Established in 1999 in Estonia with offices across 14 countries today, Playtech drives innovations around omnichannel casino technology, including networked progressive jackpots and mobile live dealers. Founded in 1996 in Sweden before expanding into playing card printing a decade prior, renowned developer NetEnt provides superior animated slots, table games and realtime live casino streaming. Launched in 1999 in Atlanta, Realtime Gaming serves as a top choice for US-facing online casinos via its portfolio spanning slots, speciality games and recent live dealer additions in European studios. This Latvia-born live casino games leader, founded in 2006, rapidly earned awards for developing pioneering online versions of roulette, poker, and other games streamed with fully interactive features. Multinational slot machine creator International Game Technology from 1975 successfully leveraged land-based expertise into interactive casino after expanding online around 2011 following a leadership shakeup. Heavily design-focused developer BetSoft from London burst onto the scenes in 1999 with acclaimed 3D cinematic slots and niches in virtual races plus bingo before venue expansion into poker. Gambling sites featured on canoe.ca use tempting bonuses to acquire new members and encourage continued play. You have access to multiple promotion types, each with distinct advantages and pitfalls. We outline key offerings so players can evaluate the best options. When you first join a casino, they’ll likely greet you with a flashy 200% deposit match deal plus free spins or something like “deposit $100, play with $300!” While exciting, look deeper at critical things like how much you need to playthrough before withdrawing win money and timeframes before the offer expires. On top of welcome deals, some casinos give you more bang for your buck, even on your 2nd or 3rd deposits. These 50-100% reload matches work similarly to welcome offers but tend to let you cash out bonus funds faster once you hit lower playthrough requirements. Who doesn’t like some complimentary action? Free spin releases let you preview new slots risk-free upon launch while retaining associated wins. But confirm the number of rounds and title eligibility before playing. More VIP-focused cashback bonuses act like rebate rewards that refund small chunks of what you lost over a week or month. So, if you notice your play history showing a lot of entries in the “negative” column, cashback puts a few coins back by refunding maybe 15-25%. Of course, continued play is mandatory. Scoring free betting credit or spins just for signup sounds too good to be true. That’s because these rare deals impose nearly impossible playthrough rules relative to tiny gifts. VIP schemes provide personalized promotions, prizes, event access and more for high-volume players. Rating levels dictate cashback rates and unlock additional reward potential over time. Moving money conveniently while upholding security remains vital for enjoyable online gambling. Below, canoe.ca experts outline the most globally supported banking channels accepted by regulated gambling sites. Amid thousands of gaming options online, determining trustworthy sites that will treat customers fairly elicits warranted caution. While no singular factor guarantees outcomes, familiar markers signal vetted processes. Reputable sites prominently display credentials like eCOGRA certification, United Kingdom, Kahnawake, Malta, Curacao, or other licensing numbers. These indicate compliance with heavy operational rules and auditing procedures imposed by renowned gambling oversight agencies. Actively scanning for the SSL “padlock” icon confirms betting portal connections utilize modern data encryption. This shields exchanged information from external surveillance or hacking vulnerabilities. While casino gaming and sports betting offer recreational enjoyment, establishing play time limits and budget caps and using available self-exclusion tools remains important. It also proves vital to know your local jurisdiction’s stance towards real money gambling and adhere to set policy. Gambling in Canoe guides help equip players with the best practices and informed choice sets for navigating regional gaming frameworks. But avoiding potential pitfalls requires personal accountability as well. At Gambling in Canoe, we guarantee a first-class online gaming experience by offering the most current and precise details. Our dedication to delivering clear and truthful evaluations, combined with our commitment to staying abreast of the latest developments in casino news, bonus updates, and the iGaming industry, ensures you’re always in the know."

"Aug 19, 2011",negative,"Sometimes, a successful play or a popular book-even a comic book-has qualities that just don't transfer to the screen. One Day is based on a best-selling novel, and the producers hired its author, David Nicholls, to write the screenplay, since..."
"Aug 19, 2011",positive," Following the same template as the ingratiating source novel by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), One Day charts 20 years of a relationship's ups and downs in one-day blips. Touching down on the same day, July 15, every year, One Day starts in 1988, with study-in-contrasts classmates Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Sturgess) falling into bed with each other on their last day at university. Emma – nerdy and socially conscious in an abstract, petition-writing way – nervously strips down and puts on Tracy Chapman for make-out mood music; put off, the posh, glib Dex shrinks back: ""Maybe we can just be friends."" It's a wonder their story doesn't end there. Yet they soldier on as just that, lifelong friends who fumble  – sometimes together, sometimes not – through the newly adult landmarks of first jobs and failed love affairs. Perhaps inevitably, the book's structure plays in a more gimmicky way onscreen. It strains credulity that a single calendar day could have so many discrete, capital-D dramatic occurrences, and the way in which Dexter and Emma's relationship evolved on page – leisurely, with time and expanse for interior exploration and character specificity – is reduced here to Polaroid-like portraiture. There are, in short, 364 days' worth of blanks to fill in for each of those 20 years, and the film's tiny yet defining filigrees – as when twentysomething Dexter casually plays with Emma's hair, in an intriguing push-pull between platonic intimacy and lightly soused foreplay – are so few that their hey-look-at-that! rarity ruins the subtlety of detail. There was a lot of hubbub about the casting of American Anne Hathaway as Emma, and indeed the trailer did seem to hone in on her more awkward wranglings with an accent. But she matures plausibly, from the gawkiness of young Emma to the steeliness of middle age. Sturgess, saddled with a caddish character, is less compelling, but he does provide the film's only spot of unloosed, raw emotion. Everything else feels too precisely and too compactly assembled for much impact. You could argue it's the structure that's so distancing, yet director Lone Scherfig's last film, the overpraised An Education, was just as detached. But where her cool-to-touch adaptation trumps the book is in how it cuttingly conveys the way stasis settles in – how whole years can whiz by without one's circumstances changing one whit. (It's why a lot of us stop keeping diaries: It's just too damned depressing to flip from year to year and recognize the same complaints, the same calls to action never heeded.) That – the illumination of our limitations, our awful habitualness – probably wasn't the effect this wannabe-epic of romantic yearning was going for, but it's a considerable accomplishment nevertheless.

"Aug 19, 2011",neutral,"  A great hue and cry arose across the pond last year when it was announced that American Anne Hathaway had been cast as Em, the less-than-glamorous British heroine in the film version of the best-selling novel “One Day” — basically “When Harry Met Sally” with a four-handkerchief twist.    The new film’s action takes place every July 15, beginning in 1988 and continuing for two decades or so. Working-class Em hooks up with the handsome, more affluent Dex (British actor Jim Sturgess of “Across the Universe”) on the day of their college graduation in Edinburgh.    They’re not always together on July 15 — in 1990, he’s partying with a naked woman in Paris, and Em is underemployed as a manager at a Mexican restaurant in London. She eventually moves in with a smitten colleague, a failed comedian (Rafe Spall, son of Timothy) she doesn’t quite love.    Returning to London, Dex acquires a measure of stardom — as well as a taste for cocaine, booze and promiscuity — as the host of a cheesy late-night music program on TV. On one of their several reunions on various July 15s, including a skinny-dipping episode, he rudely brushes aside her concerns about his hard-partying lifestyle, which is taking a toll on his career.    Her relationship founders, but the comedian’s parting gift is to encourage her literary ambitions, and sure enough, her first book is a best seller. By this point, the self-pitying Dex — who’s lost his mother (Patricia Clarkson, in a small role) to cancer and his TV show — has hit rock bottom. A short-lived marriage (to Romola Garai) that produces a daughter and an unhappy new career does little to reverse his downward trajectory.    At some point in the late ’90s, Em and Dex decide they were fated for each other after all. It’s easy to see how Dex would be attracted to the newly self-confident Em. I had more of a problem understanding why Em would want anything to do with Dex, a substance-abusing jerk who is anything but charming.    I might be able to get past that if Hathaway and Sturgess had any chemistry. There are no sparks whatsoever, and that’s always a deal-breaker for me in romantic films.    “An Education” conveyed a wonderful sense of time and place, something that’s largely missing here — if it weren’t for title cards and the occasional shoulder pad, it would be hard to tell whether you’re looking at a scene from 1996 or 2006.    David Nicholls, who adapted his own novel for the screen, doesn’t work the same alchemy that Nick Hornby created from Lynn Barber’s memoir for “An Education.” There’s far too much on-the-nose dialogue (“She made you decent”), plus Nicholls adds an extremely schmaltzy ending chapter that wasn’t in his book.    Even with his hair grayed up, Sturgess in no way physically conveys the middle-aged man he’s become toward the end. Hathaway, though, suggests Em’s life journey beautifully, and she’s the best reason to see “One Day,” if you must. "
"Aug 19, 2011",neutral," Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) have the kind of
relationship that women and men sometimes find hard to handle:
They're friends, not lovers. But the potential for sex is always
there, from their first meeting in the late 1980s to their periodic
reunions over about two decades of British cultural change. It's a classic case of opposites attracting. Emma is studious
and somewhat insecure; Dexter is outgoing and overconfident. Emma
aspires to be a writer; Dexter is happy to be host of a TV show.
Emma is sexier than she thinks she is; Dexter can't live without
sex. They'd make a great couple, if only they could get on the same
page — or the same stage. It seems that they both have some growing up to do. But as often
happens in such stories, tragedy lurks. It also lingers, as we
dawdle with one of the characters way past what should have been
the ending. Based on a book by David Nicholls, ""One Day"" fails to make us
care about the young couple at its center. Working from a
screenplay by Nicholls, director Lone Scherfig maintains a lively
pace, and she elicits spirited performances from Hathaway and
Sturgess. The problem is a story that may have worked as a novel,
but never quite gels as a film. It's a big disappointment coming
from Scherfig, whose drama ""An Education"" (2009) was a model of
concise yet engaging storytelling. ""One Day"" also squanders the talents of Hathaway, who was
terrific in last year's ""Love and Other Drugs."" She brings to Emma
an appealing vulnerability. As Dexter, Sturgess — who has appeared
in films from ""21"" to ""Across the Universe"" — deftly balances charm
and smarm."

When I lifted up my head I saw an angel step through the wall into the room. He was so very tall that he had to stoop so as not to bump his head on the ceiling. My first thought was this must be the Archangel Michael because I had been told once that the archangels are tall. I don't know why I thought it was Michael, I was just sure it was.
 
He said she sang to him and laid with him until he fell asleep. He then said Jesus came back to get her, and he brought her back to a door with him where they started to sparkle and then went through the door. Ever since my son has been obsessed with Jesus and angels. He prays to an angel often and prays for Jesus to come back.
 
I’ve never told this story. When I was about 7 years old, I was left at home alone with my nephew who was 3 at the time. We were playing in a back room when something scared us. I don’t remember what I saw or heard, but I knew I had to get out of that house or we were going to die.
 
I clutched my nephew tightly, both of us screaming and crying, and ran toward the front door. Just before reaching the exit, I saw a tiny ball of glowing white light hovering just above our front door. I stopped dead in my tracks. I could not take my eyes off that ball. Suddenly it started getting bigger and bigger. Eventually, we were totally engulfed by the light.
 
I have believed in angels all my life. In my younger years, I lived an exciting life, threw caution to the wind, and put myself in dangerous situations. I used to think I had worked my angels overtime.
 
Last year was the worse of my life. In six months, I lost my brother-in-law, my younger brother passed away, I had my adult son and family removed from my house, and I divorced my absent husband.
 
It started with me seeing a figure at the end of my bed. I also kept seeing purple, green, and white balls of light in my room at night.
 
One night, I had just laid down. Suddenly, I was outside staring at this woman who had long black hair. Her wings covered the whole of the sky. She was massive. I asked her what she wanted, shouting at her. She smiled, and she told me she was the angel of the morning sun. She flapped her wings three times and my body went all funny. I was back in my room. I could see myself lying in bed, I was on my ceiling.
 
I was 4 years old. I was in my brother's room, crying. This is when I heard a sweet voice called me. I looked up towards the footboard and saw a woman with long hair lying on her right shoulder. She had on a white flowing cloth with light blue trimming surrounded by a white mist. Her arms were extended out with her palms facing upward as if she wanted to embrace me.
 
I prayed that God would show me an angel, and he did, twice, many years after I prayed for this. Both encounters happened when I was sleeping.
 
I suppose angels will come to visit us on occasion when we would be most relaxed and receptive to their visitations. The first encounter I had, I was in a dream state walking along a dark path at night. Then suddenly, the entire environment setting lit up with incredibly pure bright light as if the sun itself was shining on me.
 
When I was younger, I was going through a lot of things that a young, 16-year-old girl shouldn't have to endure; You can try to imagine. My mother and I were arguing a lot. She was very angry because she was going through things of her on. She took it out on my little brother and me.
 
Not long ago, my father was diagnosed with stage 4 bladder cancer and was not given much hope for survival past the Christmas season. Although the odds were devastatingly against him, he chose to go through a round of chemo to take some comfort in the idea that he tried everything he could to be cured. Although God had other plans, I take comfort in my faith that he will be taken care of by Christ and the angels themselves.
 
In 1974, while stationed in Pearl Harbor, someone I had been drinking with spiked my wine with LSD. He did so with several others. We all went back to the base barracks, and some of the guys were going crazy. I prayed for help. A sailor opened his door and asked what was wrong. I told him. He asked me to get everyone and bring them to his room. I did. He asked if we believed in God. We all shared our experiences about God, and that is when I noticed I was sober. It was way too soon for the LSD to wear off, it can be an 18-hour experience. It had only been a few hours since our drinks had been spiked.
 
Moonville, Ohio, is an old town that was overtaken by a plague, almost everyone died. All that is left of the town is a tunnel. We went through the tunnel, and three of my grandsons climbed the hill to the top. There was a thin beam of light that looked like a sword. It was right in front of us. I couldn't see when I looked up to take the picture, the light was so bright. I took the picture anyway.
 
I had a difficult two years full of losses, sadness, and major changes. I was recently diagnosed with depression. I had some very strange experiences and some moments of pure bliss.
 
I called the airlines and had to be at the airport for the last 9 p.m. commuter plane. The terminal was under construction so I was left at a shuttle site in the parking lot in the pouring rain. It was 8:45 p.m. I had never used this airport so I was terrified and began crying.
 
I looked away and she was gone. I asked the fireman where was the lady. He said, ""What lady?"" I pointed to where she had come from, and he said she could not have come from that area. That was a 500-foot cliff to the Pacific Ocean.
 
It was May 2011, I was not feeling well. Everything seemed to be falling apart. I would spent a lot of time on Facebook and internet. I felt I was challenged by evil spirits. I was feeling like I was dead most of the time. I would see my spirit get out of my body and wondered if my dad would come in a spirit form to bring my soul back to my body.
 
I know I needed healing. I wanted help with my emotions and felt I needed them to flow instead of wearing a protective mask or being like a statue.
 
I have several angels and see them each in different ways. My father is rainbows, my grandma is butterflies. There are orbs in pictures. I know they are there when I photograph them. They are red and often in shapes of angels. I have been told I have five.
 
We were in the jungle at Taljai Devi near Pune (India), we knew we were lost. Both of us had almost decided that might have to spend the rest of the night at the jungle, but suddenly from somewhere, a man appeared. His looks were serene in spite of meeting him at that time of day in a jungle. We did not get scared of him at all. He looked so peaceful, there was such serenity on his face. We followed him. Me and my friend both knew that he is either an angel or a man sent by an angel to help us.
 
When I was taking pictures in my backyard one and a half years ago, I looked to see how the photos appeared. I found that a great, awesome cloud came down my alley and three UFOs shaped like pyramids were in my backyard. Three men wearing silver suits and silver cone-shaped hats advanced from the UFOs toward me.
 
I have a daughter who is permanently disabled. She had open heart surgery when she was only 3 months old. We were told when she was being prepped for surgery that we shouldn't do it and that her prognosis wasn't good. They said that they would make her as comfortable as possible until she passed.
 
The next day, I was looking through one of my many handbags, and I put my hand in to grab some coins out of it. Suddenly, I found myself with a silver ring in my hand with a coin stuck in the middle of the ring.
 
At the age of 15 years old, I was riding my four-wheeler. I tried to climb a hill with my four wheeler by myself, risky since no one was there if I had wrecked it.
 
During a very rough time last week, my daughter and I went to the mall. At the bottom of the escalator a lady approached us and started a conversation. She asked me a lot about where I was from, etc.
 
Then. she told me that this rough time would pass, and that the girls at school were jealous of my daughter, and that she just needs to hold her head up high and not respond. Wow! How did she know there was a showdown at her school the day before? She also said that my daughter will have her pick of colleges to choose from. (She is a straight-A student since kindergarten and is now in 10th grade.) She also looked deep into my eyes and told me that she knew I had been to hell and back but this will all make me stronger.
 
I was the manager of a radio broadcast station. I worked the morning show in which I had to wake every morning at 3 a.m. to get all my prep together by 5 a.m., which was airtime. The night before, I abruptly woke up at 11:00 pm. I had been sound asleep by 9:30 p.m., yet felt I had to call the radio station urgently. I was initially disoriented, yet driven. I was barking orders to my equally-sound-asleep husband who responded beautifully to my orders. I asked my husband to get on the cell phone and get ready to call 911.
 
The other night I came to stay for the Christmas holidays with my dad and brother. My brother sometimes is a person I still don't get along with even though we are adults. He keeps to himself and seems to ignore me most of the time. I feel very sad about this every time I visit my family. He is not nice to my mom at all who lives separate from him and my dad.
 
I was taking my 3-year-old daughter to daycare. I had left the house and traveled two blocks when I came to a major intersection that was being widened. I was the first car at the light, my daughter was in her child seat in the front. The light turned green, as I readied to go through the intersection, loud and clear, I heard the words, ""Don't Go."" It was so clear that I thought someone was in my backseat.
 
Years ago, I was out with my two good friends and we were walking around in this big shopping center. Over an hour, we hung around the perfume section looking for the right smell, so in the end, we were quite dazed.
 
One Wednesday night back in the late 1990's, I decided to sing for God under the evening stars. We live in a semi-rural area, so thankfully I wouldn't be waking anyone up. I suggested to God that He may want to have some angels doctor up my lame singing voice as I'm sure He is used to hearing beautiful angel choirs in the heavenly realms!
 
I believe in angels because I have lots of experiences wherein I know they talk to me. Angels don't only watch and guide they also make you a better person. I was in a bad situation two years ago. I was angry with myself, but I never noticed it. In my dream, there were two men standing on a platform. They called me. I noticed three gray stones in their forehead. I don't know why they had that.
 
One guy asked me, ""Why are you angry with yourself, what is bothering you, why are you punishing yourself,"" he said. You have everything. You have a nice family, house, people love you, then why don't you love yourself?"" His tone was an annoyed tone, I cannot answer because I know he is correct. I just said, ""I am terribly sorry,"" and I cried.
 
I was raised Catholic, my mom incorporated angels into our everyday life like to reassure us. For example, thunder is just the angels bowling, and lightning is the angels taking pictures (that one led to a bit of danger as we all wanted to run outside and smile at the heavens during a lightning storm).
 
I believe that I saw several angels on several occasions. The first sighting was at a devastating fire in West Philadelphia of a church that once was affiliated with the People's Emergency Center. The building was gutted and there appeared to be about two or three pacing back and forth.
 
I had just done the reiki. At night I could not sleep. Around midnight, I felt that I was floating, though I was still in bed. When I opened my eyes, I saw the whole room was filled with white shadows, but I was not scared, and I tried to make out what they were.
 
Driving home from work going through a neighborhood, I saw a homeless man pushing a grocery cart filled with odds and ends. I suddenly felt the need to stop and give him money which was something I did not believe was a good idea. I felt compelled to do just that. He said that he had no shelter to go to but that God always took care of him. I gave him the money and he blessed me.
 
I turned a corner and felt compelled to go back again. He had disappeared into thin air. He was there in the middle of the street, in the middle of a subdivision, in the middle of a block, and then he was gone—shopping cart and all.
 
The accident happened around 1979. My girlfriend Donna was driving the car on the Bronx Expressway one evening with another friend and me. We were in the left lane when the car decided to stall. Normally, you would glide over but Donna hit her brake. That is all I remember until someone called my name ""Veronica, wake up."" I was in the back seat and we were hit from behind. The person pulled me out of the car.
 
I believe in angels and my mom was one of them. Shortly before she died, she began preparing an amazing ""shindig."" She wanted to look nice, have great food, and enjoy and celebrate her life. Two days later, she unexpectedly died. Don't tell me she didn't converse with the angels. Don't tell me she wasn't planning her entry into the hereafter with the angels and saints and our God. She had never ever been so happy in our life and she told me so. She brushed off all the materialistic things of this world, told me to get rid of her house, a house she had clung to with tenacity for years.
 
My two dearest friends of 50 years were each killed in similar head-on collisions 17 months apart, and each occurred two days after the birth of my daughter's children, which convinces me that the timeliness of these two accidents was predetermined so that each baby could have a very special guardian angel.
 
I had a surgery a year ago. One night, I was reading a book about how to communicate with your guardian angel, then I fell asleep.
 
An old boyfriend broke my heart by leaving one day without explanation. Years later, I received a phone call from his mother, he was dying of brain cancer. She felt seeing me would bring comfort to him. This was a very emotional situation I found myself in.
 
I decided to visit him and ended up being committed to him in a nurturing way for the rest of his life, which ended up being a year. This time was an emotional roller coaster, and I often felt confused. One day while going to the train station, an old woman dressed in black stopped right in front of me and said, ""God loves you, you are doing the right thing,"" and she walked away.

"Aug 18, 2011",positive," Emma and Dexter are the kind of best friends a thousand romantic comedies are made of. A straight man and a straight woman who almost got it on during college, but regressed into a friendship that remains forthrightly, awkwardly platonic over the years. You know this situation is never going to last, and on some level they do too, but One Day does the audience a favor by not taking things the way you've seen a hundred times before. Yes, Lone Scherfig's film includes tearful revelations, kisses in the street and other boyfriends and girlfriends who are just so wrong for our main pair, but it's also sharper and more mature about love--in all its forms-- and the way it can shift and develop over time. Unfortunately the movie is also a shallower facsimile of the novel by David Nichols, who also wrote the screenplay, but it hits enough of the same notes and is handsomely packaged enough to stand fairly well on its own. So much relies on the chemistry between our Emma and Dexter, Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess, and though both Hathaway's mousiness and British accent seem iffy at times, the two are pretty good at pretending to be crazy about each other. The movie starts strong on the heartbreakingly, gorgeously shot streets of pre-dawn Edinburgh in 1989, where Emma and Dexter are winding down a post-graduation party and wind up stumbling back to Emma's cramped dorm room bed. As the sun rises Dexter points out that it's July 15, St. Swithin's Day, and suddenly we're swept to that day a year later, when Emma is working a shitty job at a shitty Mexican restaurant in London while privileged Dexter travels the world. It's the first of 20 time jumps total, as we meet up with Emma and Dexter on July 15 each year until 2010. Emma's life is one familiar to a lot of post-collegiates, working that shitty job far longer than she should have, falling almost by accident into a relationship with a doofy guy (Rafe Spall) who's way beneath her, and harboring a dream of writing children's books while being way too shy to actually follow through with it. Golden boy Dexter, on the other hand, stumbles into a high-paying job as a caddish TV presenter, though it also comes with a raging alcohol problem and the inability to deal with actual life problems like the death of his mother (Patricia Clarkson, underused). When we meet up with them on July 15 Emma and Dexter are sometimes together, vacationing amid serious sexual tension in the south of France or fighting in the street after a swanky dinner where Dexter is too drunk to care he's insulted his oldest friend. Other times they're living totally separate lives, Emma happily accepting a modest job as a schoolteacher and Dexter entering into a shotgun marriage that seems doomed from the start. Even when their lives seem to be turning away from each other, though, there are many twists left to go-- life is funny like that sometimes. Nichols is very, very faithful to his own book in the adaptation, but there's only time for so much, and scenes in the film that felt detailed and emotionally rich often fly by without making their desired impact. Dexter's relationship with his family feels especially short-shrifted, making his transformation from carefree playboy to devoted family man feel entirely rote, and though Hathaway gets some good zingers as Emma, she never emerges quite as the prickly, whip-smart heroine she ought to be. Scherfig uses several opportunities to translate the book's deep emotions into cinema-- the aforementioned Edinburgh streets and that city's landmark mountain Arthur's Seat are especially effective locations-- but it's a talky book translated into a talky movie that's sometimes more clever than it is effective. The primary feeling of One Day, though, is somehow wishing it could be better-- that Sturgess had maintained some of his leading man reserve from The Way Back and better commanded the screen, that Hathaway had allowed a little more spark into Emma, and especially that Scherfig and Nichols had found better ways to recreate the book's lived-in, confident charm. Telling a love story over the course of 20 years is no easy task, and One Day had everything it needed to pull it off, but loses something crucial in the leap from page to screen."
"Aug 18, 2011",negative,"Sturgess is great, Hathaway is less so, and ultimately, the more enjoyable high points don't do enough to make up for a lot of serious lulls."
"Aug 18, 2011",negative,"Clearly created for fans of Nicholls's tome, One Day is so slight that it barely exists"
"Aug 18, 2011",neutral,"This bittersweet drama pulls the rug out from under you after appearing to achieve a satisfactory emotional pairing. The terrific musical score by Portman & the scenic background locations in Paris, London and Edinburgh are the movie's only saving graces."
"Aug 18, 2011",positive,The love story might be the weakest element in an otherwise perceptive drama about the passage of time and the universal struggle to make something of a life that is going by more quickly than we'd like.
"Aug 18, 2011",positive,"Despite the familiar When Harry Met Sally, friends-first, opposites-attract contrivances, this romance is intermittently loveable, thanks to a glam cast and witty script."
"Aug 18, 2011",neutral,"Without the interior monologues that gave the novel's characters more substance, it feels more like a perfume commercial than a story."
"Aug 18, 2011",negative," “One Day” seemed so promising given its pedigree — lovely and sensitive actors Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess at the forefront; Lone Scherfig, a master of intimacy in the director’s chair; and David Nicholls adapting his own bestselling romance novel. But as so often happens with love, what you hope for is not even close to what you get, and in this case we are left with a heartbreaking disappointment of a film.  It starts off in Edinburgh, Scotland, one day in 1988, July 15 to be exact, when Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Sturgess) meet on graduation day, end up in bed, yet very much off on the wrong foot. He’s more upper crust, really out of her league. She’s frumpy but smart and sardonic enough to keep him intrigued, if not attracted.  True romance isn’t in the cards on that day, but we have time. The film, as the book did before it, covers a 20-year span, dropping in on them each year on the same July day.  The narrative is driven by modern themes. Em and Dex have varying degrees of success and failure on the personal and career fronts, which seem to be the main topic of conversation when they meet up each year, usually in and around London, where much of the film takes place. She busses tables at a Mexican restaurant and tries to write when she’s not at work. He’s a rising reality-TV star on a downward spiral, sped along by healthy doses of cocaine and the fickle nature of fame.  He has a string of young lovelies, while she struggles with relationships. Ian, a stand-up comic wannabe, turns up as her rock for a while (a smart turn by Rafe Spall). Patricia Clarkson and Ken Stott are mostly underemployed as Dex’s parents, though there are some nice moments between Stott and Sturgess toward the end.  If Dex and Em are in an extended pickle of whether to be or not to be a couple, it’s nothing compared with the problems the actors are facing. In the film, there is a lot of tempting and resisting and a few lingering kisses, beautifully shot by director of photography Benoit Delhomme, but the passion is missing. If anything, the awkwardness that rightfully infuses their first encounter never leaves.  It’s a very British production, but the accent never sits well with Hathaway. More problematic, she never comes close to the sort of textured portrait she brought to “Rachel Getting Married.” Sturgess, excellent holding together the very loosely constructed “Across the Universe,” is no better off. As Dex, he’s to be a lovable rogue, but charm fails him here.  This sort of story should have been a slam-dunk for Scherfig. The Danish director has been close to a sure thing since U.S. audiences began discovering her in 2002 with her first English-language film, “Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself,” a sweet comedy about suicide and family ties. But it was 2009’s Oscar-nominated “An Education” that cemented her as a truly significant cinematic voice.  In the coming-of-age story that launched Carey Mulligan’s career, Scherfig allowed us to creep inside a life in transition. She made you feel an actual witness to those deliciously dangerous liaisons. In “One Day,” with the world again turning on the axis of a single relationship, the characters and the story slip away from her.  Nicholls’ novel was a sensation in part due to the clever way it revealed Dex and Em — fragments that eventually came together to create a full-bodied exploration of what goes right and wrong with the people we love. This is not the first time he’s tackled adapting for the screen. “Starter for 10,” his earlier go at British class issues, school and love in 2006 turned out to be an enjoyable entertainment with James McAvoy its winning lead (though “The Last King of Scotland” would be that year’s game-changer for the actor).  But in nipping and tucking, Nicholls loses too much of the context necessary if we’re to fall in love with Dex and Em and the idea that they really should be together. And why do we show up for romantic movies, if not to pull for an ever after, happily or otherwise? Dialogue that played on page turns tedious on screen, and there is an awful lot of it.  Back for a moment to Delhomme (“The Scent of Green Papaya,” “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas”). The French cinematographer’s eye for places and people is so consistently stylish and spot-on that even films that otherwise fall short are worth seeing if he shot them. When the tedium overtakes “One Day,” pass the time looking at how skillfully he moves in to set the mood and frame the moment.

"Aug 18, 2011",positive," ""One Day"" is a beautiful movie, but beautiful in a way that life often is, not movies. Nothing is sudden or easy, either for the characters or for the audience, and there are no thunderbolts from the blue. Rather, the film achieves its effects and builds toward a wealth of feeling through an accumulation of seemingly day-to-day incidents, presented over the course of years. We meet two people, and with time and maturity, the towering consequence of their relationship reveals itself. So this is no light romantic movie. It may wear its seriousness lightly, as it should, but this is really about two people discovering meaning in their lives - which is next door to saying that ""One Day"" is about the meaning of life, in general. Life may be clumsy, full of misguided ambitions, false directions and inhibiting fears, and with long stretches of drudgery interrupted by short bursts of misery. But if people are lucky, the movie is saying, they eventually figure out what they should be doing and whom they should be doing it with. Or to put it another way, there are a million love stories in the Naked City, and ""One Day"" is just one of them - but a particularly emblematic one that resonates as a generational story as well. Based on the novel of the same name by the British writer David Nicholls and adapted by the author, it introduces us to two people in their early 20s, who spend the night together on July 15, 1988. Emma (Anne Hathaway) is caustic, witty, insecure and smart, from a working-class background, and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) is upper middle class and radiant with a self-confidence not to be confused with self-love. (He likes himself, but he's on to himself.) She wants to be a writer, and he wants to be famous. And the two connect, for no reason but that opposites often do. They become friends. From there on, the movie looks in on Emma and Dexter on every subsequent July 15, from 1989 through the present day. This device - one would call it a gimmick, were it not so inspired - is not to be confused with anything like ""Same Time, Next Year,"" in which the characters contrive to meet every anniversary. Rather, this is just an arbitrary conceit that proves irresistible, a series of snapshot portraits of two often-separate lives, from young adulthood to early middle age. Without making a big deal about it, the movie charts their career trajectories, as well as the year-by-year advances in technology, the changing styles, the social scene in London, and the subtle but very real differences between being, say, 28 and 32. Much of the film's humor derives from Dexter's career as a TV presenter, a horror in which he interviews rap groups, wears ridiculous pants and pretends to be a cockney. But perhaps the most important thing about ""One Day"" is that this is one of the rare romantic films in which we know why the central characters are or should be in love. And for once it has nothing to do with the elusive chemistry of two star personalities. Hathaway doesn't play her bright usual self, but a brainy Brit, and Sturgess is not well known enough to have an established star persona. Everything here is about the alchemy of the characters, which the actors inhabit with knowing good humor. Lone Scherfig's direction is sure and insightful and contains accent notes that release the story's pent-up power. I was going to describe a shot, late in the film, in which Scherfig includes 1988 and 2011 in the same frame, but no, I'll let you find it. But certainly, in a film so wedded to the calendar, it's a stroke of brilliance to suggest that nothing goes away and that time, as people experience it, is a lie. Actually, if you're keeping score, that is the precise moment that a very satisfying movie is transformed to the level of poetry, a level that, once achieved, ""One Day"" never loses.
