Oct 31 2023,positive, now im not one to brag but when i was younger i hobnobbed with a hollywood celebrity and her family her name was cheryl and she lived on the opposite side of our culdesac in a tyrone area neighborhood in st petersburg i knew her before her bigscreen debut and i am happy to say that her newfound fame did not change her one bit cheryl landed a part in the 1978 film the norseman which was filmed right here in the tampa bay area this lowbudget american international pictures cast lee majors  still riding high on the success of his television show the six million dollar man  as an 11thcentury viking prince who travels to the shores of north america in search of his missing father being a 10yearold kid all i knew was cheryl was in a movie with lee majors in my mind this meant she must be the female lead and the heros love interest of course cheryl was an extra  one of dozens if not hundreds the production company had put out a call for anyone in the area with native american heritage didnt matter she was still a star even if i couldnt find her on screen when my parents took me to see the norseman at tyrone square mall i thought about cheryl when i read visionary writerdirector robert eggers was filming the northman although both epic historical dramas revolve around vikings the two films are as different as night and day where the norseman feels like a formula swashbuckler with a heavy 70s vibe and little attention to historical detail the northman is rooted in history and inspired by literature and legends eggers  known for blurring the line between reality and fantastical dreamscapes  creates a kaleidoscopic spectacle of hallucinatory imagery and bloodspattered brutality the directors two previous films  the witch and the lighthouse  both earned high praise from critics the northman was released april 22 in theaters the film opens in the year 895 ad with young prince amleth oscar novak son of king aurvandill warraven ethan hawke joining in festivities to welcome home his father from some overseas campaign queen gudrún nicole kidman is notably less enthusiastic about the kings return  though still wounded from his conquests the king summons his son to take part in a rite of passage to prove his worthiness as heir to the throne immediately following the ceremony amleth sees his father murdered by his uncle fjölnir claes bang though fjölnir orders his men to kill the kings heir amleth escapes and vows to avenge his father save his mother and kill his uncle yes of course this sounds familiar amleth is a figure in a medieval scandinavian legend he serves as the direct inspiration of prince hamlet in shakespeares tragedy hamlet prince of denmark  the northman jumps forward a few years with an adult amleth alexander skarsgård living among a band of vikings and fighting alongside them as a berserker following a raid on a village in the land of the rus on the baltic sea amleth encounters the seeress björk who reminds him of his oath of vengeance and foretells elements of his destiny he also discovers fjölnir fled to iceland after he was overthrown by harald of norway  no need to elaborate on how this revenge saga plays out other than to say its brutal bloody and occasionally unhinged eggers serves up this timeless tale with as much pomp and circumstance as panache and savagery it feels simultaneously archetypical and innovative beyond its connection to scandinavian legend the film draws from various literary and cinematic sources a sequence in which amleth recovers a prophesied sword brings to mind a similar scene from john milius 1982 film conan the barbarian which itself was likely based upon the 1967 story the thing in the crypt by l sprague de camp and lin carter using robert e howards character conan as usual eggers goes to extraordinary lengths to achieve a level of historical accuracy in the northman he also imbues the film with mysticism and religious conviction emphasizing the importance of divinity among these characters eggers makes it clear that their gods are not just vague impersonal figures in a sprawling pantheon  they are ubiquitous and accessible and they are part of the very fabric of life  i thought vikings were violent hulking brutes with nothing of interest the director says in the films production notes my wife on the other hand had been fond of the icelandic sagas the esteemed medieval stories of viking lore and she knew that i would love them but even at her insistence i never opened one of these great books i immediately imagined solitary tenth century figures on horseback dwarfed by supernaturally colored mountains glaciers and infinite skies he said there was something about the elements and the elemental that cried out from the landscapes working with archeologists and historians eggers sought to recreate the minutiae of the physical world while also attempting to portray the inner world of the viking mind including their beliefs mythology and ritual life  in that sense the northman is an unequivocal success it is steeped in history and legend dripping with eeriness and barbarity and it echoes arthurian and shakespearian motifs filled with stunning cinematography the film is an intense immersive sometimes surreal descent into an otherworldly milieu of folkloric horror and medieval barbarism  how mainstream audiences will react to the northman depends upon their willingness to embrace eggers distinct visual style and brooding tone despite its epic scope the film retains an arthouse ambiance and  beyond the revenge theme at its heart  examines the toll of cyclic violence as well as mans enduring inhumanity if that sort of thing appeals to you catch it while its in the theaters for the ultimate experience youre likely to wince more than once as if the blood and mud might fly off the screen and hit you in the face
Sep 17 2023,positive, director robert eggers has stated that in making the northman he hoped to achieve the ultimate viking epic although it is difficult to say whether he has succeeded what remains true of the film is that it is indeed epic in every possible sense  a visually spectacular feast that grips the audience from its opening moments until the arresting finale coming out of an impressive run with two smaller budget films 2015s the witch and 2019s the lighthouse eggers is given a 90 million usd budget to expand his idiosyncratic worldbuilding into an indelible and violent film that remains recognizable to his arthouse style yet is given the breadth to bring that vision to a mainstream audience the story comes from norse legend amleth is a tale that became the boilerplate for hamlet but eggers and multihyphenate talent sjón have changed elements of the story drastically in the original versions amleth after witnessing the slaying of his father feigns being a fool to later enact revenge on his uncle who has usurped the kingdom eggers and sjón have done away with the fool amleth and have replaced him with a hardened warrior consumed by revenge arguably as the story plays out amleths quest for revenge does seem foolish as the cost is unfathomably high and his drive to destroy his uncle is a kind of madness that is ruinous to him the year is 895 ad and amleth played as a boy by oscar novak is a young king in training his father king aurvandil warraven ethan hawke has returned from battle with his uncle fjölnir claes bang amleth and his mother gudrún nicole kidman greet the wounded but triumphant warrior in amleths eyes his father is a hero and righteous king who brings glory to the people furthermore aurvandil is an attentive and loving father who is preparing amleths succession to the throne eggers takes us through some of amleths rites of passage including a psychedelic encounter with heimir the fool willem dafoe where they ingest hallucinogens and throw off their humanity to see the manifest destiny of their family line stylistically this scene is very much in eggers playbook  the reality and unreality exist at once for aurvandil and amleth the magic is not metaphor they believe in their gods and the forces of the supernatural soon after aurvandils return amleth witnesses the treacherous attack of his uncle fjölnir who with a band of loyal men brutally dispatch aurvandil and hunt down and try to kill amleth almeth witnesses the coup and sees fjölnir take his mother gudrún as his new queen escaping the kingdom amleth vows that he will avenge his father save his mother and kill fjölnir years pass and amleth now played by alexander skarsgård is a muscular berserker living in the land of rus amleths humanity has all but disappeared and he is a killing machine eggers spares the audience little as he takes us through long shots of the vikings destroying villages and collecting slaves skarsgård is an imposing presence both physically and because he is violence personified blood and mudsoaked he fills the frame with menace in a sacked village amleth encounters a seeress played by björk in her first speaking role in a film since lars von triers dancer in the dark who reminds him of his oath to destroy fjölnir and restore his family line she warns him that the revenge will come at a cost and he will have to sacrifice his kindness and kin soon thereafter he hears that the slaves the berserkers have captured are destined for fjölnir who has lost his kingdom and is rebuilding his community in iceland amleth brands himself a slave and is taken in shackles to the new land fellow captured slave olga of the birch forest anya taylorjoy takes an interest in amleth as she can see that he is not a sheep but something more to eventually escape her captors olga claims she will use her mind which is as powerful a weapon as amleths brawn the two become lovers and coconspirators in fjölnirs downfall amleths quest for revenge teeters between realism and a fever dream eggers spins us in and out of reality in a style so clearly his own the larger budget allows for sheer magnificence as he takes us through the kingdoms vistas are sweeping and glorious yet despite this they dont really add to the narrative heft of the film ironically it is the scenes filmed in close quarters that are the most impressive eggers excels at the surreal and otherworldly but this comes mainly through the script cinematographer jarin blaschke the lighthouse 2019 manages to capture both extremes of eggers vision still it is those moments where the camera is close to the action that are more distinctly discombobulating and fascinating alexander skarsgård the legend of tarzan 2016 is quite simply a magnificent beast in the film amleth given reason to reclaim his humanity through his love for olga becomes more complex and nuanced than the man who lives only through violence and hatred although skarsgårds performance is predominantly physical there is space for him to portray the characters grief betrayal confusion and vulnerability nicole kidman as gudrún is given one of the most effective scenes in the film gudrúns steel is unexpected and kidman once again proves that even with a supporting role she is built to surprise and impress sadly anya taylorjoy isnt given as much meat as one would hope for the ostensible lead actress her accent unplaceable and confusing often lifts the audience out of the diegetic world perhaps it is because olga is essentially an adjunct to amleth and a means for him to question his quest and devotion to violence that she seems somewhat underwritten taylorjoy has proven many times in her relatively short career essentially kickstarted by eggers in the witch that she is a profoundly compelling presence whilst she is on screen it is difficult to look away from her but as one contemplates olga the less the character seems to exist for anything but another riteofpassage for amleth as a bloody and most certainly trippy revenge tale the northman is astounding in many places eggers may not have created the ultimate viking tale but he has crafted an astonishing spectacle that combines his established style with something larger the film is indeed epic in scope and scale however it feels its most authentic when it is obviously eggers the myth and magic at the heart of the tale are more interesting than the revenge narrative eggers also seems somewhat forgiving of the brutality of viking culture amleth is our hero and because of what befell him his violence seems justified eggers does end on a nihilistic note that then transforms into a reward for amleths bloody vengeance to an extent eggers films are open to many interpretations and the northman is no exception however as a visual experience it is marvelous even if it isnt as thematically rich as his previous works strap in for a wild and violent ride and let eggers engulf your senses
Aug 16 2023,positive, despite covid we finally got back to the movies the way we knew them as evidenced by top gun maverick and avatar the way of water buzzing and flooding the box office there were fewer masks id checks or sitineveryotherseat stipulations but streaming did make clear inroads on how we see entertainment of the 10 films the day selected for our top films of 2022 two decision to leave and rrr played exclusively on the small screen three are nonenglishlanguage three had limited releases emily the criminal gods country and fire of love and can now be found on streaming platforms but resonated enough with the days critics to make the list and there is one documentary a diverse list of mustsees the latest from korean director park chanwook oldboy the handmaiden is a dark crime drama in which the lives of a police detective and murder suspect intersect and fold in on each other its a psychological thriller that has haejun park haeil looking into the curious death of a skilled rock climber who fell despite safety measures gathering the mountainside evidence makes for an interesting process with a second detective strapped to haejuns back as they rope walk up the sheer surface suspicion falls on the wife seorae tang wei a chinese immigrant whos not quite fluent in korean  did i mention that her departed husband was an immigration official haejun is a handson profiler sort and in scenes when observing seorae hes suddenly in the room a ghost to her observing her its a neat device park throws at us that blurs the lines between reality and projection its also a reflection of haejuns detached demeanor hes an insomniac and has a strangely dysfunctional sex life with his wife natch haejun and seorae have an attraction to each other that hangs dank and ripe in every scene theyre in in the second part of the hypnotic slow burn both have relocated to the same new city where seorae is married to a fund manager and works as a caregiver to the old its here that the film moves into darker territory as seorae is visited by a disgruntled client of her husband who slaps her around the character is actually named slappy and theres another death that cannot be misconstrued an accident or suicide of course haejun is the one assigned the case how park lays down the cards does have reveals but its mostly a deeply internal reckoning by haejun the film feels a bit like a truecrime noir and would make a perfect double bill with countryman bong joon hos memories of murder 2003 about koreas first true documented serial killer tom meek on mubi besides a deep emotional journey the revelation of davy chous return to seoul is the phenomenal debut performance by jimin park as freddie a 25yearold adoptee who travels from her home in france to seoul south korea in reluctant search of her biological parents energized and hypnotic with scenes of freddie letting loose and dancing alone center stage at a bar a bestdancesceneever candidate or a tense family meal broken by translations and clear misunderstandings its the palpable undercurrent of rage communicated by park that links it all together adrift in a world where she is of two and many more parts and struggling to assimilate as a koreanborn transplant who speaks fluent french some english and a modicum of korean  but by norms is expected to behave within korean custom and genuflection when there  her story is a familiar one for many but set apart an aching open wound return to seoul begs the question of where we find our identity how much of it is shaped by where we grow up and with whom and the power of the perception of others ally johnson not in theaters or online todd fields first film in 15 years following little children likely could not have come into existence without its

Jul 25 2023,positive,robert eggers has crafted one for the ages the northman  is a cinematic epic that blew my mind from start to finish lavishing cinematography that brings to life this era visceral violence that adds to the world  a jaw dropping third act
Jul 25 2023,positive, to know director robert eggers is to know a remarkable master of light sound and storytelling all wrapped up in a single film 2019s the lighthouse broke rules when it came to how a simple story could turn into a visual stunner for the senses with eggerss latest the northman the american director takes audiences through a forgotten time of valkyries vikings and revengewhich is definitely a dish served very very cold  the northman stars alexander skarsgard as amleth a viking prince on a journey to avenge his fathers death and save his mother from the hands of his evil uncle sound familiar it should as it is the same basic plot of shakespeares hamlet and disneys the lion king similarities aside the northman proves to be a standalone film that is a cut above the rest we start with a young amleth in 895 ad traversing his life in the north atlantic with his father king aurvandil ethan hawke and his mother queen gudrun nicole kidman their kingdom is a snow covered wonderland where the king is always tasked with the ungodly chore of battling others to keep his family and kingdom safe unfortunately for the king the true evil comes from within his own family as his only brother fjolnir claes bang plots against him to take over the kingdom while witnessing the death of his father at the hands of his uncle in a torturous ambush young amleth flees his homeland uttering his creed to himself i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir we cut to a much older and hot as fuck amleth who is a true viking in an animalistic society where he helps to destroy towns and take others as his prisoner fit and full of rage amleth is the definition of strength on the outside while wrestling with demons of hate on the inside still intending to follow through with his promise to his father and mother amleth hears rumors of his uncles whereabouts and sets off on a plan to finally take what is rightfully his  boarding a slave ship as a stowaway amleth meets the incredibly beautiful olga of the birch forest anya taylorjoy who agrees to become his most trusted ally throughout his quest as the slave ship docks in iceland amleth quickly discovers his uncle and mother as well as their two children have taken over this new land as they were dethrowned by others in amleths original kingdom disguising himself as a slave and unrecognizable in his older years he attempts to gain the trust of his uncle before he plans to wield a sword into his fathers killer the northman is an incredibly gifted film full of hostility genealogy strength and desire alexander skarsgard is picture perfect as amleth a man with one solitary vision for how his life should go based upon the dreams of his father anya taylorjoy is ferociously talented as amleths ally and love interest while claes bang gives a truly horrifying performance as the main villain the only drawback to the films success is kidmans casting as it brings memories of when angelina jolie and colin farrell were cast as the motherson duo in alexander kidman and the twist in the middle of the film go hand in hand but it wouldve been preferable to have cast an actress that didnt just play skarsgards battered wife in a famous series big little lies without giving away too much more eggerss use of light darkness and stunning cinematography by jarin blaschke should be reason enough for anyone to see this film 
Jul 25 2023,positive, violent and powerful from start to finish the northman tells an epic period accurate viking tale that easily immerses its audience throughout the entire runtime directed by robert eggers the northman tells a story of revenge when price amleths father is brutally murdered by his uncle amleth seeks revenge years later when he is a strong bloodthirsty viking he embarks on a journey to save his kidnapped mother kill his uncle and avenge his father  viking tales are popular amongst regular movie goers and casual watchers alike and luckily the northmans story excels it is bloody brutal and violent from the getgo and isnt afraid to shock its audience there is action aplenty to keep you invested yet also a great amount of quieter moments that allow us to get to know our characters better with thorough development we follow amleth from a boy to a man and are able to root for him regardless of his flaws and thirst for blood its a wild ride full of fighting violence death revenge love witchcraft and even a couple of twists and turns along the way it is likely to impress many the movies most admirable aspect is undoubtedly its visuals the cinematography is simply stunning from start to finish with excellent attention to detail in regards to framing use of lighting and colour each and every shot appears to be meticulously crafted a trait that can always be found in an eggers flick it makes for a highly immersive experience especially when paired with the enchanting original score from sebastian gainsborough the costume and set design brings everything together harmoniously creating a feast for the ears and eyes its artistic flair is commendable with a cast this stacked the amount of excellent performances was not a surprise nicole kidman is a scene stealer as queen gudrun mother of amleth who was kidnapped by her late husbands brother though her screentime is minimal she packs a punch with her mesmerising performance anya taylorjoy excels as olga of the birch forest a slave who becomes a love interest for our lead and exhibits so much emotion throughout her scenes claes bang also impresses as villain fjolnir the brotherless the target of our leads thirst for revenge however it is alexander skarsgard who shines the brightest in his lead role as amleth he exudes the strength and determination of his character never letting the audience doubt his craft he truly becomes amleth giving a career best performance other notable performances include those from willem dafoe ethan hawke and oscar novak due to eggers previous directorial work with 2015s the vvitch and 2019s the lighthouse its safe to say he had a lot to live up to the northman making its way to many film fans most anticipated lists though this is his first attempt at a blockbusteresque movie that takes a break from the horror genre his artistic flair runs through every scene and it is undeniably eggers he is known for his excellent visuals tension building and unique storytelling and though the northman may be his most accessible to date it stays true to all his best traits eggers has once again created a phenomenal movie that is a testament to his talent and the edge away from horror shows he may have many more strings to his bow he is without a doubt one of the most exciting filmmakers working today to summarise the northman is something special it deserves to be seen on the big screen by as large an audience as possible with its intriguing and engrossing storyline phenomenal acting performances gorgeous visuals and flawless directing it is extremely difficult to find a fault its brutal and violent in the best way possible yet precisely artistically crafted including something for blockbuster fans viking enthusiasts and those who enjoy the finer aspects of cinema
Jul 25 2023,negative,the northman is a story thats been told many times over and save for showcasing the stunning scenery of ireland this adaptation is nothing to write home about
Jul 21 2023,positive, its the question that robert eggers the northman contends with right from the start of his 90million historical epic few directors can command the financial means to explore carnal and macabre depictions of nordic mythology let alone have the privilege of topbilled performers like nicole kidman mouthing old english lines for the sake of historical accuracy fortunately for eggers the expressionistic period horror of the witch and the transgressive eroticism of the lighthouse have given him carte blanche to craft a highoctane adventure that puts other studio films to shame an entirely different beast from his previous two films the northman isnt trying to elevate horror nor dismantle fetishistic fantasies its a fullyformed exercise in realigning blockbuster pictures back to the way they should be big visually breathtaking and bolstered by a unique vision broadly appealing is less an insult towards the film but more towards its association with the homogenized cinematic climate it cuts through its easy to interpret a lack of finesse when the storys distant relative is hamlet and the action looks replicated from other tentpole setpieces and even television see game of thrones longshots but these evaluations overlook the attention to detail unique to this film which is sorely lacking in committeeconstructed films in an attempt to strike a balance in said cinematic climate eggers mentioned that he had gladiator and braveheart in mind he reportedly had to reedit the final cut so as not to require a masters degree in viking history when watching the result is a merging of two worlds the slow and meticulous pace of arthouse films and the mindnumbing excess of mainstream action its a wellrounded meal that everybody can chew on making it liable to some lows but also some unimaginably high highs alexander skarsgård plays prince amleth son of king aurvandill played by ethan hawke and heir to the kingdoms throne at a young age he witnesses his fathers murder at the hands of fjölnir played by claes bang the kings brother this prompts amleth to flee from his home pledging to exact revenge on the usurper save his mother gudrún played by nicole kidman and fulfill what was foretold to him by the kings jester heimir played by willem dafoe in what feels like the films most overlyedited sequence the initial setup is surprisingly breezed through leaving little room to linger on the abovestated characters it isnt a surprise that the following scene is a bloodbath filled with ambitious tracking shots and expert choreography the action sequence is a microcosm of jarin blaschkes ambitious cinematography and his ability to match the brooding atmosphere of the icelandic legend there are many flavors to the films milieu sometimes dredged in greys and blues and other times only lit by the orange emanating from the natural fire its probably not contentious to say that this is a beautifullooking film years later as a berserker amleth finds himself ravaging towns along with fellow vikings he encounters olga played by anya taylorjoy one of the slavic slaves occupying the land of the rus she offers an alternative life to the vengeful prince a breath of normalcy and a return to the ordinary world in heros journey terms besides that taylorjoy offers little to the table and is relegated to her primal attributes of benevolence and mysticism traits which are undoubtedly faithful to the legend but unsubstantiated for modern standards björk also returns after 17 years removed from acting to play a seeress who prophesizes amleths revenge in a brief yet eerie sequence  the films highlight is skarsgårds forceful turn in the lead role but an underrated aspect is the vulnerability he allows to feed into his performance amleth is a dirtied character unflinching in the face of mud and blood and blinded by the viciousness of fate each guttural scream from him is accompanied by a contemplative search for purpose a push and pull between a vengeful life and a free one he decides to be chained as a means of confronting his now exiled uncle and witnessing the noble life snatched from him one can palpably sense the longing and despair that has defined his adulthood skarsgård plays the part with the temerity of a ruthless wolf but hiding underneath the headdress is a broken child who is alone in the world  sjón an icelandic novelist joins eggers in writing the script which is every bit a play in the same way joel coens the tragedy of macbeth was  but on steroids one of the creative liberties they took on for the nordic story is the inclusion of a werewolfinspired coming of age ritual inside a bleak cavern and it plays out as bizarrely as it sounds the inworld mythology has a serene matteroffact quality to it as though visions of arterial family trees and blueeyed warriors riding horses to valhalla were commonplace in this universe its part of the scripts charm and by extension the visual language that translates it
Jul 21 2023,positive, synopsis from visionary director robert eggers comes the northman an actionfilled epic that follows a young viking prince on his quest to avenge his fathers murder although he doesnt have many films under his belt three at this point robert eggers has established himself as one of the most unique and distinctive voices of this new generation of filmmakers along with julia ducournau ari aster anna biller amongst others his features use a motley mixture of symbolic imagery and stalking horror along with the faithful periodic details including dialect costumes and richly layered folktale narratives to create terrifying and memorable pieces one of the reasons his films are so compelling and alluring may be his obsession with researchhe peruses and scrutinizes various texts lexicons and dissertations of the era along with scriptures of actual lived experiences eggers quotes if i cant experience what i write as my own memories it cant be truthful this fixation benefits his features as he brings the historical worldviews of a lost time to modern audiences in artistically bewitching and atmospheric ways i even consider his debut the witch to be close to being a masterpiece it creates a thick atmosphere of dread and conveys the themes of blind religious convictions unlike any picture i have seen in the past decades im not the biggest fan of his followup the lighthouse however i admire most of its cinematic minutiae artistic corpus and concepts now for his third project he partners up with icelandic author and screenwriter sjón who also fun fact has performed with björk and the sugarcubes as johnny triumph to deliver an interpretation of the legend of amleth whos a preeminent figure in medieval scandinavian mythology the northman centers around the prominent figure alexander skarsgård the direct inspiration of the character prince hamlet who was once set to govern the kingdom his father king aurvandill warraven ethan hawke oversaw and reigned over after a fierce battle the king and his kin embrace and celebrate throughout the evening once the nighttime arrives the two go to a forest close by to perform a rite with the help of the fool heimir willem dafoe that will bond the fatherson relationship into something worth more an affinity between kings  there is only one primordial condition to this ritual between the fire if the worst tends to happen and the king perishes amidst battle amleth must avenge his death and the worst indeed occurs when his father is pitilessly murdered by his uncle fjölnir claes bang and his mother queen gudrún nicole kidman was kidnapped by the same people who performed the ruthless act from that point on he escapes on a rowboat out to sea and swears i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir two decades later amlethnow a viking who raids several slavic villagesreceives a vision from a seeress björk with a brief yet fascinating scene she reminds him of his oath to the gods about exacting retribution for his royal progenitors because an act of violence and callousness reminds him of what happened to him he conceals himself as a slave in a ship headed towards his falsehearted uncles new estate fjölnirs perfidious act led to complete dismissal and exile  as they make their way to the new domain amleth meets and romantically bonds with olga anya taylorjoy a young sorceress who is willing to help him pursue retribution in the estate amleth builds trust with fjölnir and his loyal companions so that when the time is right he can strike his mighty sword against him and get vindication for his family name beautifully and carefully crafted by eggers and company the northman takes the norse myth that inspired hamlet and makes it into a mesmerizingly ambitious and brutal revenge tale although there is a large kill count and garners its plentiful buckets of crimson red splattered around the muddy terrains the film is about the tolls savagery takes on a persons life choices and vitalitya nihilistic account of the everlasting succession of barbarity and brutality there are several scenes in which amleth rethinks his actions due to the visceral carnage caused by his influence as he ransacks villages or by others the killings of his own people  this then juxtaposes with the moralities and principles of the different types of people we see throughout the film vikings kings queens sorceresses ordinary folk and the enslaved this is a theme that comes back from eggers previous features however in this case it isnt about religious convictions or the edges of sanity but the cycle of violence theres also the dissimilitude between the male and female characters regarding the male characters eggers is fascinated by portraying the human body in all its ugliness even though skarsgård delivers a muscular berserker performance harnessing the spirit of an apex predator while showcasing his washboard abs theres burping and farting like pattinson and dafoes drunken ramblings in the lighthouse as the signs of manhood and bonding between the men yet at the same time we see their bodies abused and defiled as if humanity is meant to suffer for eternity this helps to make the northman not only a compelling watch but a challenging and hurting one as well in a good way of course you can sense the physicality of the sword swings or the punches thrown during the fights  on the other side of things the women and womanhood are treated esoterically or mysticalesquealmost sacred however the movie doesnt expand upon these characteristics as much as one would like to however thanks to kidman and taylorjoys acting chops this flaw is overcome mostly but not completely the other minor issues that the film contains have to do with its final emotional pull and its cold demeanor like most shakespearian play adaptations or other similar works there will be many who already know the grand scheme of things not the brilliant final battle but its conclusion that wasnt the problem the problem was that its ending overall isnt as emotionally enthralling as one might expect nor does it reach the thematic richness of the witchs finale when compared it feels a bit smaller nonetheless you are in awe of eggers directorial abilities most specifically because this is a grander scope with a budget of 75 million dollars thanks to focus features for giving such an innovative auteur a big bag of cash to realize his visions  most of the northmans elements are exquisitely detailed the costume design by linda muir and louise cassettari craig lathrops production design and the entire sound team to take you back to the bestial 10th century in addition the work of cinematographer jarin blaschke is pretty darn good the way he shoots the films action set pieces is outstanding he lets them breathe and develop slowly with tracking shots so the viewer can be way more immersed in the story blaschke also isnt afraid to let the camera linger in front of the actors faces so we can sense every emotion the characters are going through there is a lot to admire in eggers latest and its possible that with a rewatch you could appreciate the details more and analyze the themes indepth the reflections of the cycles of violence passed down from generation to generation is a fascinating concept and eggers finds a way to balance feral entertainment with simplistic scenes of dramatic heft the studio interference comments that appeared a few days ago dont seem like much happened it doesnt appear to have narrowed his vision as it has his stamp all over the 137minute runtime by the time the end credits hit you will be waiting for it to begin anew and that is one of the highest compliments you could give a movie of this size and breadth 
May 9 2023,positive, alexander skarsgård leads a stellar cast in robert eggers latest the northman which provides all the weirdness gore beauty and singularity that you would expect from this directors take on a viking tale of vengeance its a classic eggers equation adding together met expectations of his stylised and violent version of an historic epic with rabid commitment from his actors which certainly equals a movie with undeniable power  whether its to everyones tastes or not on only his third featurelength film following the witch and the lighthouse its impressive that the writer and director already has a distinguishableenough style that audiences can know what to expect and strap themselves in accordingly however for every horror fan that thrills at the literal gutspilling and decapitation as well as repeatedly bizarre religious rituals around bonfires there are others less enraptured by his bold vision which does have a tendency towards indulgence at moments with young viking prince amleth played ably by oscar novak before skarsgård at its heart the northman follows the youngsters growth as he flees his home following the murder of his father king aurvandil ethan hawke by his uncle fjölnir claes bang powered by his own personal motto to avenge his fathers death save his mother queen gudrún nicole kidman and kill his treacherous uncle amleth returns years later to carry out his plan the northmans great cast lives up to what youd hope from such starry and suitably scandinavianheavy billing everyone has wholeheartedly embraced the intensity eggers likes to draw out from his actors sometimes its exhausting simply watching even if its only little snippets of delightful bizarreness were treated to from björk and eggers returner willem dafoe claes bang is a worthy adversary to skarsgård with the irresistible suave charm he had as dracula for the bbc in 2020 replaced by steely aggression while nicole kidman has a properly meaty role in which to sink her teeth anya taylorjoy also returns to an eggers role after leading 2015s the witch once again lending her ethereal beauty and delicate touch to the part of toughasnails slave olga however the film rests mainly and comfortably on skarsgårds massive shoulders dialling it up to what can only be described as beast mode for a fair chunk of the film he has the physique presence and swedish pedigree for it and weve seen him show off his brand of almost noble savagery before in spades in his international breakthrough role on vampire show true blood although a more accessible film than the lighthouse sharing a similar ability with the witch to ground itself in the history and faith of its setting the northman does lean heavily into its weird rituals and visions alongside the dark violence of viking gore which is exactly where youd expect to find eggers the northmans chuckles are few and far between due to its nearunrelenting grimness although odd moments of light relief are peppered in  consider yourself warned if you dont think youll be in the mood for a man having his freshly choppedoff head placed up his ae  if youve got a celebrity story video or pictures get in touch with the metrocouk entertainment team by emailing us celebtipsmetrocouk calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our submit stuff page  wed love to hear from you
May 9 2023,positive, in matt reeves the batman robert pattinson tries out im vengeance as the caped crusaders latest cinematic catchphrase in robert eggers the northman alexander skarsgårds prince amleth takes it up a few notches preparing himself in the style of kill bills beatrix kiddo and gladiators maximus decimus meridius for a roaring rampage of bloody gladiatorial revenge on his nasty uncle fjölnir claes bang whose character is soon enough fjölnir the brotherless loosely inspired by the medieval scandinavian legend that gave birth to william shakespeares famous and tragic dane hamlet the northman  despite a whopping budget that started at an estimated 65 million and finished closer to 90 million  is not likely to see the same kind of box office receipts enjoyed by reeves 2022 blockbuster even so one marvels that in eggers short career he has been able to accomplish that rare feat the delivery of auteurist visions immediately recognizable for meticulous period details and a commitment to uncompromising storytelling craft the northman also retains the filmmakers deep respect for the weird and the uncanny both the witch and the lighthouse 93 and 109 minutes to the 137 of eggers 2022 film are weirder and more uncanny however due in no small part to their closer proximity to the horror genre the northman has a few tricks up its sleeve but amleths mantra  i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir  is indeed the essence of the plot eggers  writing this time with icelandic lyricist poet novelist and performer sjón  plays it straighter and safer than expected a key twist cracks the door to a stunning possibility that should lead amleth to ask himself a variant of another pattinsonaffiliated meme staple what if im the bad guy had eggers and sjón focused on the intricacies and complexities of that idea the northmans inevitable climactic duel  a spectacular oneonone gates of hel holmgång visually reminiscent of obiwans dismantling of vader alongside the lava flows of mustafar  might have delivered something unforgettable the northman has much to recommend it even though björks part is small and not especially significant fans can rightfully cheer the big screen return of the icelandic musician absent with the exception of drawing restraint 9 since she paid the price to an abusive lars von trier in dancer in the dark more than two decades ago anya taylorjoys olga of the birch forest adds enough promise to make one wish the movie was called the northwoman while willem dafoes holy fool heimir is better than any cg effect and i just cant stop thinking about the striking orthodontics or dental adornments worn by the screaming shield maiden ann thompson and neil taylors arden shakespeare edition of hamlet claims the story is second only to cinderella as the worlds mostfilmed although the flood of dracula variants sherlock holmes iterations and versions of a christmas carol are in the conversation eggers has joked that his longgestating remake of nosferatu could be cursed by the ghost of f w murnau but i hope he gets to it in the near future the northmans carefully choreographed singleshot takes and startlingly lit closeups  designed in collaboration with cinematographer jarin blaschke  blow the spatially disorienting and overedited style of so many contemporary action films completely out of the fjord greg carlson gcarlson1972 is a professor of communication studies and the director of the interdisciplinary film studies minor program at concordia college in moorhead minnesota he is also the film editor of the high plains reader where his writing has appeared since 1997
Feb 18 2023,positive, the northman is practically bursting with testosterone the story of amleth alexander skarsgård a viking prince hellbent on revenge robert eggerss third film is essentially a case study in the destructive nature of unyielding masculinity true to form eggerss attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking and the meticulous director transports us to the viking age a time when physical strength was synonymous with survival but despite its singular title the northman is also filled with complex female characters subverting its rigid power structure three women queen gudrún nicole kidman olga anya taylorjoy and a mystical seeress björk all play pivotal roles in amleths destiny a battle with his sworn enemy on an icelandic volcano eggerss film may focus on the male obsession with dominance and destruction but he juxtaposes this theme with the socalled mysteries of women the intellect needed to navigate a world based on physical power the men of the northman live and die based on the strength of their bodies but its women survive by the strength of their cunning queen gudrúns introductory line is a harbinger for the dark road ahead as her excited son brings news of the kings return she delivers a sharp warning that he is never to enter her chamber without an invitation quickly softening she expresses both love for her husband and concern for her son whom she worries is not yet old enough to take over the kingdom in the midst of fjölnirs coup a disguised amleth watches the conqueror carry his screaming mother through the village and declare her his new bride incapable of saving her he is forced to leave her behind queen gudrún has now become the damsel in distress he must rescue and his inability to do so will haunt him for the rest of his life years later an adult amleth has been adopted into a viking clan raiding the land of rus after brutally conquering a village he wanders into the ruins of a temple and encounters a blind seeress with a galvanizing prophecy she reminds him of his long ago oath and places in his hand a symbol of the tear he shed in the fragility of his childhood essentially shaming him for his weakness she tells him its not enough to simply be strong he must demonstrate his strength by conquering the man who once stole his power she also foretells of a maiden king who will play a role in his destiny but once again he has no interest in the female element of his fortune though we learn little of her origins the seeress first identifies amleth as a slayer of her people and brother to the men who took her eyes perhaps she views her spiritual knowledge as a tool to emasculate him as revenge for her suffering powerless in the face of a strong enemy she defends herself by reminding amleth of his weakness and sending him off on a path of destruction  amleth finds the perfect opportunity to resume his quest with the shipment of slaves his clan has just captured they are bound for the homestead of fjölnir the brotherless now living in iceland after losing his stolen kingdom to another conqueror amleth poses as a slave and sneaks aboard the ship with no kingdom to fight for his mission is now solely personal assuming his mother has merely been feigning love for the man who kidnapped her he seeks to save her and reassert himself as the conquering hero though he likely sees his quest as altruistic he is ultimately attempting to assuage the guilt he carries from leaving her behind as a child  aboard the ship amleth meets olga of the birch forest a captured maiden from the village hes just conquered known as a spellspeaker she practices a feminine earth magic and vows to free herself through cunning though olga asks for his help amleth soon learns that she is more than capable of defending herself she resists fjölnirs unwanted advances by lifting her skirts to show that she is menstruating and wiping the blood in his face she poisons the stew with mushrooms causing the black dreams that allow amleth to wreak further havoc impressed with her bravery and spiritual knowledge he asks about her practice olga tells him that her magic will stoke the flames of his sword and that the thread of her fate now entwines with his her flexibility stands in contrast to his rigid obsession while olga is content to listen to the earth and follow her cues amleth will destroy anything that stands in the way of his chosen fate  amleth soon learns that the mysteries of women may have more bearing on his destiny than he once believed on the eve of his vengeance he confronts gudrún with his true identity hoping for a joyful reunion he instead learns a devastating truth she was part of the plot to kill amleths father a slave stolen from a village very much like olgas gudrún was claimed and assaulted by king aurvandil and amleth is the product of a coupling she describes as savagery she truly loves fjölnir and was not screaming but laughing on the day in which he freed her from his brothers control even worse she is the one who demanded amleths head seeing her first son as a product of her trauma she ordered his death to destroy all reminders of her painful past mother and son now find themselves in opposition he threatens the happy life shes finally found and she is one of the murders hes sworn to kill  finally reckoning with the mysteries of women amleth is forced to confront the lie on which hes based his life without the strength to physically dominate the women who surround him have used cunning to align themselves with a strong protector gudrún found fjölnir just as olga found amleth though both women genuinely love their chosen partners these relationships likely began as necessary manipulation in search of powerful shelter the seeress gets her revenge by playing on amleths fear and distracting him with the memory of his inadequacy the women of the northman survive by embracing their perceived weakness and using them as a cover to manipulate the minds of men obsessed with strength  ethics and nobility have very little place in this world and gudrún and olga must align themselves with the best bet for their own survival amleth is our hero because he is the lens through which we view the story but he is a member of a viking raid that slaughters villagers and burns children alive the father he idolizes returns to his kingdom with slaves captured from a village he conquered on his voyage the amulet he gives his son was taken from the neck of another prince presumably after his murder though fjölnir is presented as a villain gudrún sees him as a liberator having freed her from a life with aurvandil but fjölnir is a conqueror as well he attempts to rape olga and only backs down because she offends him neither heroes or villains these men are simply a product of their destructive environment and the pillars through which the women must navigate interpretations of eggers intended message may vary but his fiery conclusion demonstrates the futility of amleths quest he does achieve his revenge beheading fjölnir next to a stunning lake of fire but he is mortally wounded in the process both men fall to the ground finally victims of the violence that has dominated their lives amleth dies on the battlefield a highly prized end that guarantees him passage into valhöll the majestic afterlife for slain warriors though amleth has achieved his stated goal an alternate interpretation shows that hes thrown his life away on a meaningless prophecy failing to understand the mysteries of women hes dedicated his life to saving a mother who does not want to be rescued avenging a lecherous king and murdering the man who actually saved his mother  pregnant with amleths twins olga is now the sole survivor of his prophecy and bearer of his familys line given her dedication to a more nurturing faith perhaps she can steer his descendants away from obsessive destruction in a more sustainable direction her daughter will be the maiden king that prophecy foretold and with her mothers guidance will have the opportunity to reject the world of violence so prized by her ancestors with her earth magic olga will teach her children to embrace the constructive threads of their lives wherever they may lead  a new breed of creaturefeatures was unleashed in the 1990s and continued well into the next decade shaking off the ecological messaging of the past these monsters existed for the sake of pure mayhem just to name a few tremors the relic anaconda godzilla deep rising and lake placid all showcased this trend of irreverent creature chaos reptiles and other scaly beasts proved to be a popular source of inspiration for these films but for that extra crawly experience bugs were the best and quickest route spiders in particular led some of the worst infestations on screen in the early 2000s and on the underbelly of this creeping new wave  specifically the directtovideo sector  hangs an overlooked offering of spider horror arachnid in 2000 brian yuzna and julio fernández launched the spanish production company fantastic factory the filmax banners objective was to create modestly budgeted genre films for international distribution and while they achieved their goal  a total of nine englishlanguage films were produced and shipped all across the globe  fantastic factory ultimately closed up shop after only five years arachnid directed by jack sholder alone in the dark a nightmare on elm street 2 freddys revenge the hidden and based on a script by mark sevi was the second project from the shortlived genre house yuzna was drawn to the concept largely because of its universal appeal a monster was marketable in any region regardless of cultural preferences or restrictions there was also the fact that spiders give everyone a case of the heebiejeebies by having extraterrestrial forces be the cause of the spiders mutism and immensity as well as other urgent problems within the story arachnid incidentally pays respect to hollywoods golden age of schlock filmmaking the opening sequence indeed shows a stealth planes pilot jesús cabrero trailing a ufo and its translucent passenger to an island in the south pacific but the alien business is kept to a minimum going forward there is no time to process this seismic revelation of life beyond earth before moving on to the films central plot  several months since the et was last sighted  and after being snuffed out by one of its own accidental creations  a medical team from guam heads to celebes better known as sulawesi nowadays in search of whatever is behind a new illness the doctors played by josé sancho and neus asensi already suspected a spider bite although they failed to consider the biter could be the size of a tank with the descents alex reid as the snarky pilot of this doomed expedition one who has ulterior motives for accepting the job the films core characters go off in search of a spider and hopefully a cure the title makes it seem as if there is only the one arachnid in the story but once chris potter and reids characters plus their team step foot on the island they encounter other altered arthropods yuzna felt sevis script needed more creatures along the way especially before the spider showed up in full view the bug horror commences as one gunsman succumbs to a burrowing breed of crabsized ticks and random characters fend off a horrific centipede with reptilian qualities these are just the appetizers before the greatest arachnid of them all arrives the late ravil isyanov here playing a zealous but sympathetic arachnologist becomes a human lunchable for the spiders eggs and one of the doctors gets a face full of corrosive spider spew so there is no shortage of grisly predation in the film with a few bits of the monsters handiwork possessing a haunting quality to them shot quickly and cheaply arachnid is fastfood horror its convenient and designed for immediate consumption and will likely not linger on the palate usually there is not a lot worth remembering with these slapdash genre productions however this is one case of spider horror where the extra effort made a difference apart from the egregious use of digital imagery in the outset jack sholders film primarily employs practical effects and these are not rubber spiders dangling from strings or being flung at the actors either fantastic factory aimed much higher by securing ddtsfx pans labyrinth hellboy ii the golden army and creature designer and makeup artist steve johnson species blade ii arachnid while far from flawless somewhat redeems itself by having chosen practical effects and animatronics over cgi which had become the new normal in these kinds of films and this class of creaturefeature was definitely not getting the sort of advanced vfx found in the likes of eight legged freaks steve johnsons spider was not the easiest prop to work with and it lacks the movement and versatility of a digital depiction however there is no beating that sense of weight and occupation of space that makes a tangible monster more intimidating viewers will have trouble recalling the human characters long after watching arachnid yet the humongous headliner remains the stuff of nightmares over the years the director has spoken critically of the film he originally held off on agreeing to the offer to direct in hopes that another project a steven seagal picture would finally manifest no such luck and sholder accepted arachnid only on account of his needing the work he said of the film i thought i could  make it halfway decent but i discovered there wasnt a whole lot i could do nevertheless sholders experience as a director of not exactly highbrow yet still rather entertaining horror is evident in what he has since called a dud while there is no denying the reality and outcome of arachnid even the most mediocre films have their strokes of brilliance small as they may be
Dec 26 2022,neutral,northman is one of robert egger best films the scope the scale the atmospheric building of norse mythology is groundbreaking along with some insanely well acted performances and beyond thrilling action and revenge based story must watch masterpiece
Dec 4 2022,positive,the northman creates a unique saga that taps into something truly primal before one hell of an ending
Oct 11 2022,positive, epic allencompassing filmmaking unlike anything seen in  theatres today the northman tells its story of brutal revenge with a  potent blend of scandinavian mythology swordswinging action and  shakespearean dramatics  based on the scandinavian legend of amleth which in turned  inspired shakespeares hamlet the northman blends the brute of john  milius conan the barbarian and the mysticism of john boormans excalibur in a viking movie that is as much about oldworld religion as it is a tale of  revenge in which questing warrior amleth alexander skarsgard receives help  in the form of three witches who foretell prophecies of destiny swearing vengeance upon the head of his uncle fjohir  claes bang for the murder of his father king aurvandil warraven ethan  hawke and enslavement of his mother queen gudrun nicole kidman the hulking  amleth schemes his way into fjohirs isolated isle village where he dispatches his  enemies with extreme prejudice the northman is a film as strange as it is engrossing  the use of norse mysticism creating a world ancient in spirit and brutal in violence  filmed in varied locations in northern ireland the republic of ireland and  iceland director robert eggars along with cinematographer john blaschke the  lighthouse capture the greys the mist and the ancient landscapes  upon which this tale of mysticism and destiny take place skarsgard delivers one of his best turns yet as amleth blending  hulking brutality with moments of introspection as he encounters supernatural  elements beyond his comprehension along with the legacy of a kingdom savagely  taken from him good too is anyataylor joy as olga of the birch forest a  soothsayer and slave who finds love and solace in amleths arms ethan hawke  and willem dafoe leave an impression in minor roles especially dafoe who takes  his penchant for portraying strange characters to new grimacing heights  eggers who previously impressed with the witch and the lighthouse has forever changed the viking film with the  northman an intoxicating and epic blend of violence mysticism and  breathtaking visuals that establishes the presence of a heavyweight filmmaker whose  distinctive vision is needed now more than ever 
Oct 3 2022,positive, if you love hamlet but youve always thought the ending was too upbeat then the northman is the movie for you spectacle pageantry and myth combine with blood mud and abs for a dazzling uproarious viking spree in which alexander skarsgård seeks to avenge the murder of his father with the aid of anya taylorjoy the queens gambit and icelandic national treasure björk  robert eggers the lighthouse brings to life the norse legend that also inspired shakespeares hamlet that of prince amleth who is robbed of his birthright when his father the king is murdered by his own brother the murderous fjölnir claes bang claims not only his brothers crown but his queen nicole kidman as well the young prince narrowly escapes his uncles wrath and is presumed dead but when we meet him again years later he is all grown up into a revengeseeking viking ruthless bloodthirsty welltrained and handy with an ax  ethan hawke plays the doomed king aurvandil and the films first scenes are vital to the emotional core of the film which threatens at times to get lost in gore vital to the story is a long sequence with young amleth and aurvandil in a trippy ceremony led by willem dafoe who you absolutely want as your spirit guide through any ancient nordic hallucinogenic journeys in which you connect with your ancestors and your fate this ceremony bonds young amleth to the father he reveres and hawkes presence although brief on screen is felt throughout the rest of the film without this wellestablished emotional connection amleths bloody adventures would have felt meaningless any one of the elements of wild action fabulous fantasy or high drama could have outweighed the other at any point but eggers keeps things in balance throughout the films lengthy run time the characters are archetypes from ancient lore but grounding moments bring them alive as people who we care about kidman was particularly effective as queen gudrun from whom we do not hear much for at least half of the film when the longsoughtafter reunion between mother and son takes place she unleashes a stunning onslaught of emotion and kidman is electrifying subverting expectations of maternity to say the least but the real reason to watch the northman is because of how it looks eggers develops the stylized sensibility of his earlier films on a grand scale here reveling in the visual spectacle of vast icelandic mountains swiftly flowing rivers of both blood and water forests intestines fire birds and much more recurring visions are rendered gorgeously turning this ancient myth which was eventually translated into hamlet one of the cornerstones of the western canon into a moving illuminated manuscript  contemporary bodies tell a tale you read in your english class and  similar to the even trippier recent the green knight adaptation  this film does not feel oldfashioned in the slightest it is highly accessible but never anachronistic a visceral and vivid dreamscape of an action film the

Sep 24 2022,positive, king aurvandil warraven ethan hawke returns to his kingdom with the bounties of war he greets his wife queen gudrún nicole kidman and gifts his young son amleth oscar novak with a trinket that he had pillaged its a gift fit for a man not a young boy and the starting point for amleths journey into manhood the king has returned from war grievously injured and he refuses to succumb to injuries or die as a grey beard he will die in battle and before he does he wants to ensure that his son is ready for the duties that will be bestowed upon him upon his death in these early scenes of the northman robert eggers sets the stage for a visceral otherworldly exploration of norse mythology and religion the king and amleth venture into a smokefilled inner sanctum where heimir the fool willem defoe acts as their guide summoning the spirits of their ancestors and their descendants to help with this passage from boyhood into manhood but its the tragedy that follows that launches amleth onto a different path one marred with pain vengeance and obsession when they depart from heimir king warraven is slaughtered by his bastard halfbrother fjölnir the brotherless claes bang and the queen is taken amleth barely escapes with his life though given the trajectory that he is set upon the vengeance that consumes his life perhaps a part of him died that day with the young boys vow to avenge his father save his mother and kill fjölnir the northman moves forward in time until amleth now alexander skarsgård is a grown man and an active and willing participant in the pillaging and plundering of neighboring villages its violent bloodthirsty animalistic and true to the history of the vikings the men don wolf pelts beating their chests howling at the moon drinking herbed wine laced with presumably hallucinogenic mushrooms sending them straight into berserker mode its here in this halfslaughtered village that amleth first encounters olga of the birch forest anya taylorjoy whose striking whiteblond hair sets her apart from the rest of the villagers as they are rounding up the villagers to ship off as slaves amleth learns that they are destined to be delivered to the farm that fjölnir has made for himself after being ousted by another king he seizes this opportunity cutting his hair and branding himself as a slave to be sent to fjölnir on the journey to fjölnirs olga recognizes him as a wolf in sheeps clothing but they form a connection that perseveres even in the worst of times upon his arrival amleth discovers that his mother has remained with fjölnir and they have had a son together she seems at least to outside observers to be happy both as a wife and as a mother to fjölnirs eldest son thórir the proud gustav lindh and their son gunnar elliott rose while he could take swift action and avenge his father amleth paces himself there is trust to earn slaves to free seeds to sow and uncomfortable truths to uncover olga is presented to him as an alternative path for his life a deviation from a life filled with vengeance hatred and selfisolation she is gentle and kind but deadly in her own right she is a perfect match for amleth willing to fight alongside him for a future together but ultimately the temptation of valhalla is too strong while the northman does present a shockinglyaccurate portrayal of the 9th century it does employ a healthy dose of hollywood magic to create a compelling and engaging story for the 21stcentury audience while not quite a true story amleth is a figure from scandinavian legends and the basis for william shakespeares tragedy hamlet the connection between the two stories is impossible to ignoreright down to the pointed oedipus complex as someone who has spent the better part of her life entranced with the rich wonders of norse mythology eggers is the first to portray norse spirituality valhalla and figures like the seeress björk and halla the maiden rebecca ineson with the sort of respect that they are owed these arent party city vikings these are vikings whose blood sweat and tears are palpable the seeress and halla arent objects to be desiredthese are women designed to be feared and venerated if the dig whet your appetite for viking boat burials then the northman will be a feast for the historical soul with the sweeping immersive cinematography and the way in which the film fully embraces the beauty and horror of nordic history the northman is positioned to be robert eggers best film yet he leaves no stone unturned reminding the audiences of how violent superstitious and dutybound the nordic people were eggers script which he cowrote with icelandic author sjon provides the groundwork for powerful unexpected storytelling as raw and masculine as so much of the film is perhaps to the extreme even its still focused on the heart of things with a keen intentional line drawn towards the reverence of the feminine skarsgård is utterly transformed by this role more beast than man in the heat of battle but still a boy desperate for the love he never received as a child its a tragedy because amleth was forged by the negligence of the elders around him shaped into a weapon of vengeance that ultimately brings him swiftly into the gates of valhalla but even in the tragedy of it all theres a hope that blooms among the leaves of his family tree and the promise that his line will continue with purposeful emphasis on his daughter the northman coupled with last years oftoverlooked the green knight stands as a stark reminder that there is still a place in cinema for gorgeous inspired odysseys rife with literary allusions deepseated spiritual meanings and an exploration of complex human emotions vengeance is a potent drug more deadly than any hallucinogenic tonic berserker or rabid dog it comes in the dark of the night and strikes right at the heart of even the strongest viking
Sep 8 2022,positive,this brutally violent yet soaringly lyrical action epic is quite unlike anything captured on screen before 
Sep 1 2022,positive, the northman is an epic the likes of which we hardly see in hollywood anymore carefully curated by a master of the medium  packed with powerhouse performances from his very first feature film its been clear that robert eggers is a bit of a rulebreaker whether it comes to tackling shocking or seemingly taboo subject matter or turning in scripts that are often borderline incomprehensible to those who arent well versed in 17th or 19th century english theres no denying that eggers has quickly established his own signature style in todays cinematic space which is no small feat advancing to become one of the most defining auteurs of the era who is beholden to no artistic restriction and as a result of knocking it out of the park twice in a row with cinephiles and critics with 2016s the witch and 2019s the lighthouse eggers was granted his least creative constraints yet with this years the northman along with differing in distribution from his first two films both of which were distributed by a24 while northman is in the fine hands of focus features the northman comes with a 90 million budget  over 20x the witchs and 9x the lighthouses  and a runtime of nearly 2 ½ hours while the witch and the lighthouse ran for 93 minutes and 109 minutes respectively since the start weve known that the northman was going to be a story told on an unprecedented scale for eggers but while some artists achieve new professional actualization when their creativity cant be curbed others crumble under the pressure of making the jump from indies to blockbusters and meeting studio demands luckily eggers is no such artist delivering his best film to date with the northman  an epic the likes of which we hardly see in hollywood anymore carefully curated by a master of the medium our chaotic chronicle commences as a young prince amleth oscar novak awaits the arrival of his father king aurvandill ethan hawke of the before trilogy and moon knight from war injured aurvandill confides in his wife and amleths mother queen gudrún nicole kidman of big little lies and being the ricardos that he must start showing amleth the ways of the world in preparation of possibly becoming king himself someday soon with these teachings being relayed by aurvandills friend  and local fool  heimir willem dafoe of spiderman no way home and aquaman however upon leaving their communion aurvandill and amleth are attacked by fjölnir claes bang of the square and the girl in the spiders web aurvandills brother and amleths uncle with the former succumbing to his slaughter and the latter escaping to the ocean vowing to return to avenge his father and save his mother years later we find that amleth alexander skarsgård of true blood and passing has taken up with a pack of traveling raiders abandoning his quest in favor of mindlessly savage and superficial pursuits but a chance meeting with the seeress björk of dancer in the dark reminds him of his true purpose sending him back to his homeland where he discovers that fjölnir has lost his familys kingdom and is now instead a feudal lord with gudrún as his wife who has bore his son posing as a slave amleth slowly integrates himself into fjölnirs feudal community where he also falls for fellow slave  and sorceress  olga anya taylorjoy of the queens gambit and last night in soho who shows him an alternative path in life one defined by hope instead of hurt yet can he ever escape the emotional corruption that has consumed him since childhood or is violence doomed to beget more violence until the end of time as soon as this story starts audiences are instantly enraptured by the immensely eerie yet utterly enthralling aesthetic robert eggers is so famously known for  combining jarin blaschkes consummate cinematography with staggering sound work from james boyle james harrison and steve little and sebastian gainsborough and robin carolans striking score  as his trusted crew is not only firing on all cylinders but additionally operating at a higher level than ever before as a result of being given their greatest cinematic canvas yet  every shot is a sumptuous masterwork fully immersing us in these brutal yet oddly beautiful environments so that we too can see the dawn of the sun as distinctly as amleth and his fellow slaves or hear the horrific hackingandslashing as if such slayings were happening only a few feet away few creatives have such a commendable command over the synthesis of cinematic sights and sounds as robert eggers does and thats the first thing that separates the northman from similar historical revenge sagas like braveheart or gladiator  for starters none of em look or sound as good as this one similarly though the northman clearly takes after the setup of a famous shakespearean play amleth  hamlet anyone eggers and cowriter sjón lamb do enough to differentiate their take on the classic tale despite amleth serving as inspiration for the tragedy of prince hamlet in the first place to shape a story that stands on its own structurally the passage of time added between aurvandills passing and amleths revenge serves to make his mission more meaningful and monumental while an additional character arc for kidmans gudrún this adventures alternate for hamlets gertrude and an entirely original character in the form of taylorjoys love interest olga not only finetune the female players in amleths cough hamlets cough life but also present him with new quandaries to consider his relationship with olga in particular is not only conceptually riveting from starttofinish but ultimately unbearably emotionally resonant as hes forced to choose between a potentially prosperous future with her or putting away the pains of his past for good with ruinous results likewise eggers and sjón cleverly complicate amleths crusade to avoid advocating for a message that revenge or violence is in any way rewarding or fulfilling most notably with tragic third act revelations that completely reframe amleths entire expedition  and existence  up until this point assuring that every action that follows is accompanied by a piercing prescience indicating that amleth will never achieve the alleviation from this anguish that he so desires the two also candidly challenge the suggestion that ones fate is set in stone especially via taylorjoys olga as she pleads with amleth to remember that he has a choice in life and can break this cycle of violence releasing him and everyone else from this collective enmity eggers and sjón compassionately characterize the viking culture of the era to show what belief systems they subscribe to and why but they simultaneously establish an engrossing dialogue between tradition and philosophical transformation making this the rare revenge epic that has more on its mind than murder every actor in this exhilarating ensemble is similarly at the top of their game no matter how many scenes they star in led by alexander skarsgård in an aweinspiring animalistic turn as the assiduous amleth prevailing when it comes to portraying his protagonists propulsive physicality but excelling just as efficiently when it comes to his essential emoting in the affecting third act bringing a greater insight into just how broken this behemoth of a man truly is  though most of the movie does center around his titular northman every other performer matches his might when asked to contribute their piece to the plot from willem dafoe and björk with startling nearsinglescene performances to ethan hawkes admirable ardor as king aurvandill to claes bangs frigid ferocity as fjölnir to anya taylorjoys opulent optimism as olga and last but not least to the glorious nicole kidman as queen gudrún who all but steals the show in one momentous monologue to skarsgårds amleth as things start to head south in the homestretch uprooting our entire perception of her part in a way only an adept actress as she can do stylistically and thematically the northman is undeniably robert eggers crowning achievement as a director to date with the auteur succeeding at shaping a raucous revenge saga that stirs the soul as much as it stuns ones senses paired with his positively capable cast and crew eggers brings this era back to life in fierce fashion throwing us into a time and place filled with ferality and fatality but not devoid of faith for a better future delivering a dark depiction of the sobering struggle between fate and free will after making a name for himself in the indie world and now leveling up to blockbuster fare with ravishing results it remains to be seen what challenges are left for robert eggers to conquer but its safe to say that if the northman is any indication hes unquestionably up for the task
Aug 24 2022,positive, twentiethcentury softies like me may experience a film like robert eggers the northman as a contemptuous but invigorating slap in the chops life was hard in ad 895 and every frame of the movie is there to show it in all its magichour snowflecked beauty and all its tornflesh bloodymudpuddle ugliness like eggers two previous films  the witch and the lighthouse both of which i adore  the northman devotes itself to recreating a time long past along with its moods attitudes and details of daytoday life it would be easy indeed to parody the northman with all its shrieking madmen and howling to the black sky and chanting in the old languages but eggers offers up this material so earnestly and with such carefully crafted art that to lampoon it would feel callow and vile  im about 75 on board with the film  it runs a bit long and we start to feel it with about half an hour left to go  but im glad it was made and i hope its poor showing at the box office wont put eggers in movie jail this is the sort of expensive excessive fantasia that sniffs around in deeper darker nooks of cinema largely forgotten about and lifts the art form the northman is loud with a brooding score and metal clashing against metal but it has more in common with silent film than with anything else around based on the legend of amleth which in turn spawned hamlet it seems to want to take us back to the beginning of drama or at least the birth of many tropes it tells the most elemental of stories the one about the son avenging his father and grafts a lot of pagan strangeness and gore onto it  amleth alexander skarsgård is out to get his stinky uncle fjölnir claes bang who murdered amleths father king aurvandill warraven ethan hawke and married his mother queen gudrún nicole kidman for years amleth grunts and growls and readies himself for the moment when he realizes his oath i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir amleths entire life becomes about that after which he guesses hell just kill himself or something because his life will no longer have purpose amleth does pursue a brief interest in the young sorceress olga anya taylorjoy who proposes another level of purpose to amleths life but mainly his fate seems to be mired in rage and pain and blood it may take a little bit before a viewer recognizes that amleth as presented here isnt really the hero just the protagonist  the images appear to be charged by the posthuman energies of spirits and fae the shadows and scents of femininity seem to reduce these crude brutal men to animals and the women dealing with this offthescaletoxic masculinity are in danger of becoming inhuman wretches themselves queen gudrún for instance certainly comes across as vindictive and cruel but to what extent have the culture of 895 and its sickening rules rape is no big deal its part of every kings victory lap made her that way there are other men though noncombatants fools hewitches who have wiser heads  until they lose them to someone with a hotter head plus a sword the northman seems simple or simplistic until we start turning it around and peering at it   the sensibilities we see in the movie are very remote from ours we could almost be watching aliens sometimes the film has a harshly musical icelandic vibe eggers recruits the icelandic poet sjón as his coscripter here and puts björk in majestic electrocutedpenguin garb as a character called the seeress as i said the narrative begins to drag a little but the compositions and the colors of night and the casts dedication to exploring longgone behaviors  all of this is firstrate the northman might be my least favorite eggers project but that means nothing  oh its only a b or maybe even an a eggers goes big here and uses paints he hasnt used before his three films feel alike in that they could all unfold in the same uncanny demonhaunted universe at different times but theyre also very distinct accomplishments eggers is still a major reason to stay interested in whatever movies are becoming
Aug 8 2022,positive, id love to have been a fly on the wall for the pitch um its an adaptation of a 12thcentury norse folk tale about a prince avenging the death of his father  you know shakespeare well this one inspired hamlet its going to be really violent and much of it will be subtitled in norse but the farting and burping scene with ethan hawke is really going to work  trust me ethans put in a lot of work oh and we got björk for the witch

Jul 26 2022,positive, hey so you might have noticed my reviews havent been as frequent this year well due to both professional and personal reasons ive not been able to give the site as much attention as i would like your girl has got a lot of plates spinning right now and as much as i love doing it alternative lens isnt as important as my ultimate career aspirations or my mental health however that didnt mean i stopped seeing as many movies in fact ive seen so many more so far this year than i had by this time in 2021 so as a result my biannual attempt to catch up on everything i didnt have time to do a full review of or didnt have much of a take to warrant doing one or just saw way too late is now much larger than itd usually be but if you really need to know my thoughts on a movie as soon as ive seen it give me a follow on letterboxd here  ill often do my quick thoughts on movies straight after ive seen them including first watches of older films or revisiting movies ive seen before so if youve been missing me on here and looking for more altlens content head on over to letterboxd its where all the cool kids are these days disclaimer i only saw this movie because i had time to kill and was able to see it for free i would never have bothered otherwise cos i aint giving any of my money to mumsnet anita bryant most films end up being overhyped and cant help but be disappointing once you finally see them this is one of those rare exceptions everything everywhere all at once takes advantage of every aspect of the cinematic form to tell a story you couldnt do justice in any other medium its up there with mad max fury road spiderman into the spiderverse and the matrix in that its a movie that fully embraces the spectacle and artistry of cinema whilst never forgetting about what really matters story character and theme michelle yeoh has never been better stephaine hsu is a revelation ke huy quan truly a star reborn i hope this is just the start of a renaissance for him and who could ever say a bad thing about james hong or jamie lee curtis but the real stars here are the daniels the screenplay and direction are just pure perfection yes one could nitpick about certain logic gaps but if youre focusing that much on those insignificant details then youre watching movies wrong the way theyve balanced all the genre elements and absurdist comedy whilst also tackling some pretty dark and serious subject matter is the stuff of legends the kind of excellence that will be studied and gushed over by film academics for decades to come if theres a better movie than this in 2022 then 2022 will have been a bloody landmark year for cinema 1010 there are honestly worse movies this year but on a moral level id rather you watch them than this because at least there you dont have to give a portion of your purchase to prosecco orson scott card no if you read my review in full youd see i had plenty of criticism of the film itself mainly the sloppy writing and lack of whimsy i would have given the same score regardless of any personal feelings about the screenwriter and her opinions its just an added reminder to readers about the commerce behind art which whether you ignore it or not exists and has an impact on the success of a piece also this is my website theres no code of conduct stopping me from expressing my personal opinions if i were writing this for another site i would probably hold back those thoughts but here i dont have to you dont have to like my opinion but not you or anyone else gets to police what i say i thought folk like you were all about freeze peach and all that
Jul 15 2022,negative,it is disappointing that the northman goes past what would have been a truly radical ending and extends itself for a zany climax that qualifies as valhalla porn

this sense the northman resembles other recent filmsthe green knight for example based on the arthurian chivalric romance and martin scorseses mob drama the irishmanthat place preordained male violence in a nihilistic almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic these films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a persons life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary incidental or vaguely foolish partway through amleths campaign his mother gudrún confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited fjölnirs act of betrayal enraged amleth kills his uncles son but he isnt dissuaded from his goal at the beginning of his final confrontation with fjölnir instead of rescuing gudrún amleth murders her in a struggle in these films the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time their blood feuds which give them purpose contain no inherent depth eloquence or special insight by the films conclusion amleths commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect rolling forward on the strength of its own preordained inertia if in hamlet a princes desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia the northmans amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien this singleminded devotion to fate would benefit from eggerss anthropological insight without it were left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny no matter how destructive may offer transcendence in a grim chaotic world hate is all i have ever known amleth tells olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill fjölnir but i wish i could be free of it the northman is a brutal and violent film felt in both its protagonists appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning enslaved laborers are killed at random in the continuous shots of battle that eggers favors half a dozen discrete horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds during the raid on the slavic village early in the film amleth rips out a mans throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf but the film suddenly cuts ahead to just after the battle amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over panting and bleeding from open cuts their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain a separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raids aftermath in the longer view amleths group dominant in battle gains the connotation of hired muscle useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards that moment has curious implications it presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled and casts amleths quest in an almost entrepreneurial light but those threads arent pursued soon after amleth hears about fjölnirs loss of his kingdom and his departure to iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe fjölnir killed his brother for nothing now hes a sheep farmer the fighter says laughing as the cycle of fate starts over again  barely avoiding capture

knight for example based on the arthurian chivalric romance and martin scorseses mob drama the irishmanthat place preordained male violence in a nihilistic almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic these films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a persons life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary

much invited fjölnirs act of betrayal enraged amleth kills his uncles son but he isnt dissuaded from his goal at the beginning of his final confrontation with fjölnir instead of rescuing gudrún amleth

laborers are killed at random in the continuous shots of battle that eggers favors half a dozen discrete horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds during the raid on the slavic village early in the film amleth rips out a mans throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf but the film suddenly cuts ahead to just after the battle amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over panting and bleeding from open cuts their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain a separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raids aftermath in the longer view amleths group dominant in battle gains the connotation of hired muscle useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards that moment has curious implications it presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled and casts amleths quest in an almost entrepreneurial light but those threads arent pursued soon after amleth hears about fjölnirs loss of his kingdom and his departure to iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe fjölnir killed his brother for nothing now hes a sheep farmer the fighter says laughing as the cycle of fate starts over again  we next see amleth played as an adult by alexander skarsgård years later now a formidable warrior applying his martial prowess to raiding slavic villages his revenge oath has been indefinitely deferred in favor of pillaging with a band of shamanic berserkers he isnt yet aware of fjölnirs movements that his uncle has lost his land and fled to iceland only after the urging of a mystical figure played by the musician björk does amleth resume his quest he disguises himself as a slave bound for fjölnirs settlement once he arrives he plans a series of escalating attacks with the help of another captive a slavic sorceress named olga anya taylorjoy the campaign eventually destroys the remnants of fjölnirs kingdom and amleth faces his rival in a final duel at the top of a volcano although the northman represents eggerss most ambitious project yet both in its narrative scope and budget he is known for choosing stories like thisspooky historical dramas that can skew melodramaticand managing to avoid sentimentality and shtick through obsessive anthropological detail in his previous films the witch a horror film set on the edges of a 17thcentury new england puritan settlement and the lighthouse a darkly funny 19thcentury drama that follows two bickering lighthouse keepers in their descent into madness eggers has a knack for collecting periodspecific ephemeraphrases from accounts of demonic possession antique camera lenses a museumreplica pagan rattle and handstitched costumesto make a coherent facsimile of a world when the method works tenets that might seem prosaic to modern viewers become vivid and urgent located within a faithful reproduction of the setting that produced them although there are flashes of this sensibility throughout the northman the film falls into an awkward middle ground between blockbuster epic and the cerebral historical dramas that preceded it not quite filling either prompt moments of revelatory strangeness come inconsistently and they feel disjointed from a plot thats too unwieldy for verisimilitude alone to carry the sequences that lack a sense of context to animate them can feel rote or even sillya scene in which amleth duels a ghost skeleton for a magic sword for example a couple of instances of animalbased deus ex machina or the abrupt end of olga and amleths romantic relationship soundtracked with a swell of music that make its pathos feel forced still beyond the less convincing scenes there are

he cant take his final revenge on fjölnir until the terms of the prophecy made by the seer in the slavic village are met it was foretold that i would slay my fathers killer in a burning lake amleth says until that day comes i will torment the man who made my life hell we thirst for vengeance but we cannot escape our fate in the meantime with olgas help he executes a gruesome series of attacks on

Jun 29 2022,positive,the northman isnt exactly a triumph but with its many knockout moments it represents a big step forward for the youngish director robert eggers who for the first time has a big budget 90 million to work with 
Jun 28 2022,positive, caution there are some very general spoilerish observations in this review that concern its closing scenes and the relationship between those scenes and the endings of robert eggers previous films the witch and the lighthouse its kind of amazing how many films ive seen built upon the inigo montoya mantra lets say it together you killed my father prepare to die its even more amazing how fundamental that storyline is considering the fact that i have never met a single human being whose father has been murdered by a traitorous acquaintance nor have i ever met anyone who had an opportunity to go on a revenge quest and yet just this morning in conversation with a wise counselor what was i wrestling with i was tending to some wounds that i suffered as a young boy during a season of my fathers unemployment at the time i believed  passionately  that teachers and school administrators had wickedly conspired against him top end his job as a teacher i remember feelings of rage helplessness and humiliation over the idea that anyone could take power away from my parents in ways that would make them suffer hardship that was only the beginning there was a lot that i know now that i did not understand then i had a lot of growing up to do thus even though i am weary of revenge narratives i feel some measure of understanding and sympathy for the deeply wounded young hero of robert eggerss new film the northman he too as a young boy witnesses his father removal from a place of power and influence he too suffers emotional trauma and lets his fury harden into resentment that becomes a controlling factor in his life revenge is foolishness but that doesnt mean that stories about it are worthless sure there is an epidemic in american entertainment of stories that glorify revenge  and thats a toxic trend but tales of vengeance can follow a righteously angry hero to so many possible conclusions not only a violent reckoning or ruin but also grace forgiveness reconciliation i love lee isaac chungs film munyurangabo which i saw a whole decade before he made the oscarwinning minari its a powerful story of a revenge quest that leads its angry and heartbroken antihero to a surprising turn its a surprising story that finds hope at the end of a journey that began in trauma and wrath such stories are very rare throughout human history but even if revenge tales end in the achievement of violence they can become meaningful tragedies in choosing violence over longsuffering and love an antihero can illustrate the wages of sin and provide us with a cautionary tale consider hamlet the choice to answer killing with killing leads to greater consequences for everyone ive always found the prevalence of such violence in mythology interesting  celtic tales greek myths whatever the origin  for how it illustrates the values and beliefs of particular peoples places and times i first learned about the norse god vidar also known as the silent god and the god of revenge while paying very little attention during a boring college class on mythology you want vidar on your side if youre on a revenge quest after all according to his origin story vidar knows the territory wreaking vengeance he tore apart fenrir the wolf who had killed his own literal godfather odin but why is vidar described as a god of silence and revenge the combination struck me as curious was vidar silent because silence is an essential talent for someone who is determined to sneak up on a dangerous tyrant and kill him that makes sense  especially if the villain might be anticipating such retaliation could it also be that a god of revenge is violent precisely because he is silent about his anger bottle up hard feelings and youll end up with a volcanic eruption thats some heavy wisdom  ive learned it from watching others in my family and community ive learned it in my own experience nevertheless i have no doubt that contemporary revenge narratives influence a culture that has such a huge appetite for them the increasing violence in american culture wars seems to me to be influenced by these stories make an audience angry enough and they will cheer for all manner of violence and that includes christian audiences as evidenced by the popularity of braveheart among evangelical christians and their increasing support for violent uprisings against their culturewar enemies even though such uprisings are obviously contrary to jesuss own teachings so i had good reason to approach eggerss new movie with skepticism reading about the basic narrative arc of the northman i became nervous that this might become just a fancier more enthralling version of the kind of narrative that quentin tarantino consistently serves up a lurid feast appealing to an audiences bloodlust and even more worrying than that  a nordic revenge story right now a story about clans of white people warring like animals in an endless cycle of violence and retaliation making speeches about defending their bloodlines doesnt that sound like the glorification of whats going on all around us in the world right now and threatening not only our hopes for peace and justice but even our hopes of an inhabitable planet for future generations i admire his two previous films the witch 2015 and the lighthouse 2020 both tell stories of characters who remove themselves from the trouble of society as if that will help the efforts of those characters fail  as they distance themselves from some sources of trouble they learn the hard way that they have brought plenty of trouble with them into their isolation now suffering in remote places they have no community to rely on for help even more troubling both films depict their doomed protagonists devolving into a kind of ecstatic madness a victory that i dont believe audiences are meant to believe in or celebrate i think were supposed to recoil at their choices and at the frightful consequences i interpret both as cautionary tales  or better cautionary nightmares  about how our impulses can lead us straight to hell and i think we are shown that just the satan of miltons paradise lost determines to make a heaven of hell so these characters fail to discern the gravity of their error thinking they have somehow triumphed whats more i think eggerss filmmaking powers are formidable while both stories strike me as meaningful and worth studying the witch and the lighthouse also look and sound extraordinary their exquisite aesthetics conjuring a powerful sense of spiritual darkness their scripts composed with a richly literary complexity the lines delivered by actors who have mastered difficult dialects or is it just another braveheart justifying vengeful violence in the name of some kind of god throwing fuel on the fire of the violent fantasies of the culture warriors who threaten democracy for many moviegoers  perhaps most  the northman will play like a darker bloodier version of gladiator in which the audience roots for a suffering hero he never quite says it but the mantra is there all the same he might have said my name is prince amleth you fjölnir the brotherless killed my father king aruvandil warraven prepare to die instead he says i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir we watch amleth alexander skarsgård gird up his loins and sharpen his lances to carry out violent vengeance against a tyrant claes bang who took the throne of his father ethan hawke by treachery and also made the queen gudrún nicole kidman his own by force the northman is basically the urhamlet a version of classic story that predates any of shakespeares concerns about ophelia or the role of the players in catching the conscience of the king this is the most fundamental of revenge quests this amleth doesnt care about wordplay he devotes his life to the long game of stealth and vengeance his intent easy readable in the creases of his forehead and the scowl of his posture amleth gets a decadelong training in viking masculinity complete with  fireside dances and chants handtohand combat costumes of animal skins communion with wolves and with witchcraft including a seeress played by none other than the great sorceress of pop music bjork and with a sort of crossfit program that involves a lot of rowing its easy to root for him at first but there is a strange contradiction at the movies heart  manifested in the character of olga anya taylorjoy amleth and olga form a tenuous bond of mutual support as they earn their way up the chain of slavery to fjölnir the brotherless until they find themselves in  iceland  fjölnir has been driven out of his own kingdom and forced to settle elsewhere  at the edge of fjölnirs inner circle and family when they get there amleth is troubled to discover that the story he has told himself throughout his life has been a false narrative fake news those events that traumatized him in childhood they werent as simple as hed imagined it wasnt just a case of the evil world committing sins against a saint olga the tender and beautiful slave who sees amleths hardship so clearly becomes a beacon of wisdom and hope in his life its seems only right that shes played by anya taylorjoy the actress who has in my opinion eyes that seem to have been custom made for the cameras attention yea more than the eyes of any actor living or dead her tremendous shining eyes give olga a sense of seeing so much more than amleths narrow and bloodshot eyes ever could she eventually comes to see a hope for the two of them to break away from the path of violence and find a more meaningful and rewarding life somewhere else she wants to set amleth free from the dangers of clinging to the source of his wrath that false narrative he has believed that false narrative that he might now see clearly and overcome here is an opportunity to show audiences something so much more than  so much better than  the bloody revenge for which so many of them seem to have an insatiable appetite if i can trust my first experience with the film i think olga becomes the movies conscience we embrace amleths doubts his momentary fear that he might not have any moral high ground to stand on here as he waves his sword around and challenges his foe will amleth choose to reject the wiser more complicated understanding of what was really happening in his youth will he hold to his original emotional response as reasonable as it might have been once upon a time even though he now has a chance to see that it was childish and that it will only lead to more bloodshed and folly i think we are supposed to side with olga in her appeal to dissuade amleth from his quest i have a hard time believing that eggers us to side with amleth in abandoning a future with his family in favor of the glory of a battle to the death i think eggers wants us to see that this is an old old story and that today we can be enlightened enough to glimpse a brighter path so much depends upon how we interpret the films closing moments  which i wont spoil here they complicate matters significantly and give those who disagree with me their best evidenceseveral of the critics i trust the most are upset about this movie making strong arguments that it is not only disappointing but dangerous i completely respect these arguments so rather than claim i have the right reading of this film im inclined to borrow an expression from winston churchill who was speaking about russia not hamlet when he said them eggers film is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma its going to get people talking but at this point i do have a different interpretation of the film  particularly because i cant stop thinking about eggerss two previous films both the witch and the lighthouse give us central characters who turn to the dark side so to speak in their minds and by their chosen values they triumph  sure but they do so at the cost of their own souls at the cost of their souls i am inclined to argue  only every so slightly and im wide open to being persuaded otherwise  that the northman is right in step with those films i believe that amleth is a tragic figure one who is deluded into thinking he has triumphed but from whom we must keep a skeptical distance refusing to celebrate him as triumphant horrified by what has become of him and what will probably likely become of his family his selfaffirming vision at the end is not unlike the ecstatic ascension of the young woman possessed at the conclusion of the witch in the films fiery volcano finale i couldnt help but hear the distant echo of young obiwans cry you were the chosen one yeah amleth mightve been if hed listened the most heroic figure i know had a singular response to unfathomable evil and in his response i find hope for an ultimate deliverance after all once you have started down the dark path if you dont seize upon the moments of grace that are offered you well as the little green guru says forever will it dominate your destiny i prefer the shakespeare version of this story for the record it gives us a clearer vision of wisdom and folly and its truth can set us free  but i think eggers version will stick with me amleths dawning realizations about all that he misunderstood in childhood  these resonate with me some of the work i am doing now is learning to accept revelations about my childhood that were a long time coming in a sense its yet another injury another realization of betrayal it wasnt a case of my family being the good guys and the world around us being the bad guys the impulse to draw lines in such a binary fashion is understandable when someone is hurt but its also childish and it can cause us to take a bad situation and make it far far worse i look back at many years of speaking with contempt for those who i believed to be antagonistic toward my family i look back at the stories i believed the stories i told myself and how they hardened into fury and resentment that have probably burned years away from the potential span of my life the truth is setting me free  but not before the lies some of which have been selfinflicted have done a world of damage im grateful for storytellers who have helped me see the cost of vengeful impulses im grateful for the gospels vision of a braver response that can lead to help and healing thus ive broken away from the masses that cheer for the fulfillment of revenge quests stories of violent heroism always seem like tragedies to me violence is cyclical after all if you respond to violence with violence all youre doing is perpetuating violence in a way that all but guarantees it will continue instead of going all braveheart and raising a weapon in a roaring challenge christ receives his enemies violence with open arms suffers it and refuses to let it remain in the world in canceling violence he saves us  from sins that is the kind of courage and character i find worth celebrating amleth is too blinded by rage and by a perverse cultural milieu of what we now call toxic masculinity to see the better path and that is why his story is such a tragedy hopefully it will be received by audiences for what i believe it is a memorable harrowing cautionary nightmare
Jun 26 2022,positive, theres a recurring wave of unease that subsumes much of robert eggers the northman every moment seems to exist on the verge of disruption as if ephemerality is baked into the structure and so we gain excitement from watching chaos manifested ruptures and disruption are critical to what is at work here so much so that the first image of the film is a volcanic eruption that envelopes the screen danger is imminent and of course it is this is a miserable and punishing world how wonderful then that for all the cruel misery at work the northman feels propulsive and exciting even as we work our way methodically to inevitable areas of tragedy and despair this world might be miserable but the filmmaking on display is energising and exciting eggers film cowritten with icelandic poet sjón is based on the legend of amleth our hero by saxo grammaticus a tale of norse mythology that is more readily remembered as the source for shakespeares hamlet although thinking of the northman as a viking version of hamlet misses out some of the specific weirdness that feels endemic to eggers work as a filmmaker over his threefilm oeuvre whether implicit or explicit shakespeare remains an influential figure in film over the last two centuries and eggers variation on the very familiar tale of the embittered son avenging the name of his dead father is one that feels innately familiar but nothing in eggers approach to this story feels familiar or banal i spent a lot of the northman remembering how dull i found so much of the approach to the narrative in joel coens the tragedy of macbeth earlier this year of course coen was working with a more straightforward adaptation of that particular play but the most telling attitude of eggers take on the angry vengeance at the root of his film a similar emotion that is essential for macbeth feels tactile and visceral in a way that resists any notions of austerity remoteness or reticence eggers approach is confrontational he demands our attention and then plays with our senses bringing the northman to climax after climax that challenges our perception of this world a brief prelude where we meet the young amleth and learn about the dynamics of this world effectively establishes this this tactility jarin blaschkes camera moves through the shadowy castle in a way that makes even the most regal parts of this world look grimy and uncomfortable so we meet nicole kidmans queen gudrún who is imposing and fearsome as much as she is beautiful and beguiling her energy provides an intriguing dynamic with ethan hawkes weary king aurvandill who offers a paternalistic countenance that feels warm but ambiguous enough for amleth to spend the rest of the film wishing to avenge him king aurvandills murder is an early highpoint that confirms eggers willingness to confront the magnetic violence at the heart of this world the camera does not avert its gaze but confronts us with unbridled brutality young amleths flight from the scene is a wonderful sequence as the film moves from the past into the present in a mesmerising bit of camerawork the northman is winningly engaging at every turn and is best when it becomes an unabashed technical marvel its definitely eggers least actorfocused script so within that its no surprise that the most effective turns are by actors from who we know have always been able to do the most with the least hawkes paternal gaiety commands the first sections willem dafoes manic energy lingers long after we see him last and  of course  kidman in a film overwhelmed by competing versions of masculinity offers a sly and confident performance thats punctuated by her eyes darting in the background in every scene  contemplating if not always commenting on the action around her each performer feels more interesting when opposite her it is a role that in truth feels too brief but effectively teases the promise that is manifested in a late scene with skarsgård that improbably ends up feeling like the highpoint of a film with so many eclectic fightsequences but everyone is good even if limited by the parameters of the film which sees these characters less as individualised figures and more as part of a fabric of hate vengeance and brutality that this viking world is built on in this way it lacks the unpredictable looseness of the lighthouse eggers best film but offers a clarity of vision that retains the kind of technical specificity that is so key to his work so far what i find most compelling about the northman is the way it recognises the cruel brutality of this world and the angry malfeasance of humanity but still feels exciting and exhilarating and that for me is the most significant aspect there is a consistent propulsive energy at work in the northman that is its best asset how strange that a film that is so full of the most miserable aspects of human nature feels so energetic for all the death and blood and gore the northman offers the kind of visceral thrills that feel tapped into the full aesthetic parameters of what cinema can offer its one of the highlights of 2022 thus far
Jun 24 2022,positive, satanic goats dont talk in the northman heartthrobs dont masturbate while fondling mermaid figurines either still within ten minutes preteen viking prince amleth oscar novak the batman his gloryseeking warrior father king aurvandil warraven ethan hawke moon knight and jestermeetsshaman heimir willem dafoe nightmare alley descend into a firelit cave to take hallucinogens growl grunt bark like wolves and fart like its a godgiven superpower if viewers didnt know whos behind this bold brutal brilliant and blood and gutsstrewn scandinavian opus before then theres no doubt from this trippy scene onwards after the witch and the lighthouse writerdirector robert eggers touch approach and style have become that distinctive just three remarkable features into his helming career as he first demonstrated with his potent pilgrim horror movie then doubled down on with his mesmerising oceanside nightmare eggers crafts chaotic celluloid dreams about faith and sanitystretching dances with madness and mania he makes features so striking that theyre haunting rippling with the devotedly realistic and the hypnotically occult in tandem eggers work isnt merely meticulously tense and atmospheric it proves blisteringly visceral to the point of feeling inescapably tangible indeed his steadfast commitment to authenticity spirits the whole concept of immersive filmmaking high into movie valhalla see the vivid periodappropriate detail in the northmans nordic villages whichd only be more evocative if theyd timetravelled in from the ninth and tenth centuries sense the entrancing swirl that springs from all of the above complete with eggers unfailing idiosyncrasies experience the sublime tussle with myth fantasy and folklore that results as it has in each of his features to both plunge into and interrogate his historyset reveries in this untamed and laidbare portrait of the past something is rotten in the state of iceland  as it was in denmark via william shakespeare and in the pride lands of africa in both versions of the lion king writing the northmans screenplay with poet novelist and björk collaborator sjón lamb eggers takes his cues not from hamlet however but from the old norse legend of amleth that inspired the iconic tragedy the narrative still involves a son anointed to be the future king a tragedy that shatters his regal family and a dastardly uncle who gets murderous to seize the throne and his brothers wife of course and it keeps following its protagonist as he wages a determined odyssey of feral revenge against the man who reshaped his fate so ruthlessly i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir thats amleths vow as a boy on a north atlantic island in 895 when he witnesses the latters claes bang locked down treachery he flees after hearing his uncle bay for his head too and seeing him carry off queen gudrún nicole kidman being the ricardos as a spoil of his victory two decades later amleth alexander skarsgård succession is a hulking wolfskinclad viking berserker living life flinging whatever weaponry he can find while viciously pillaging through the lands of the rus but amid the bloodlust gore and pilingup body count the intense marauder is thrust back onto his vengeanceseeking path a slavic seeress björk in her first film role since 2005 whispers stark truths about his current savagery and lapsed mission against fjölnir reigniting his yearning for that promised slaughter  and the singleminded behemoth learns that his uncle is now sheepfarming in iceland having lost the kingdom in another coup a line from hamlet comes to mind now could i drink hot blood by the time amleth brands himself to pass as a prisoner of war slips onto a slave ship and ensures hes among the new captives at fjölnirs ranch hes already literally done just that but his thirst for honouring his father rescuing his mother and slaying his uncle remains unquenched and he soon has help from and the heart of fellow servant olga anya taylorjoy who scored her big break with the witch alongside eggers how that quest eventuates wont surprise anyone familiar with the bard but the northman still astonishes again and again as only visionary filmmakers can eggers refuses to take any expected turn or make a single predictable move even while playing with a plot thats long spilled its thrills across popular culture and while slashing into a genre  viking epics  thats rarely far from screens high among the northmans joys and wonders both large and small sits its cast  with skarsgård fulfilling a decadeplus journey from playing true blood vampire eric northman to both starring in and producing this which hes been trying to bring to fruition for just as long his muscular power and presence as the epitome of rage and revenge is pulsating not to mention physically commanding and buying amleth as the lacerating spirit of both a wolf and a bear is one of the easiest things about the film his big little lies costar kidman also turns in a ferocious performance and the pairs evolution from that tv hits husbandandwife dynamic to this flicks unhinged motherandson duo drips with the requisite oedipal creepiness elsewhere bang does brooding villainy like hes born to it as he showed in dracula 22 years after playing hamlet himself hawke delivers a 20minute supportingplayer masterclass and the inimitable taylorjoy ensures that no one else could ever be pictured in her pivotal part plus that eggers finds small roles for the witchs kate dickie and ralph ineson doesnt go unnoticed a ravaging rampage of a film  a movie beating with unshakeable fury as metal a viking saga thats ever likely to be made and equally thunderous and offkilter  eggers best feature yet wouldnt be what it is without its weight and spectacle though its a picture of brusque poetry in its dialogue its curt lines laden with importance but never trite amleths stated juggling act to find kindness for my kin and hate for my enemies included its a work of elemental potency in its sweepingly shot imagery with cinematographer jarin blaschke a veteran of all three of the directors films painting with light the stunning landscapes and the wind rain snow mud fire and ash that lurks upon it thats true in the headsplitting game of knattleikr that makes just one primal centrepiece the climactic naked volcano sword fight and the many supernaturallaced sights inbetween and it all contributes to a breathtaking cinematic onslaught that savvily turns hellishness into movie heaven  all without shying away from the costs and sacrifices of amleths crusade serving up a simplistic revenge fantasy or excusing glorifying or downplaying the relentless violence that informs every moment

note is virgil the lonely caretaker of a remote safe house  eddie marsan makes us feel the weight of this mans haunting memories and crushing isolation and its a shame that the part is so small director tarik saleh effectively stages a couple of shootouts but thats not enough to save this otherwise inert actioner the guilty 1947  high tide 1947 as with repeat performance reviewed last week the flicker alley label has teamed with the film noir foundation and the ucla film  television archive to revive and restore two more noirs from 1947 and lovingly bring them to bluray and dvd whereas repeat performance was a standalone title the guilty and high tide have been released in a double feature edition cornell woolrich the prolific mystery writer adored by both hollywood and françois

surprise even better is high tide which opens with a car crash that has pinned down both private eye tim slade castle and newspaper editor hugh fresney lee tracy as the pair eye the rising waters that will eventually drown them the movie enters flashback mode and shows how they got to this point its a twisty tale that paints fresney as a crusader unafraid of the mobsters who rule the city and slade

included the horse soldiers 1959 it sounds like a piece of trivia that cant possibly be correct over the course of his career one largely defined by his westerns john ford only directed one feature focusing on the civil war he also tackled the war between the states in 1963s how the west was won but that was just one segment in a multipart movie its a shame then that the horse soldiers doesnt rank more highly in his oater oeuvre its beautifully photographed by william clothier and contains some rousing setpieces but its hindered by thinly drawn characters and a scarcely believable romance based on an actual incident this stars john wayne as colonel marlowe a union officer tasked with leading a raid deep into confederate territory strictly militaristic in thought and deed he butts heads with major kendall william holden the outfits doctor and a man disgusted with every aspect of war marlowe and kendall are painted in broad strokes  unusual for a john ford production  and the story grows convoluted when the group is forced to take along a southern belle constance towers who has overheard their plans naturally she and marlowe begin as enemies and end as sweethearts the horse soldiers is the third civil war flick to hit bluray within the past 12 months but its not as exciting as major dundee or as complex as shenandoah last passenger 2013 heres a pleasant surprise an undertheradar thriller thats been largely undiscovered for nearly a decade now in the tradition of steven spielbergs duel it features an unseen force of evil at the controls of a vehicular instrument of destruction  in this case its a train rather than a truck a latenight train leaving london is carrying only six passengers when it becomes obvious that something isnt right the tickettaker is

known as the man who would be wolverine he was cast in the xmen role before delays tied to his mission impossible 2 involvement forced him to drop out and tointon make an appealing couple and nooshin

2019 10 best entry the lighthouse takes on hamlet before it was hamlet working primarily from a legend largely brought to light by 12thcentury danish author saxo grammaticus  a medieval saga that directly inspired shakespeare to pen his magnum opus  eggers and coscripter sjón have created a ferocious revenge tale thats heavy on the blood and sweat but light on the tears it tells the story of amleth alexander skarsgård who also produced an icelandic warrior seeking vengeance against the uncle claes bang who murdered his father a miscast ethan hawke and took off with his mother nicole kidman to get close to his target amleth disguises himself as a slave an action that puts him in the same company as a captured sorceress anya taylorjoy who shares many of his goals the northman is a rousing viking yarn where the supernatural easily commingles with reality a world in which witches and seers carry as much weight as kings and queens its an absolutely immersive experience with eggers and team offering an upcloseandpersonal seat to a searing soaring spectacle bluray extras include audio commentary by eggers a makingof featurette deleted and extended scenes and a look at knattleikr

Jun 9 2022,positive, a legitimate roller coaster ride a love letter to watching a movie through the slots in your fingers because the frenzy at times can be just too much to bear in the best way possible only a delightful sicko like bay could direct something like this that ambulance surgery scene is seared into my brain covid rear window steven soderbergh is one of the most talented director from his generation if only because he can quite literally direct anything any genre at any time the protestvan scene and the sabotage sequence made me yell aloud in excitement one of the best movies of the year watching this and the northman backtoback was a hell of a way to spend a monday well this is much better than the crimes of grindelwald one of the worst studio blockbusters ive seen in the last 10 years and when it actually focuses on the beasts its a fun time jude law was an excellent dumbledore pick and he understands the assignment dan fogler is always a hoot in these movies and really seems invested in the character and mads mikkelsen is just such an improvement over redacted the problem is that even the good stuff here feels wholly unnecessary the first film in the series did a good enough job of actually living up to its promise but trying to shoehorn the dumbledoregrindelwald saga in this series just was the wrong decision that needed its own movie without trying to tie itself down i quite enjoyed this for what it was but im just unsure we really need another one of these movies id be much more obliged to watch it after this one as opposed to that awful second film it just all feels like content over cinema something recognizable something occasionally fun and compelling just never  needed where the hell was all the love for this when it came out just a sleek purposefully messy chamber piece heightened by rylance chewing every bit of scenery and a really tight purposeful script the type of movie that wouldve done better in 2005 methinks it helps that dylan obrien zoey deutch and johnny flynn are among the best in their young class of underappreciated actors graham moore is a guy ive got high hopes for its been a minute since weve had a nice little mob drama like this tom cruise is the greatest movie star of all time i think this settles the debate hes a weird cat but the man understands the theatrical experience probably better than any actor to ever live hes created some of the most thrilling works ever and pushes the limits every time into what he can do there have been some greats but cruise is the king hes the best that ever was or will be this is stellar top gun maverick feels like the irishman for blockbusters with the criticism going much more outward than inward if youd like to ask tom cruise about his opinion on the state of studio filmmaking heres your answer so i think i know what answer he gave marvel its right up there with creed and star wars the force awakens for bombastic legacyquels but it feels much more like the former in pushing the craft forward and in the latter in just delivering everything you were hoping for a perfect blend of both approaches alltime movie theater experience one of the great sequels too a modest intriguing little crime drama that lets jesse plemons kind of take over for stretches and do his thing which i always approve of not sure if it fully lands that ending but i really enjoyed the ride fwiw nicolas cage didnt have to make this for folks to celebrate his talent blessedly we did that last year with pig and in 2018 with mandy this at least to me wouldve worked better as a funny or die short but cage and pedro pascal as bffs is fun enough to help cover up the uninteresting plot this isnt the shocking satirical introspection into a generational actorenigma it kind of billed itself to be more an snlstyle movie where a man plays a meme cage is always game for whatever the script throws at him i just wish theyd thrown more its a lukewarm effort but likable enough to sand over a very uninspired plot you could legit do without all of the cia stuff just cut it out it is just empty air the memorabilia scene is good i wish the movie had been more of that the paddington 2 scenei think its still too early to reference paddington 2 in other movies thats just me though you do you phil tippett spending 30 or so years to make this is a hell of a thing more of a sensory experience than anything but a punishing one bent on pulling you into the depths of tippetts inferno i wouldnt last 5 minutes in this hellhole he imagined i think thats the point stunning imagery blistering tone downright horrifying in spurts bleakly humorous in others i really hope tippett watched a lot of seinfeld while he made this or took a lot of really calm walks by the beach this movie needed some paddington 2 jokes not the unbearable weight of massive talent itd be funny to me if they played this for a crowded theater full of kids instead of minions the rise of gru mad godfor the whole family not bad not quite among eastwoods best but a very entertaining and wellmade courtroom drama with some unexpected personality its a damn shame kevin spacey is a criminal because hes quite good in this and usually everything he does john cusack is also a fascinating foil but i genuinely have no idea what type of journalist or writer he was and what his ethical boundaries were writing a book might open him up a bit to be more friendly with the subject but if hes an actual journalist this is a crash course in how not to cover something nevertheless a really good watch it has its flaws but its eastwood and the lady chablis rip alone makes up for most of the slipsups what a performance bummed she didnt get a chance to do more in the movies respect always to my uncle bobby for taking me to see this when i was 11 my brother was 9 and he was there too special night my mom had no idea the luck of the irish gag is still to this day one of the funniest things from that absurdly great 00s comedy run capped without peer by that joel david moore thats how he wanted to go out line i mean you cant do it better the way he sells it and the look on the guy next to him the lance armstrong gag and like  okay lets be real 15 of the very datedprobably offensive jokes you could do without outside of that always one of the best studio comedies of its time during a time when studios actually made comedies what a concept i dont want to be some sort of jackass and try to act like i know what happened in this movie because obviously i have no idea but im pretty sure its about people who cant let go of the past to the point where they become stuck there and cant leave so basically the eagles watched this said wait a second and wrote hotel california its also got the worlds most ampedup organ player going ham on every stanza

Jun 7 2022,positive, we know we know we need to get better about always reviewing things in a timely manner here at tfe here are quick takes on some movies we have said too little about  at least in a reviewish kind of way two of which wed heartily recommend and one quite unexpectedly in the same way as we wondered is it necessary when spielberg announced that he would remake west side story we must now get used to the idea that ben aflleck is going to remake witness for the prosecution is it necessary i cant find it anywhere but i am dying to see the french version of deep water since i was informed of its existence isabelle huppert and jeanlouis trintigant play the leads enough said i dont think affleck or skarsgard have much screen presence theres a bland oatmeal vibe to them that i can never get past but ill probably see the northman for bjork and kidman it came and went so fast i did not realize that abmbulance was stylized that way and now im newly annoyed at a movie that barely exists i swear if someone tied him up to a chair and forced him to watch a bela tarr film  i believe that his head will explode  michael bay is and always will be the worst filmmaker working today i swear if someone tied him up to a chair and forced him to watch a bela tarr film  i believe that his head will explode  michael bay is and always will be the worst filmmaker working today
Jun 7 2022,positive, the northman underwent an intense series of reshoots last year this after politely received test screenings put a damper on the possibility of it being released in 2021 eggers third feature has had a somewhat problematic journey thus far what we have here is an ambitious and massive film that is said to have a 90 million budget its screenplay was cowritten by icelandic novelist and poet sjón sigurdsson but the ambiguously spooky storytelling of eggers earlier films is replaced with a more mainstream approach here thats perfectly fine this isnt the kind of movie that will break any sort of cinematic mold but its rousingly entertaining stuff watch it on the big screen with a large audience if you can never discount a true filmmaker even with studio interference the northman runs 140 minutes and i was never bored and that means something these days it feels obviously very familiar as its based on the legend of amleth which inspired shakespeares hamlet but its incredibly welldirected what the northman lacks is the artful ambiguity of eggers first two films the witch and the lighthouse the influence of studio notes is apparent throughout but its not that much of a slog and despite a little too much cg with a climax happening at the mouth of an active volcano two naked men fighting not the best endin hollywood doesnt really make epics of this kind anymore you can tell eggers wanted a more elevated visuallydriven movie but the reshoots made it more entertaining hopefully a directors cut shows up someday more of a pure eggers version the offthetop influences are hamlet gladiator and game of thrones alexander skarsgaards lead performance is stellar ethan hawke as skarsgaards murdered kingfather is in the film for maybe 10 minutes nicole kidman hawkes wifequeen has a few scenes her screen time comes to roughly 20 minutes that she just nails anya taylor joy cuts a vivid figure but a terrible accent how many heads are split open with axes id say about a dozen the killings are extremely brutal a fair amount of intestine spilling theres some kind of nod to rosencrantz and guildenstern he reports and the skull of yorick makes an appearance
Jun 3 2022,positive, robert eggers aka bobby eggs is back this time with a viking epic featuring the talents of a skarsgaard and bjork does he bring us the blockbuster weve been advertised or another classic eggers indie pic is this this film that wins over brian were talking all things northman this week before weekly recommends and after a lil update on the 2022 movie draft
Jun 1 2022,positive, the story in this viking saga set mainly in iceland prince amleth played by oscar novak as a child and alexander skarsgard as an adult witnesses the murder of his father king aurvandil ethan hawke at the hands of his uncle fjolnir danish actor claes bang fjolnir also kidnaps his mother gudrun nicole kidman amleth grows into a warrior and a witch musicianactress bjork starts him on his path of vengeance where he meets priestess olga anya taylorjoy his first two features released to acclaim were works of horror the witch 2015 starring taylorjoy in her breakthrough and the lighthouse 2019 with their eloquent wordiness spawned internet memes the films were unabashed love letters to gnarled old things living in realms beyond time norse warriors of old are revered in heavymetal music and comic books and recently have been featured in drama series eggers with icelandic novelist and coscreenwriter sjon consider most popculture depictions inaccurate here in a screenplay adapted from a legend one that supposedly inspired shakespeares hamlet vikings are superstitious slavers and bloodlustdriven fighters but they are also settled relatively wealthy pastoralists and merchants with trade links with the remnants of the roman empire the story stays close to realism in another way it holds that the legends are true and in the 10th century the beings of norse mythology  such as the valkyries female spirits guiding the dead to the next world and the fenrir the giant wolf god  were real it goes without saying that ones fate is inescapable but if you go in expecting this to be paced like a marvel movie you will be disappointed the beats are much slower and when supernatural creatures appear they do so like the great eagles in the lord of the rings films 2001 to 2003 they unravel a knotty plot problem then vanish
Jun 1 2022,neutral, robert eggers returns to the big screen for the northman an epic historical action drama that serves as his most ambitious highbudget project yet a career that began with lowbudget horror films the witch and the lighthouse eggers has arrived in theaters with a good oldfashioned revenge thriller the emphasis here is on oldfashioned as he masterfully transports us back to 895 ad for a movie about prince amleth alexander skarsgård a viking on a mission to kill his uncle who killed amleths father and kidnapped his mother two decades prior this is a triumphant effort from eggers to tell a more mainstream narrative while keeping in tune with his distinct stylings those who have seen eggerss previous work know that he is partial to graphic surreal imagery carefully constructed to be as evocative as possible eggers brings some of that to the northman giving his characters striking visions that lead to a beautifully unique cinematic experience at the same time he crafts a story of vengeance that serves the characters very well amleths words i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir echo through the screen at its core the story is conventional amleths journey is what originally inspired the tragedy of hamlet with the protagonists names serving as anagrams eggers tells a very shakespearean tale opening with a gripping prologue that introduces the audience to amleth as a child oscar novak does an incredible job in his scenes as young amleth and he shares the screen well with ethan hawke and willem dafoe who provide excellent work with their brief screen time as they perform a spiritual ceremony on all fours their dedication to the craft is admirable they behave like animals and sell a scene that could have been lost without the right performers and direction what eggers has mastered as a filmmaker is transporting his audience into a time entirely different from our own once his films begin total immersion starts as you enter an experience unlike any other the craftsmanship and attention to detail in every bit of the northman are stunning with believable immaculate production design while some films set in the past make the mistake of having everything feel polished and artificial this movie is gritty with dirty costumes in settings that complement the films dark tone this is also eggerss first venture into largescale action sequences while the films focus isnt the action the movie features some of the most gripping battle sequences of the year there are long takes with copious amounts of bloody brutal violence that can be shocking the barbarity of every insane fight scene matches the fierce nature of the vikings and demonstrates the strength of amleth as he embarks on his plan of vengeance skarsgård who has shown his physical prowess in the legend of tarzan outshines himself with his masterful stuntwork in this film as far as the films story goes the easiest complaint is that it uses familiar ingredients amleths goal of revenge is conventional but it is perhaps the only accessible aspect of a movie that is uninterested in making things relatable for a 21stcentury audience the film is based on a classic legend and eggers does an excellent job of putting his artistic voice onto it the second act can slow down at times but the sublime cinematography and the performances are very engaging anya taylorjoy continues to outdo herself as an actress and nicole kidman is phenomenal as is claes bang as the films antagonist eggers also knew the right moments to bring his characters into dramatic directions with a shocking revelation that pushes the protagonist into dark places the northman is an exceptionally crafted film with unconventional visuals and a filmmaking voice behind it that is powerfully unique there is graphic violence and dark moments all over this film and it is a story brought to life wonderfully by a cinematic auteur as comingsoons review policy explains a score of 7 equates to good a successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out but it may not appeal to everyone jonathan sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in new york city he has metinterviewed some of the leading figures in hollywood including christopher nolan zendaya liam neeson and denis villeneueve he also works as a screenwriter director and producer on independent short films
May 31 2022,positive, blood runs mud flies and bones crack  in crisp percussive ways youve hopefully never heard in real life  throughout the northman a grand gutspilling norse epic that feels at once earthily ancient and thrillingly modern plunging us into a viking age of elemental survival strategies and unfettered masculine brutality robert eggers film shows off all the immersive worldbuilding a huge hollywood budget can buy minus any obvious studio lacquer everything here feels whittled from stone woven from flesh grown from the ground up and then destroyed in a frenzy of bruising exactingly choreographed warfare by the time björk shows up in a cameo  her first film appearance in 17 years  as a holloweyed mystic you feel genuinely transported to another dimension the northman is a film touched by madness that also happens to know exactly what its doing with so much overwhelming sensory detail at play  eggers keeps the story backofapostcard simple when his father king aurvandill ethan hawke is murdered by his uncle fjölnir claes bang young prince amleth flees and grows into the formidable form of alexander skarsgård returning years later to avenge his fathers death rescue his mother gudrun nicole kidman revealing complex layers of feminine desire and pragmatism in this testosteronedriven tale and reclaim his kingdom if it sounds familiar thats no accident eggers is working from the medieval scandinavian legend of amleth which centuries later trickled down into shakespeares hamlet in hollywood terms the northman shares dna with the lion king if not a whole lot else but as with eggers previous films the febrile period visions the witch and the lighthouse its less about the story and more about the goforbroke telling from the rich flavourful historical idiom in which he writes  this time in collaboration with revered icelandic poet sjón  to the vast visceral carvedinwood imagery that gives the words their weight meanwhile the stripped linear narrative is complicated by an anxious uncertain moral conscience that you dont find in say gladiator amleth is unwaveringly determined to have his revenge in this life or the next yet as much as we understand his motives the more he slashes and slays his way toward that goal the more we question its value disturbing and exhilarating at once the northman is troubled by toxic cycles of male violence even as it gets us waistdeep in battle
May 29 2022,positive, alexander skarsgård plays amleth who is determined to win back the kingdom stolen from his father in robert eggers the northman photo by aidan monaghan courtesy of focus features like the muscular fighter and the seductive sorceress at its heart robert eggers the northman besieges and bewitches the viewer in equal measure with its realistically bloody and enthrallingly haunted view of life among the vikings its near the end of the 10th century ce and a viking castle is awaiting the return of king aurvandil ethan hawke and his cohort from their latest battles the queen gudrun nicole kidman prepares for the kings arrival as is their teen son amleth oscar novak aurvandil takes amleth on a vision quest  involving a steam hut psychedelics and the leering jester helmir willem dafoe  thats the first step of the lads eventual ascension to his dads throne but arvandils brother fjölnir danish actor claes bang has other ideas he leads a group of soldiers to assassinate the king kidnap gudrun and declare himself the new king the only mistake fjölnir makes is letting amleth get away the lad rows a small boat out to sea with three vows on his lips i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir years pass and amleth  played as a strapping adult by alexander skarsgård  is still reciting those vows but as a soldier in a mercenary army after his group pillages a village he rescues a slavic maiden olga anya taylorjoy from getting killed in the melee when he hears olga is being shipped off with some newly enslaved villagers to iceland where fjölnir now lives amleth becomes a slave himself to join the voyage and finally exact his revenge in iceland amleth discovers fjölnir has already lost aurvandils kingdom and the new settlement he leads is managed through fear by fjölnirs sniveling prince thórir gustav lindh who looks like a dark ages version of jared kushner amleth works cautiously at first scoping out fjölnirs new kingdom before taking it down amleth also teams with olga who is as ruthless as he is your strength breaks mens bones olga tells amleth adding i have the cunning to break their minds eggers  as he did in his first two films the witch and the lighthouse  creates a world where harsh reality and mysticism live side by side in long fluid takes eggers captures the unrelenting violence of marauders ransacking villages and slaughtering the locals but the script which eggers wrote with the icelandic writer sjón lamb also leaves room for psychedelic spirit journeys visits with visionseeing priestesses one of them played by björk and the influence of dreams on amleths gory reality taylorjoy following her run that included the queens gambit and last night in soho continues to be one of the most fascinating young stars to watch kidman makes the most out of her one surprising moment and bang the square the burnt orange heresy brings a weary menace to the traitorous fjölnir but the northman forces all eyes toward skarsgård who presents amleth as a brawny brooding hero who must learn that the childhood ideas of vengeance must inevitably yield to the adult reality that many things are not what they appear to be  fans of the witch and the lighthouse lowbudget movies that orchestrated an atmosphere of dread were going to be curious what eggers could do on a larger scale what hes created is an authenticlooking and dreamfilled world of a thousand years ago sometimes beautiful and often brutal  but always fascinating
May 28 2022,positive, a savage and mesmerizing viking saga like no other robert eggers the northman leaves your senses bludgeoned by the time the credits roll like the witch and the lighthouse which made eggers an indie horror darling his latest has an obsessive intrigue with pastoral history baroque language and pagan mythology albeit on a much larger scale with a budget of nearly 90 million dollars this visually striking odyssey is distinguished by its heavily researched set pieces authentic costuming dreamlike vistas and visceral bonecracking battle sequences its the 9th century in scandinavia as were introduced to prince amleth the son of king aurvandil ethan hawke when the battleweary ruler returns to his dilapidated kingdom and beautiful wife queen gudrun nicole kidman after years of fighting wars and scouring the countryside he takes young amleth to a sage willem defoe for an initiation ceremony where they ingest psychedelics howl like dogs and experience visions of their family tree this is pure robert eggers territory  a dark realm where uncertainty paranoia and magic coexist the spell quickly ends however when the child witnesses his uncle fjolnir claes bang murder his father as the boy escapes into the wilderness he vows to avenge his father and save his mother from his uncles tyranny several years later a bearded and sinewy amleth alexander skarsgård travels the scandinavian countryside with other grunting homicidal vikings these musclebound marauders invade small villages and decimate entire families before feasting on their food and wine one night after a particularly brutal skirmish amleth encounters a bejeweled seeress bjork who informs him that his uncle fled to iceland with his mother who he recently took as his bride with his thirst for revenge rekindled amleth jumps on a ship and insinuates himself with a group of slaves bound for iceland including the alluring olga anya taylorjoy from here the movie ratchets up the tension as amleth aims to exact his revenge on his uncle if the story sounds familiar a young man avenging his fathers murder by the uncle who married his mother you probably heard of a play called hamlet inspired by the same scandinavian folktale you can discern the contours of that play in the films narrative eggers simply exhumed its bones and slapped some muscle on it instead of a brooding danish prince who wails to be or not to be our hero is a twisted ball of hate and cunning hes not apprehensive about killing his uncle as much as enjoying the process of tormenting him its shakespeare on psychedelics and swedish death metal if the northman shares anything with other hamlet adaptations its the spiritual exploration of moral uncertainty which questions the glory in killing another man even if its justified cowritten by eggers and sjon lamb the film is not without a misstep or two in constructing a world where loathing lust and violence are a way of life the filmmakers forgo levity and human empathy although we understand amleth philosophically we dont feel an emotional connection to him or anyone else a little nuance and humor wouldve gone a long way especially since eggers somber tone and often incoherent antediluvian dialogue already keeps us at a distance but these are modest gripes for a work that achieves greatness on such an impressive canvas every frame of jarin blaschkes cinematography is a carefully rendered baroque painting while the score by robin carolan and sebastian gainsborough pushes us deeper into the ether with transcendent rhythms and primordial drums taking cues from films like excalibur and conan the barbarian eggers is able to weave hypnotic hallucinatory sequences into the films embroidery without losing sight of the central plot it also never hurts to have a remarkable cast skarsgard inhabits amleth with such ferocity you wonder if he had a mental breakdown on set bangs murderous uncle balances repressed rage and existential confusion with an amazing fluidity while kidmans queen gudrun absolutely slays shes frightening and the always mesmerizing taylor joy adds a bit of romance and grace to a movie brimming with machismo the real star however is the movies ethereal and paranoid atmosphere which eggers crafts with a sculptors precision hes proven himself to be a genuine filmmaker unlike a lot of contemporary directors who edit their movies like overly eager children on a sugar high eggers brings a sense of patience and curiosity with a kurosawaesqe flair he uses long tracking shots and detailed production designs to pull you into the dark landscape while maintaining an undercurrent of menace even if some of the thinly drawn characters get buried under a mountain of mud bone and gristle the northman is a compelling experience its also one of the most brutal and astonishing films of the year
May 28 2022,positive,a complete cinematic experience from the sound score acting aesthetic story and directing is masterfully put together and executed  
May 27 2022,positive, imagine being robert eggers right now stunning audiences in 2105 with the captivating the witch and also introducing them to the incredible anya taylorjoy following up in 2019 with the nearindescribable the lighthouse  were now here with an epic for the ages a feast for the senses norse mythology has never looked this good on the big screen nor felt as vitally visceral what follows is a cinematic marvel continuing his partnership with cinematographer jarin blaschke the signature visual style with eggers is present correct and as brutally beautiful as we would expect each shot is a feast for the eyes  theres something hauntingly captivating about every single frame and theres much to be haunted by here this is a film that is as vicious and violent as you would hope for from a tale with these origins its to point of nearecstatic deliciousness that we bare witness to such primal and pulsating savagery the reason it is so compelling is the substance that comes with the ascetic skarsgård in particular is a tourdeforce a hulking embodiment of unbridled obsession with fate  destiny it feels wrong to describe his undeterred quest for retribution as a pleasure to watch yet thanks to eggers at the helm it genuinely is within the barbarity theres wonderful teasing out on the threads than bind and drive us  how humans are dammed to follow a path that is not of their own choosing 
May 26 2022,positive,its brutal and violent but theres something really beautiful about it 
May 23 2022,positive,nicole kidman steals her scenes in this immaculately crafted tale of revenge the action brings the heat but the story may leave you cold 
May 20 2022,positive, although robert eggers has only three feature films to his name so far audiences already know what to expect from his work otherworldly weird intensely individual and universal at the same time with a strange sense of humor and a fascination with esoteric within a wellworn mythic structure eggerss films examine the heart of darkness within cultures at once foreign and deeply familiar whether or not hes always successful in his project hes yet to make an uninteresting film and he hasnt broken that streak yet his latest the northman is a norse epic feminist diatribe and family drama in one and is exactly what youd expect from the director  and writer of the witch and the lighthouse the northman follows amleth alexander skarsgaard the son of king aurvandill ethan hawke and queen gudrun nicole kidman who vows vengeance when his uncle fjolnir claes bang murders his father and kidnaps his mother as a child amleth escapes the assassination to join a band of marauding vikings and we next see him laying waste to a slavic village and carrying off the strongest inhabitants as slaves when a chance encounter leads amleth to discover where his uncle has gone he believes the fates have given him the opportunity to fulfill his promise he disguises himself as a slave to be transported to iceland where his uncle mother and cousins tend a sheep farm there he meets olga anya taylorjoy a slavic woman who complicates his singleminded quest for vengeance if eggerss previous films were difficult and confounding the northman is far more accessiblebut thats no knock against it nor does it reduce the cultural or mythological complexity of the narrative eggers has a clear concept of the genre in which hes working and brings similar sensibilities about faith and horror that he did to his first two films despite being on a grander scale the northman is just as claustrophobic and intimate as its predecessorsthe windswept oceans and mountains of norway and iceland replace the wilds of puritan new england and the crashing waves of the atlantic ocean but are still the sites of isolation and intense interpersonal relationships shaped by social and religious systems and individual psychosis in eggerss films the characters are embedded in their society its cultures and traditions and faiths and are shaped by it victims and victimizers alike he understands perhaps better than any of his contemporaries the violence inherent in the system and the circuitous nature of trauma the story evades glorifying norse or viking culture while respecting the world in which the characters live amleth is trapped in a circle of trauma and toxicity but he has the choice to break free from itthe superstructure of the narrative itself does not require his sacrifice as it does oedipus or even hamlet the film rather supposes that it is his belief in his fate that traps him within the cycle olga presents an alternative a worship of the earth and the offer of rebirth that amleth begins to work towards but it is amleths culture of destruction and patriarchy that seems to doom him without mincing words eggers exposes the cult of death inherent in toxic masculinity the northman deftly appears to be about one thing while slyly indicating that it will be about something else as with the witch and the lighthouse eggers utilizes a deceptively straightforward story informed by legend or myth a family plagued by a witch two men stranded in a lighthouse a son taking vengeance for the murder of his father to explore the complexities within the cultures he depicts and attempt to say something about our own eggers returns to myth and legend again and again in different milieus yes but with the same basic ideato dig into the past that has so shaped our current culture in its own way the northman is a challenging film by being so deceptively simple it refuses easy categorization this is not a norse fantasy epic as much as some pr firms want it to be and utilizes the recognizable narrative to interweave a deeply complex mythos of history religion superstition and legend it contains spectacular performances and a writerdirector who has only become more assured in his work as time has gone on while the violence blood and mud wont be for everyone the northman is a rewarding film for those who venture into its wilderness
May 20 2022,negative,a historical epic without the epic a revenge plot with all the agency of revenge removed what is left  a two and a half hour plodding viking reenactment
May 20 2022,positive,  robert eggers one of the most vital contemporary american filmmakers thanks to his uniquely captivating movies the witch 2015 and the lighthouse 2019 scales things up considerably for this historical epic about a viking princes quest for vengeance  sometime around the 10th century a scandinavian king ethan hawke returns home from war to his queen nicole kidman and adolescent son amleth oscar novak after partaking in a ritualistic rite of passage with his father amleth witnesses the kings brother fjolnir claes bang murder his father thought dead amleth escapes vowing revenge and grows up to be a hulk of a man played by alexander skarsgard now with considerable abilities as a killer honed by years of being a viking berserker after an especially bloody raid which includes a bravura singleshot sequence in which skarsgard pummels multiple poor souls amleth encounters a seeress played by icelandic singer bjork who informs him that his opportunity for revenge will soon present itself sure enough amleth is able to get himself sold as a slave into his nowdeposed uncles ownership where he plots to kill fjolnir and rescue his mother who is now fjolnirs wife apparently spurred on by swedish star skarsgards desire to make a viking movie eggers teamed up with icelandic novelistpoet sjon to write the screenplay based on the myth that also inspired hamlet both of eggers previous films demonstrate a proclivity for intense visions of the past informed by dreamlike imagery and a grimy muddy aesthetic as you might imagine those skills are very wellsuited to a bloody viking epic and there is a wide variety of aesthetic wonders to behold here in a post game of thrones world its a challenge to make anything medieval seem especially brutal or bold but eggers easily clears that bar evoking a primal mythic quality that widens the eyes but although there is not a single dull moment in this bigbudget fever dream there is a minor sense that something has been lost emotionally speaking with eggers working on such a large canvas he may be slightly better suited to more intimate storytelling that said it feels like a miracle that this film exists and its worth celebrating for the pure artistic ambition of it all big swings like this are always a good thing skarsgard looks the part but can never quite shake a slight contemporary quality the witch breakout anya taylorjoy is great as a fellow slave and the lighthouse star willem dafoe is a hoot in a brief role as a jestersoothsayer danish actor bang is fantastic as well but in the acting stakes kidman who played skarsgards wife in big little lies is the real star player here once again displaying her ability to draw upon unparalleled levels of intensity in her performing cast nicole kidman alexander skarsgard ethan hawke willem dafoedirector robert eggersrunning time 137 minutesrating r16 graphic violence cruelty animal cruelty  sexual materialverdict a big bold bloody good time
May 20 2022,positive,this is not the sanitized hornedhelmetwearing marvel comics thor vision of vikinghood this is blood and mud and ice and pagan gods and reader i am here for it
May 19 2022,positive,for all the nonsense the northman trails in its wake this is also a big brawling and absolutely beautifully shot and scored film
May 18 2022,positive, vikings in pop culture have gotten a bit too cozy as of late instead of depicting them as the bloodthirsty pirating raping warriors that they were conquering every new land and leaving a bloody trail behind them weve gotten a defanged version of the terrifying conquerors while recent shows like vikings and vikings valhalla show a version of vikings with a heart of gold and not a slave in sight and games like assassins creed valhalla romanticize the wandering journey and noble soul of a viking robert eggers the northman does neither im not saying the game and those shows dont have their own merit but the northman is not trying to curry your favor for its berserker protagonist  based on the legend of amleth which inspired shakespeares hamlet something you quickly notice once you watch the movie the only thing familiar about the world of the northman is its plot indeed from hauntings to yoricks skull the film doesnt deviate too much from the soul of the story weve gotten to know so well amleth alexander skarsgård is a viking prince on the run after witnessing the murder of his father aurvandill ethan hawke by the hand of his uncle fjölnir claes bang he escapes as a child vowing to return for vengeance and to save his mother gudrún nicole kidman  years on his own plagued and infected by hate and vengeance have turned amleth into nothing short of a beast it isnt until during one of his bloodsoaked raids where he meets a seeress björk that he is righted once more sailing to iceland disguised as a slave alongside a slavic witch named olga anya taylorjoy amleth schemes and seethes unlike eggers previous features theres very little that is surprising or unexpected when it comes to the northman those who label it as horror are fundamentally misunderstanding what horror is this is a revenge story closer in relation to the count of monte cristo than the witch or the lighthouse  instead eggers proves that the connecting thread in his films is a distinct and enchanting blend of the bizarre and arcane with dashes of folkloric magic and indulgence in fantasy instead of dabbling in magical realism and making us question what is real and what is superstition it is all real for these characters just as thomasin can live deliciously so too can amleth become beastlike and wield magical blades  its inspiring to see that stories like this can still exist ones that arent afraid to push the boundaries between genres because while dubbing the northman as a historical epic isnt necessarily wrong it would be inaccurate along with its violence and costuming and dead languages there is also a surprising amount of humor romance and fantasy from burping and farting to pretending to be literal wolves the scenes that brought me surprising mirth were funny because of their unflinching intensity the situation as a viewer from 2022 is entirely comical but for the characters its real thats not to say that you arent meant to laugh at some of those scenes theyre meant to be ridiculous  on the same note the scenes between amleth and taylorjoys olga are surprisingly tender wrapped within this story of hamlet could have been a burgeoning story of a young lord and lady macbeth olga is equal parts ethereal and vicious far from a shrinking violet her alliance and connection to amleth ground his character in something real shes not there to be beautiful ophelia and die she is his partner his savior and his purpose when he becomes rudderless its touching to see the man who was once nothing but muscle and loud screaming and grunting noises turn into open himself up to a slavic witch and speak of the future eggers blends these genres and tones together effortlessly in a way that seems so simple but is difficult to accomplish in the northman robert eggers sheds the title of a horror director he shows just how far his range can lead him and it is exciting to see him lean into that fueling his stories with healthy doses of fantasy only serves to prove this point and adds an extra layer of excitement when i think of what fantastical story hell conquer next
May 17 2022,positive,  robert eggers has carved a niche for himself making visually arresting thoroughly researched historical films with supernatural and folkloric overtones its hyper specific and gave us two of the best movies of their kind of the past decade the witch from 2015 and  the lighthouse from 2019 both movies are deeply unsettling affairs exploring several universal themes in the weirdest ways possible his newest movie the northman is by far his least weird that consequently also makes it my least favorite its not a bad movie in the least it just feels like a lot of the eggers special sauce got watered down even if the brutality went way way up the northmans attention to period detail is perhaps the most impressive of eggers whole career the scope of something like this is massive utilizing the vast frigid landscape of iceland to explore several different cultures melded through pillaging and slavery norse celtic rus and pict characters all occupy the screen at the same time and they each feel different in their own particular way i never once doubted the veracity of any element on screen it truly feels like a journey through history what doesnt quite have the same feeling of immersion is the story a young norse prince named amleth witnesses his father king aurvandil ethan hawke  murdered at the hands of his uncle fjölnir claes bang amleths mother queen gudrun nicole kidman is therefore taken as fjölnirs new queen though amleth is himself sought for death he escapes in a boat vowing to return one day to avenge his father rescue his mother and kill his uncle years later amleth is a bearwolf viking raider now in the abhaving portrayal of alexander skarsgård the beefiest skarsgård after ransacking a russian village amleth overhears a tale of king fjölnirs loss of his kingdom he is little more than a town chieftain in iceland but amleths hatred and fire for vengeance has not died amleth disguises himself as a slave and joins a caravan heading to fjölnirs town along with a cunning young rus maiden named olga anya taylorjoy amleth plots the slow destruction of his uncle and everything he holds dear but as is always the question will revenge truly sate his bloodlust this is one of the oldest stories in the world i dont mean just because this movie takes place in the late9th century ad you have seen this story before its conan the barbarian its hamlet its at least 50 of all spaghetti westerns the revenge story cannot exist without effectively turning the avenger into a beast who has to choose whether to succumb to their hatred or go down a more forgiving path the body count goes way up while they decide naturally certainly its not like the northman is wholly without the trademark eggers touches the moments when the movie truly shines are when the narrative brings in elements of folklore and superstition when amleth begins his nighttime raids of his uncles farm we get a bit of the norse magic and mysticism fjölnirs elder son thórir gustav lindt believes it to be the heretical magic of the christian slaves theyd acquired from ireland olga uses earth magic she picked up in rus we see norse ritual sacrifices to the god freyja its a fascinating mélange of different influences while the movie definitely has its fair share of cool elements like thatbjörk as an eyeless seer is a standout and willem dafoe as a weird jestermeetsmystic is anotherit all too frequently feels like they are at the mercy of the narrative which is as rote and pedestrian as it gets i love a good revenge story dont get me wrong but the northman feels trapped by it rather than using it to explore any other greater themes both the witch and the lighthouse explore some fascinating avenues of toxic masculinity they show us men who are in various ways impotent and unable to enact the change in their own lives which of course leaves them open to the otherworldly forces which inhabit the forest or the sea that surround them here the toxic masculinity feels both horribly destructive and unchecked adult amleth is a ball of rage from his first appearance to his last literally roaring or howling like the animals he emulates his actions therefore lead other mennotably but not limited to fjölnirto reply in kind this does feel like the men here are in their own ways impotent but we never see an opposite brutality begets brutality and justified or not brutality is all there shall be the cast is excellent the cinematography from eggers regular collaborator jarin blaschke is gorgeous and everything about the time period feels perfect and rich and yet i cant help thinking about how much more david lowery seemed to do with his arthurian riff the green knight last year it too is a heros journey of sorts about a man with an unsure future attempting to follow or upend his fate but its so much stranger so much more interesting in a number of different ways and seems to use its mystical and mythological elements to a greater level of effect the northman is a gorgeous textured depiction of its place and time with so much to recommend it on both sides of the camera i just wish it had found something deeper to show us a more nuanced story to tell than what we get and its not like there arent plenty of opportunities a couple of moments in the story had me saying oh wow thats interesting but they ultimately only broke the rhythm of the typical genre conventions briefly the flow of the revenge movie could not be contained for long if you have any interest in seeing a visual interpretation of a viking epic at its pinnacle i would recommend seeing the northman wherever has the best sound and projection near you its a beautiful looking movie however dont go in expecting the unpredictability of the witch or the lighthouse to which the northman simply cant hold a candle or torch
May 16 2022,positive, just seven years ago a littleknown filmmaker named robert eggers debuted his brilliant featurelength debut the witchan extraordinary exploration of 17thcentury religious hysteria familial dysfunction and folk horror the unqualified critical praise that followed its sundance premiere was more than justified four years later eggers returned with the lighthouse an equally brilliant 19thcentury dissection of isolation madness and mermaids his second effort all but confirmed his status as a worldclass talent working in or out of the arthorror subgenre only eggerss contemporarywriterdirector ari aster deserves to be discussed in similar terms of talent or output eggers conveyed his singular obsession with period authenticity into every meticulously handcrafted frame in every intentional camera move and in every heavily researched line of mythopoetic dialogue adapted by eggers with icelandic poetnovelist sjón lamb from the same source material william shakespeare used for the slightly betterknown hamlet this third featurelength film the northman centres on amleth oscar novak a prince and heir to a minor kingdom ruled by aurvandil warraven ethan hawke and his queen gudrún nicole kidman amleths idyllic existence is highlighted by a peculiarly unique fatherson bonding session involving a shamanfool willem dafoe hallucinogens and literal animalistic howling which ends abruptly at the sharpened edge of aurvandils halfbrothers claes bang weapon fjölnir takes aurvandils kingdom makes gudrún his wife and orders amleths execution amleth escapes certain death but only after promising to avenge his father save his mother and kill his uncle its far easier vowed than done and a multidecade interlude begins where amleth now an outcast without title or property grows up into a megabrooding hulking berserker alexander skarsgård between the foundational trauma of losing everything at an early impressionable age and the unbreakable vow he made then amleths future seems to involve vikingera pillaging plundering and dying in combat hello valhalla thats before though an unnamed seeress played by björk in a remarkably memorable cameo reminds amleth of an immutable fate defined by the vow he made decades earlier where shakespeares consciencestricken hamlet fatally hesitates in taking revenge against his brotherkilling uncle and duplicitous mother sealing his own fate eggers and sjón leverage the idea of hesitation into a conflict between fate alongside that existential struggle comes amleths longburied desire for domesticity in the form of olga of the birch forest anya taylorjoy olga is a russian woman taken as a result of the northmans first extended setpiece an elaborately choreographed fourminute single take that pits amleth and his fellow berserkers against a lightly defended russian village spoiler the russian village doesnt stand a chance as bravura as anything in eggerss short remarkable career that first setpiece will linger in the audiences minds as both mesmerizing and horrific the filmmaker deliberately challenges the audience to continue their presumptive identification with amleth and his quest its a risk eggers obviously considered and accepted when making the northman though its certainly likely to make some moviegoers or viewers hit the pause button and either bail or become apathetic toward amleths blood and gorefilled quest theyll still be pulled in by eggers obsessive attention to period detail and visual style but may keep amleth and the characters in the northman at arms length their individual and collective fates more like pawns or minor pieces swept off a chessboard by a temperamental toddler for those who arent alienated by the outcome of that first brutal setpiece eggers exploration of amleths monomaniacal journey suggests an inherent if not necessarily original critique of revenge narratives ie who becomes the point of identification and why and for amleth whose life has been defined by an intractable inescapable vow fate less as a mystical or supernatural form than a social cultural and political one that journey comes full circle back to the foundational lifealtering experience watching his uncle commit regicide its a toxic ultimately destructive form of masculinity that leads in only one direction at the metaphorical if not literal gates of hell even as olga a pagan witch of sorts offers another option ie domesticity amleth can only see the vow he must fulfill and the fate he must embrace that amleth cant bring himself to see any alternatives becomes like hamlets welldocumented hesitation his fatal flaw while its impossible to separate his narrative from his visual style eggers continues his seemingly meteoric ascent to worldclass filmmaker status expanding his toolkit to encompass a breathtakingly intense attentiongrabbing singletake approach to scene and story creation unlike anything else its an approach that can be expensive a reported 90m budget for a superhero and spandexfree film and demands nextlevel commitment from his collaborators on either side of the camera including cinematographer jarin blaschke editor louise ford production designer craig lathrop and costume designer linda muir all of whom worked on eggers first and second featurelength films all you need is death is the latest in the celtic

May 16 2022,positive, raise your alehorn and sword for mighty robert eggers a true visionary for he is the helmsman of the northman now on prime video the lighthouse and the witch or the vvitch if you please a most awesomely unholy celluloid triumvirate his latest is a viking revenge saga promising enough barbarity and attention to authentic period minutiae to render one slackjaw with awe alexander skarsgard and his pitiless trapezius muscles take center screen as a berserker questing to slake his thirst for vengeance and his journey brings him in contact with fellow medieval nutjobs played by nicole kidman anya taylorjoy ethan hawke willem dafoe and lured back into film by forces surely beyond our comprehension the sovereign goddess bjork im under the impression that if one doesnt watch the northman one risks being slaughtered for ones great weakness so here goes  the gist the northman opens as every movie should with a direful prayer to a volcano its ad 895 a time apparently void of rational thought odin has brought king aurvandill warraven hawke home from battle to his wife queen gudrun kidman and tween son amleth oscar novak aurvandill hugs the living shit out of his boy its a mans mans mans mans mans world his subjects pose in firelight as if they exist in ancient paintings he eyes his plunder chained female slaves parade solemnly nearby gudrun suggests they head to the bedchamber but theres no time for that  aurvandill sports a torso gash that nearly rendered him paté for vultures its time to initiate his successor to the tree of kings which requires him to bring amleth to heimir the fool and also the mystical dealer of scandinavian psychedelics who will have them bark and howl and run about on all fours like wolves and lap up the drugs and belch and fart and levitate in front of surreal visions and take a pledge of vengeance when fathers are killed in glory in battle and now amleth is a man amleth has barely comingofaged when aurvandill is betrayd by his own brother the boy watches as fjolnir claes bang commits regicide and sends his men to commit nepoticide but when amleth escapes he vows to commit avunculicide because one doesnt take a stoned lupineoath without being fully dedicated to it years later amleth is now played by skarsgard and has oarboated his traps unto godliness all the better to help one achieve fireside reverie in praise of battle and then run fearlessly into such putting an ax into lesser men until their blood runs down ones chiseled fing delts lats and abs  and one red droplet down his cheek like a tear its a living he visits the temple of bjork and she reminds him of his oath and then a raven alights and looks him in the eye he quits the viking gig and cuts off his hair and brands himself like a slave and passes himself as such on a boat headed to fjolnirs sheep farm in iceland fjolnir is no longer king but that doesnt mean he deserves to still have his head attached to his body thats just logic over stormy seas the slavers doth sail and amleth meets fellow prisoner olga of the birch forest taylorjoy who utters spells in foreign tongues he shares his story and they do what everyone does on first dates in romantic comedies they vow to help each other kill people he can break mens bones she says but i have the cunning to break their minds this is love if ive ever seen it theyre assimilated into fjolnirs enslavement ranks amleth looks up and sees his mother shooing ravens from her window she is now fjolnirs wife and they have a young son and he has another son from a previous relationship whos a sad sorry weakling fate tugs at amleth he follows the fox to get to the hewitch he consults the hewitch to get the rope he uses the rope to get to the zombie he vanquishes the zombie to get the sword and hell use the sword to get his revenge which wiggled and jiggled and tickled inside him  but to what end what movies will it remind you of the northman is sort of mel gibsons the green knight it recalls apocalypto the passion of the christ and braveheart in its gruesome oldworld bloodletting and shares kinship with the likes of gladiator and 300 performance worth watching kidman acts up a storm in a key scene that cracks this plot wide open and proves that sanity is a seed that finds no purchase in this world memorable dialogue im pretty sure amleths mantra i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir is the my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die for a new generation i also feel fjolnirs pain when he declares this is not the work of my god this is truly sorcery because i say the exact same thing when the detroit lions lose sex and skin vaguely shadowy frontal nudeness by fire and lavalight exposed hindquarters when amleth and olga make love on the forest floor within a shaft of moonlight surely dirtytalking about slaying thine enemies and such our take the northman is lunacy delivered with dead sincerity and youll either roll your eyes and be repulsed or leap headlong into the flaming crazy and revel in it the latter reaction is far more tempting for those of us familiar with eggers immersive unapologetically weird unsettling visual style rife with long virtuoso shots his occulticspiritual nightmare stories and his insistence upon authenticity which borders on obsessive and dares us to find an anachronism this viking tale  cowritten by eggers and icelandic poetartist sjon and derived from the saxo grammaticuspenned legend that inspired shakespeares hamlet  is one damn thing after another rotating among scenes of grotesque violence whispered declarations and pagan rituals ranging from randy courtship dances to human sacrifice because in this culture putting people into this world is just as maniacally fun as taking them out of it so what we have here is a revenge picture enriched by eyewidening things surreal iconography liturgical deliria soothsayer bjork an old desiccated severed head whose incredibly distinctive bone structure is clearly that of willem dafoe  things we havent seen before and that experience is such a rarity something to be treasured eggers looks upon the nottorturedenough morality of this strange world with an unjudging eye its a killorbeenslaved existence ruled by the most putridly toxic masculinity the type that inspires a man to utter i will become a hailstorm of iron and steel as he plots to torture those who committed the gravest of betrayals against him discomfort may very well be eggers intent whether its the perverted joy we dont want to admit we feel when amleth schooled in the cruel domination of those weaker than him inflicts violence upon his foes or the whiplash guilt we experience when we realize how not fun it would be to watch a movie about a viking learning to turn the other cheek this is after all not a christian society  their god is a corpse nailed to a tree declares a viking man known as finnr the nosestub because his proboscis was sliced off and left for the squirrels the northman is perhaps a statement on the folly of revenge and for that matter that of fate itself since the people of ca 1000 ad likely could not fathom the concept of free will eggers more pointed goal may be simply to adhere unyieldingly and unapologetically to that worldview so deranged strange and fascinating to our modern eyes our call stream it the northman marries the battle epic with the chimerical vision of a director whos one of the best in todays game its weird and its wondrous
May 15 2022,positive, fans of director robert eggers will not be disappointed in his latest film the northman an epic viking revenge saga that stays true to his vision and style this extremely violent bloody and gory film is gorgeously crafted the performances are masterful and the care taken to make it as historically accurate as possible is something to be commended twenty years later an adult amleth alexander skarsgård has become a warrior viking tearing through villages on a fighting and murdering rampage when he learns where his mother and uncle are living the man disguises himself as a slave and goes to work on their farm there he meets the ethereal witch olga of the birch forest anya taylorjoy a fellow slave who also possesses magical powers after suffering for years amleth finally gets revenge on those who wronged him so long ago brutality rages in this film and its not for weak stomachs blood guts and beheadings continue throughout this is one of the most intensely violent films i have ever seen and at times its a challenge to watch eggers seamlessly incorporates aspects of viking mythology from their spiritual beliefs to historical customs mysticism and fantasy in the form of valkyries and witches exist in his story as does the savagery of their way of life in 10th century iceland its evident that the filmmaking team took their time doing exhaustive research on what it was like at the time in order to make the film as historically accurate as possible for that reason it feels like being transported back to the dark barbaric past the film gives a real sense of what it must have been like to be alive during that time the attention to detail is incredibly precise and the costumes and makeup are jawdropping the performances are phenomenal across the board from skarsgårds primal fury to kidmans wickedtongued mother there isnt a dud here the casting is excellent and everyone fits their part the film dives into strange and artsy territory which may try the patience of viewers expecting noholdsbarred historical action there are plenty of exciting scenes of bloodthirsty battles but the script has some unexpectedly thoughtful moments as well thank you very much for this encouraging review i was betwixt and between re watching the film having been a regular viewer of vikings i decided against seeing it and watched my usual fare instead though ill definitely watch when it comes up for hire i had the feeling it may have been in the style of the revenant which i did not like due to my reservations with this well it is very much like the revenant and it is super violent and gory that was difficult to sit through but the historical accuracy of the costumes rituals etc is something pretty special 
May 15 2022,positive,with its naked sword fight on top of an exploding volcano the northman is radits bloodsoaked tale of vengeance right in line with the great icelandic sagas an epic cinematic rendering of a story that has been told for at least a thousand years
May 15 2022,negative,visually it is darkly stunning but storywise it is all over the place nicole kidman is one film and alexander sharsgard is in another anna taylorjoy doesnt know where the heck shes supposed to be 
May 14 2022,positive,eggers film didnt resonate with me after i left the theater i never felt pulled into the orbit of amleths revenge close enough to really empathize with his plight gorgeously shot yet oddly hollow emotionally 
May 14 2022,negative, i wanted to love robert eggerss followup to the witch and the lighthouse but maybe a bigbudget viking saga just isnt the right fit for a wonderful weirdo like him i was so looking forward to the northman im bewildered to report that it didnt dazzle me that i gazed on this viking epic largely unmoved a serious disappointment and i like viking movies if i can get decent longboats berserker fights vengeful slaves axethrowing and the chilling moan of those crazy goat horns i dont even mind if stuff gets a little cheesy bonus points for ernest borgnine in the vikings 1958 yelling odin as he leaps into a pit of ravenous wolves sword in hand backed by universals focus features the northman is robert eggers first launch into studio filmmaking and mainstream hollywood with the directors previous projects the witch 2015 and the lighthouse 2019 making waves on a much smaller scale as indie horrors unfortunately the northmans opening weekend was a box office bomb bringing in only 12 million domestically  23 million in total globally  against eggers quoted 7090 million budget the northman is about a glowering musclebound manmountain named prince amleth alexander skarsgård son of stellan who as a boy witnesses the killing of his father king aurvandill ethan hawke and the abduction of his mother queen gudrún nicole kidman by the kings betraying halfbastard brother fjölnir claes bang amleth vows revenge if that sounds vaguely like hamlet its by design it seems shakespeare adapted his play from old norse sagas and director robert eggers is a stickler for them and norse history in general hiring scholars to factcheck him throughout the development process but first amleth has to escape grow up and channel his hate which runs like a freezing river through my veins into the berserker lifestyle finally he resumes his quest for revenge disguising himself as a slave so he can be shipped off with the others to the iceland settlement run by king fjölnir who by now has already lost the kingdom he usurped in norway for the first time in an eggers film the casting is a distracting problem in the witch the luminous anya taylorjoy in her starmaking debut led an inspired ensemble and in the lighthouse robert pattinson and willem dafoe gave performances of aweinspiring conviction in impossibly demanding roles but in the northman dull brooder skarsgård makes you realize how highly watchable arnold schwarzenegger was in conan the barbarian 1982 which just happens to be one of eggerss inspirations along with andrei tarkovskys andrei rublev even more frustrating is the fact that frequently standing next to skarsgård is a far more scintillating actor anya taylorjoy whos given very little to do as olga a witchy slave captured in the raid on the land of rus by the gang of vikings that included amleth once in iceland amleth and olga sneak off frequently behind hillocks to plan their slave revolt olga says darkly your strength breaks mens bones i have the cunning to break their minds which sounds pretty cool but unfortunately you sit through the entire film waiting for her to do some mindbreaking and she never does she mixes up a batch of hallucinogenic soup at one point but thats the extent of it theres something so basically off about the whole project i can only wonder what happened to you robert eggers cowriting with sjón an icelandic poet and novelist eggers brings his usual obsession with historical accuracy to bear on the film crosschecking his script and locations and costumes and props and everything else against what leading scholars say about the north atlantic at the turn of the tenth century eggerss obsession with minutia led to wild choices like alexander skarsgård wearing the same pair of boots throughout the entire shoot repaired with strips of leather when they fell apart we must laud these excesses this fixation on weirdbuttrue history because it thwarts the typical disneyfication of older stranger worlds that we tend to see in hollywood and this approach worked wonderfully in eggerss triumphant debut the witch and in his even more daring followup film the lighthouse but somehow here its run him aground all through the northman it seems as if the viking epic was directed by someone working in the style of robert eggers but without his ability to zero in on the specific shots and scenes to make a compelling vision of the past come alive in the witch its those handheld shots from the back of the family wagon roughly sharing the point of view of the children as their puritan communitys big wooden gates shut on them consigning them to their fates in the terrifying seventeenthcentury wilderness in the lighthouse its those first blackandwhite shots in a vintage squareshaped aspect ratio of that godforsaken rock off the coast of 1890s new england the northman has all the lavish resources studios can command and it looks extraordinarily handsome throughout shot by the same gifted cinematographer as eggerss previous films jarin blaschke its got gorgeous scenery wonderful firelit interiors cool beards and braids nice fur wraps and even bjork in a small role as a scary seeress but somehow those key shots that ignite the imagination and deliver you into the power of the narrative never appear frankly i dont think i will do it again even if it means like not making a film this big ever again    and by the way id like to make a film this big id like to make one even bigger but without control i dont know its too hard on my person but hes also walked back those earlier remarks insisting that the film represents no loss of authorship and that the studios role through postproduction was necessary to achieve the best version of the northman still it seems clear that hes ambiguous at best about the process of making bigbudget mainstream movies that almost inevitably involve a lot of interference from studio brass if you read about eggerss childhood as a wunderkind encouraged at every turn by intellectual and creative adults to fulfill his potential it seems hes had such a rarefied experience overall its made him unlikely to thrive in the meatgrinder system of the mainstream film industry as eggers put it himself when asked why he thought testscreening audiences were having trouble with earlier cuts of the northman he said currently with my best intentions like im not normal i look like a poster boy for a bushwick hipster but that is where my relatability ends i fear its that i fear at the end of the sentence that marks eggers as a reader a dreamer one of those obsessive kids who lives in their heads full of art and history and fantasy and as a result talks in unusual phraseology even into adulthood guess how i know eggers admits he was initially indifferent to norse sagas which were too macho for my sensibilities it was his wife clinical psychologist alexandra shaker who inspired him with her love of all that bloodspewing bonebreaking honorkilling folklore and it could be that its just not an ideal meeting of writerdirector and subject matter the films an honorable failure in my view but i also feel a certain urgency in saying that the sooner robert eggers goes back to his previous independent mode of filmmaking on subjects that obsess him personally from the start the better
May 13 2022,positive,this is a movie that doesnt shy away from emotions it embraces them fully the actors dont shy away from overacting either they revel in it and this is both refreshing and entertaining
May 12 2022,positive, he may be known for the arthouse rather than the mainstream but writerdirector robert eggers action and ideas are never knowingly undersold tone is incredibly important to this viking tale of revenge which is so fullon it could easily tip into parody and eggers makes his attentions clear from the off with a spot of portentous voiceover and strong visuals  it feels shakespearean and so perhaps it should given that its central figure amleth alexander skarsgård was also the inspiration for hamlet eggers previously tackled american puritanism with the witch and late 1800s superstition in the lighthouse taking an immersive approach to the belief systems in his films you genuinely feel how much his characters have faith in their gods and their folk tales as an extension of their everyday lives to the extent that the dividing line between what is real and what is imagined becomes almost nonexistent his films also have an elemental feel thats particularly in evidence here with water present as icy snow and waves while fire is represented both in ritual and by way of volcano the story cowritten by icelandic poet and novelist sjón is as old as the volcano itself and sees young amleth witness the death of his viking king father ethan hawke at the hands of his dads brother fjölnir claes bang going on the run he chants the mantra that basically drives the story i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir eggers mantra is equally straightforward go big or go home eggers approach offers some glorious moments including an atavistic comingofage ritual in which ethan hawke and his young costar oscar novak playing amleth as a child bring home the viking connection to the natural world as they howl like wolves or a viking raid shot in a long take that brings home its murderous menance the problem with eggers love of a big mood is that as with all his films he operates at such a high level of intensity that he has barely anywhere else to go as the action progresses i longed for some of the subtlety and allegorical underpinning of david lowerys the green knight  hinted at in the films more mystical moments anya taylorjoy who got her break in the witch turns up as love interest olga  not that eggers has much time for such fripperies a shame given the matriarchal structures of icelandic society  while bjork has an enjoyable cameo as the viking equivalent of macbeths three witches although i do have to question the casting of nicole kidman as amleths mother she is only nine years older than skarsgård and looks a lot less than you can also feel the studio at work when it comes to the films final act or rather acts uncertain whether to offer happiness or tragedy it tries not entirely successfully to go for both in a bid to provide something for everyone theres plenty of might about eggers films but i could use a bit more heart
May 11 2022,positive,the northman is brutal bloody and violent even a little gory at times but its beautiful aesthetics displayed in every shot and every sequence place it above other movies with similar topics review in spanish
May 8 2022,positive, theres a poetry to robert eggers language as a storyteller his incredibly detailed world has a gravitational pull toward excellence it comes through in his dialogue camera framing and immersive production design and although his latest the northman is a classic tale as old as time eggers bakes a brutal cake layered with meaning incredibly rewarding themes and a grand sense of mystery like eggers previous work the witch and the lighthouse the northman is wicked and delightfully weird without ever losing its grip on being a compelling character study engulfed in dazzling imagery  and its his best film to date the focus features viking epic follows prince amleth oscar novak on the verge of becoming a man when his father ethan hawke is ferociously murdered by his uncle a terrific claes bang of the square amleths uncle kidnaps prince amleths mother an awardworthy nicole kidman leaving his world upside down as he tries to find his place in it raised with tremendous hate in his heart for the next 20 years prince amleth alexander skarsgård is ready to exact revenge and take back whats been stolen from him compared to eggers previous two films the northman is his most straightforward narrative however that doesnt hinder the experience one bit eggers films are mesmerizing because of the haunting and psychedelic imagery and detail the witch and the lighthouse both feature images that will continue to live on and the northman is no different  theres a scene involving children that will stick and really upset some people its incredibly dark and brutal but it raises interesting questions about where the line is for amleth he is someone so consumed with hate that hes strategic about everything making the basic need to be human feel nonexistent this is perfectly visualized in a scene where he cries his last tear as a child and what kind of eggers movie would this be if it didnt dip into the supernatural this is an arena that eggers excels in as a filmmaker anything that feels otherworldly is always grounded because of his navigational skills with tone he can show you the most disturbing material and still have you eager to see where the story goes  one terrific duel between amleth and a giant undead entity will excite those who have a taste for the weird but the sequence also pumps the brakes with its followthrough all these largerthanlife experiences have a reason for going to the extreme for instance the fight scene mentioned above could be read as an internal battle to prove amleths worthiness in receiving heroic gifts like a sword eggers is cautious about blurring the lines between fantasy and reality  performancewise so much can be said about skarsgårds beastly take not only does he tap into the complex emotions of a man trying to fulfill a promise and have a legacy of his own but he also brings so much physically to the role thats intoxicating one scene when he catches a spear and throws it right back to its sender is chilling how skarsgård walks in a slow deliberate and bloodthirsty manner is something that deserves to be decorated in gold youll believe amleths pain 100 percent but it is kidman who gives the most surprising turn of the film its been some time since shes gone to this level she accomplishes so much in such little screen time primarily in a scene near the films last third which is one of the most powerfully constructed and acted moments in any movie ever youll know it when you see it because youll feel a fire build within you  the northman may not pull everyone in at once but it will have some serious legs more and more people will discover it over time and those who do will sing its praises far and wide its an old story older than hamlet hamlet with his similar sounding name is actually based on amleths journey but theres such a freshness to its view on fatherhood and what we lose along the way theres also a lot to admire and learn like how the younger generation sees the older generation as having more integrity for having faced a harder world  from visionary director robert eggers comes the northman an actionfilled epic that follows a young viking prince on his quest to avenge his fathers murder with an allstar cast that includes alexander skarsgård nicole kidman claes bang anya taylorjoy ethan hawke björk and willem dafoe preston barta is a member of the critics choice association and the dallasfort worth film critics association read his work here on freshfictiontv and rottentomatoescom follow him on instagram at bluraydad
May 6 2022,negative, directed by robert eggers the northman follows vikingera warrior amleth alexander skarsgård as he sets out to avenge the brutal murder of his father ethan hawkes aurvandill at the hands of his own brother claes bangs fjölnir filmmaker eggers working from a screenplay written with sjón delivers an often astonishingly impenetrable endeavor that contains few if any elements designed to capture and sustain the viewers attention and theres little doubt ultimately that the armslength atmosphere is compounded and then some by an ongoing emphasis on frustratingly and palpably indecipherable dialogue  as eggers has seemingly directed his talented roster of heavilyaccented performers to mumble and whisper their way through the pictures entire interminable runtime it is as a result not surprising to note that the northman suffers from a pervasive lack of context that grows increasingly problematicdisastrous as it progresses with eggers frequent reliance on headscratching asides and digressions including a series of laughably pretentious dream sequences certainly going a long way towards perpetuating the nigh endless vibe and although eggers has admittedly peppered the proceedings with a very small handful of engaging interludes eg amleth violently storms a small village alongside other vikings the northman builds towards a completely and hopelessly underwhelming climax that ensures it concludes on as lackluster a note as one couldve envisioned  with the end result an epicallymisguided trainwreck that couldnt possibly be less interesting or involving
May 5 2022,positive,the northman falls short of being an epic film but the mastery in composition of the film is noteworthy
May 5 2022,positive,execution performance and art direction are all unparalleled but the whole simply proves a solid familial melodrama in the end they cant all be great
May 5 2022,positive, those familiar with hamlet will find some familiar things in robert eggers the northman and that is no coincidence the source material for both is sjóns gesta danorum circa 1200 about a prince with both mommy issues and a usurping uncle where shakespeare adapted the story to his time creating an elegantly and eloquently melancholy protagonist eggers has embraced the wildness of the original creating a world of primal ritual where the spirit realm regularly interacts with the material one and life is nasty brutish and short mercifully so if we can take the word of amleths father aurvandil ethan hawke whose fondest hope is to die in battle rather than be disgraced by lingering into decrepit old age it does give a whole new cast to the ending and if only for that eggers is to be highly commended this amleth alexander skarsgård more direct in his speech and far less elegant by modern standard is the beloved son of aurvandil and gudrun nicole kidman on the last sunny day of his childhood his father newly returned from battle with the spoils of same takes young amleth to an overnight underground ritual that will mark him as his heir and usher him into manhood the mindaltering substance involved along with the burps and farts that separate humans from the beasts affords fantastic visions the first of many in a film dense with symbolism and savagery and bonds father and son so tightly that when brother and uncle fjölnir claes bang sets upon them as they leave the ritual caverns it commits amleth to a life pledged to avenging his father saving his mother from the rapacious fjölnir and killing said rapacious fjölnir it is the invective the young prince spews as a mantra as he rows away from certain death into the land of the rus years pass and the young man now grown to ferocious manhood as a warrior pillaging the countryside learns the fate of his treacherous uncle he summarily decides to pass himself off as a slave in order to infiltrate the kings exile settlement in iceland and take his revenge he meets the sly and subte olga anya taylorjoy a fellow slave who isnt fooled by his disguise but who is taken with his plans and offers to break minds the way amleth plans on breaking bones eggers spares us little of what made northmen aka vikings so feared the scenes of just how the rus decimate a peaceful village without mercy or even much thought as to the humanity of their victims is the stuff of nightmares this amleth is no scholar home from university dithering about what to do this is a killing machine whipped into a berserker skarsgård embodies the physicality effortlessly and imbues this tortured soul with an equally tortured emotional state he simmers with rage while mouthing humility to his new masters and evokes the psychic scars of remorse when seeing his mother again for the first time since the fratricide there is also a complexity to his relationship with olga at first latching on to her only as an instrument of revenge and then slipping into an attachment without sentiment yet with a similarly seething passion this is a character of his time and place certainly made unsympathetic to us by his actions yet skarsgård while never mitigating amleths warrior code still makes of amleth a sympathetic character capable of invoking our sympathy by keying into the part of amleth that is resonant in his plight its a subtle performance in a film that is ferocious and all the more effective for it the spirit world and the material world share the same psychic space here such that no raven is merely a bird and a valkyrie with graven teeth flying amleth through the air to meet his fate is no more unusual than a seagull floating over the landscape in a place where dismembered corpses provokes no horror beyond the disrespect inflicted on ones honor and where human sacrifice is little more noteworthy than any other kind the spirit worlds hold is not only credible but a necessary component in the context that eggers provides the mystical is an explanation and a release not unlike the orgiastic rituals and the protocricket played with extreme prejudice when death is merely a transition from one reality to another the fleeting nature of life is a given and not something about which to fret as in the case of aurvandil death achieved honorably and in ones prime a gift the northman is a dark tale told with precision and wonder it is a brutal experience for the viewer forceful and forthright in its vision but it is an experience that is more than mere entertainment because it does more than merely immerse us in an alien culture that is abhorrent by modern standards it makes it sensible on many levels we might never want to spend a day or even an hour in this place and this time but there is something about the easy communion with the invisible world that is aspirational plus a hero every bit as complex as the one with which shakespeare gifted us
May 4 2022,positive, director robert eggers has quickly made a name for himself in hollywood thanks to his first two features the somber yet entrancing horror films the witch and the lighthouse but with his third feature the northman eggers has definitively proved that hes a cinematic force to be reckoned with the northman is a revenge tale based loosely on a viking legend and it allows eggers to lay bare his ambitious sweeping vision with emphatic determination and wellearned confidence the story itself is as predictable as most movies about retribution but the fact that this movie is nonetheless bewitching despite its predictability is the most telling testament to eggers unique and effective style of storytelling set mostly in a small kingdom off the coast of ireland sometime in the 9th century the northman opens as king aurvandill ethan hawke returns to his wife queen gudrun nicole kidman and their young son prince amleth who encounters bizarre beings such as a hewitch played by willem dafoe and a seeress who may not even have eyes played by icelandic singer björk the king is soon struck down in his prime before his sons very eyes and though the boy runs away to spare himself the same fate he eventually grows up to be a man hellbent on avenging his fathers murder played as an adult by alexander skarsgard in a careerbest role amleth sets out to find the target of his vengeance  his own murderous uncle fjölnir claes bang given the rather simple setup it doesnt take a seeress to know what you can reasonably expect to occur over the next two hours amleth knows he is fated to die at the gates of hell but not before he rescues his mother and kills his uncle anna taylor joy also shows up to lend the proceedings some additional intrigue as a mysterious sorceress peasant but the role proves ultimately pointless and the northman proceeds almost exactly as you expect it to from start to finish that said eggers and his cowriter icelandic poet sjón earn the films leisurely running time as they make this familiar story utterly captivating the point clearly is the journey and not amleths fateful destination that trek is created by eggers confident camera and jarin blaschkes vigorous cinematography as well as louise fords seamless editing and sebastian gainsboroughs heartpounding score other talented veterans from eggers first two films include costume designer linda muir and production designer craig lathrop this gifted belowtheline group works in harmony together and the gorgeous final product reflects both their devotion to the project and their dedication to each other muir designs the vikingstyle costumes you might expect but she accentuates her characters with various flourishes such as headpieces and other bits of armor that denote a heightened sense of importance lathrop gives you fireplaces sheds where a lot of scary and important things happen a witchs cavern and a mighty volcano appropriately called hel while ford takes you from fastpaced action to panoramic still shots of the incredible vistas that blaschke captures in the background gainsboroughs soundtrack insists that this story is epic and that more is at stake than simply fate or honor after all prince amleth is widely understood to be the inspiration for shakespeares hamlet so much is riding on his swole shoulders of course this story would not be nearly as interesting were it not for the equally capable actors who help eggers tell it skarsgard and bang are two of scandinavias best working thespians today and what can one say of tireless aussie nicole kidman though the amalgam of accents that these actors of different nationalities employ at times teeters dangerously close to house of gucci territory most of the action in eggers screenplay is thankfully on the battlefield or in the shadows and there is insufficient dialogue to grate the senses with a spoken mélange of tones at the end of the day these three actors as well as dafoe and taylorjoy triumph with their expressions and visceral movements and the northman conveys the same grandiose consequentiality that any of shakespeares royal tragedies do few will walk out of the northman without taking something memorable with them though the inherent predictability of revenge movies with their familiar themes of fate and destiny and excessive use of animal symbolism in this case ravens and goats can often result in a heavyhanded movie that is fortunately not the case with eggers third film thanks to eggers confident manner of storytelling one that permits his brilliant cast to meld seamlessly with the monumental efforts of numerous craftspeople the northman is one of the most impressive if not downright haunting movies to hit theaters in quite a while
May 4 2022,positive, the environment of the northman is one of ice and fire one where its difficult to imagine anything beyond cloudy skies dirt  mud windy days and volcanic nights and such an environment of course breeds a kind of man who fights as if dominated and possessed by the elements knights of ice and fire they could be director robert eggers after his previous effort the lighthouse continues his exploratory thread of male gender politics and bonds if by way of ripped abs and pure vengeance no matter how potentially challenging his movie is a revenge action picture first and foremost crafted out of iron and sorcery delivered to a moviegoing world that demands the familiar and the colorful revenge is familiar and colorful but the landscape is cloudy and bleak smothered in the smog of smoke this is a film that gives what is wanted without any regrets through an environment thats as angry as it is awesome nothing about the northman is unattainable to standard observation its all simple to gather if dressed up with the legend of spells and rituals the young prince of a viking kingdom goes on the run after witnessing the murder of his father and the kidnapping of his mother at the hands of his uncle vowing to avenge his fallen family and to kill anyone and everyone in his way living for nothing more growing up to become an axwielding pack of muscles in the form of alexander skarsgard the prince covers his animalistic intent with the sheepskin veil of a mildmannered slave in order to fulfill his fate and end his journey a standard tale but boldly told moviegoing with bill is a readersupported publication to receive new posts get exclusives join my movie club and support my work consider becoming a paid subscriber skarsgard plays this prince with a hulking presence speaking as if to grunt and shout  at least at first its celebratory how well hes able to transition the character back into a human being and thinking individual after years and years as an instinctual beast its through both his longform hunt and his meeting with a young handmaiden slave played by anya taylorjoy the northman bludgeons and brutalizes and casts much magic but its in the performance of joy whose role is on a path towards freedom and life and genius that a kind of grace is found no duh but absolutely fine as is joy shines with intensity when calm and control when intense shes come so far from her revelatory turn in eggerss the witch pushing herself further and further if in baby steps slow and steady it would be a shame to write about the acting in this film without mentioning its bestperformed sequence between skarsgard and nicole kidman theres a spectrum between joy and kidmans female characters both with a kind of push and pull on the princes very soul kidmans queen and mother when confronted by her son becomes yet another obstacle and source of sorcery for skarsgard to conquer but at this moment he stalls like a stunned child kidman exerts such frightening and nonresonant power by which i mean hardly anyone could relate to the game shes playing at least no one would want to admit relating to that and thats an amazing feat  when your movie begins with a foreboding shot of a premature feels like it volcanic eruption and a snarly and growly voiceover youre setting up for something that rarely could be lived up to something absurdly visionary born of nightmares and male genetic jackhammering true to this design the northman achieves this kind of ethereal environment and surprisingly another  something that resembles a high definition video game story mode i couldnt help but think of crazy samurai musashi a onetake swordswiping escapade thats more gameplay than narrative when watching the northman there is no secondhand experience with this film though i didnt feel as if i was impatiently watching my brother play something exciting the excitement this time out was playing for me and me alone 
May 4 2022,positive,drenched in testosterone northman is less concerned with reinventing the wheel with its narrative built on the same mythology that inspired hamlet but rather with making you feel the visceral human anger and rage underpinning its entire proceedings 
May 3 2022,positive, in director robert eggers the lighthouse latest the ripped swede portrays a viking hellbent on revenge alongside nicole kidman anya taylorjoy ethan hawke and björk robert eggers crafts ancient fairy tales drenched in torment and madness and the northman proves a fable of fire blood and fury that expands the ferocious scale of his folkhorror cinema fuming with a rage so fearsome as to be otherworldly the latest from the director of the witch and the lighthouse is at once a kindred spirit to those masterful predecessors and a turning point for the 38yearold auteur employing his trademark aesthetics and atmosphere for a more streamlined and archetypal story about a viking prince on a quest for revenge against his treacherous uncle coated in dirt and muck and stained in swaths of crimson its a grand and gruesome epic of destiny and decapitations malevolence and magica deathmetal ode to honor retribution and sacrifice that casts payback in a surprisingly and thrillingly positive light with ripped abs and a cold singleminded stare amleth alexander skarsgård is a man without a home or a clan living among other viking marauders who believe themselves to be lycanthropic beasts howling at the moon like wolves and roaring at the sky like bears around blazing campfires by the time we meet amleth we already know whats made him so feral courtesy of an introductory 895 ad passage that focuses on the ordeal suffered by the young amleth oscar novak years earlier when his father king aurvandill ethan hawke returned home from battle to his queen gudrún nicole kidman and his brother fjölnir claes bang aurvandill is an aloof monarch to his wife but he exhibits rugged affection for his son taking him to a forest temple whereunder the guidance of court jester and spiritual shaman heimir the fool willem dafoethey participate in a hallucinatory pagan ritual that links man to animal and allows amleth to spy the tree of kings which resides within their bloodline though amleth is heir to the throne his world is shattered when following this mindmelting experience his father is set upon and slain by fjölnir in an act of betrayal that will forever shape the princes path the northmans setup is pure conan the barbarian replete with heads being separated from shoulders by mighty blades in the snowy woods and like john milius 1982 gem eggers film carries itself like a legend full of hulking mass and import the only nod to historical reality is a brief mention of king harald fairhair from the armor and fur cloaks worn by aurvandill to the mist and smoke that cover this chilly landscape to the crunching footsteps of the men and horses that traverse it the action moves like a lumbering goliath trudging onward toward ruin mayhem and tragedy thats as inevitable as the rotation of the earth theres mammoth weight to this saga and once it shifts its attention to skarsgårds grown amleth that heft is embodied by its protagonist who screams and bellows with a vehemence thats also expressed through bludgeoning combat from the desolate look on his face its apparent that amleths days of killing and pillaging are only temporary and they conclude following an encounter with a blind seeress björk as mesmerizingly weird and chilling as expected who prophecies that his fate is to avenge his fathers assassination on a fiery lake with a mythic steel sword at which point a maiden king will assume the crown this compels amleth to join up with a group of slaves bound for the icelandic homestead of fjölnir who despite his fratricidal perfidy has been reduced to living life as a farmer in this group amleth meets olga anya taylorjoy an imprisoned woman who speaks in outmoded tongues to the god of the soil and together they conspire to achieve amleths ends along the way falling in love amleth seeks to save his mother and murder his uncle and he takes a slowburn approach to serving fjölnir his just deserts fjölnir doesnt know amleths true identity and he and his arrogant and unworthy sons treat amleth as a lowly piece of property much of the northmans middle passages involve the vikings acts of sly insurgence and stealthy terror including dismembering two guards and impaling them against a hut in the shape of a steed everything builds toward inevitable hellfire and doom and eggers stages it with a methodical headdown resolve that echoes the determination of amleth whom the magnetic skarsgård turns into a figure of obsessive purpose convinced that felling his disloyal uncle and liberating his mom are his sole reasons for existing and will grant him the peace and freedom hes never known the northman immerses itself in a pit of anguish and anger equal parts mystical valkyrieandvalhalla dreams and gritty realworld nightmares and eggers evokes it with his usual array of silky and muscular camerawork and grayblack imagery via cinematographer jarin blaschke as well as a robin carolan and sebastian gainsborough score of thunderous malice here punctuated by bagpipes his cast is highly attuned to the dour and demented atmosphere hes conjured a merciless bang and cruel kidman tap into the ugliness of this bygone world taylorjoy radiates holy hope as the sole person committed to amleths enterprise and dafoe exudes a familiar brand of maniacal deviance noseless soldiers human sacrifices undead warrior kings and packs of wolves and birds the latter imbued as in the lighthouse with menacing spiritual power are additional elements of this grim stew which eggers transforms into a primeval portrait of the desire to wrathfully redress past wrongs that can never be undone amleth executes his mission with ghastly resolution and if the northman boasts less of the delirious spiraling lunacy of the lighthouse it makes up for it with broadshouldered batteringram savagery shrouded in flickering gloom his tableaus of agony and wonder enhanced by unsettling cgi eggers spins a yarn thats 1000 years old and yet pulses with timeless ire his story locating the sweet spot where the archaic and the new seamlessly intertwine moreover while his film adheres to the tenets of its chosen genre it eschews the moralizing that often defines it instead embracing the notion that vengeance can fuel a righteous cause rather than merely be an annihilating force that destroys the vengeful theres horror and insanity in the northmans vision of predestined reckonings and also beauty in its final contention that some ordained undertakings are worth the blistering brutal cost
May 2 2022,positive, in early june netflix is having a geeked week featuring a lot of content geared towards genre fans but it looks like that moment is already here given the arrival of two films that could hardly be more customtooled towards a particular kind of cult cinephile and which have both been eagerly awaited by that demographic for some time both could be nutshelled as action movies but neither are exactly within the range of normal for that genre one is by a bona fide auteur and no michael bays ambulance a couple weeks ago did not count while the other is well about as postmodernist as such things get robert eggers has acquired considerable cache by directing two chamberscaled period horror films that were really psychological thrillers at least until the end and even then you could argue whatever supernatural events occurred were only hallucinated by characters pushed past sanity 2015s the witch was an extraordinary portrait of religious fear and fanaticism amongst an exiled settler family in 1630s new england  three years later the lighthouse with willem dafoe and robert pattison as island station keepers going mad from isolation in the 1890s was equally striking if arguably a mite less successful as a whole both were singular visions that had an uncompromising severity of style atmosphere and story contentsomething hard enough to pull off at all let alone excite a fairly large general audience with the northman is something else entirely though a big long starry swordandsorcery epic that probably cost five or six times the combined production budgets of those prior features it begins in the ireland of 895 ad as king aurvandill ethan hawke returns from conquests abroad eager to reunite with queen gudrun nicole kidman and their son prince amelth oscar novak who at age 1o or so is considered ready to undergo a ritual passage to manhood under the guidance of his fathers holy fool heimir dafoe but soon after aurvandill is murdered by his own jealous sibling fjolnir claes bang forcing the boy to flee or be killed himself when we next meet amelth he is played by the strapping alexander skarsgard and is part of a roving band of bloodthirsty barbarians raiding villages for loot and sport he abandons that mercenary lot to pose as a captured slave upon learning that fjolnir and gudrun are now living in icelandic exile he then sets about proving himself loyal in many ways to gain access to the fallen royal couple all the while scheming revengefor his dead father and for his presumably unwillinglyremarried mother its a brutal very masculine world in which the witchs anya taylorjoy as a slavic slavesorceresslove interest and icelandic icon bjork in a glorified cameo as the seeress have the sole other female roles of note ones that might easily have been cut with little change to the central plot you can tell eggers and coscenarist sjon were as scrupulous as possible about period veracity like the directors previous films this one is visually arresting in ways that emphasize the physical challenges of landscape custom and era all the performances are strong skarsgard was born for this kind of role as hes got the requisite awesome physique and heroic handsomeness as well as the acting chops to create a credible realworld character rather than a cartoon action figure like conan the barbarian every taxdeductible donation helps us grow to cover the issues that mean the most to our community become a 48 hills hero and support the only daily progressive news source in the bay area yet impressive as it is in all these departments the northmanwhich the director did not have final cut control over calling its postproduction process painfulnever quite transcends genre the way eggers has before it is an exceptionally serious even humorless dark ages spectacle of combat adventure and shakespearean intrigue with a dash of magic but while it lacks the pulpier qualities of game of thrones or the vikings it nonetheless doesnt land far enough from them in gist nor from bigscreen muscleman epics stretching from steve reeves to schwarzenegger eggers hasnt quite elevated the familiar conventions such that they become something else entirely the way david lowery did with the arthurian saga in last years the green knight of course you dont hand someone 7590 million and expect them to deliver anything in the realm of 1967 czech marketa lazarova or nicolas winding refns 2009 valhalla rising two brutally pure nearabstract representations of medieval hardship that would be financial suicide but for all its pagan mysticism intelligent detail and frequent beauty the northman ultimately feels like a fairly formulaic costume revenge taleone with higher pretensions than most to be sure but not so much of a higher effect its a good movie yet also a little disappointing because its not quite good enough to get away with being so little fun theres really nothing but fun on the agenda in the unbearable weight of massive talent which also opens in theaters nationwide fri22 its central joke is well nicolas cage playing nicolas cage semiwashedup movie star still starring in a whole lot of movies most recent years hes released about six per their very erratic quality considered part of his charmand of his selfharm given that he was known almost from the start for giving peculiar overthetop performances even in mainstream hits like peggy sue got married or moonstruck but especially in quirkfests like vampires kiss wild at heart and raising arizona it seems rather astonishing in retrospect that for a while there this weirdo was one of the most popular actors in the world starring in at least a few of the most middleoftheroad entertainments imaginable from 1996s the rock to 2004s national treasure but it didnt last and his increasingly busy decreasingly selective filmography purportedly encouraged by very spendy offscreen ways gradually turned him into a sort of professional novelty act how gonzo would he be this time how random could his eccentricities get would they actually relate to the movie theyre in or not will he elevate it or sink it or if hes in an infrequent earnest mode will the effect be touching or just seem disinterested i have really enjoyed some nic cage performances and movies in recent years chief among them mandy mom  dad and last years pig but he remains a true wild cardnot only in that you dont know what hell do but you dont know whether what he does will be good for the movie or even for nicolas cage unbearable weight has the clever if risky see the cautionary example of burt reynolds 2017 quasiswan song the last movie star idea of having its star basically play himself well he is playing himself nicolas cage albeit a version that apparently took some armtwisting before he was willing to accept endlessly selfabsorbed pretentious about his art and its applied shamanic thespian instincts very sensitive about criticisms re his career trajectory a bit too eager to please borderline desperate to get the role of a lifetime that would put him back on top but which he may be too nolongerhot to win in other words exactly the mix of largerthanlife swaggering celebrity and terminally insecure basketcase we might well imagine cage to be thats the cage 20 director tom gormican and coscenarist kevin etten levy upon a longsuffering fictive exwife sharon horgan and teenage daughter lily sheen who are really fed up with his shit particularly after he reacts to a professional setback by getting very drunk and extremely embarrassing at the latters 16th birthday party just as well then that the next gig arranged for him by agent neil patrick harris is not a movie but a paid personal appearance at the estate of a rich spanish superfan alleged olive grower javi pedro pascal yes it is demeaning to parade ones nearly60yearold self before complete strangers and pretend to be their friend just for a 1 million paycheck but such are the travails of a formeralist actor belying his luxurious digs and high security turns out javi appears a pretty nice guy as well as a sincerely flattering fan and despite the occasional harassing innervoice snark from his younger self nicky cage digitally youthified to the mid1980s our protagonist has started to actually enjoy this sojourn when he is informed by two cia agents tiffany hadish ike barinholtz that they require his cooperation javi they say is in truth a violent international arms cartel chief whose goons just kidnapped the teenage daughter of a latin american president he wants ousted the captive girl may even be held on the premises where the star of faceoff and con air is currently boozily suntanning  for america for love of decency he must use his acting skills to make like a spy perhaps even an action hero to save her what could be easier how many times before has he played that kinda part could it be so hard to do for real needless to say oh yes it could unbearable weight is not deep but it juggles a lot of balls rather delightfully paying affectionate homage to its fucking legend star while also ridiculing him and letting him ridicule himself operating as an actual action movie while parodying the genre there are a bazillion references to past nicolas cage filmsyou might even say the passage in which he and pascal trip on lsd is one long bow to his screen gonzodom yet a measure of the films essential good naturedness is that the best cinephile injoke here is a running gag reference to a movie he had nothing to do with paddington 2 the cuddly 2017 sequel that could well be the single best feature film of the last decade no childless adult ever even thought about watching  why is it plugged so incongruously in this goofy fanflick for grownups well why not paddington 2 really is all that and the unbearable weight of massive talent only makes itself even more agreeable for saying sothe

May 2 2022,positive, the tale of amleth or the legend that inspired it was the inspiration for shakespeares hamlet titled the northman in this robert eggers version the two stories have much in common  eggers is both a researcher and a filmmaker his movies the witch and the lighthouse were based on writings from the eras in which they were set he wrote this one with the icelandic poet sjón to create an accurate depiction of viking life the tale is set just before 930 ad we meet amleth as a boy whose father ethan hawke initiates him as a prince in a ceremony conducted by a shaman played by an unrecognizable willem dafoe the boy runs away and is said to be dead but amleth survives on his rage and vows to avenge his father kill his uncle and save his mother amleth grows into a strong violent brute killing almost at will while he wanders after he discovers his uncle and mother now live in iceland he poses as a slave to reach them  it wouldnt be fair to tell you the rest of it although it is not a fantasy it does involve fortunes being told  i was reminded a couple of times of the weird sisters  and ritual as well as a magical sword the performances not surprisingly are superlative and so are the visuals watch the details in the objects and the extras who populate the environments eggers has created a stunning harsh world to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
May 1 2022,neutral, with an obsessive attention to historical detail and a fascination with lore language and ritual there is no mistaking the northman for the work of anyone but robert eggers the witch the lighthouse but despite a bigger budget and a much bigger canvas does the directors new viking revenge epic add up to anything but a bloody good time along with that review adam and josh return to the buster keaton marathon with the actordirectors first masterpiece 1924s sherlock jr
May 1 2022,positive, the northman is a film thats right up my alley from the setting to the buckets of blood spilled over the 2 hour runtime its a violent visceral and engrossing voyage and i was hooked for every minute of it it also continues to mark robert eggers as a director to watch additionally fans of his work on the witch and the lighthouse are probably purchasing their tickets as we speak but what makes this film worth a watch here are three reasons why you should watch the northman eggers has worked with some of hollywoods most prolific actors including anyataylor joy and willem dafoe the northman boasts what may be his most impressive cast yet including those two the narrative focuses on prince amleth alexander skarsgard who seeks vengeance against his uncle fjölnir claes bang for murdering his father aurvandill ethan hawke and kidnapping his mother gudrún nicole kidman along the way amneth encounters the witch olga joy and the two form a partnership that quickly grows romantic much of the cast has previously starred in genre fare skarsgard is best known for his role in hbos true blood while hawke is playing arthur harrow in moon knight and bang portrayed dracula in the bbcs adaptation of bram stokers novel and as mentioned before both joy and dafoe have had roles in eggers previous films and show up here  dafoe shines in a brief role as heimir the fool who despite his name is responsible for sending amleth on the path to manhood skarsgard himself carries the film on his extremely ripped shoulders he runs through a gauntlet of emotions from fury to sorrow to passion and his chemistry with joy is electric another reason to watch the northman well the film has been described as arthouse conan the barbarian and thats not far off as the fight scenes in this film are extremely grisly heads are hacked off warriors are impaled and literal blood and guts fly across the screen one warrior even has his nose bitten off in a particularly gruesome scene however the end fight is truly amazing  i dont want to spoil what happens but its definitely worth the price of admission what really makes the fight scenes stand out is how eggers and his goto cinematographer jarin blaschke stage them a fight in a tomb features a shining beam of moonlight which bathes a brutal fight scene in unusually soft lighting another scene features snow covering a forest which serves as prelude to slaughter this movie may be brutal but its also surprisingly beautiful  and shows that eggers made good use of the 90 million budget with a narrative that takes place in the time of vikings and a screenplay that was cowritten by icelandic poet sjón its only natural that norse myth plays a role in the northman yggdrasil the tree of life is often referred to and even features in a dream sequence as a glowing tree comprised entirely of light with bodies hanging from its branches another dream sequence features a valkyrie riding through the sky her face contorted in a roar of primal fury not only does the use of norse myth play into the setting but it also continues a trend of surreal imagery thats permeated all of eggers films these are just a few of the reasons why you should watch the northman it hits that sweet spot between arthouse cinema and adrenalinepumping revenge film and like everything everywhere all at once proves that indie features can appeal to mainstream audiences the northman also marks a trio of new releases including the bad guys and the unbearable weight of massive talent which proves that there is a wealth of options in the theaters besides superheroes and remakes born and raised in texas collier cj jennings was introduced to geekdom at an early age by his father who showed him ultraman and star trek the next generation on his thirteenth birthday he received a copy of giant size xmen 1 and dove head first into the realm of pop culture never looking back his hobbies include writing screenplays and essays watching movies and television card gamesrpgs and cooking he currently resides in seattle satoru gojo is the heart of jujutsu kaisen season 2  now heading into cour 2 here is everything you need to know about the character 
Apr 30 2022,positive, robert eggers is behind the camera in this historical epic that seems to have appeared on cinema screens with little fanfare this in itself is strange as the film is by nature a bombastic and energetic presentation that revels in its own energy and embraces everything that such a film can represent apparently eggers and the films lead alexander skarsgard wanted to do a viking movie together so the northman became a labor of love for both artists the story of revenge is a well worn one but the setting and mystical presentation of the themes elevate this production for audiences that may initially feel they have seen this story done before and despite the criticism from some that the accents are a bit weird the performances here are well above average with the nocompromise direction producing a visceral and often shocking finished product with a cast that includes ethan hawke willem dafoe nicole kidman and anya taylorjoy it seems incredible that with a budget of just 70 million the film pulls itself together so satisfyingly admittedly a lot of the bigger names here provide just slightly more than cameos but you cant help wonder if some of the cast worked here for cheap skarsgard plays amleth the northman of the title who witnesses the murder of his father by his uncle in a shakespearian style plot point and is forced to flee as his uncle takes control of his brothers land he vows revenge and we follow his journey towards a final confrontation the film manages to juggle all the tropes you might expect in this kind of film with some very stylistic directorial flair that elevates this to a more artistic production than you might expect if you are of a certain age you may remember the robin of sherwood tv show from the 80s the show reimagined the robin hood legend and used mysticism and magic to add new nuances to it well watching the northman you get a similar feeling basically this is a violent tale of revenge yet we are presented with witches visions and often mcu levels of action sequences that blend perfectly the balance between some truly violent imagery and the more fantastical lifts the screenplay away from your basic historical adventure into a more complex narrative exciting and sprawling the northman is almost a throwback to an earlier time of moviemaking with a story of redemption presented in a fascinating and spellbinding way impossible to turn away from this movie has style and substance and is probably in my top ten films of the year so far its one problem is perhaps its run time which could have possibly been trimmed down just slightly to tighten up the final act but apart from that this is a triumph of actionadventure filmmaking that you should check out if you like this type of thing louie fecou joined the ready steady cut writing team back in august 2018 as an entertainment writer and since then has published over 1000 articles for the site louie has proven experience in various publications print and online to kickstart his journalism career in 2013 he was a columnist and writer for the irvine herald newspaper
Apr 30 2022,positive, robert eggers again reminds us that he hasnt adopted filmmaking as merely a vocation but a platform to tell stories that havent been told  or in the least told like this with his 10th century icelandic actioner the northman in what can only be described as a brutal testosteronefueled profusion of game of thrones 300 and kill bill eggers the lighthouse and cowriter sjorn serve up a ye old tale of nipple sweat and literal headbashing that follows a young vikings alexander skarsgard looking ever the spokesperson for golds gym pursuit of the hardhearted killer claes bang that took the breath from his father ethan hawke and stole his momma nicole kidman when prince amleth catches up with the treacherous uncle the bad dude has lost his throne and is now ruling a smaller village the determined terminator plays the part of a slave as long as he can  before the shadow of the moon a witch and his fondness for fellow hand olga anya taylorjoy suggest the time is ripe to make his move one time hbo pinup alexander skarsgard true blood and his workout regime rule the roost here but nicole kidman is equally impressive the likes of which she hadnt been in quite a while in my opinion as the title characters complex momma hawke and willem dafoe in extended cameos also add to the tasty meat at the core of this beasts bones much of the praise though belongs to the production team  skilled imaginative visionary eggers the stupendous production design of and cinematographer who skillfully and flaringly capture the beauty and blood of a nightmarish past it wont be for all particularly those with a weak stomach but it deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as it can another fine notch in the 2022 movies belt
Apr 30 2022,positive, you may have never heard of the scandinavian legend of amleth but youre likely familiar with his story regardless after all the medieval saga of a prince out for revenge against the uncle who murdered his father and stole his throne was the direct inspiration for one of shakespeares most famous tragedies right down to the anagram used for the heros name needless to say its a tale most of us have seen told before on stage and screenbut perhaps not quite like this the third feature film directed by robert eggers following the witch and the lighthouse the northman violently embraces all of the hallucinatory magic and rampant bloodshed of scandinavian lore in bringing amleths story to the screen cowritten with icelandic writer and lyricist sjón  a frequent collaborator of björk who introduced him to eggers and makes her longawaited return to the screen here  the northman isnt exactly telling an original story but it is an enjoyable one especially if youre already a fan of eggers incredibly immersive cinematic styledeath before dishonorthe film opens with the longawaited return of king aurvandill warraven ethan hawke to his kingdom on the northern atlantic island of hrafnsey here he is reunited with his queen gudrún nicole kidman and his young son and heir amleth played as a child by oscar novakafter spending the entire night undergoing a superfreaky spiritual ritual led by the jester heimir willem dafoe the king and his son emerge into the bright light of day only to be ambushed by the kings bastard brother fjölnir claes bang fjölnir and his men kill aurvandill and raid his kingdom murdering innocent villagers and making off with gudrún as a prize but amleth manages to escape rowing himself to safety across the stormy sea and fiercely declaring through his grief i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnirsource focus featuresyears later amleth is a viking warrior now played by alexander skarsgård who seems more animal than man howling with bloodlust under a wolfskin as he raids a village in the faraway land of rus however a chance encounter with a seeress björk doing incredible björk things that only björk can do reminds amleth of his sworn quest for revengeturns out fjölnir has lost the throne for which he committed the sin of fratricide and is now living in exile in iceland with gudrún and his two sons so amleth smuggles himself aboard a ship of slaves bound for fjölnirs farm befriending a slavic witch named olga anya taylorjoy and settling the wheels of fate back in motion but the path to vengeance is full of bumps and twists and reminders that the stories one believes as a child do not always match up with the endings one encounters as an adultvisions and nightmaresfrom jarin blaschkes gorgeous location cinematography to craig lathrops incredibly detailed production design the northman transports the audience through time and space to a longlost land of sorcery and savagery every frame is splattered with mud and mead and blood and the battle scenes are awesome to behold however the films most thrilling imagery is also some of its most fantastical the vision of the tree of kings that traces amleths noble bloodline the valkyrie who amleth dreams will escort him to valhalla the undead king who amleth must fight for custody of the sword he is fated to wieldmore than any other upandcoming director working right now eggers  who began his creative career as a production designer  is capable of making the atmosphere of the movie theater around you so totally melt away that even the sounds of crying children and crunching popcorn cannot pull you back to your present reality before the end credits begin to roll it helps that eggers has surrounded himself with an established company of brilliant craftspeople both blaschke and lathrop worked on the witch and the lighthouse and deserve nearly as much credit as the director for rendering the wild weird worlds of these films so utterly immersive whether or not you want to be there is something else altogether but i personally have enjoyed each and every trip they have taken me onsource focus featuresthis willingness to go as far as humanly possible to make his films feel authentic to the period in which they take place extends to eggers screenwriting from the archaic dialogue in the witch much of which was pulled straight from historical accounts of witchcraft to the saltwatersoaked sailor slang of the lighthouse the characters in his films can often be difficult to understand the northman is not nearly as borderlineincomprehensible as those previous films but it does feature enough throaty growling and hoarse howling to give one sympathy pains in the throat  not to mention plenty of epic declarations about meeting ones enemies at the gates of hel natch some of it feels a bit silly but in a way that i personally quite enjoyed after all who wouldnt get all riled up to destroy ones enemies after hearing some of skarsgårds fullblooded monologuesspeaking of skarsgård who coproduced the northman and for whom starring in a viking saga has been a longtime goal he is excellent as amleth while much will be and has been made of his extreme physical transformation for this film one should not let his outrageous muscles distract you from what is a truly powerful performance okay the muscles can distract you a little bit the rest of the cast is also remarkable but that shouldnt be a surprise considering the names filling it out from kidman as the icy secretive gudrún to bang as the menacing fjölnir to dafoe as the wonderfully weird heimir the actors in the northman bring out all of the hidden complexities in characters that are otherwise archetypes cut and pasted from the legend of amleth and other ancient viking tales taylorjoy in particular is a delight to watch as the ethereal olga her unusual beauty and otherworldly presence add some important feminine energy to the story and ensure that youll find yourself missing her whenever she happens to not be on screen this is her second collaboration with eggers following the witch and needless to

Apr 29 2022,positive, vengeance is an easy desire to rationalize the injustice of suffering leaves a void that the heart naturally wants to fill the cost of delivering such retribution often plays second fiddle to the minds manifestation of the sweet delight seemingly offered by correcting an egregious wrong of course the world is not a binary of good vs evil not that vengeance has to care about such realities the northman follows a life of vengeance an adaptation of the legend of amleth a scandinavian figure more familiar to western audiences for inspiring shakespeares hamlet the narrative follows the prince alexander skarsgård with oscar vovak playing amleth as a young boy as he seeks to avenge the death of his father king aurvandill ethan hawke at the hands of his uncle fjölnir claes bang who also burned his village and abducted his mother queen gudrún nicole kidman prophecy shapes amleths quest believing himself to be put on the soil solely to take his uncles life amleth gives up a promising career as a viking berserker to stow away aboard a slave ship headed to iceland the seat of his uncles exile becoming enslaved himself in the process he meets olga anya taylorjoy a sorceress and kindred spirit as amleth and olga grow closer the prince faces a fork in the road the cost of his quest for vengeance contrasted by the prospects of breaking the cycle to forge a new path free of the endless violence director robert eggers delivers a slowburn thats singularly focused in its stepbystep depiction of amleths submission to prophecy just as good and evil exist outside a binary the question of nature vs nurture is a bit irrelevant when faced with a reality where the two work in almostcomplete tandem violence may not be the only life that amleth could choose to live but it is the only life he knows how to live eggers every motion hammers that point home the cast all seem to understand their place less as characters but as part of the legend eggers seems to understand the weight of epic the performances and cinematography carrying a soft touch even amidst the narratives extreme brutality skarsgård never once puffs his chest to assert his place as the hero in complete alignment with amleths sense of prophecy bestowed upon him at an early age his approach to character development feels almost more like character actualization than any real sense of growth not all boys change as they grow into men the supporting cast also including willem dafoe and björk in bit roles have quite a lot of fun with the material the 137minute runtime is a bit overbloated but eggers never loses his grip on his audience through the cerebral narrative largerthanlife material is rarely delivered with such serene execution epics are not necessarily meant to feel intimate yet the northman carries itself like performers in a black box theatre welcoming even against a backdrop of endless miles of nothingness the northman demonstrates eggers immense maturity as a filmmaker a testament to cinemas power to communicate rich art to a wide audience in a world full of crowdpleaser films fighting for their share of the box office the film instead aims to leave its viewers with a calmer sense of satisfaction by the time the credits roll it feels good to be challenged in the theatre to see an epic wrestle with morals humanity has been grappling with for hundreds of years five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up 
Apr 29 2022,positive,the storyline was simple yet effective the landscape the production values  i was all in
Apr 29 2022,positive,overall despite the lavish treatment the film is surprisingly dreary
Apr 29 2022,positive, ill be honest it didnt take much to sell me on the northman the stunning look of it the particular period setting the epic scale its gritty edge  all of those things are right up my alley and then theres the films director robert eggers i loved his 2015 debut feature the witch and while i was pretty lukewarm on his 2019 followup the lighthouse it was still an audacious bit of maverick filmmaking both of those movies bear many of the same marks of their creator theyre both rooted in eggers interests in folk horror and legend both show off a near obsessive level of period detail both are clearly made by someone fully embracing their creative freedoms and both feel completely original and unlike anything else that may fall close to their genres the northman is what you get when those very distinct creative signatures are used to tell a bigger story with a bigger cast and with a much bigger studio budget in this case nearly 90 million penned by eggers and icelandic screenwriter poet and novelist sjon the northman is a brutal and at times bonkers viking revenge epic based on the same scandinavian legend that inspired shakespeares hamlet set in the north atlantic at the turn of the 10th century eggers sits us down in a brawny and violent world caked in mud and stained with blood its a world where human savagery is more commonplace than anything resembling compassion and where the supernatural and occult coexist allowing the director to veer down some dark and twisted paths more specifically based on the legend of amleth the northman opens up with a tablesetting prologue that sets this revengesoaked tale in motion in it 10yearold prince amleth played by oscar novak enthusiastically greets his father king aurvandil warraven ethan hawke who is returning home from battle wounded and weary aurvandil decides its time to begin preparing his son to take his throne with the help of the wildeyed shaman heimir willem dafoe aurvandil leads his son through a gonzo ritualistic rite of passage involving blood oaths trippy visions and flatulence its the first of several scenes sure to test mainstream audiences the next morning after a night of unconventional bonding the course of amleths life is changed after he witnesses his uncle fjolnir claes bang butcher his father and kidnap his now widowed mother queen gudrun nicole kidman with fjolnirs bloodcurdling command bring me the boys head still echoing through the thick air amlith flees by boat repeating to himself a mantra that will burn into his soul and fuel his hate for the rest of the film i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir the screen fades to black and many years pass when the image returns we see a much older amleth played by a hulking alexander skarsgard now a member of a barbaric viking clan who ravage the land of the rus like a pack of ravenous wolves here we get one of the films more spectacular moments  an incredible single uninterrupted take of the berserkers raiding pillaging and slaughtering a slavic village the intensely difficult and complex sequence sees eggers and his goto dp jarin blaschke weaving their camera through the chaos and carnage sucking us into the sheer savagery of the scene its gruesome and unflinching its also incredible filmmaking upon getting word that fjolnir has now settled in iceland with gudrun as his captive wife amleth stows away on a boat posing as a slave there he meets a fellow captive who introduces herself as olga of the birch forest anya taylorjoy she claims to be a sorceress and the two form an immediate bond your strength breaks mens bones she utters hinting at an inevitable partnership i have the cunning to break their minds the two arrive at fjolnirs settlement and are immediately put to work but rather than killing fjolnir and his men like a rabid beast amleth begins a methodical campaign of physical and psychological terror brutally picking off his prey onebyone in the dark of night and sending waves of fear throughout the commune while eggers is clearly the architect and his fingerprints are everywhere the movie succeeds thanks to a fine collective effort blaschkes camera not only captures the ferocity of the action but also the beautiful yet harsh textures of the icelandic landscape theres also the amazing period richness of craig lathrops production design and linda muirs costumes add to it the pulsepounding propulsion of robin carolan and sebastian gainsboroughs score of course you also have the cast ably led by skarsgard hes an imposing mix of cold primal rage and quiet intensity and though aptly and somewhat comically described as a beast cloaked in manflesh skarsgard also reveals amleths pain and vulnerability kidman is a blast hawke is as wily as ever and bang is pure villain material amid the showers of blood the grimecovered abs and hallucinatory mindtrips lies a fairly basic story sure it features a screaming valkyrja ineta sliuzaite a creepy soothsaying seeress bjork and crows working at the behest of odin himself yet the story remains simple its the creative juices of robert eggers that gives the northman its unique identity from the impeccable detail and design to the wild flourishes and overindulgences now where will such a movie land with audiences thats the 90 million question material from the associated

Apr 28 2022,negative, you would be forgiven for expecting more from the northman if youre a fan of writerdirector robert eggers you might expect something weirder along the lines of his previous triumphs in the horrorsuspense genre if you bought a ticket based on the trailers alone knowing nothing of the celebrated auteur behind the film you might expect something more straightforward the gritty actionadventure extravaganza promised by shots of alexander skarsgård catching spears midair what youll get is neither the bold weirdness of eggerss previous efforts in the criticallyacclaimed margins nor a clean strike into the blockbuster mainstream instead the northman wavers hesitantly within subversion before ultimately embracing its subject the classical heros journey more specifically the northman purports to represent a quintessential narrative of masculinity in which homosocial codes of war and honor clash with the emotional bonds of love and family as an eggers fan myself i expected him to twist this familiar narrative somehow to upend and trouble it or at least pervert it a little but i am left scratching my head at this intensely literal take on traditional western masculinity which nonetheless joins a host of other recent neomedievalist and folk horror films in expressing a particular kind of anthropocene angst by ambivalently upholding a premodern preindustrial existence the northman begins with a feint at subverting the ultramasculine archetype of the viking in one of the first scenes we witness young protagonist prince amleth skarsgård initiated by his father into warriormanhood only to find that the proof of worthiness is how well one can belch or fart on command but no amount of willem dafoes admittedly delightful crazyeyed vamping troubles the classic story that unfolds from there just like his literary descendent hamlet amleth trains himself to avenge his murdered father loses himself to hatred is forced to selfexamine then achieves his vengeance as a wiser man his being sidetracked by love of a beautiful woman anya taylorjoy is merely another expected trope there is an attempt to complicate the narrative when in the films best scene amleths mother nicole kidman reveals that his revered father was actually a brute and that she was his slave before she was his queen but we nevertheless end up with amleth completing his journey in melodramatic mantoman combat the dead amleth is carried to valhalla by a valkyrie his purpose fulfilled the fact that both men are nude in this final fight is not a strippingaway of their vainglory but a celebration of their impossiblychiseled bloodandmudsmeared physiques the thinking mans marvel superheroes skarsgårds trapezius muscles are so overbuilt he literally cannot stand up straight and instead hunches in an effect both menacing and a little ridiculous eggerss succumbing to viking nostalgia can be read as part and parcel of the recent surge of similarly nostalgic films that imagine a more epic more authentic past specifically a british and scandinavian one last years the green knight also depicts a medieval warrior this time an arthurian knight maturing through magical and emotional trials the last duel 2021 transposes contemporary discourse around sexual assault onto poignantly antiquated trialbycombat even nonhistorical films like the many folk horror revivals which seem to critique this kind of nostalgia also uphold it betraying a growing contemporary longing for a romanticized european past the spectacular midsommar 2019 written and directed by eggerss peer in elevated horror ari aster both condemns the violence of the neonorse cult at its center but also celebrates its healthier unflinching approach to grief and death compared to the suppressed americans it victimizes  yet where midsommar leaves us decidedly uncomfortable with our nostalgic longing twitter argues monthly over whether its ending is good or bad actually the northman offers only the shadow of such nuance if this trend reflects the more generalized desire of an alienated white american populace for reconnection with a spiritualcultural heritage what does the northman reveal it holds up a white prince dispossessed of his birthright building himself into a killing machine rebuked a little by the women around him who encourage him to love and cry but ultimately dying a badass warrior in a volcano amleth dies ostensibly to protect his unborn children proclaiming that he chooses both family and vengeancethe film literally trying to have it both ways eggers seems to be saying that contemporary white men can embrace the warrior ethos embodied in the viking while maintaining their postmodern emotional enlightenment but in the end just as amleth favors odin god of war and rejects the fertility god freyr whom he derides as the god of erections what the film truly glories in is battle and death not love and family  so where does that leave us the northman is not a bad film it has interesting visuals and offers a few surprises skarsgård gives an excellent performance making the best out of some truly wooden lines but i cant help but be disappointed that eggers took this politically and socially fraught figure the viking and played it so straight bros who fantasize about the viking good old days will find very little to challenge them in the northman and so ultimately the films avowed moral and what it actually delivers are at odds making this male power fantasy especially uneasy perhaps thats why the northman harps so much on the inescapability of fate the belief in destiny alleviates fear but it also disavows responsibility
Apr 28 2022,positive, i recently rewatched robert eggers debut film the witch and its legitimately impressive this guy gets to keep making the movies he wants to make a supernatural folk tale set in 1630s new england with periodaccurate dialogue didnt scream breakout hit but thanks to the directors firm vision and a lead performance by a young anya taylorjoy he was given a long leash for future projects he followed that up with the lighthouse another period film that explored loneliness and isolation with deeply committed performances from robert pattinson and willem dafoe it was a critical favorite but not exactly accessible to wide audiences fun fact from the press junket for eggers latest the northman taylorjoy revealed she volunteered to play a mermaid in the film eggers wisely told her she didnt want to play that mermaid but eggers is also commanding a bigger budget than hes ever had reportedly around 60 million so hes also made one of his more accessible movies one concession he made was having characters in his viking epic speak english instead of the original norse we meet the titular character as young prince amleth who witnesses the murder of his father ethan hawke at the hands of his uncle claes bang who then takes amleths mother nicole kidman as his bride young amleths memorable refrain from the trailer is a pretty good plot summary i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir skip ahead a couple of decades amleth alexander skarsgard has spent this time getting ripped and plotting his vengeance his path back to fjolnir has him joining forces with olga of the birch forest taylorjoy whos been taken as a slave and spoil of war eggers biggest movie to date the northman truly feels big big sets big battle sequences and big themes eggers shows hes ready for the jump to a bigger budget speaking of icelandic icons eggers cowrote the script with writer sjon icelandic poet novelist and lyricist who recently penned lamb as well as bjorks foray into the world of lars von trier dancer in the dark while primarily a character study for skarsgards amleth and his journey for vengeance the script goes big as well paying a reverent debt to nordic mythology with a plot thats complex but mostly clearly defined eggers continues to showcase a mastery for exploring this kind of folklore in another authentic period piece id be curious to see what his style would be like on a more modern story but the northman nevertheless marks him as a director with an exceptional vision
Apr 28 2022,positive,the northman is a sweeping epic driven by blood and brutality offering up a bleak and unrelenting take on the legend that inspired it it might be great  hell it almost certainly is great  but sadly it left me behind
