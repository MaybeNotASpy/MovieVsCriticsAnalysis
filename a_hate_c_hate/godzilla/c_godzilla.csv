"Oct 31, 2023",positive," If you approach life with the general philosophy that any Godzilla movie is a good Godzilla movie, there’s only one film to really challenge such an assumption: 1998’s Godzilla, TriStar’s much-maligned, Hollywood-financed foray into the classic kaiju‘s mythology. The film was director Roland Emmerich’s follow-up to his seminal 1990s disaster-piece Independence Day and arrived at the end of a very long, very arduous development process by many creative teams who mostly agreed on one thing: The Japanese version of Godzilla simply wouldn’t appeal to American audiences, and by changing everything about the character, they’d arrive at something better. In the 25 years since — which include a new trilogy of Hollywood movies featuring a more lore-accurate Godzilla and another half-dozen Toho-produced adventures — it’s pretty clear their instincts were entirely wrong. Most fans still rag on this project as the nadir for the character on the silver screen. The new American films continue to grapple with the legacy of the choices made by Emmerich and company. Zilla, as the monster featured in this Godzilla has come to be called in Toho licensing, has gone on to feature in a reasonably successful cartoon in which his invulnerability, atomic breath and innate heroism were restored. Otherwise, Zilla only ever appears in comics and films as a submissive foe for classic versions of Godzilla to trample over for fan service. Culturally, its failure is total. When I revisited the film a few years ago during the development of my original Are You There, Godzilla? It’s Me, Evan series of essays, I ranked it at the bottom of the entire series of three-dozen features. Revisiting it this year, I actually ended up moving it up a few spots — toward the middle of the bottom, above such languid turds as Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla, Godzilla vs. Megaguirus and the entire trilogy of animated bores released by Netflix in the last few years. Say what you will — and there’s a lot to say — but Emmerich’s amoral instinct for large-scale destruction means that however dumb his take on Godzilla gets, it’s at least never boring. The film opens with what has now become the quintessential opening to all American takes on the character — opening credits overlaying flashes of H-bomb footage and secret documents, implying an untold consequence of the late 20th-century atomic age and nuclear testing. There’s even a proto-Monarch of sorts (the clandestine paramilitary organization in newer films that allow humans a reason to interact with kaiju), although in this film, it’s just the French Secret Service. After the opening, we’re introduced to the helping heap of human characters who see their lives torn apart by the arrival of Godzilla. Matthew Broderick stars as Dr. Niko “Nick” Tatopoulos, a nuclear biologist and expert in irradiated animal habitats. His knowledge makes him indispensable to the American and French forces alike. Maria Pitillo stars as his ex-girlfriend, Audrey, an aspiring reporter in New York City whose connection to Nick gives her access to scoops. Their narratives weave together throughout Godzilla’s rampage, and they each bring with them their own supporting casts, including turns by Kevin Dunn as a colonel, Harry Shearer as a cameraman, and Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert, an overt parody of film critic Roger Ebert, with whom Emmerich had beef at the time. It’s a fun cast that nobody would ever call “stacked,” but they’re adequate to keep the story moving. For the first hour or so, it does: Godzilla approaches and eventually attacks New York City, weaving in and out of the building’s concrete canyons in a way not really depicted in the franchises’ other films. This Godzilla moves like a large, irradiated iguana, built for speed rather than destructive might. He lacks fire breath or invulnerability. Most problematically, he lacks personality as well. That isn’t a problem when it’s just Emmerich doing his destructive dances but really hampers everything that happens in the back half. Traditionally, Godzilla appeared as an allegory for the nuclear destruction wrought on Japan at the end of the second World War. The original 1954 film ended with Dr Serizawa developing an even stronger weapon to kill Godzilla and dying to prevent it from being used in war by anyone. Subsequent appearances diluted the metaphor but successfully transitioned the famous monster into a variety of roles — villain, hero, anti-hero or even a symbol of entirely different thematic concerns. As of 1998, Toho Studios’ version of the character had died “permanently” in 1995’s Godzilla vs. Destoroyah in an anti-nuclear weapons story that nearly turns Tokyo into Chernobyl due to mankind’s thoughtlessness. Even in his most shallow classic incarnations, the King of Monsters serves a role in the story, both abstract and physical. The problem with Emmerich’s Godzilla is that once the first attack concludes, he and Dean Devlin, his creative partner at the time, never crack what the rest of the story is actually supposed to be about, resulting in a flailing action movie that starts repeating itself while introducing new, unwanted and contradictory elements. The 23-minute sequence under Madison Square Garden featuring miniature Godzillas is the most difficult to square with the film’s insistence that audiences sympathize with Godzilla as a simple trapped animal; if it’s truly going to continue reproducing, there’s no choice but to exterminate it, sad as that might be. There’s no reckoning with mankind’s responsibility for the mess they’re in, either. It becomes a lot of whiz-bang special effects fun without anything grounding it (Not to mention the fact that the entire sequence is just a riff on the actually scary velociraptor content in Jurassic Park just a few years earlier.) Fans have always complained that Godzilla isn’t a “real” Godzilla movie because the character is so different than the traditional approach. That’s a pretty fair complaint, and I pretty much agree. That said, Emmerich is good at what he does, and the first half is a really entertaining film that hits most of the necessary first-act beats for a kaiju movie. I love the insistence that New York is trapped in an endless rainstorm, a nice atmospheric touch that I’m sure did double duty as a way to save on visual effects if they could just render their version of Big G in a hazy, half-lit environment. The Mayor Ebert stuff is shameless and silly. I don’t actually dislike Broderick as Dr. Nick, either. He brings an everyman feel to the role that feels in keeping with traditional Godzilla storytelling. In fact, the bare bones of the human relationships are pretty square with classic Showa-era archetypes: the scientist, the military, the journalist. All roles are needed to provide plot-propelling perspectives in a genre story. I don’t mind them at all here. It’s simply that the film loses any steam halfway through and never recovers. I’ve seen some critics hypothesize that the lack of an American trauma meant filmmakers had nothing to pull from for their version of Godzilla; I think that’s a fair take, although it’s not like 2014’s Godzilla nailed its allegory, either. Had the 1998 version arrived three years later, I’m sure Emmerich would’ve mined the events of 9/11 for some fertile storytelling. But then again, we got plenty of that from Michael Bay’s Transformers films, which are as close as we’ve ever gotten to a truly spectacular post-9/11 kaiju picture (I guess Cloverfield counts, too, but it’s not nearly angry enough to be the best of them, at least to me.) Can you imagine how magnificently stupid a Michael Bay-directed Godzilla film, would have been? Maybe released in 2008 or so? Can you? Oh god, I need to stop talking. I’m getting flustered. Look: As someone who subscribes to the notion that there are no bad Godzilla films (OK, besides those anime movies), I still find the best bits of Godzilla to be good enough to make the entire thing worth sitting through every few years. I actually like Zilla’s design, too, and I’m always happy to see him show up. Maybe I’m tasteless, but the truth is: I just really love Godzilla, whatever form he takes. 1998’s Godzilla was released on 4K UHD for the first time a few years ago. This is the same release with the same special features. The only difference is a very spiffy new steelbook, with very gorgeous artwork. It’s not a bad addition to any steelbook collection and a nice way to have the 1998 film stand out in any collection if you haven’t already purchased the film in this format. The high-resolution master looks great (although it does call into stark relief the age of the monster CGI in many sequences), and the aforementioned environmental and weather choices look gorgeous with the proper system. This is fundamentally a disaster movie. Watch it the best way you can. Special features include the original teaser trailers (great for 1990s nostalgists, I guess), as well as an audio commentary track with the visual effects supervisors, a compilation of Godzilla fight sequences, a music video for the Wallflowers’ unbearable cover of David Bowie’s “Heroes” and a behind-the-scenes documentary."
"Oct 28, 2023",negative," BLACK SABBATH (1963). If you’ve ever laid awake at night wondering how exactly the heavy metal band Black Sabbath came up with its name, ponder no more. Yet serving as inspiration for Ozzy and friends is the least of this classic’s merits. Despite making a handful of films in the interim, I tre volti della paura (its original Italian title, translated as The Three Faces of Fear) most confirmed the promise that writer-director Mario Bava demonstrated with his influential 1960 hit Black Sunday. First, the good news: Kino has reissued the film on Blu-ray. Now the addendum: It has reissued the American cut it released in 2015, not the original Italian version it offered in 2013. The actual edits are mostly minor, as the biggest change is that the — gasp! — lesbian subtext in the Italian cut has been completely removed for U.S. consumption. But this anthology film, with Boris Karloff serving as the cheerful host, is most effective in its original sequencing, which progresses in story terms from good to better to best — in the American version, it’s been rearranged from best to good to better. Solution: Program your player to follow the order below. “The Telephone” is a taut thriller, as the title device connects the beautiful Rosy (Michele Mercier), her jilted lover Mary (Lidia Alfonsi), and an escaped convict out for revenge. “The Wurdulak,” based on a piece by Tolstoy, rekindles that Black Sunday ambience in a period tale that stars Karloff himself as the patriarch of a family plagued by vampires. And “The Drop of Water,” adapted from a Chekhov story, features what might be the creepiest corpse in cinema history, as a nurse (Jacqueline Pierreux) makes the mistake of swiping a valuable ring from the body of a newly deceased clairvoyant. GODZILLA (1998). Forget the Emmy-winning TV special Liza With a Z — here we have the Razzie-winning theatrical stinker Godzilla With a Zzzz. Actually, the title is simply Godzilla, although a better moniker would have been Godzilla vs. Ferris Bueller since the oversized monster proves to be no match for Matthew Broderick’s incessant shtick. An overhyped, overproduced, overeverything chunk of synthetic entertainment, this American update of the beloved 1954 Japanese classic immediately makes it clear that it was made for dum-dums: An opening scene features a sign marked “Chernobyl,” and then writer-director Roland Emmerich and writer-producer Dean Devlin add a credit that reads, “Chernobyl, Ukraine,” lest stateside viewers confuse it with, I dunno, Chernobyl, South Carolina or something. At any rate, the majority of the action takes place in NYC, where the leapin’ lizard and a buncha baby ‘zillas (don’t ask) square off against such imposing figures as a nerdy scientist (Broderick), a French insurance agent (Jean Reno, on board to attract and appease the increasingly significant global audience), and Mayor Ebert (Michael Lerner), an overweight, candy-munching guy who’s always giving the “thumbs up” sign and whose balding assistant is named Gene (alas, the heavy-handed critical bashing did not extend to the inclusion of a religious wacko named Medved who gets flattened by Godzilla). This lumbering bore runs a tedious 138 minutes — in that same span, one could watch the infinitely superior 1969 animated short Bambi Meets Godzilla approximately 92 times and be all the better for it. Extras in the 4K + Blu-ray + Digital Code Steelbook edition include audio commentary by visual effects supervisors Volker Engel and Karen Goulekas; “All Time Best of Godzilla Fight Scenes”; and the music video for The Wallflowers’ “Heroes.” THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER (2023). It’s an interesting slant for a Dracula flick, akin to offering a behind-the-Hamlet-scenes peek with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, presenting the Norwegian POV with The Thing prequel (also called, somewhat daftly, The Thing), or retaining the perpetually dropped Arctic sequences for Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the obscure (but worth catching) mid-70s Swedish production Terror of Frankenstein. The Last Voyage of the Demeter takes one sliver (“The Captain’s Log”) from Bram Stoker’s Dracula  and spins an entire movie out of it. Set aboard the merchant ship Demeter, it charts the terrifying events that transpire as the ship journeys from Eastern Europe to London with its only cargo being big boxes of dirt. As the sailors disappear one by one, it’s up to the captain (Liam Cunningham) and a Cambridge-educated doctor (Corey Hawkins) to piece together the mystery. As with 2018’s Ophelia, the puzzle pieces don’t always fit together between the adaptation and the original source material — for instance, the film version includes an unexpected female passenger (Aisling Franciosi), a detail Stoker’s captain surely would have mentioned — but for the most part, this is a compelling terror tale that retains the flavor of Stoker but adopts the pattern of Alien (the tagline might as well have been “At sea, no one can hear you scream”). The vampire (played by Spanish genre actor Javier Botet) isn’t in the suave Lugosi/Lee vein (these puns, they write themselves!) but rather more like Max Schreck’s (and Klaus Kinski’s) grotesque Nosferatu, and superb effects work help bring the creature and its surroundings to vibrant life. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by director André Øvredal (Troll Hunter) and producer Bradley J. Fischer; a making-of featurette; deleted scenes; an alternate opening; and a piece on the visual effects. THE MIST (2007). The Mist marks writer-director Frank Darabont’s third adaptation of a Stephen King property, and, because he’s not shooting for Oscar gold this time around (the previous titles were the enjoyable but grotesquely overrated pair The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile), he’s able to ease up on the pedal of self-importance and deliver a “B”-style genre flick — albeit one offering some evaluations of human nature in between all the bloodletting. Owing a nod in the direction of John Carpenter’s nifty chiller The Fog, this concerns itself with a group of people who are gathered at the local supermarket when a mist envelops the entire area. It soon becomes clear that something evil resides in the fog, and the shoppers decide that they should remain indoors rather than venture out into the parking lot. It’s here that the story reveals its cynical roots, as a religious zealot named Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) converts many of the frightened survivors to her mode of thinking, a path that leads to a Jim Jones-like environment and at least one human sacrifice. Propelled by Harden’s scary performance, Mrs. Carmody is a genuine threat, and she validates the contention that times of crisis are as likely to turn people against each other as they are to unite them against a common enemy. The pessimism also extends to other areas of the script, most notably that powerhouse ending. The new 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital edition (there’s also a Steelbook edition available only at Best Buy) contains both the original color version as well as an alternate black-and-white version. Extras include audio commentary by Darabont and producer Denise Huth; a making-of featurette; a conversation between King and Darabont; deleted scenes; and pieces on the visual effects. NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988) / NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 2 (1994) / NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 3 (1997). I’ve always been amused by the part of the tagline for Night of the Demons that reads, “Angela is having a party, Jason and Freddy are too scared to come…” Of course, were this true, it would reveal messieurs Voorhees and Krueger to be complete cowards, as there’s not a frightening moment to be found in any of the pictures in this trilogy. That’s not meant as a knock, just as an acknowledgment of the sort of low-budget horror yarns we’re dealing with here. A perennial presence on video-store shelves back in the era, Night of the Demons finds Goth girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) opting to throw a Halloween party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home rumored to be filled with an unspeakable evil. The usual assortment of movie-stereotype clods assemble — the jock, the good girl, the tough greaser, the chubby guy, the sexpot (genre fave Linnea Quigley), etc. — but once a séance is held and Angela eventually gets possessed, all hell breaks loose. This is too silly to generate any semblance of unsettling atmosphere, but the monster makeup is effective, the cast is engaging (if sometimes amateurish), and there are a few (intentional) laughs thrown about. I first (and, until now, last) saw this on VHS back in the late ‘80s, and the only parts I could recall over the decades were the bookend scenes featuring that grumpy old man and his “How do you like them apples?” comeuppance. Night of the Demons made back its budget and then some, so I expect it was a handful of factors besides box office (including the passage of time) that found both of its sequels debuting on video rather than theatrically. In the case of Night of the Demons 2, that’s perhaps a shame, since it proves to be the best in the series. While still plagued by some of the issues that prevented its predecessor from soaring and scoring more highly, it does feature the best cast and the most interesting characters. The demonic Angela (Kinkade) returns to torture some more teens that dare visit Hull House on Halloween, but this time she meets a formidable opponent in Sister Gloria (Jennifer Rhodes), a no-nonsense nun who has no problem emulating Rambo by gunning down the opposition with Super Soakers filled with holy water. The series suffers a drastic drop with Night of the Demons 3, with a workable story diluted by clumsy pacing, dopey dialogue, and a tacky visual scheme. On the run from the law, several kids (some guilty, some innocent) hide out at Hull House, where Angela (Kinkade) is waiting to cause more pain and suffering. While this letdown was the last in the original series, a remake of the 1988 flick did appear in 2009 — starring American Pie’s Shannon Elizabeth as Angela and featuring a cameo appearance by Quigley, it was a massive bomb. All three films are sold separately as Collector’s Editions, with the original offered as a 4K UHD + Blu-ray package while the sequels are Blu-ray only. Extras on Night of the Demons include a trio of audio commentaries by director Kevin S. Tenney and select cast and crew members; the international cut of the film; the workprint version (titled The Halloween Party); a making-of documentary; interviews with writer-producer Joe Augustyn, Kinkade, and Quigley; and a six-minute version of the film that was shown to potential distributors. Extras on Night of the Demons 2 include audio commentary by director Brian Trenchard-Smith and director of photography David Lewis; audio commentary by select cast members; the workprint of the film; interviews with Trenchard-Smith and Kinkade; and dailies. Extras on Night of the Demons 3 include audio commentary by director Jimmy Kaufman; audio commentary by Tenney (serving as screenwriter for this picture) and special effects artist Roy Knyrim; the director’s cut (actually the workprint) of the film; interviews with Kaufman, Tenney, and Kinkade; and behind-the-scenes footage. PARAMOUNT SCARES VOLUME 1 (1968-2022). The first in what the studio hopes to be a series of 4K creature-feature sets, Paramount Scares offers five of its popular horror flicks covering a span of just over half a century. Adapted from the novel by hitmaker Ira Levin (The Stepford Wives, The Boys from Brazil), Rosemary’s Baby (1968) marked the first American film for Polish writer-director Roman Polanski, who had already scored internationally with the likes of Knife in the Water and Repulsion. This box office hit emerged as one of the best chillers of its decade, and it still serves as a touchstone of the modern horror film. Mia Farrow, in the finest performance of her often erratic career, and John Cassavetes star as Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, who move into a trendy NYC apartment where their new neighbors include a nosy but apparently well-meaning elderly couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer). Rosemary is elated when she becomes pregnant — even if she is confused about a particularly disturbing sex dream followed by scratches on her body the next morning — but she feels suffocated when it seems as if everyone is trying to take control of her life. Her paranoia magnifies as she comes to believe that the building residents are Satanists who are after her unborn child. A movie that builds momentum through its deliberate pacing, Rosemary’s Baby not only functions as a supernatural thriller but also predates many psychological works (including several by David Cronenberg) that tap into the universal fear of having your own body rebel against you. Polanski earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Gordon won for Best Supporting Actress. As a teenager in the early 1980s, I devoured Stephen King’s first dozen or so books (yes, including Danse Macabre) before other interests led me to bail on tackling his next offering, Pet Sematary. I never did get around to reading it, but while the plot specifics are reportedly almost identical, I have to imagine it doesn’t possess the same degree of daftness that permeates director Mary Lambert’s screen version, also named Pet Sematary (1989). Showcasing a script penned by King himself (it was the second time he adapted one of his own works, following 1985’s limp Silver Bullet), this casts Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby as Louis and Rachel Creed, two of the most irresponsible parents ever to stumble their way onto a movie screen. Their young daughter Ellie (Blaze Berdahl) and especially their toddler Gage (Mike Hughes) would be just as well off living on their own, a point made clear once tragedy strikes the family and the adjacent pet cemetery, a former Indian burial ground with supernatural powers, provides Dad with a way to make everything OK again (or so he thinks). The premise is fascinating, but Lambert’s leaden direction (suspense is nowhere to be found), weak performances from the leads, and the frequently campy interludes (is Brad Greenquist’s walking corpse supposed to be this ridiculous?) pretty much sink this one. Fred Gwynne, however, is excellent as Jud, the folksy neighbor whose well-meaning actions eventually lead to doom and gloom. Even as a huge Ramones fan, I gotta admit that the title song doesn’t represent the band at its best. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) is an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s 1979 Broadway smash, but it hides its stage roots so thoroughly that it often feels like a piece created exclusively for the screen. That’s hardly a surprise, given that, for a spell anyway, Tim Burton was one of our most visually adept filmmakers. In refashioning Sweeney Todd for cinema, he and scripter John Logan (creator of TV’s Penny Dreadful) crafted a big, bold musical that functions as an upscale slasher film: It’s bloody but also bloody good, with the gore tempered by the melancholy love stories that dominate the proceedings. Johnny Depp delivers a haunted performance as a barber who returns to London after 15 years in prison to exact his revenge on the judge (Alan Rickman) who ruined his life, while Helena Bonham Carter plays the lonely widow who aids him in his efforts. As partners-in-crime, they’re perfectly matched: He slits the throats of all who sit in his barber’s chair while she grinds up the corpses to use in her popular meat pies. Burton’s decision to stylize this film to within an inch of its life (his most theatrical flourish is to retain a Grand Guignol sense of the melodramatic) was sound, resulting in a visual feast that dazzles even through the setting’s necessary grime. Depp and Carter ably provide this rousing musical with the emotional heft necessary to prevent it from merely becoming an exercise in Gothic chic. Earning Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Costume Design, this won for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. Given all the cinematic bloat these days, a pared-down thriller would seem to be a blessing, offering nothing more and nothing less than appreciated, adrenaline-pumping chills. It worked several years ago when Blake Lively stood firm against a menacing shark in The Shallows, but the idea goes belly-up with Crawl (2019). In this one, alligators are the apex predators making life miserable for the humans, as college swimmer Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario) and her injured father Dave (Barry Pepper) are trapped in the flooded crawlspace of Dave’s Florida home while a category 5 hurricane rages all around them. Initially, there’s some tension as Haley and Dave are hopelessly pinned down by these critters, but because the script by brothers Michael and Shawn Rasmussen never offers much variation, and because director Alexandre Aja never provides a proper sense of the layout of the joint, all excitement soon dissipates. A few hapless humans wander into the frame to provide snacks for the gators, but stripped of personalities and, for the most part, even names, their ultimate fates mean little. Crawl is presumably meant to refer to the movements of both the alligators and the human protagonists, but it might as well refer to the forward momentum of the movie itself. Its solemnity results in tedium, and it’s best to turn to 1980’s Alligator instead. Embracing the more ludicrous aspects of the premise, that picture was energetic and entertaining. Crawl, on the other hand, is mostly torpid and toothless. If the sight of a person grinning like an idiot is enough to unnerve you, then you might well be the target audience for Smile (2022) — me, I’ll stick with Jack Nicholson’s Joker for my maniacal grimaces. A psychological horror yarn that tries to cover up its slender storyline and lack of genuine thrills with an overreliance on obvious jump scares, Smile is yet another of those chillers (see also Evil Dead Rise, Malignant, It Comes at Night, Don’t Breathe, etc.) that tend to get overrated simply because there aren’t enough quality horror yarns these days to keep the niche reviewers sated. Smile is by no means bad, and it initially maintains interest with its story of a supernatural entity that uses pain and trauma to jump from one person to the next. But a repetitiveness eventually sets in (especially with a running time of a full two hours), and the ending is pretty lousy. Good performances help, particularly Sosie Bacon (daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick) in the leading role. Even horror mavens who don’t love all five of the included titles might want to spring for this impressively packaged set, with its deep red exterior and inside goodies like a specially created issue of Fangoria looking at the quintet of movies, a Paramount Scares logo pin, and a sticker sheet. All five films are offered on 4K, Blu-ray, and Digital, with Sweeney Todd making its UHD debut. This set also brings over the numerous extras available on past releases, including a retrospective piece on Rosemary’s Baby; audio commentary by Lambert on Pet Sematary; footage from a 2007 press conference for Sweeney Todd; an alternate opening on Crawl; and deleted scenes on Smile. TALK TO ME (2023). From Robert Wiene’s The Hands of Orlac to Oliver Stone’s The Hand, from the Amicus portmanteau film Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors to the splatter sequel Evil Dead II, disembodied hands have long been a mainstay in horror cinema. It’s to the credit of writer-director Danny Philippou and co-director Michael Philippou that they’ve come up with a unique approach to the errant appendage, casting it as the portal through which the living can communicate with — and become briefly possessed by — the dead. When the teenage Mia (Sophie Wilde) elects to try it out in the company of her friends, she reestablishes a bond with her deceased mother (Alexandria Stefensen) that threatens not only her own relationship with her father (Marcus Johnson) but also those with her best friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and Jade’s younger brother Riley (Joe Bird). Considering the kids initially treat the supernatural shenanigans no differently than if they were playing a game of spin the bottle or Trivial Pursuit, it’s difficult to immediately plunge into the storyline. But once the Philippous pour on the atmosphere and flesh out the characters, the movie settles into its spooky groove, efficiently winding its way toward a Twilight Zone-worthy capper. The filmmakers deserve further credit for making their protagonist believably flawed and prone to making bad decisions — Wilde is excellent in the role, and she’s matched by Jensen and Bird. An Australian production, this was a stateside sleeper hit for A24, outgrossing all the studio’s previous pictures save Lady Bird, Uncut Gems, and champ Everything Everywhere All at Once (globally, it’s second only to EEAaO). TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD (1972). A production between neighboring countries Spain and Portugal, Tombs of the Blind Dead (original title La noche de terror ciego, which translates as The Night of the Blind Terror) was a key film in Spain’s robust horror cycle of the 1970s. Furthermore, its success led writer-director Amando de Ossorio to make three more movies in what became known as “The Blind Dead Series”: 1973’s Return of the Blind Dead, 1974’s The Ghost Galleon, and 1975’s Night of the Seagulls. This first picture finds several folks foolishly hanging out at a desolate graveyard, one which sees its inhabitants — a band of sadistic Knights Templar — rise from the dirt and search for fresh bodies to consume. Like the critters in A Quiet Place, their sightlessness (crows plucked out their eyes while they were hung out to die) means they must locate their prey by sound alone. Character actions don’t always make sense and the connective tissue (a love triangle of sorts) feels rushed, but the authentic location shooting and the ghoul designs are top-notch. This initially played the U.S. in a heavily re-edited version simply called The Blind Dead. Then, in a particularly bizarre — and hilarious — bit of programming, another distributor, eyeing the grosses of the Planet of the Apes series, decided to add a prologue explaining how the walking dead were once intelligent apes killed by humans and have now returned; this cut was released as Revenge From Planet Ape! The Blu-ray edition offers Tombs of the Blind Dead in its original Spanish as well as with an English/Spanish hybrid soundtrack; also on hand is the U.S. theatrical cut The Blind Dead as well as the alternate opening sequence for Revenge From Planet Ape. Other extras include three audio commentaries; a feature on the Spanish zombie flick; and a still gallery. THE TOXIC AVENGER COLLECTION (1984-2000). Or “TA IN 4K,” as it’s advertised directly on the box set itself. And why shouldn’t Toxie be given the home-video upgrade? After all, he’s the star of Troma Entertainment’s most successful film, so popular a character that it’s his unsightly mug that appears on the studio logo as its official mascot. Even three flop sequels haven’t diminished the appeal of “The First Super-Hero From New Jersey.” Created by Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufman and directed by Kaufman and fellow founder Michael Herz, The Toxic Avenger (1984) pretty much set the blueprint for all future movies from the indie studio: broad comedy, lots of gore, smatterings of T&A, and enough non-PC material to make even Howard Stern blush. The first film in the Toxie franchise is far and away the best, sporting a frenzied and freewheeling attitude that none of the follow-ups were able to recapture. Mark Torgl plays Melvin Ferd (alternately Melvin Junko in other films), a geeky weakling who works as the janitor at a health club in Tromaville, NJ. The homicidal jocks Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard) are particularly cruel to clumsy Melvin, and it’s their actions that cause him to fall into a vat of toxic waste, thus transforming him into a mutated hulk (Mitchell Cohen, not to be confused with former-Trump-flunky-turned-sworn-enemy Michael Cohen) whose natural instinct is to fight evil. The Toxic Avenger is so over-the-top in everything from its violence to its villains that it’s impossible to take seriously, and Andree Maranda scores as Sara, the blind woman who becomes Toxie’s girlfriend. The Toxic Avenger Part II (1989) and The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie (1989) were originally one long film before Kaufman elected to slice and release as two pictures, and this helps explain why the two works are of comparable crumminess. Everything is still in place — the blood, the guts, the gallows humor — but nothing quite works, and the end sensation is depression more than anything else. In Part II, Toxie (John Altamura until he was fired, then Ron Fazio) travels to Japan to locate the father who abandoned him — the trip is actually a ruse by the chemical company Apocalypse Inc., which seeks to take over Tromaville while its resident superhero is away. With Part III, the title takeoff on The Last Temptation of Christ is the most clever aspect of the movie. The picture itself is as forced in its immoral mirth as its immediate predecessor, with Toxie now the unlikely spokesman for Apocalypse Inc. until he comes to his senses and fights back. The blind sweetheart in these two pictures, now named Claire instead of Sara, is played by artist and musician Phoebe Legere, but she’s not nearly as effective as Maranda in the first film. After skipping the 1990s completely, the series returned with Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV (2000), a movie I find impossible to properly describe … or digest. The opening act, which mocks mentally challenged people and school shootings, is beyond offensive and beyond belief, and the gags couldn’t possibly be any cruder. It’s terrible … until it’s not: At some point, a specific brand of demented intelligence emerges, and it’s easier to go with the flow as this thing progresses. It’s set in a multiverse long before the MCU made the concept cool to the kids, as Toxie (now played by David Mattey) finds himself switching places with the Noxious Offender (also Mattey), the homicidal mutant who rules over Amortville. The blind girlfriend (Sara in one dimension, Claire in the other) is now played by Heidi Sjursen; the popular Troma character of Sgt. Kabukiman, N.Y.P.D. (Paul Kyrmse) appears in support; Stan Lee (billed in the credits as Peter Parker) serves as narrator; now-disgraced porn star Ron Jeremy appears as the Tromaville mayor; future Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn pops up as Dr. Flem Hocking (an obvious spoof of Stephen Hawking); and Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf is God. The titular take-off on Citizen Kane is reflected in arguably the most brilliant sequence, a “News on the March”-styled bit centering on this movie’s version of Xanadu (and “Rosebud”). Extras in the 4K + Blu-ray set include audio commentaries by Kaufman on all four films; audio commentaries by various cast and crew members on select films; introductions by Kaufman; cast interviews; and the 135-minute documentary Apocalypse Soon: The Making of Citizen Toxie. THE WICKER MAN (1973). One of the most intriguing of all cult films to emerge from the 1970s, The Wicker Man employs allegory and atmosphere to amplify its thin veneer of the supernatural — it registers as both a fantasy flick and a horror movie in our minds more than it does on the screen. Edward Woodward (best known stateside as TV’s The Equalizer) stars as Neil Howie, a humorless and devout Christian who in his capacity as a police sergeant is called to the Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12-year-old girl. He’s shocked to learn that, under the auspices of Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in what the actor considered his best film and his best role), the residents are all part of a pagan society, and their upcoming harvest celebration requires the sacrifice of a virgin. Offering what ultimately can be seen as an examination of competing faiths — and, tellingly, the bleeding of one into the other — director Robin Hardy and scripter Anthony Shaffer offer up a heady stew of ambiguity and interpretation, and the ending remains one of the most shocking in cinema. Incidentally, ignore Neil LaBute’s ridiculous 2006 remake starring Nicolas Cage, which shucks religion completely and instead fashions the tale as a battle between upstanding male dominance and wicked feminist doctrine. (Oh, but do check out “Best Scenes From The Wicker Man” on YouTube; it’s fantastic.) The Wicker Man has been reissued in a 50th Anniversary Steelbook edition that offers 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code, but note that it holds only the 94-minute Final Cut and not the 88-minute original U.K. theatrical version nor the 100-minute Director’s Cut. Extras include a 1979 interview with Hardy and Lee; a 2013 interview with Hardy; an archival interview with Ekland; and a piece on the music. THE DEVIL-DOLL (1936). Another winner from Dracula and Freaks director Tod Browning, this enjoyable outing allows Lionel Barrymore the opportunity to go the Tootsie route. He plays Paul Lavond, a Devil’s Island escapee who plots revenge against the three men who framed him for embezzlement and murder. Disguised as a sweet old lady who runs a toy shop, he benefits from the discovery of his fellow fugitive (Henry B. Walthall), a scientist who has figured out a way to shrink human beings down to the size of dolls. Engaging special effects and another robust performance from Barrymore (five years after his Oscar-winning turn in A Free Soul) contribute to the fun. Blu-ray extras consist of film historian audio commentary; the 1936 cartoons Milk and Money (starring Porky Pig) and The Phantom Ship; and the theatrical trailer. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1943). Universal’s 1925 silent adaptation of Gaston Leroux’s celebrated novel, an enormous hit starring Lon Chaney Sr., was ripe for a sound remake, and Universal pulled out all the stops for this lavish production. As the dull hero and put-upon heroine, Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster command the top two spots in the credits, but of course it’s third-billed Claude Rains’ character who dominates this story — in stature if not actual screen time. Numerous actors have played the part of the disfigured madman who haunts the Paris Opera House, and while Chaney remains the best (and most frightening), Rains lands in the place position for his more sympathetic handling of the role. Nominated for four Academy Awards, this won two: Best Color Cinematography and Best Color Art Direction. For our Hallowe’en viewing, one movie’s worth, my pick was perhaps a bit of an odd one: Lewton/Robson’s The Seventh Victim. Daria loved it, so yay! Excellent choice! That’s probably the most underrated of all those fine Val Lewton chillers — coincidentally, I revisited it myself about eight months ago and enjoyed it as much as ever."
"Oct 23, 2023",positive," Godzilla first appeared in film almost seven decades ago and since then has been in approximately forty feature films with more on the way.  Named the longest continuously-running film franchise by the Guinness Book of World Records, the large lizard-like monster has been terrorizing cities all over the world since 1954. In 1998, writer/director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) brought his own version to the big screen and, while originally planned as a trilogy, it ended up being a one-off film after disappointing reviews from fans and critics.  As the movie celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is releasing a limited edition, 4K Steelbook this week. Following French atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific, an unknown creature is spotted passing through the Panama Canal. Scientist Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick; Ferris Bueller's Day Off) is called in to investigate the matter, and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant, irradiated lizard has been created by the explosions. Godzilla then makes its way north, landing in Manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city.  Niko, along with his college sweetheart, Audrey (Maria Pitillo; True Romance), cameraman Victor (Hank Azaria; The Simpson), and French Secret Service agent, Philip (Jean Reno; Léon: The Professional) must determine exactly what is going on and how to stop the monster before it is too late. One of the complaints about Emmerich's version of Godzilla was that it wasn't very serious, instead taking on a somewhat more tongue-in-cheek slant to the subject matter. Of course, that would explain Broderick's casting in the lead role as he is well known for his comedic acting talent. He does a very good job with the material he is given while remaining true to his strengths.  Reno offers a good performance while showing a little of his comedic side and Azaria rounds out the male trio, again using the comedic timing he is known for.  Pitillo's performance, along with a number of the other supporting cast, leaves a lot to be desired. Even though Godzilla was released in 4K four years ago, this latest update is the best version, technically, so far.  With Dolby Vision video quality the picture is clean and detailed, even during the darker scenes taking place at night. The color palette offers a variety of hues and shading giving the film additional depth.  Unfortunately, the downside of the upgrade is that the effects stand out - not in a good way - and many of the green-screened scenes are much more obvious than in past versions. The special effects and less serious overall tone made this Godzilla less beloved than previous and since-released versions but if taken with a grain of salt, and recognizing that this one was meant to be a little lighter fare,  it can be entertaining, if you open your self up to it.  I do understand the complaints regarding the ""look"" of the giant creature, but if the viewer can get past that, there are definitely some laughs to be had.  The Steel Book is beautifully done and, as this version is the cleanest visually and aurally to date, it is worth purchasing.

"Feb 15, 2023",negative,"  What the new, monstrously budgeted Godzilla brings home is that size doesn’t matter–that tacky crudeness harnessed to a real vision can have more brute power than all the state-of-the-art computer wizardry that Hollywood’s money can buy. This time, the title titan is a devil-visaged lizard who convincingly wrecks Manhattan; lays a load of eggs that hatch velociraptor-like little (i.e., 9-foot) dinosaurs; and gets nailed on his way to Brooklyn by a coalition of scientists, the military, and the French secret service (don’t ask). The movie, directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, the Teutonic schlockmeister who awed (or stupefied) the world with Independence Day (1996), isn’t entirely lame. The way the beast is finally snared has a certain architectural piquancy. And sequences of the great lizard winding among skyscrapers as if they’re hedges in a lawn maze–his tail sheering off floors as it whips around corners–have been engineered with bravura. Otherwise, size really is about all that this tedious, underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it. Its brain remains disproportionately teensy.  It’s no big news that in the Japanese Godzilla (or Gojira), the creature (played by a guy in a rubber suit stomping around a miniature Tokyo) was a metaphor for the A-bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even in the American edit, with Raymond Burr tacked on as a portentous reporter, the aura of mourning was palpable. Godzilla is the only cheesy disaster flick that feels as if it was made by people who’d actually lived through some kind of horrific devastation. And even after countless sequels of escalating silliness–in which the monster became Japan’s savior, battling other mutant reptiles and space aliens and rescuing Japanese boys who’d call out (in laughably dubbed English): “Thanks, Godzilla! Come back soon!”–Godzilla retained a nuclear-haunted nobility. I’m not just endorsing retro-chic when I say that the guy in the rubber suit is more fun. For my money, he’s also scarier. I don’t want an anatomically correct Godzilla. The original Godzilla is a dragon, a mythical destroyer who’s close in spirit to the Jewish legend of the Golem–the colossal, indestructible clay man summoned up out of all the dark forces of this world who can’t be destroyed by any of this world’s weapons. The Godzilla who lumbers through a metropolis on two legs, erect, slowly crushing cars and knocking over buildings, robotically training his radioactive breath on anything and everything he sees, is a mythical vision of Armageddon. The new, down-to-earth Godzilla is much closer to the tyrannosaurus of Jurassic Park and to American giant-monster pictures such as The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. He’s almost never erect–he stoops to incinerate. He’s supposed to be smart. He can out-swim torpedoes and dodge heat-seeking missiles (which take out the Chrysler Building, among other man-made wonders). And just when people say, “Whew! I think I lost him!” he pops out from some cunning hiding place and gobbles them down. So why does he still strike me as a less than formidable opponent? Well, any forefather (and, given his reproductive capacities, foremother) of a new species that chooses to travel halfway around the globe to lay his eggs in the middle of Manhattan doesn’t seem built to survive, evolutionarily speaking. Emmerich cribs his basic suspense techniques (the low-angle camera riding in on open-mouthed spectators) from Spielberg’s Jaws and Jurassic Park, his egg imagery from Alien, his marauding baby dinosaurs from Gremlins, and a scene of the U.S. Army striding through some South Seas devastation from Apocalypse Now. What’s uniquely his own is the way the havoc periodically grinds to a halt to make room for “relationship” scenes, in which the characters maintain a soap-opera obliviousness to everything (crumbling skyscrapers, fire-breathing beasts) but their feelings.  Oh yes, there are human characters, sort of. Matthew Broderick, that charmingly worried wise guy, plays an expert in radioactive genetic mutations. He stays heroically credible even as the film grows insanely incredible, as when he has to pretend to outrun the rampaging 30-story Godzilla for half the length of Manhattan island in a tiny yellow cab. The other performances are as crude as the writing, although Hank Azaria brings terrific bonhomie to the part of a daredevil TV cameraman, and the brilliant Harry Shearer doesn’t entirely disgrace himself as a pompous anchorman. As a member of Broderick’s team, the spiky, forward redhead Vicki Lewis could have walked off with the picture if she hadn’t been brushed aside in favor of a dumb blond aspiring TV reporter, played by Maria Pitillo–a sitcom actress who can’t utter a line without the left side of her mouth curling up in Valley Girl incredulity or down in Valley Girl petulance. Contrary to what you might have read (or awaited hopefully), Mayor Ebert and his contentious aide, Siskel, do not get squashed. Which brings me to another well-known critic: Aristotle, who, at the dawn of Western drama, deemed spectacle the medium’s least important component. It’s true that cinema is a less cerebral form, and that much of what Aristotle considered a thrilling night out would make us commit suicide out of boredom. But if, as a filmmaker, you’re going to make spectacle the top priority, you’d better show us stuff we’ve never seen before. You’d better keep those miracles coming, or we’re apt to grow nostalgic rather quickly for the days of spaceships on wires and monsters in rubber suits."

In addition to Steven King and Jordan Peele, we talk with Oscar-winning actor Anthony Hopkins about how he humanized Hannibal Lecter, the oh-so-sophisticated cannibal of The Silence of the Lambs. And Carrie star Sissy Spacek remembers sneaking into the theaters in New York City to watch audiences jump at the sight of her hand stretching up from the grave at the end of that film. Plus, we hear from actor Mercedes McCambridge, who voiced the devil in The Exorcist; George Romero, who directed Night of the Living Dead; and Kathy Bates, who starred in the 1990 film Misery. King talks about what terrified him as a child — and what frightens him as an adult. Peele talks about the fears that inspire his filmmaking. Originally broadcast in 1992, 2013 and 2017. Whether you go to see it now or wait until it begins streaming, A Quiet Place Part II is likely to make you a little jumpy. It doesn't have the same claustrophobic intensity as its predecessor, but it's just as taut, suspenseful and beautifully made. Alexandra Auder's mother, Viva, was one of Andy Warhol's muses.  Growing up in Warhol's orbit meant Auder's childhood was an unusual one.  For several years, Viva, Auder and Auder's younger half-sister, Gaby Hoffmann, lived in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.  It was was famous for having been home to Leonard Cohen, Dylan Thomas, Virgil Thomson, and Bob Dylan, among others. In the series Jury Duty, a solar contractor named Ronald Gladden has agreed to participate in what he believes is a documentary about the experience of being a juror--but what Ronald doesn't know is that the whole thing is fake.

"Feb 15, 2023",negative,This newest look at the radiation-created creature who once razed Tokyo continues to advance the art of digital-efx to a jaw-dropping degree. Yet it offers little else. 
"Feb 15, 2023",negative," ""Size does matter,"" say the makers of Godzilla, but somebody should have told them that it's dangerous to boast, and that personality also counts. It would be fun to report that Godzilla is a 400-foot-tall turkey in lizard's clothing, but the truth is that it's just rather dull. The writing-producing-directing team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have made a successful career out of plundering the B-movie archive for ideas which could be spiced up with a little 1990s technology. It worked for them with the enjoyably trashy sci-fi fantasy Stargate and it certainly hit paydirt with Independence Day. With their talent for reinventing and reinvigorating hoary old genres, the pair must have seemed the ideal choice to tackle this particular re-make, but, whether through hubris or a simple lack of imagination, the formula fails to fizz this time. The ""echoes"" of other movies (Frankenstein, King Kong, Jaws and Aliens spring immediately and forcefully to mind) are all there, but they just serve to remind you that the originals were rather better, and the creature itself seems uncomfortably closely related to the inhabitants of Jurassic Park. Another problem is the film's colour palette; the breezy bright colours of Independence Day are replaced by brooding dark colours and deep shadows. Most of the action takes place at night, and the daytime scenes are filmed under lowering clouds and torrential rain in a look akin to that of Rain City in Seven - an interesting technical challenge, perhaps (although one suspects it might have something to do with covering up the shortcomings of the digital effects), but hardly what one expects from a summer blockbuster. Even worse, the plotting seems designed to make sure we'll never get too excited. The opening is fine, with plenty of ominous foreboding as the mysterious creature is sighted making its way up the Eastern seaboard of the United States. With the nuclear theme of the original updated to the 1990s, the French shoulder most of the blame for Godzilla's mutation, caused by their nuclear tests in the Pacific. Tension is effectively built as the creature heads for its unknown destination (at least, it's unknown if you haven't seen one of the zillion trailers and teaser ads). But once Godzilla gets to New York, things fall apart very quickly. Manhattan is evacuated while the creature hides out in the city's subways, avoiding all military attempts to flush him out, and we're forced against our will to follow some rather dreary human interest in the shape of Matthew Broderick as the scientist who comes to understand what's going on, and Maria Pitillo in what is already becoming the cliched role of the year, the ambitious young TV reporter. Jean Reno is running around in the background as a mysterious French secret agent, making heavy-handed, deeply unfunny jokes about bad American coffee. Sooner or later, of course, they all have to head for the city and face the monster, but it takes an awfully long time. Is there any reason on earth why a film like this should be two hours and 19 minutes long? At 90 minutes, Emmerich and Devlin might conceivably have had an exciting movie. Size matters all right, but not the way they seem to think. Long, long ago, in a kingdom far away, a famous and venerable animation studio seemed to have lost the art of making good movies. But all that changed when the overhauled and revived Disney Corporation released The Little Mermaid eight years ago, reversing the received wisdom that the age of the animated feature was over and setting the standard for a string of huge hits in the 1990s. Not that any of this will matter too much to most of the audience for this welcome re-release - but it's worth remembering the doldrums into which Disney's animation division had sunk before The Little Mermaid turned things around, while noting that it still looks like one of the best modern offerings from the studio. The underwater sequences are absolutely wonderful, the story is classically simple and the whole thing is mercifully free of the schlocky sub-PC hokum of later offerings like Pocahontas. Even the songs are rather good, and the intimate scale of the whole thing makes one wonder whether all the fancy, computer-generated panoramas of more recent productions are at all necessary. A pleasure from start to finish, and a film that should thrill the new generation born since the original release. After the turbulence of the immediate post-Gorbachev years, when it seemed that one of the world's great film cultures might be swept away entirely, Russian cinema has been experiencing a modest but definite resurgence. A few months after Sergei Bodrov's fine Prisoner Of The Mountains was shown at the IFC, Pavel Chukhrai's exquisitely made film, set during the harshest years of post-war Stalinism, confirms the trend. Ekaterina Rednikova plays Katya, a young war widow with a six-year-old son Sanya (Misha Philipchuk). Aboard a train, she meets handsome, rogueish army officer Tolyan (Vladimir Mashkov), and the two begin a sexual relationship which sets them against the rigid oppression of the police state. The unfolding developments of the story are so masterfully handled that it would be wrong to reveal any more, but The Thief skilfully and believably interweaves its three protagonists' lives with the stark reality of their predicament. Chukhrai has said that he wanted to make a film about ""the childhood of the generation which has had such a strong influence on life in this country today"", and the point is rammed home in a rather heavy-handed coda, in which we see Sanya as a middle-aged army officer marshalling his troops in the midst of what looks like a savage, Chechen-style civil war. It's an addition which seems unnecessary (although perhaps not to a Russian audience) but it certainly doesn't detract from this melancholic, beautiful film, whose images linger in the mind for a long time."
"Feb 15, 2023",negative," After Cannes’ 50th anniversary last year, I wrote that the world’s most prestigious film festival “is defined by the most extreme contradictions: culture and glamour, art and commerce, sunny beaches and dark theaters, critical debate and crass deal-making, challenging cinema and mainstream product.” Yes, and it’s also crowded as hell. This year’s 12-day marathon—including 22 films in competition, dozens more in various sidebar packages, and several hundred others screened around town for “market” purposes—drew 4,000 journalists, fans, flacks, and industry bottom-feeders, making it extremely time-consuming, if not impossible or dangerous, to walk from one end of the Croisette to the other. The quintessentially Hollywoodian Primary Colors kicked off a fest that also included four French and four American movies in competition for the juried Palme d’Or. These big-ticket titles ostensibly help to underwrite one film each from China, Taiwan, Greece, and Russia—none of which has big stars or a fair chance of earning commercial distribution in the U.S. or France. Not for nothing was Godzilla selected as the closing-night film, even though, by any other standard, the choice was indefensible. But Cannes in May isn’t Cannes; it’s Planet Hollywood. The insanity of the daily schedule, the banality of the red-carpet parade, and the inevitability of needing to choose one film over another makes disappointments all the more profound, atrocities all the more hateful. You can spend a sweaty 15 minutes darting from one screening to another, often with 50 pounds of PR in tow, only to find that the movie is less than you hoped or worse. Little at this year’s festival approached true greatness, despite some world-class talents in competition. Taiwanese master Tsai Ming-liang’s The Hole was typically minimalist—so much so that a dramatic high point of the first half-hour was a character’s cough. Ken Loach’s My Name Is Joe was a minor work, but its hotheaded Everyman protagonist (Peter Mullan), who quits the sauce and romances a sweet social worker, rang true. Hou Hsiao-hsien’s The Flowers of Shanghai, a snail-paced portrait of brothel life in late 19th-century Shanghai, was one of the festival’s most challenging films; at least a quarter of the audience walked out before it was over. Even Terry Gilliam’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fell short of his best films, but Johnny Depp’s shabby-clothed journalist outsider provided the festival’s most resonant critique: “The mentality here is so massively atavistic that crimes often pass unnoticed.” Indeed, alienated outsiderdom emerged as the festival’s theme. Patrice Chereau’s Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train was a wildly overwrought melodrama about an extended family whose every member has some sexual “problem” (homosexuality, transvestitism, female hysteria). Claude Miller’s The Class Trip depicted a young boy’s Freudian daydreams, but without dreaming much itself. Roberto Benigni’s bizarre, obnoxious Life Is Beautiful turned from a featherweight slapstick comedy into a more upbeat Schindler’s List, making it perhaps the closest we’ll come to seeing Jerry Lewis’ notorious unreleased Holocaust melodrama, The Day the Clown Cried. The outsider heroine of Dance Me to My Song—a woman with severe cerebral palsy, played by a woman (Heather Rose) in the same condition—offered one of the festival’s true surprises. Rolf de Heer’s unflinching direction notwithstanding, this is indeed “a film by Heather Rose,” who not only gives a fierce performance but also cowrote this harrowing love-triangle variation on her life story. The near 10-minute standing ovation given to Rose bodes well for a film that could tap some of the same real-life underdog appeal as its fellow Aussie import Shine. On the other hand, perhaps it would be better if Rose weren’t embraced by Planet Hollywood. By contrast, Todd Solondz’s Happiness—an ironic/sarcastic title if there ever was one—depicts an endless amount of fear and loathing under the guise of the blackest comedy: A clean-cut suburban father (Dylan Baker) recalls a cathartic dream about gunning down random strangers, then jerks off to a teen magazine; a mother (Cynthia Stevenson) ends up tasting her boy’s first ejaculate. To an extent, one appreciates the director’s view that America is sick, suburbia is polluted, most men are sickos, some women are mean and pathetic, and all children are victims. But then what? As in Welcome to the Dollhouse, Solondz successfully beats the viewer into submission—and so the cycle of abuse continues. Much better was Lars von Trier’s Idioterne (The Idiots), which proposes an odd solution to alienation: impersonating retarded people as a rebellious means of raw self-expression and subcultural fraternizing. Although The Idiots is the uncredited second film in von Trier’s newly formed cinema collective (his name isn’t on it), this is unmistakably the work of the man who made Breaking the Waves—the same aesthetic mix of jump-cuts, seasick camerawork, and washed-out colors capturing the metaphoric story of people too delicate for this world, fighting to assert themselves amidst the powers that be. Leave it to Lodge Kerrigan, director of the bleak Amerindie Clean, Shaven, to return us to the land of the lost. Kerrigan’s Claire Dolan is a tightly controlled, nearly suffocating investigation of the life of a New York prostitute (Katrin Cartlidge) who struggles to put some distance between herself and her manipulative pimp (Colm Meaney), enlisting the aid of a scruffy cab driver (Vincent D’Onofrio). The theme all around is control, and Kerrigan certainly proves the master of his domain. At the post-screening press conference, the youngish auteur brooded impeccably, stared at his water glass, and generally looked like a guy who doesn’t get out much. After a week of nothing but screenings, I believe I know how that feels. Halfway through actor-director John Turturro’s boring Illuminata, I bolted, just barely making it into a market screening of the buzz movie in competition, The Dreamlife of Angels. Even though I watched from a cramped and cross-legged position on the floor of a tiny room, this incisive study of the shifting relationship between two young French women was riveting, seeming as real as any doc. (Sony Pictures Classics picked it up for distribution, meaning it may appear here before year’s end.) One night I blew off the festival entirely, skipping the press screening of Hal Hartley’s heinous Henry Fool in favor of a 30-minute train ride to a tiny theater showing Adrian Lyne’s Lolita. As you probably know, the Child Pornography Prevention Act passed Congress, making it illegal to show a minor having sex, even with the use of a body double. Lyne strained to interest a U.S. distributor before settling for a premiere on pay cable in August. As Lolita unspooled, I wondered what it meant that much of the film excited me (in a manner of speaking) more than anything at Cannes. As mass-released “alternative” fare like Good Will Hunting continues to make foreign art cinema an iffy prospect anywhere, film cognoscenti visit festivals at any cost because surprises at home are few and far between. At a panel discussion on the state of film criticism, French critic Michel Ciment mentioned that last year’s quartet of Cannes award-winners—Taste of Cherry, The Eel, The Sweet Hereafter, and Happy Together—earned hardly any money in commercial release. And yet that hasn’t stopped people from coming to the festival. In other words, for critics who’d rather seek hidden treasures than spend 52 weeks a year helping to announce whatever Harvey Weinstein and Co. consider a sound investment, the film festival has become the last, best arthouse. But since that arthouse isn’t open to the general public, reporting on it means risking irrelevance or loss of employment—which only makes the situation worse. Probably the only reason to continue practicing film criticism is the naive hope that, every so often, what you write has some microscopic influence on widening the range of available product. And if not, well, there’s always Miramax’s fall lineup. Speaking of which, every once in a while the former indie company’s clout lands a Velvet Goldmine—that is, a film by a smart, iconoclastic, politically minded director designed to subvert the status quo of visual, narrative, and sexual representation. Todd Haynes’ hugely ambitious glitter-rock epic stacks layer after layer of flamboyant artifice atop stardust memories of the ’70s queer youth culture’s yearning for “ch-ch-ch-changes”—precisely the project of glam rock itself. The investors were probably thrilled to hear that they’d be getting something like Citizen Kane meets Boogie Nights and Performance. But the role-playing of the filmmaker and his actors (including Ewan McGregor and Christian Bale) is so extravagantly complex—and the style so tantalizingly opaque—that not even the publicists’ “meet the talent” press luncheon could spoil the mystery of this goldmine’s Rosebud. On Sunday, about 30 of us gathered in front of the Trinitron outside the press room to scribble down the names of the award winners. Befitting the jury’s president, Martin Scorsese, the awards were evenly distributed. Haynes took the Prix de Meilleure Contribution Artistique (Best Artistic Contribution), thanking Oscar Wilde and Roxy Music “for giving us so much to aspire to.” Hal Hartley won the screenplay prize for Henry Fool; John Boorman was awarded Best Director for The General, his so-so biopic of Irish thief Martin Cahill. Peter Mullan took the actor’s prize for My Name Is Joe, while Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier, the young women from The Dreamlife of Angels, split the Best Actress award. Roberto Benigni won the Grand Prix for Life Is Beautiful and knelt at Scorsese’s feet. And the top-prize Palme D’Or went to Theo Angelopoulos’ Eternity and a Day—which seemed to last about that long. Now that the serious side of Cannes is fini, I’m headed for the Grand Théìtre Lumière to battle the crowds for Godzilla—which I could do just as easily at the Hollywood 27. As the French would say, “Plus ça change....” My plane doesn’t leave for two more days, but in a way—in the biggest way—I’m already home. “Mr. Spielberg,” the attorney asked, “is character development important to the success and popularity of an action film?” “Unfortunately, it’s not important, no,” Spielberg replied. “Take Jurassic Park—people went to see that movie over and over again because of the dinosaurs, not because the kids had a nice scene where they sat in a tree at night and talked for three minutes.” C’mon, Steven. People went to see Jurassic Park the first time because of the special effects, but they went back again and again (and then bought the video) because of the characters. Jeff Goldblum’s spaced-out scientist and Richard Attenborough’s jolly media magnate have their own appeal, but especially strong are the dinosaur personalities—the cute-but-deadly campys, the ruthless raptors. Spielberg is downplaying character development in the above-quoted exchange because he’s a defendant in a lawsuit alleging that the script for Twister was plagiarized. The final script is “like 5 percent” of the success of the movie, he calculates disingenuously. But if he believes that, he’s forgotten why Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Jurassic Park are great movies, and why the character-light sequel The Lost World isn’t. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the creative team behind Godzilla, subscribe to the school of one-shot moviemaking: create a special effect so monstrously huge that the entire world will have to see it once. Who cares if, after the opening weekend numbers are toted up, anyone will want to see it again, or buy the video? Emmerich and Devlin never intend to make a King Kong, in which the monster grabs hold of our imagination and achieves immortality through his tragic personality. As they showed in Stargate and Independence Day, they only want to take seven bucks off half the country’s moviegoers and scram—and for that, you don’t need character development. So their Godzilla, created by French nuclear testing in the South Pacific (take that, France!), makes his way very quickly to Manhattan, where people run for their lives and tractor-trailers are crunched in mighty jaws. Then the borough is evacuated (off-screen, unfortunately—now that would have been a movie). Helicopters chase the monster around in scenes designed to provide a basis for the upcoming video game. Meanwhile, soldiers, scientists, and the obligatory venal politician (Mayor Ebert, with his assistant Gene—take that, critics!) try to figure out how to kill the beast. Matthew Broderick plays an expert on nuclear mutations who figures out all the important plot points, like ’Zilla’s pregnancy. After the first half hour, with its witty references to the Toho studio’s original movies, Godzilla becomes an exercise in bad pacing studded with free-floating good ideas. It’s great to see the monster swimming in the Hudson River, undulating like aquatic dinosaurs do in paleontological reconstructions. It’s terrific to see his offspring struggling to corner on the slick floors of Madison Square Garden. But by the time we see these imaginative moments, we’re so worn out by the movie’s buzz-bomb approach to action and comic relief that we’re immune to further sensation. Emmerich cranks up the lumbering Japanese monster to Mach 2, and the editor and cinematographer are simply pulled along in its wake. Meanwhile, auxiliary characters like Maria Patillo as Broderick’s love interest and Hank Azaria as a rogue cameraman are written as stereotypes, so no time need be wasted getting to know them. Worst of all, we feel nothing when the mighty Godzilla bites the dust, other than relief that the sensory assault is over. Why should we? It’s just a CGI. That Emmerich, Devlin, and maybe even Spielberg think we don’t want monsters to have personalities as strong as our fears only proves that they don’t know what a monster movie is really about. Character counts, and Godzilla is a negative number."

"Feb 15, 2023",negative," (CNN) -- Ever since its promotional theatrical trailer was released last summer, we have been teased, taunted and tormented with tantalizing glimpses of the 1998 version of ""Godzilla.""  We've also been told over and over again that ""size does matter."" There is no doubt that this lizard will be a cash cow for at least two or three weeks.  Then, hopefully, people will realize that the movie's not worth their pocket change -- or maybe when ""Armageddon"" opens on July 1, the summer movie season's second comet will land right on top of the big guy. As in the original ""Godzilla"" released in 1956, a nuclear bomb, this one set off by the French, mutates a harmless reptile into a  huge lizard that's big, mean, and has a thing for major cities. Instead of Tokyo, this monster's heading for the Big Apple. The only thing in his way is half the U.S. Army, the Navy and Ferris Bueler, I mean Matthew Broderick.  He plays ""the worm guy,"" an earnest scientist who studies the effects of radiation on worms.  Naturally, he's also the world's leading expert on giant nuclear lizards.  We also have a little inside joke here.  Broderick's character's name is Totopoulos, which happens to be the name of the man who designed this version of Godzilla. Filmmakers Roland Emmerich (director/writer) and Dean Devlin (producer/writer) are great at eye-popping effects and at blowing up national landmarks, but their films are lacking in character development.  The main thing that made their mega-hit ""Independence Day"" work as well as it did was the wise-cracking fighter pilot, played by Will Smith. There is no such character here.  The closest stand-in we get is a mysterious French special agent, played by Jean Reno, who manages to get a few zingers in here and there as he helps Broderick's character track down Godzilla. During the first hour, Godzilla had me right in the middle of his big scaly palm.  The audience is continually teased with only glimpses of ""Godzilla"" as he crosses the world, eventually descends on lower Manhattan, and proceeds uptown smashing billions of dollars' worth of real estate along the way. But when the film moves from the lizard action into the humdrum lives of the people played by Broderick, Pitillo and Hank Azaria (who plays a news cameraman) the film's forward momentum skids to a stop. Basically, this whole movie is derivative drivel. Yes, the special effects are spectacular, but there's not an original thought in evidence.  Emmerich and Devlin have borrowed whole scenes from ""Jaws,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""King Kong"" and ""Mighty Joe Young.""  Then when we finally do see a full-frame shot of the lizard, it's a cross between ""Jurassic Park""'s raptors and Sigourney Weaver's ""Alien.""  He's a big boy.  But oddly generic. On top of everything, the mayor of New York is named Ebert, as in Roger, and his chief aid is named Gene, as in Siskel.  There's even a little thumbs up, thumbs down action at the end.  This cheesy turkey is also a bit hammy.  Come to think of it, this isn't a movie.  It's a delicatessen. No matter what I, or anyone else, says, this film is going to make gajillions of dollars, and teenage boys from 12 to 60 will be lining up to see this monster mash.  But for me, ""Godzilla"" ranks as a ""somebody else pays."" Better yet, make someone pay you to see it.  I did."

"Nov 23, 2022",negative," It’s big, it’s scaly and it’s not happy to be here. “Godzilla” stomped into local theaters this week to wreak havoc in Manhattan and at the box office. Nuclear testing on distant islands of French Polynesia has resulted in mutation of a lizard in that area. This much we gather from the long opening credits sequence depicting the nuclear blast and viewing the defenseless lizards watching as their home and their lives are destroyed by the fiercest of foes: man. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is a biologist studying nuclear mutation of various creatures. His latest effort focuses on earthworms at Chernobyl. He’s torn away from his work by American military operatives lead by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn). Tatopoulos is wanted to discover what this creature is that has shredded a fishing trawler and made tracks across in Panama. Many of us have come to know Godzilla as a cheesy Japanese movie monster that wreaks havoc in Japan. However, this incarnation of “Gojira” is less cheesy and more explosive. For the film to be successful, the blow-em-up premises of Independence Day and Men in Black have to be shoved below the surface and the true cheekiness of Godzilla exposed. Unfortunately, director Roland Emmerich feels he’s got a sure-fire hit with the destruction from “ID4” and the theft of ideas from “Park”. On the box office front his success is guaranteed. Godzilla will make a killing if those cheering little kids in the theater have anything to do with it. The quality, however, is quite different. There’s not much in this film we haven’t seen before. The effects are a combination of “Park’s” magnificent dinosaurs and the disappointing antiquated destruction from the end of “ID4.” Bad roles have been given to great actors (Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria). They play their parts the best they can, but it’s Emmerich’s directing that kills their shots at decent roles. The most interesting portions of the film come in three sets of segments. The first is the use of Michael Lerner and Lorry Goldman as Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel look-a-likes. Lerner is Mayor Ebert, Manhattan’s rotund leader. Lorry Goldman is Gene, Ebert’s assistant. They bicker throughout the film, but it’s the sequence where Ebert crows “Why do I even keep you around?” that marks one of the few bright spots in the film. The use of French secret service agents to bad-mouth the Americans and save the day is unique and finally turns the tables on the endless parade of anti-French sentiment that runs rampant through American humor. At one point, Philippe (Jean Reno), the French agents’ leader, is sampling coffee and spits it up, “I thought this was French Roast?” One of his colleagues, holding up an American can of coffee with the words “French Roast” printed in large letters on it, replies, “It is.” The final set is featured at the beginning and towards the end. The sequences portray the lizards and especially Godzilla as innocent creatures simply trying to live the only way they know how. They are more human in characteristic than any of the human characters in the film. In that way the film fails. The Characters become destructible things instead of keys to the film. In the end it’s not the senseless destruction or the lives lost that we care about, it is this giant lizard who we can only see as an innocent bystander hunted by a fear-stricken race bent on destroying anything that threatens their way of life."
"Jun 25, 2022",positive," While we’re a handful of days behind schedule, The Letterboxd Files with yours truly has returned for another round of things that you could’ve already read if you had a Letterboxd and followed my account. If you don’t, never fear. I’d never deprive you of these painfully casual film blurbs. I wouldn’t even dare. This week, we’ve got Elvis, a spattering of William Friedkin and Wolfgang Petersen (because why not) and more reviews from the vault because I have a job and didn’t watch as many movies this week. Lmao, Baz, you crazy SOB. Elvis is a 159-minute atomic blast of rhinestone glory. Genuinely unsure how Austin Butler pulled that off, and how Tom Hanks was able to be so evil with that accent. A stunner. Let Luhrmann do whatever he wants for the rest of his career. Can we put to rest the idea Walk Hard made it to where you can’t do a biopic like this anymore? Literally just hire someone as insane and opulent as Baz Luhrmann and nail the cast. Elvis is a rattler. No idea how Baz decided to put a Denzel Curry track in the Elvis movie, but I support. Maybe not my favorite Petersen film, but it’s pretty compelling when it’s showing the horrors of contagion and how futile we are to nature. Having actually lived through a pandemic and gotten the virus in question (with tons of vaccine flowing through me), it is fascinating to see the “what if?” horrors of 90s imagining of what this might look like. Clearly it’s going off a disaster movie’s playbook, and the military conniving feels a little trite for how something this serious would actually go. But just having lived through a moment where U.S government severely mismanaged the opening stages of a pandemic…incompetence and malevolence at the federal level don’t feel that off. Petersen really found something to say with the state of our leadership at the top with his government trilogy (this, Fire, AF1), and though this is the least effective of that trio, it’s still a noxious reminder of how we pale in comparison to nature’s worst. Cute monkey, too. God bless Wolfgang Petersen for mounting such a thrilling, phenomenally stupid-yet-surprisingly deep studio blockbuster at a time where we need way more of that than Spider-Man 7. Gary Oldman snapping in every scene is a hoot. I originally intended to only watch an hour of this, but it was so magnetizing, I couldn’t do anything but finish it. The classic 90s political thriller, complete with an air-tight script for 2+ hours, some great performances and a steady hand from Wolfgang Petersen. I miss Clint Eastwood acting in other people’s movies. Just a grand time. A scuzzy, sun-drenched LA neo-noir where nobody is good forever and everyone has something to hide. Obviously the car chase is a landmark, which what else would you expect from the guy who made The French Connection, but I was equally impressed by Friedkin’s ability to zap the film of any predictability. It’s just a daring, morally dubious cops-and-grifters saga with one hell of a Willem Dafoe performance. Everything burns. It’s stunning to me we used to live in a world where this was a major release from a movie studio. Sure, it got stomped by Star Wars, but what didn’t in 1977? A clear pathway for movies like Uncut Gems and Triple Frontier, and a white-knuckle, unforgiving descent into a very specific land of desperation. One of the few movies where it felt like anything could go wrong at any moment, and you feel that tension from opening to closing credits. Friedkin is a master of shot composition, and in building that exact shade of gut-wrenching tension that makes you want to yell at the screen. There’s something powerful that the film that’s going to stand as the future of Pixar is made by a team of amazingly creative women. Domee Shi elite: best directorial debut at Pixar since Lee Unkrich doing Toy Story 3. Staggering talent. It’s got shades of Scott Pilgrim and Aardman, which is one of the higher compliments I can give a movie. It nails the 2000s feel, down to the fact that it feels like one of those 00s live-action family films aimed at preteens. That’s a feat! I usually don’t give Disney credit for creative risk anymore, and boo on them for pulling this from theaters, but this is a step in the right direction. You quite literally can’t make this movie 10 years ago. Generational spectacle. It’s the first of a whole, but it feels still like a complete journey. It’s one of those rare experiences you can’t miss on the big screen – like, if you have any love of film at all, you must see it at least once in a premium format. I think it’s going to be canon one day / it’s the shining example of Villeneuve’s talent and what makes him the most interesting director working. I mean this seriously – some moments in this rival the same awe I felt the first time I watched 2001 in a theater (IMAX) – you just get those goosebumps and feelings of disbelief at what you’re watching. I still don’t know how they pulled some of this off – I’ll be honest, I got a little emotional watching some of this again in such a grand way. Not just for what we missed during the lost year in theaters, but just in appreciating what the best of what the spectacle of moviegoing can give you. A+ movie. The bulk of this is very squarely fixed in a Bush America, and some of the commentary lacks the kind of nuance that we’ve learned about global
politics since it came out. I think some of it is the same kind of issue Blazing Saddles faces now – timely subversion that now looks dated without viral context – but some of it is just Parker/Stone’s sense of humor just not advancing past what was allowed at the time. Some of it is aggressively funny, some of it is just not quite there anymore. What’s surprising is some of its best material isn’t even humor – it’s the darkness that seeps in with the characters and the story. The music is solid, the puppetry is deeply impressive, the puking scene is still the funniest part besides the house cats. I really wish there was more here that aged well, but it’s still quite good for what it’s trying to do. It’s not my favorite thing Parker/Stone have done, but it’s important for what it accomplished, even if what some of it accomplished shows a little naivety and insensitivity. As much as the absence of John R. Dilworth looms over this (it’s very weird he virtually had nothing to do with the revival of Courage and didn’t sign off on this), this is leagues better than the CGI Scoob! movie that committed the unforgivable sin of recasting Shaggy. Matthew Lillard is the only person that should be allowed to play or voice Shaggy until his passing; this should be U.S. law. The tonal clash of Courage’s artsy/creepy horror comedy and Scooby Doo’s kooky 60s mystery caper isn’t nearly as jarring as you’d expect. No Dilworth means the graceful terror of the original Courage series is missing, but the body horror comedy and abstractions, and all the usual beats, for Courage are present. The original show is landmark for animation and one of the best animated series of all time; this revival is pretty darn enjoyable in a “good fan fiction” sort of way. Thea White’s Muriel being back and is just as good as ever, just before her passing, hits hard. I forgot what a spectacular piece of voice acting that was and what a great, tender character she is. She and Courage’s dynamic still hits home. So sweet. Some of this is a little too goofy for its own good (Eustace’s rap number is a choice), but it’s so much better than it has any right to be, and just so, so much better than the big-budget animated film meant to spark a cinematic universe. It gets both series’ right, and it has Lillard right where he needs to be. Also, what a randomly hilarious/moving statement on the relationship the anxious have with calming apps. The likely first and last Courage family reunion was a nice little thing I didn’t know I needed. Mixing in Scooby-Doo is a clever little wrinkle that makes this direct-to-DVD ditty worth the time. The best and worst of Kevin Smith, rolled up into a delicious burger that gives you the runs. As I get uncomfortably closer to 30, I can’t help but feel much more so now the burden of time than I did when I snuck-watched this in 2006 that Smith places on Dante and Randal, selling burgers and talking pop culture into their 30s as life passes them by and they start to grapple with the fact that they’re not really “young” anymore. You can tell that Smith is at war with himself as a creator here, still slinging the same shock-disgust humor but wholly unable to fumble the emotional beats that define his best films. He can’t let go of some truly uncomfortable jokes by today’s standard (half of Randal’s shtick would get tossed out in millisecond in today’s climate, for obvious reason), which makes some of this movie age like an old hamburger on the sidewalk. It’s not really “fair” to judge everything on that standard, with Smith more than willing to answer for Randal’s defeating immaturity with deep-seeded insecurity and fear for how small he feels in a world that seems to be passing him by and a past he probably never fully appreciated until it was long gone. They say youth is wasted on the young, and it’s clear Smith is asking himself, and his pop-culture obsessed audience, if they really understand how precious the days of empty chatter with beloved buddies are, how the time you spend with those you love and the good you can rummage up to do for others really cements your time on this planet, not the big dreams you muster or the life goals you feel bound to complete. Dante and Randal may feel lost in the dog days of the service industry, but it’s that they’re together that makes it worthwhile, and even joyous and well worth the menial nature. Though, Smith’s irony comes with finding that out before so much of it is off the clock. You can’t always appreciate what you’ve got while you’ve got it in abundance, which is why life can be so bittersweet. Smith’s penchant for vulgarity and shock value never served him quite like he hoped; this, of course, came before his spat with Rotten Tomatoes and Cop Out/Yoga Hosers period when you could tell he was struggling to find his voice as an artist who saw an industry starting to pass him by and a style that was growing more dated by the hour. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot was actually a pretty nice little comeback vehicle for him, and clearly, Clerks III might be his best chance in decades to make a sincerely good movie, informed by real-life struggle. Dante and Randal have always been his most honest characters and best evolving reflections of self, as you can tell Randal’s teary lament to Dante in jail is fully Smith purging his own insecurities about aging onto the page. Making Randal have a heart attack to directly mimic his own experience really has some dramatic potential that rivals anything he’s done in his career. It might be the best proving ground he’s ever had. Though, you just hope the juvenile sensibilities strike more toward character than offensiveness. I get some of Randal’s gross-out, low-brow, creepy gags are of their time and made to reflect a shallow, immature, likely dishonest goober who talks a big game and doesn’t have much to back up with. But his persona is caught between genuine empathy and a damning sense of obsoleteness. People complain “you can’t make this anymore” with certain comedies, but clearly some of this movie’s humor is irresponsible and embarrassing. Thankfully Smith has beyond evolved his rhetoric (his latest View Askew film finds a much more palatable sensibility), but you’ve got to weigh this film’s good heart, smart wordplay and deeply touching character work and performance with its at times bewildering lack of awareness. Though, that’s Smith for you circles 2006. Jeff Anderson’s performance, beyond being really nuanced and powerful at its best moments, also captures a sense of lowliness and timidity that does make this film’s most face-planting moments feel less proud and more self-critical than Smith’s page does. This is a very good film in spurts, and a bizarre, rusted time capsule in other ways. It’ll rightfully stay in its time of release and probably will get revisited with some negative attention once the new film comes out for how cringey some of the humor is. But also don’t forget the beating heart of it all, that helps contextualize some of this film’s lesser angels as sad consequences of living life without full awareness of how precious it is and how wonderful it is to have those around you. A glorious over-exaggeration. Jan de Bont knew how to give folks a good time at the movies. For the goofy moments and aged VFX, there’s a real sense of terror with the storm and a real sense of excitement for the chase. It’s a great cast, Bill Paxton such a loveable jackass in this, and Helen Hunt does a great job as the anchor for the emotion. PSH, obvs., is the MVP though, the world’s best storm-chasing hype man. This is a little long and ridiculous, but it’s also just a tour-de-force roller coaster theme park attraction. Which is ironic, because the actual theme park attraction for this sucked. Look, the Russos were a weird ass pick to direct this movie being that the last non-MCU film they made was You, Me and Dupree. Cherry is a lot of things, and at times, the Russos completely whiff on what they’re trying to say, only to be bailed out by their really impressive cast. The Russos know how to cast well; that’s the only reason this film, at least to me, holds itself together. It’s a glossy Goodfellas of an addict’s descent, free of any nuance. The Russos are not the guys who will give you that. But Tom Holland is a supremely gifted young guy who understands the story much better than the Russos do, and he’s pretty dang good here. He’s better at capturing the dangers of  boredom and economic disruption, better at casting a side eye to the empty, dangerous machismo of his military training, better at portraying the devastation of PTSD and the inability to find meaningful help for it, better at sliding into addiction and eventual ruin. The Russos don’t know how to do any of that convincingly, but their filmmaking still, somehow, refracts back with oomph because they were smart enough to wrangle in Holland (and Ciara Bravo, who does some under-appreciated heavy lifting her). The Russos are not probably going to make another movie like Cherry with some of these reactions devastatingly negative, but I found some engagement in this thing. It’s no better or worse at fast food imitation of a better filmmaker than its peers (I think they’re doing more Refn than Scorsese), and it’s, again, anchored by an actor in a better movie. Holland is genuinely good here, and that military section is genuinely interesting and thoughtful in its brazenness to depict the downsides of army life in such a crass, empty way. It’s unafraid to have a more blunt conversion about the 00s wars than some other things I’ve seen, and I liked that about it. The addiction drama is grimy and shallow, but Holland, Bravo, Jack Reynor and Forrest Goodluck are so dang good in portraying the darkness and immorality of the moment that it becomes surprisingly watchable. I don’t think the Russos are doing bad work here, but I question what happens if the cast falls through. It’s a decent flick, but Holland earns his stripes. A voracious, twisted vision of Hell, a carnival of sin and discord forged in the bowels of something unholy and wretched. Gaspar Noe by means of Lars von Trier with John Waters, David Lynch, Harmony Korine, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Zombie, Darren Aronofsky, Uwe Boll, the Farrellys and Tim Story serving as creative consultants. A disturbing survey of a languishing grave of holiday capitalism, screeching from the beyond warnings of greed and excess. A demented ballet of gruesome revenge from an ugly, amoral soul. I feel I am drawn to this film for its pungent nostalgia, for the feelings I have when I watch it that cannot be explained for the quality of what I’m watching, but I also defend the filmmaking. This is what happens when a film goes so off the rails that it dips into a twilight zone where so many delirious accidents and haphazard creative choices get hocked together into something so unsettling, garish, crass, dated, individual. There will never be another movie like Ron Howard’s The Grinch and 2003’s Cat in the Hat. These are abominations, but also such fascinating time capsules and signifiers for what the Universal Studios corporate suite thought was cinematically appropriate for the work of Dr. Seuss. In a world of MCUs and sterile family entertainment, I crave something so disastrously captivating as Ron Howard’s The Grinch. It’s wrong to like this movie, but like it, I do, for all of its festering warts and licked toads. It’s legitimately entertaining in a very selfish way – I find no inherent value in what I’m watching, but I still take great pride in finding value in the experience. I think this film works in some ways because there are some genuinely great things about it, on purpose and on accident. Jim Carrey is a man possessed – it is the most physical performance of all time, and I’m dumbfounded and deeply fascinated that he did this, Me, Myself and Irene and Man on the Moon so close together. It’s like he did The Majestic as a way to come off the acid trip he must’ve had to go on to be in those consecutive movies. I don’t like to think he ever took the Grinch makeup off – he just stayed in there, pushing the brink of his mental stability until he was just Grinch, nothing less, nothing more. Just Grinch. It’s an astounding feat of physical comedy and excess emoting. It’s a miracle he was able to do this and make it so lasting – I mean that. Rick Baker and company’s makeup is unbelievable for how it just meshes into the characters. The dog is a good actor dog, Taylor Momson is a good kid actor, Tambor plays smug like a fiddle, Clint Howard is the perfect actor for such a besmirched production. Getting Faith Hill to sing the main song over the credits after this nearly two-hour psychedelic breakdown is absolutely hilarious. This movie should not exist but I’m so glad it does. It’s a wonderful example of some of the deeply strange stuff that masqueraded as family entertainment when I was a kid. I’m all the better and worst for it. I find value in this film. It’s a weird, unkempt, relentlessly crude-yet-disarmingly-warm piece of early 2000s kitsch. But it’s also one of the most popular and rewatched Christmas films of all time. Only a holiday movie could be so bizarre and still garner such adoration and loyalty. A cheap sizzle reel of hero worship and political myth-making; telling in its utter inability to find anything particularly laudable about Rudy Giuliani in flashbacks of his spotty career in public service as a draconian attorney-turned-mayor. Any virtue bestowed upon him is in imagined dialogue, where any of his actions are heralded as “the right thing to do” because he’s Rudy, a good American and New Yorker who *loves his city.* It’s telling Giuliani made a cameo in this to give it his official seal of approval – it’s mostly the biopic equivalent of blowing smoke up the buttocks. I really don’t know what to do with the 9/11 material here. It’s obviously the pivotal part of Giuliani’s public persona, what he was mainly known for pre-Trump. Giuliani’s actual response and legacy to that horrible day is much more complicated now than it was when this film was made, already coronated as “America’s Mayor,” a shine that largely followed him nationally up to his time in this current administration. It’s a little shameless to have footage used like this, pandering in a way to serve mainly the purpose of telling Giuliani’s story. It’s his movie, but this film’s handling of 9/11 feels very lacking. But it was also released in 2003, before anyone really saw the full picture? I don’t know. James Woods’ performance is kind of just what he used to do in movies; banter quickly and yell loudly. It’s a strange balance of wanting to portray Giuliani as this moral fortress who also casually cheats on his wife, shows no mercy in his law, uses the Southern Strategy to win an election and berates superiors as a showing of “strength.” He’s given a glowing aura the story can’t organically fulfill. On subtle purpose or accident, it just shows him as a brash, ineffective, “law and order” politician who gets thrust into history and is hailed in the moment for saying all the right things and being at the front and center. It’s not to say he didn’t do good things around 9/11; it’s just that he’s not nearly the unifying hero that this movie tried to make him out to be. Clearly this film has no cultural currency outside of that Twitter clip that went viral (not very indicative of the rest of the film, which is as a whole listless, uneventful and kind of boring), but it is a fascinating time capsule to see how reputations get built off of fictional work. He was America’s Mayor because that’s what folks were told he was. It’s how Trump was seen as a successful businessman who could stabilize the economy. Stories matter! Myth-making in politics is dangerous; this film is definitely guilty of this. It’s whatever. A Made-for-TV procedural biopic that can’t really rectify its desire to glorify its subject with a life’s story unable to provide many examples of why that glorification is wholly deserved. I really wonder what the good people at TOHO thought when they left the screening room after being shown Roland Emmerich’s take on the beloved Godzilla. It’s probably like what Walt Disney would think if those people who make cheap animated films with Rob Schneider for Redbox made a Mickey Mouse movie. Godzilla ‘98 is a thing to behold, a doofy creature feature where quite literally everyone is an idiot and common sense and basic physics are thrown to the wind in exchange for lots of explosions and loud roaring. The Godzilla roar is one of the most jolting noises in global cinema, and here, it’s sounded so much, all at once, you lose sight of it and just get lost in the cacophonous nonsense. I can’t deny Emmerich must’ve had the time of his life here, because this is a silly movie with a true sense of personality. It has no idea it’s so crazy and lazily written, and it marches around like it’s the second coming of Jurassic Park. Jan de Bont was originally supposed to make this, and I would’ve been so curious to see what that would’ve been like. He showed so much clever restraint on Speed, and Emmerich never met a restraint he didn’t want to break with 30 tons of explosives. He’s basically who he is as a filmmaker, a much less problematic, hokier Michael Bay who has destroyed the world like 5 times. Respect is due to how unfailingly sincere he is, even if his films have never been particularly great. Godzilla ‘98 is a big, uninspired, contrived mess, but you have to at least somewhat enjoy how happy-go-lucky it is. Like, they basically took a big dump on the Godzilla mythos and reduced him to a lifeless, CGI horror of a dinosaur, and I still didn’t hate this stupid movie because of how eager it is. I really, really hated how they lost Godzilla so much. No one in New York could not keep their tabs on a gigantic monster; multiple scenes have everyone asking “where’s Godzilla?” like it’s Homer Simpson trying to pitch Poochie to the Springfield TV execs. He’s right there, you’ll yell at the screen! He’s right there! Godzilla is right behind you! How did he go from rampaging in the streets to hiding in the sewer system? Why does the Mayor in this get so mad about evacuating the city after a gigantic dinosaur attacks? Why did this film cast Harry Shearer to play the news anchor when he also voices Kent Brockman on The Simpsons, making a phrase like “the Disney Store has been looted” less of a forbidding sign of the times in this movie and more like an episode of The Simpsons? Why was Hank Azaria’s character composite for “Animal” the cameraman “a slice of New York pepperoni pizza brought to life by a wizard?” Why did they try to lure Godzilla by putting down a big pile of fish in the middle of New York City? Why is the military so stupid in this, even by the standards of movie military people? Is that *really* Godzilla, or just a giant stupid lizard who apparently has the ability to lay hundreds of eggs, in the span of like an hour, much less. Why was a renowned nuclear physicist taking a picture of Godzilla with a disposable camera multiple times? Why didn’t I absolutely hate this movie? I think it was because of the French military subplot. I did enjoy that. Jean Reno is always great. This is ok? Gleefully dull, but with enough earnest panache and spirit that you can’t dismiss it outright. There is a great moment where Matthew Broderick (a casting decision I actually didn’t hate) tried to escape on an elevator at Madison Square Garden from a bunch of hungry baby Godzillas, barely getting the door to close to save his hide. He gets to another floor, and the door opens. He sees a bunch of other baby Godzillas chowing down on a popcorn machine. They look at him. He says, “wrong floor,” and closes the door. I laughed. This was a heck of a bit. Why couldn’t the whole movie just be that? Godzilla as an IP is fine now. This is, ironically, kind of like the 2001 Planet of the Apes film I just watched (in 2020). This one is probably more remembered since it was such a big thing, but they’re both big-budget one-stop pop culture moments that flamed out because no one really liked them. This was also far too long, but I don’t think that really matters at a point. Liked those practical sets, though! Love those practical sets. What a fun, nasty little movie. Tim Burton got the raw end of the deal that this wasn’t a bigger thing. It’s got such an anarchistic spirit, it’s laugh-our-loud funny, it’s insanely creative, the multi-narrative layout works well and the aliens are so fun. It’s a better movie than Independence Day, and I wish we talked about this every 4th of July instead of Independence Day. It’s such a wonderful lampoon of the establishment and hammers in Burton’s disdain for those in charge. It’s also got the frenetic spirit of a PG-13 Tex Avery/Chuck Jones/Bob Clampett cartoon. The dove gag and ensuing “no birds” sign, and the aliens’ general disdain for birds in general, made be howl. This movie is a heck of a comedy, on top of its delightful parody of sci-fi tropes. I’m most struck by this rewatch because the animation is starting to really date itself. This movie is almost 20 years old! That astounds me. I was, like, 8 when it came out, and I remember being so enthralled with how weird and funny it was. I was laughing so much as a kid in this that I purposefully wet my pants so I could avoid going to the bathroom and miss any of the movie. I was that hooked; I peed myself in honor of Shrek. It holds up because it’s one of those movies that always will. It’s just hard to make an animated movie with this much staying power, one that, even if some of the animation is looking a little rusty these days, still crackles with so much wit and has such a large heart. Jokes I still laugh very loudly at: the Duloc welcome song and the exploding song bird, the brimstone exchange, most all of Donkey’s lines, probably more. The welcome song was one of the funniest things I’d ever seen when I was 8. The timing of that is unreal! Everything about Shrek is good. It’s all at once such an oddball movie and a towering achievement in animation; I think one fuels the other. Hot take: Shrek is a great movie! I’d kind of seen rumblings about people revisiting this and being kind of awestruck by it, and I can happily say I am now in the number that says the 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie is fantastic. I watched this on HBOMax at my fiancée’s (now wife!) house, and when she saw what I had watched, she texted me and said “did you really watch Josie and the Pussycats?” She is a very understanding person! I mean, yowza. Where the heck did this come from? Where was its audience when it came out? Why am I just now watching this? It’s great! It’s basically using a nostalgic IP as a Trojan horse for scathing, hilarious satire on the blind consumerism of the late 90s/early 00s, where people just bought stuff without really thinking “hmm, why am I buying this? Is this good? Is it good for me?’ I feel like we’ve all become more mindful of being advertised to and about the products we buy, but a movie like this still makes you kind of look around and see that we are still a world dominated by brands. It’s that now brands have to play fair, er, maybe just more fair than they used to? Consumerism being a means for conformity and a suppression of individual ideas, championed by those who are trying to compensate for how their individualism backfired on them, is not a theme I expected in the 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie. I really couldn’t have told you a year ago I’d be singing this film’s praises, mainly because a year ago I had forgotten this movie existed. It’s great! Unlike a lot of the teen-driven movies of its time, this one is incredibly smart and has some serious panache to the style. It mimics the boy band music video template in its aesthetic, which ages more like a wise stylistic decision to date the material rather than a point of convenience in the filmmaking process. The entire cast is excellent (I mean this in no point of irony; Tara Reid is Oscar-worthy in this film, like on the same level as Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids, as are the script, songs and maybe even Parker Posey and Alan Cummings), the satire hits in waves (I cannot understate how biting some of it is, particularly the way it brazenly skewers the music business and its treatment of the art, artists and audience), the humor is belly laugh worthy (the Du Jour, 2000-2001 graphic got me right in the kisser), the writing and direction are creative and assured and the music is legitimately great. Du Jour in and of itself is such a brilliant sendup of the boy band. Every single note of satire is just great here; the world might be different than when this was made, but my goodness, this is such a clever, endearing, madcap film. It’s genius how they pull this off and so sad that few people really grappled with how great it is when it was released. It’s one of the best cult films I’ve ever seen, and one of the flat-out best satires, period. Watch this! It’s on HBO Max (at the time) and it’s legitimately superb. We can’t go to movie theaters right now but my goodness you can sure plop on the couch and watch the wonderful 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie. One of the best things I’ve seen in awhile. When I was a kid, I didn’t watch this a ton after I saw it in theaters, primarily because this was the dark Disney movie I don’t think anyone in my family was keen on revisiting. I get why! It’s an inescapably human, decidedly non-Disney work, a gorgeous, philosophical rumination on religion, moral hypocrisy, the infallible nature of man, the power of kindness in a world that so often forgoes it, genocide, repressed human emotion fermented into pious villainy, the war within the church for servant love versus moral rule, inner beauty, societal oppression, etc. It’s not a movie 4-year-old Cory really “got,” I’m sure, and it’s precisely why, though they detract from the film’s swelling power at times, the gargoyles are necessary. Kids needed, y’know, something to hold on to, and wisecracking rock things do the trick! But adult Cory loves seeing something like the “Hellfire” music number in a Disney movie. This is the darkest “G” movie of all time! It’s like the Bambi’s mom scene for 90 minutes! Knowing deep down this isn’t even Quasimodo’s story, and though it’s thrilling and unforgettable to see him swing through the corridors of Notre Dame singing about going outside his shelled home. It’s Frollo’s story, the real Hunchback of Notre Dame, a grotesque man whose devious moral crusades mask his inability to rectify with his own shortcomings and fear of not being good enough for his false sense of righteousness. It’s a disturbingly relevant character, and Tony Jay voices the hell out of him. Musical numbers like “Topsy Turvy” and “Hellfire” just aren’t things Disney does or ever did. This film came out during a major transition for Disney and it feels like this film slipped through the cracks. A happy accident, if you will. I don’t want a watered down live-action version of this. I want the most PG-13 “G” movie of all time to stay how it is. If you just kind of let the gargoyle stuff be (the Jason Alexander’s gargoyle is attracted to a goat material is almost funny in a really embarrassing way), this film is the best thing the studio put out in the 90s that wasn’t Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin or Lion King. Heck, some of the highs here are as good as those movies, maybe better in some regards. This is a hallmark in taking a basic story trope, the boy and his dog, and driving in a wholly original, delightfully irreverent vision with it at its base. I really appreciate that Disney didn’t seem to hold this one back much; the studio’s output was at a point in the early 00s that, in a post-Tarzan world, they were making more non-musical risks. It eventually cratered and they had to return to the song-and-a-scene format of the 80s/90s Renaissance (Princess and the Frog/Tangled really starting in the second Renaissance), so some not good movies like Home on the Range and Chicken Little, slipped through. But so did outstanding films like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet. The voice cast here is just to die for (Daviegh Chase doing this and Spirited Away in the same year is unbelievable), and the animation is gorgeous. Sanders and DeBlois really let the backdrops take a dust into Hawaiian watercolor feel, and when a film this nutty and sweet also have a rigorous artistic backbone. These guys also know how to plot story like crazy so you know the pace, emotional beats (elite) and narrative payoff will be there. I wish Disney didn’t beat the heck out of this with that B-grade television show and all the direct-to-video sequels, because this film’s legacy deserves the gold standard. It’s one of Disney’s best animated films and one of its most proudly original. It’s also got the emotional sophistication you expect from the studio’s best works. It’s the A-team. The surfing Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride sequence is earned, not bought. When a film can pull something like that off so effortlessly to where it’s not like “hey, look, a great idea!,” that’s when you know."
"Feb 5, 2022",negative,"It is not just a bad movie; it is depressingly bad, in large part for what it says about the prevailing atmosphere of utter contempt for the art -- and the audience -- in which movies now are designed and produced."
"Sep 14, 2020",negative," n Chernobyl, Ukraine, nerdy biologist Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is enthusiastically studying earthworms, only to be unceremoniously whisked away by uniformed men on a military plane. He’s reassigned by armed persuasion to Panama, to investigate a monstrous footprint. Although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission employs him, his expertise doesn’t quite prepare him for the discovery of Godzilla, the abnormally mutated Komodo dragon or crocodile or other such reptile, uncommonly affected by atomic bomb testing. The attack of an Asian rig draws the interest of mysterious insurance man Philippe Roaché (Jean Reno), who joins the researchers in Panama. Niko’s boss Dr. Elsie Chapman (Vicki Lewis), of the National Institute of Paleontology, believes the creature is a dinosaur. But the evidence points to diabolical radiation sparking the evolution of a beast that is the first of its kind. When the killer colossus starts tromping through the streets of New York, the National Guard orchestrates a massive evacuation, while chaos and destruction markedly supersede the initiative. When it’s determined that Godzilla is capable of burrowing through the subway, military leader Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn) orders the fourteen possible subterraneous exits off the island to be sealed, to prevent the brute from roaming free through the entire United States. The idea of quarantining the leviathan is completely nonsensical, as is baiting it with mountains of fish. Fortunately for humanity, Godzilla isn’t entirely evil – and he’s also somewhat intelligent. But his size makes him rather unstoppable, and his agility allows him to duck under missile fire, creating no less than four scenes in which iconic buildings or fellow combatants are disintegrated as collateral damage. His skin seems impervious to rockets nevertheless. Implausibly and moronically, the army helicopters that are tracking Godzilla’s trek through Manhattan frequently lose him. The destruction level is amusingly high, with nonstop toppling of buildings and billowing explosions, demonstrating the incompetency of officials and the supremacy of bulky muscular abundance. “You caused more damage than that goddamned thing did!” screams the mayor. Designed and supervised by Patrick Tatopoulos (the name is not a coincidence), Godzilla barely resembles the original visual concepts created in 1954, while the use of predominantly unconvincing computer graphics helps the film to age much less gracefully than movies decades older. Toward the conclusion, the film looks a lot like “Jurassic Park,” but is unable to capture even a fraction of the intensity; perhaps the plenitude of pathetic comic relief is the culprit. Interestingly, the monster itself is shown fairly quickly, moving away from the idea of keeping its appearance secretive (like most calculating horror films). But “Godzilla” spends extremely unnecessary minutes developing subplots for supporting characters. Niko’s college sweetheart Audrey (Maria Pitillo) works for the WIDF news station in Manhattan, under the misogynistic reporter Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer), who refuses to promote her. She’s a friend of cameraman Victor Palotti (Hank Azaria) and his wife Lucy (Arabella Field), both of who receive a surplusage of dialogue as Audrey struggles to make a name for herself. The mayor (Michael Lerner) is also given numerous scenes as he governs nearly all of the decisions made by the military, which conflicts with the goals of the French secret service crew that monitors their movements. There are far too many characters and they’re all annoyingly bungling – which reflects the clumsy, unproficient hands of the filmmakers helming this overlong, abominable take on the Toho Company’s legendary monster.

"Jul 23, 2020",negative,The overall effect is about as scary as an out-of-control street parade float.
"Feb 26, 2020",negative,"Hollywood's Godzilla was devoid of personality. We didn't care what happened to that mega-lizard. Heck, we didn't even get a good look at him until three quarters of the way through the film."
"Apr 11, 2018",negative," This time Godzilla is really dead. A child of atomic blasts, it survived attacks by every conventional and fanciful weapon industrialized nations could throw at it: jets, bombs, gunships, rockets, tanks—the whole toy chest. Once, it was enclosed in a bubble and kidnapped to outer space, recruited to do another planet's dirty work. It's been attacked by flying saucers, the Super X2 experimental craft, an oversized King Kong, electrified pylons, Biollante the biological weapon, suspiciously penile-looking, poison-spitting Mothra larvae. It's been plotted against (“Implement Plan 2, Item 4, Schedule 5”) by alien Kilaaks and the Republic of Saradia, discussed by the Mental Science Exploitation Center and World Space Authority, mesmerized by teeny-bopper psychokinesis. It ate nuclear power plants, enjoyed those, thank you. It beat Rodan, Mechagodzilla, and hydra-headed King Ghidera (or Monster Zero, when controlled from the hidden fortress within Mount Fuji by aliens from Planet X in the Scorpion System). That paralyzing titanium ray in the back, just when it was about to slam down Titanosaurus? Well, let's just say that only made Godzilla's victory dance that much sweeter. But in Godzilla vs. Das Spielbergle the beast finally meets its match. Director Roland “The Spielbergy” Emmerich (his nickname's mistranslation from his native German—surely they mean Spielburglar—might simply indicate that Germans don't get Spielberg any better than most American critics) lobotomized Godzilla's walnut-sized brain, removed its mind in extravagant digital cosmetic surgery, leaving poor Pop Toho destitute of reasons to ever make another inexpensive, innocent, adolescent mechanical/miniature adventure with ugly old analog Godzilla. The dead weight of Godzilla has permanently imbalanced the series' economy of scale. “They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving intelligence … especially the big one,” says the Kenyan game warden Robert Muldoon of Jurassic Park's raptors. “That one, when she looks at you, you can see that she's working things out.” Well, when Modzilla looks at you, you can see it hasn't a clue. This Godzilla's had his personality digitized to death, a poor example of character animation, lacking any discernible character. Unlike the Jurassic dinosaurs, which Das Spielbergle simply copied in larger scale, Godzilla exhibits no creepy, recognizable, realistic animal behavior, either. Its figuration lacks a memorable, primal snapshot. It's posed a lot like the evil one from Spawn, and even then it's only glimpsed quickly, the first rogue of The Furtive Monsters of Filmland. (The Toho effects artists weren't hiding anything; they beheld Godzilla's enthralling visage with lingering, terror-and-giggle—inducing portraits.*) If not for the Taco Bell collectors cups and Dreyer's Ice Cream cartons you'd scarcely remember this Godzilla, much less conjure it in a nightmare. It's even a dull color—hey … it's Grey-zilla, it's Blah-zilla—not your toxic, Mountain Dew green. Seen as an atomo-mutated iguana, it has an overdeveloped lower jaw and a cruel face like a giant Alien, and mostly it's glimpsed in body parts. When a filmmaker settles on these newfangled effects, he doesn't want the audience looking too long at them. Besides, we're in New York and the meter's running. The decision to make Godzilla an expensive effects film immediately departs from the series' aesthetic and iconographic tradition, which even resisted stop-motion (as in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms or the effect Tim Burton captured so marvelously using computer-generated imagery in Mars Attacks!). The onslaught of exploitative digital effects effectively removes Godzilla from the world of juvenile pleasure—now it would need a gargantuan audience—leaving nothing of interest for any age. It's not a good adult movie; it's not a good kids movie; it's not a good movie; it's not a movie. It's an Event. Godzilla overdone in this manner by a junkmeister proves that movies are improving in ways that don't matter and getting worse in ways that do. And how quickly did the promise of CGI's limitless possibilities run into the productized deceit of the banal. Despite the Spielberg mimicry (the fishermen on the wharf, “I think we need bigger guns”—yes, we know), the drama hasn't the snap of Jaws (while Spielberg's works toward transforming and perfecting genre, Emmerich hasn't yet achieved tongue-in-cheek). And the effects show no improvement over the now five-year-old Jurassic Park, such as in the swish pan to successively snapping baby godzillas in Madison Square Garden, which copies, not quotes, the raptors in the kitchen scene. (And we've seen Godzilla's dopey son, Minya, before. He grew up to become Barney.) As compared to the effects achieved in the contemporary production Lost World—with its safari romp, breathtaking cliffhanger sequence (a master class in directing that would have had Hitchcock furiously taking notes), and raptors attacking at dynamic obliques seen overhead as they cut swaths across the tall grass toward their prey—well, that's on another filmmaking planet. Interested observers of the recent sins that have been visited upon all that's been held sacred about the cinema couldn't resist heaping upon the coming of Godzilla an unintended weight. Godzilla would not just symbolize, as it always has, man's imbalance with nature in the atomic age (Godzilla's reference to French nuclear testing speaks from tradition), but it would rather represent everything that's gone wrong with the movies. As the soulless, unstoppable, hyperbole machine emerged from the roiling water and headed toward a neighborhood near you, the monstrous Event would not be, indeed could not be, about a movie with any meaning. A reading from the Prophetess Pauline (Kael's “Why Are Movies So Bad? Or, The Numbers”) predicts these apocalyptic Events. She foresaw such über-scaled product as coming from dispassionate, now unfettered directors like Emmerich, a local demigod merely because his movies StarGate and Independence Day—the cynically dumbed-down, obvious, humorless, clunkily scripted and unimaginative packets of stolen bits from better films—made money. (After The Noah's Ark Principle, Joey aka Making Contact, Hollywood-Monster aka Ghost Chase, Moon 44 aka Intruder, and Universal Soldier, no one was declaring his genius, or even his undiscovered aptitude—the Numbers in a nutshell.) Godzilla's risk-less capitalization on a famous product trademark would promise expensive visual effects and thus create the kind of synergy between entertainment media (the $100 million in marketing buys lots of synergy) and line up TV and newspaper shills like professional advance men. Finally, since the audience for dogpatch poesy completes the prosaic act, the simple art of the genre film becomes defined downward for an audience so numb, desperate, and raddled that “all they want are noisy thrills and dumb jokes and images that move along in an undemanding way, so they can sit and react at the simplest motor level”—Prophetess Pauline, reviewing Godzilla, miraculously accurately, in 1980. TriStar claims it begged the Dean Devlin—Roland Emmerich team four times before they agreed to make Godzilla; the Numbers mean a studio wouldn't even consider interesting Japanese directors such as Shasuke Kaneko, who made Gamera 2: Assault of the Legion as recently as 1996, or Kazuki Ohmori (Godzilla vs. Biollante shows updated technique without corruption of character), or Godzilla: 1985's Koji Hashimoto, or an American respectful of adolescent imagination such as Joe Dante. Give those guys $100 million and see what they come up with? Made-in-Japan pop can't even get distributed here. Carefully debarked of anything objectionable or stimulating, Godzilla turns out to be far too pointedly pointless to get agitated about. It doesn't even destroy structures in New York that might resonate—the Citicorp Building (headquarters of the planet's most evil bank, by the way), the World Trade Center towers, the Limelight disco, or St. Patrick's Cathedral. The idea is to crush all meaning without mercy. Even as a study in scale, the effects are uninspiring; they lack the transfixing power of the giganticized George Michaels or Rolling Stones music videos, even the crude rear screen of the miner who discovers Rodan's nest. What's more, the juvenile pleasure of Godzilla was suspension of suspension of disbelief, drifting between seeing Godzilla as a believable beast and/or a Japanese man in the Godzilla suit, destroying the neatest miniature city, not a photorealistic place but a spectacular diorama. It was attacked by your toy tanks and planes. Indeed, the Godzilla action figures of the Sixties were Godzilla—the movie character was not more realistic, it only moved. Did no one have the sense to ask Emmerich, at least rhetorically, “Why would you want to make a realistic Godzilla?” Emmerich shows no sympathy for the devil. Toho's Godzilla was never Studio-sterile. Godzilla mogul Tomoyuki Tanaka's enterprise was stylized Japanese pop art for kids, replete with harmoniously singing twin-pixie girls, mod fashion, comic-book art direction, and mythic beasts in a pyrotechnic puppet-theater. The head forbade Godzilla to tromp right by the Tokyo skyscrapers and crush that delicate, precious, defenseless old pagoda; the heart secretly pounded applause to Godzilla's every destructive tantrum. The real, famous, original Godzilla (Toho should now make this distinction, like Ray's Pizza parlors) has the face of a hopping-mad wet feline atop a long stiff neck, a house cat after a bath, with a flattened brow ridge cum fastback, an oddly likeable smirk, and irradiated dorsal fins splayed in a lovely rhythm down his spine. “That strangely innocent, and tragic monster,” as memorably described by series veteran Raymond Burr in Godzilla: 1985, was essentially a pro wrestler, as likely to be cast as hero with a sentimentalized departure as a villain to vanquish, even still a misty moment, or topple over, ending the movie immediately, sometimes seconds later. That wrestling dynamic—the movies were even promoted as big fights—meant it had simple, dramatic coherency, too, the reconfiguration of popular theater Roland Barthes critiques lovingly. Even saddled with an inexpressive Kabuki mask face, Godzilla can gloat; it just needs body language to do that, arms outstretched, in that proto-Rocky pose. It tosses a huge bolder with a giant lobster monster, back and forth, until Godzilla gets bored and breaks off a claw. Its bawl is perfectly strange and horribly funny—an elephant shriek quickly descending into an ursine/leonine roar; now it's a cataleptic Sony Dynamic Digital Sound blast (only at selected theaters!). Good old Godzilla hops into karate kicks, does a Japanese jig, and thumps its overdeveloped chest with undersized arms. It judo-throws creatures to cheesy Hammond B-3 organ-led jazz riffs. Its heroism interrupted by a death ray from a UFO hovering above, Godzilla grabs his throat with one hand and gestures with the other, looks up plaintively as if stricken with laryngitis, and shakes his head as if to apologize to all the world's children, “I'm in the grip of a death ray! What can I do?” Where is Emmerich's contribution to Godzilla's legend? His reductive method is the least holistic gestalt of A-level directors in Hollywood. He plucks from action films setups and shots and bits, but then he combines them dispassionately, artlessly, mechanically, without any added sensibility. By their first few minutes, his films feel old. In Universal Soldier (92), he starts in the Seagal/Stallone/Schwarzenegger mode of mayhem, then settles into RoboCop (minus Verhoeven's uncomprehended neo-Sirkian Euro-irony), Terminator 2 (the unflinchingly self-cauterizing mute brute protecting the tough yet emotional broad) with a touch of the good soldier/bad soldier dynamic of Platoon. The emotion is so calculated, it feels as if Emmerich's punched through the chest and ripped out the bloody half-hour heart of character development. His notion of artistic progress is stealing from better movies. StarGate? Close Encounters and Timecop. Independence Day? Close Encounters and Star Wars. Godzilla? Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Alien(s). There's rarely reference to anything that wasn't hugely successful, because reiteration of successful formula is all Emmerich's about. This is hit-making by the Numbers, box-office #1s, and who can blame him? Godzilla made $74 million its first Hollywood (five-day!) weekend—probably more than all previous Godzilla pictures combined—to media-muttering of industry “disappointment”: The sole purpose of this product was to make more money than anything else before it, generate a reflexive response immune to critical and public opinion, then let it creep back to the mediocre-sea. But who grieves for Godzilla? This time, Godzilla won't be back. But the creature the Germans call Das Spielbergle? You'll never stop this guy. *Mr. Inoshiro Honda, who directed most of the Toho Godzilla, exhibited old-fashioned showmanship. If Emmerich had any passion for the franchise, he'd have revised Honda's famous freeze-frame credit sequence sneak previews, which in the Sixties served the triple purpose of evoking gales of shrieking, laughter, and shouting (that's a sound one never hears anymore—movies today can't even work kids up into a frenzy); serving up instant gratification that made it easier to then settle in for plot; and giving flustered mothers the chance to scurry up the aisles with shocked, bawling infants. A black mark of our film culture, this Godzilla only excited furiously marketing and synergy-producing adults."
"Dec 11, 2014",negative," The classic Japanese monster film has been updated by the team that produced and directed “Stargate” and “Independence Day,” and what we get is basically “Jurassic Park” with one very, very big dinosaur. Nuclear testing has resulted in the mutation of a fish-loving lizard who seeks out Manhattan as an ideal place for him to lay eggs (he is a self- reproducing hemaphrodite). Godzilla roars around knocking down buildings, bespectacled scientist Nick Tatapolous (Matthew Broderick) works with the US Army and a mysterious group of Frenchmen to try to stop him, and Audrey (Maria Petillo), the girl who broke Nick’s heart in college, tries to break into the broadcast reporting big leagues by getting the inside story. On the scariness scale, this one fits in at around the “Jurassic Park” level, with a few jump-out-at-you surprises and some tense moments. The special effects are state-of-the art, but not particularly innovative. There are some striking visuals and a few clever plot turns. But the movie sorely misses the quirky charm of “Independence Day’s” Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum and the story never captures the heart. As far as I am concerned, the real special effect in this movie is the way they managed to make it appear that Manhattan was evacuated almost instantaneously. Parents should know that younger kids aware of India’s recent nuclear testing may be concerned that real mutations could be occuring. Some kids may be confused because at times, Godzilla is presented sympathetically, especially as he/she shows protective fury in finding her babies have been killed. Parents of older kids may want to talk with them about why it was important to Phillippe (Jean Reno) to take responsibility for Godzilla and why it was wrong for Audrey to betray Nick’s trust."

"May 6, 2014",negative," The Independence Day team of writer-director Roland Emmerich and writer-producer Dean Devlin update the Japanese monster series with dubious results. The picture’s fatal flaw is its inability to give us any consistent sense of Godzilla’s size. One minute the creature is knocking down skyscrapers with a swish of its tale and the next it’s hiding between buildings from the U.S. Army (the action mostly takes place in New York City). Even more ridiculous is Godzilla’s habit of burrowing into subway tunnels to escape. And if you hoped for a little personality in your monster, forget about it. Godzilla is as bland as the humans scurrying at its feet (which include Matthew Broderick, Hank Azaria, Jean Reno and Maria Pitillo)."

	No doubt about it: ""Godzilla"" will be a killer at the box office during the early stages of its prodigiously wide release. The slam-bang excitement and state-of-the-art special effects are more than impressive, but even with all that going for it, ""Godzilla"" isn't likely to post ""Titanic""-size grosses. No doubt about it: “Godzilla” will be a killer at the box office during the early stages of its prodigiously wide release. The slam-bang excitement and state-of-the-art special effects are more than impressive enough to ensure every 12-year-old boy in the known universe will want to see it early and often. And millions of nostalgic baby-boomers will be drawn by the novelty of a new and improved version of the lizard who repeatedly razed Tokyo in B-movies of yesteryear. But even with all that going for it, “Godzilla” isn’t likely to post “Titanic”-size grosses, or even challenge the records set by “Independence Day,” the last high-concept sci-fi spectacle devised by director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin. Despite all the flash and filigree, this monster movie is curiously — and conspicuously — lacking in heart. “Godzilla” is not so much a remake as a reinvention of the 1954 Japanese production that spawned scores of sequels, comic books and television commercials. (U.S. audiences are more familiar with the first pic’s 1956 Americanized version — “Godzilla, King of the Monsters” — which incorporated new footage with Raymond Burr as a reporter/narrator.) In the Emmerich-Devlin version, as in the original, the title creature is an unforeseen side effect of nuclear testing. The big difference is, this Godzilla is not a regenerated dinosaur. Rather, fallout from French nuclear blasts in the South Pacific have turned a lizard into a gigantic mutant monster. Only tantalizing bits and pieces of the monster are glimpsed during the early portions of the pic, as screenwriters Devlin and Emmerich (working from a story they concocted with Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) zip through exposition and introduce lead characters. After an effectively frightening Godzilla attack on a Japanese fishing ship, focus shifts to the Ukraine, where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), a biologist from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is studying the effect of radiation leakage on earthworms near Chernobyl. A military team led by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn) drops in to whisk Tatopoulos away to help with a much bigger problem. Joined by paleontologists Elsie Chapman (Vicki Lewis) and Mendel Craven (Malcolm Danare), Tatopoulos and the military team examine, among other things, the beached wreckage of the Japanese vessel. The ship has a huge claw mark on its bow, but that’s not the worst of it. Tatopoulos finds traces of blood that, along with the creature’s footprints, point to the existence of “some sort of enormous reptile.” Right from the start, Broderick conveys a gee-whiz ingenuousness that is distracting at best, insipid at worst. Broderick’s mannered affectations are either meant to humanize a thinly written character or simply provide comic relief. Either way, the performance as a whole comes off as a major miscalculation, to the point of making one miss the morose gravity of Burr in the earlier “Godzilla.” In sharp contrast, Jean Reno takes a winningly subtle approach in offering a crafty mix of foreboding and bemusement as Philippe Roache, a French secret agent who’s working undercover as an insurance company representative. He, too, observes the wreckage, and also interviews the only crew member who survives the attack on the ship. During that interview, the traumatized survivor refers to the creature as a legendary sea serpent: Gojira. Eventually, of course, this name is bastardized into Godzilla. Meanwhile, off the East Coast of the United States, fishing boats have their own close encounter with the lizard. By the time Tatopoulos and company get to Manhattan, the creature is ready to make his American debut at the Fulton Fish Market. From there, he rambles over to wreak havoc in the city’s financial district, just in time to interrupt a re-election campaign speech by the excitable Mayor Ebert (Michael Lerner). Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), an ambitious researcher for egotistical TV news anchor Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer), sees the Godzilla invasion as her big chance for professional advancement. Since she just happens to be the former girlfriend of Tatopoulos, she’s able to coax the still-smitten scientist into revealing more than he should about the creature. Throughout “Godzilla,” New York endures the most sustained rainfall in all of movie history. Most of the action takes place at night, but even the daytime scenes unfold under darkly overcast skies, which, of course, makes it all the easier for Emmerich to obscure Godzilla’s features for the maximum amount of time to generate the maximum amount of suspense. But when the creature is fully visible, it resembles nothing more than a hybrid of the mother beast from “Alien” and a T-Rex from “Jurassic Park.” Although the effect is striking, it’s not the familiar creature who often managed to earn audience sympathy, or at least develop a distinct personality. There’s something oddly generic-looking about this computer-generated image. This slimmed-down, turbo-charged beast is able to move easier and lunge more quickly while dashing through the streets of Manhattan. But, then again, why should Godzilla have to dash? Part of what made the original “Godzilla” and its sequels so much fun was Godzilla’s bad-ass, take-no-guff attitude as he lumbered down streets, kicking over buildings and remaining defiantly immune to bullets, bombs and heat-seeking missiles. This Godzilla usually runs away from his attackers, causing most of his damage mostly by accident. And where’s the fire? In all of “Godzilla,” the Gangsta Lizard breathes flame only twice, hardly enough to satisfy anyone familiar with the Godzilla mythos. “Godzilla” features some serviceable monster mayhem on New York streets, and offers a nifty assault in Central Park. But the movie doesn’t really kick into high gear until Tatopoulos and Roache, along with Roache’s heavily armed French compatriots, make their way into the evacuated city after Godzilla’s apparent demise. They discover Godzilla has laid about 200 ready-to-hatch eggs in the bowels of Madison Square Garden. There’s no getting around the fact that all the Godzilla offspring bear a suspicious resemblance to the “Jurassic Park” raptors. Just as in that lizard epic, the good guys — joined by TV cameraman Victor (Animal) Palotti (Hank Azaria) — race down hallways and crouch behind closed doors, pursued by the hungry creatures and the thrills and spills appear to be recycled from the climactic sequence of “Park.” But the sheer number of the creatures here, and the genuinely clever way Emmerich utilizes them, make for a high-octane adrenaline rush. And the banal dialogue — particularly in scenes where Broderick and Pitillo try to sort out their relationship — is spiked with a few witty touches. As soon as Lorry Goldman arrives as a bald-pated mayor’s aide named Gene, it’s clear that he and Mayor Ebert are in-jokey caricatures of two famous film critics. And just to make sure we don’t miss the gag, Goldman makes his exit by giving the mayor an angry thumbs-down. Godzilla designer and supervisor Patrick Tatopoulos — whose name is commandeered for Broderick’s character — does a bang-up job of creating a lean , mean monster machine. But there is little that is charismatic about his handiwork. As a result, there is no emotional frisson at the very end, even when it’s obvious that the audience should share Broderick’s pang of sorrow for thefallen creature. Size does matter, of course, but some things matter more. The soundtrack is also primed to produce sensory overload, as it is very loud , sometimes discomfortingly so, but the target audience likely would be surprised if it weren’t."
"Feb 14, 2008",negative," How much does size matter? It matters a great deal to Hollywood studios, and the very lucrative team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin — Emmerich directs, Devlin produces, and they work together on the scripts — are a studio exec’s dream come true. With StarGate and Independence Day, this dynamic duo proved they could create enormous anticipation — a bulletproof gotta-see-it campaign. What they can’t do, it’s clear by now, is make a good movie to go with the brilliant marketing. Godzilla, the new big one from Emmerich and Devlin, achieves the same weird paradox that ID4 did. It thunders into view with the full weight of event marketing, yet the movie itself is completely weightless. And, like Deep Impact (to cite just the most recent example), it zaps you with the spectacle of giant destruction and bores you with puny human-interest stuff. Who cares whether biologist Matthew Broderick and aspiring reporter Maria Pitillo get back together? There’s a monster knocking very large holes out of New York City. Emmerich and Devlin’s genius at arousing anticipation does result in a compelling first reel or so, here as in ID4. The audience gets excited by the promise that something big is coming. But when the something-big arrives, notice how fast the awe wears off, how quickly the audience’s giddiness turns to restlessness. Godzilla goes on for two hours and nineteen minutes, a great lumbering beast that has no personality, has size but no power. Am I referring to the movie or the monster? Both. The movie is bad in the same way that ID4 was bad: It aims low and misses. The big action scenes owe just about everything to both Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Godzilla running amok in New York is a pumped-up version of the T. rex menacing San Diego, and there’s an extended sequence involving an army of baby Godzillas that blatantly rips off the raptor scenes. I have no idea why Emmerich and Devlin needed to up the ante by infesting Madison Square Garden with mini-‘zillas (why didn’t they leave that for the sequel?); it adds an unnecessary half hour. Godzilla himself is fun when he first hits New York, but the filmmakers don’t find anything imaginative to do with him, and they keep him offscreen most of the time, while we’re stuck with Broderick whining and Jean Reno as some special agent and lame humor at the expense of Siskel and Ebert. The original Toho Godzilla (or Gojira), for all its guy-in-a-rubber-suit cheesiness, had a lovely clunky charm. The new Godzilla, technically whiz-bang though it is, actually looks bad next to the stop-motion behemoths of Ray Harryhausen (whose It Came from Beneath the Sea appears on a TV in the film) and the rubber suits of Toho. In his obscure book The Total Film-Maker, Jerry Lewis often refers to “the intangibles” of film. Well, a monster that has been sculpted and manipulated by hand has a tangible essence, a quality of having been worked on, that a CGI-created beast, however skillful, simply doesn’t have. This Godzilla is an “intangible” in the wrong way. After a while, Godzilla just strikes you as a big CGI blur; even the streets and buildings he destroys look cold and computerized. The deafening soundtrack tries to sell you size and force, but if you watched Godzilla with the sound off, you’d see a parade of thin, frantic images. This Godzilla even forgets to include the traditional cautionary message about nuclear testing; it’s used as an explanation for the monster, but then the movie drops it and concerns itself with … how to prevent Godzilla from nesting. In other words, “We don’t care that we created this thing; we just don’t want it to reproduce.” The original Gojira was Japan’s metaphor for the terrible mutating power of Hiroshima. The new, Americanized version goes after the great monster with the same military technology that dropped the bomb. And in this telling, Hiroshima isn’t even the cause — the culprit, it turns out, is France’s nuclear testing. Blame it on the French! The ironies and idiocies swirl together in a bland soup that, for some viewers, may taste like entertainment. Others may find it tasteless in both senses of the word."

"Dec 6, 2005",negative," Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II (1993)Rodan makes his (it's?) Heisei debut, sparring with Godzilla and humanity over an egg that ends up containing a new-for-the-90s version of Minilla (alternately called ""BabyZilla"" or ""Godzilla Jr.""). Meanwhile, the United Nation's anti-Godzilla task force has a new plan: Build a pilotable new Mecha-Godzilla. It works out about as well as every other plan ever tried against Godzilla. This is occasionally called a low-point in the second series, but I think people just didn't cotton to BabyZilla's overtly ""kawaii"" redesign. Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla (1994)A giant crystal comet is on a collision course with Earth, bearing one of Godzilla's most bizarre-looking (and least-imaginatively named) foes along with it. With a stronger emphasis on beam-weapon optical effects and pyrotechnics, plus another human-piloted mech in the form of a new Mogera, this is sometimes derided as a ""Sentai-fication"" of Godzilla, but it's not without its charms. Godzilla vs. Destroyer (1995)This was the plan: Toho would (for the first time since '54) kill off the original Godzilla in a lead-up to the 1998 American remake launching a new series. It didn't work out, obviously, but ""The Death of Godzilla"" was a big enough deal at the time to make headlines in the United States. How does it go down? Turns out the Oxygen Destroyer weapon that solved the problem in 1954 also created a new species of super-resilient crustacean/reptile hybrids that have now reached maturity and are swarming the country Aliens-style; while Godzilla himself is dying (but also more powerful and angrier than ever) from his own internal nuclear reactor melting down - threatening a cataclysmic event. There's a little too much time spent riffing on Aliens and Starship Troopers, but the finale is haunting and even poetic as these things go: Godzilla goes down fighting and takes all of Tokyo with him - and leaving a now fully powered Junior as his legacy. Godzilla 2000 (1999)Toho was deeply unhappy with the 1998 American Godzilla, and even less happy that they didn't get much money out of it. The lean, gritty and angry ""Millennium"" series (so named to distinguish it from the 80s/90s films despite Japan still technically being in the Heisei era) was their response: 1954 is the only canon once again, but now Godzilla is an oh-so-late-90s conspiracy subject followed around by what we'd now call ""Truthers"" storm-chaser style. This is also the one that gave us the ""Godzilla is inside each one of us"" meme."

"Aug 1, 2003",negative," Directed by Roland Emmerich, Godzilla follows several characters, including Matthew Broderick’s Nick Tatopoulos, Jean Reno’s Philippe Roaché, and Hank Azaria’s Victor Palotti, as they attempt to survive after the enormous title creature attacks New York City. Filmmaker Emmerich, working from a script written with Dean Devlin, delivers a bloated and mostly tedious endeavor that contains few, if any, elements designed to capture and sustain the viewer’s interest, which is disappointing, to say the least, given that the picture admittedly does open with a fair amount of promise – as the comfortably familiar first act, having essentially emerged directly from a template for movies of this ilk, seemingly paves the way for yet another larger-than-life (and propulsively entertaining) Emmerich end-of-the-world thriller. There’s little doubt, however, that Godzilla eventually progresses into a tedious and hopelessly padded-out midsection that emphasizes the dull exploits of several thinly-drawn (and predominantly unappealing) human characters, and it’s clear, certainly, that the nigh interminable atmosphere is exacerbated by an ineffective (and hopelessly anticlimactic) final third detailing the survivors’ battle with hundreds of raptor-sized monsters – with the end result a low point both for the blockbuster genre and for Emmerich himself."
"Jul 9, 2003",negative,Unspeakably boring and despicable. How anyone could possibly like such a piece of wretched excrement is beyond my comprehension.
"May 22, 2003",negative," Sadness is perhaps the best emotion a movie can evoke, and it works wonders for films that use it wisely. Is there a bad kind of sad? This film proves that indeed there is. Godzilla is a sad film. You see, the monster isn’t evil and has no bad intentions (until the end, when it gets very mad, it never intentionally kills a human except in self-defense), it’s just pregnant hungry and cranky. And yet the filmmakers are so needlessly cruel to the creature that it makes this creature feature damn near unwatchable. It’s just a bad kind of sad. It’s not the kind that leaves you feeling entertained, but the kind that leaves you feeling bad, like you’ve just endured a traumatic experience. Oh, but the movie isn’t poignant, no such luck. And it’s certainly not trying to say anything to the viewer. And it’s hard to tell — was director Ronald Emmerich trying to make us sympathize with the creature? If so, which I doubt, he both succeeded and failed, we sympathized but were crushed by the ending (oh, right, like you didn’t already know what it was!). As for the special effects — they are indeed spectacular. As a matter of fact, they are the best special effects that I have seen… perhaps ever. But they don’t entertain. Why? Well for starters, the script to support the effects is a total botch, the worst I’ve seen since Mr. Nice Guy. The human performances certainly leave something to be desired. And, since the movie is little more than one long pointless chase scene, the action gets tiresome. By the time the climax comes around we are sick of Godzilla. We are tired by the effects. And personally, by that time, I was so pissed off at the human characters that I was cheering for the monster. Makes it really anticlimactic."
