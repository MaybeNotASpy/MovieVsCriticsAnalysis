"Apr 4, 2024",positive," Hello to all of our great InSession Film fans! Over the next couple of days, I will be giving my daily recaps to my adventures here at film festival part of South by Southwest, located in the beautiful, vibrant and always weird Austin, TX. This is the first time I’ve ever been to a film festival and the first time covering it for the website to represent InSession film. Before I get into the films, I have to thank the great JD Duran for recommending me and applying for me to be a part of SXSW and I am forever grateful to him for helping me cross this opportunity off my bucket list. Now one would think that the first film you would see at SXSW would be something that was on the schedule but the first screenings weren’t until around 5 pm CST, so I had some time to kill. So I went to one of the many Alamo Drafthouse’s in town and caught the newest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel. While I will not give a full review on the film, I will say that I had a lot of fun with the film, thought Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson were fantastic and had great chemistry. Plus, the film did a solid job of setting up what is to come this summer with Avengers: Endgame. So once the screening ended, I headed down The Paramount Theater, located in the heart of downtown Austin, and is the location for most of the big premiers throughout the festival. There I got in line for the festival opener and one of the biggest films of the year, Jordan Peele’s Us. After waiting three and a half hours in line, I can confirm that Mr. Peele is a new master filmmaker and not just for the horror genre. I don’t want to get too much into spoilers or talk too much about the plot since the film comes out this week and I want everyone to go into the movie as fresh as possible but I must say that he came to play hard with this film. Us is a film that has a lot to say and once it was done, I knew I needed to see it again. The writing and direction that Peel presents us in this film is so much more nuanced and unique, it’s like you are watching a director fully come into his own. The cast are extraordinary, led by a powerhouse performance from Lupita Nyong’o, who gives a performance that lives up, and dare I say is better, then her Oscar winning performance for 12 Years a Slave. But the number one this I will never forget about this film was the crowd’s reaction during and after this film, which was ecstatic and eating ever part of this movie up. When you are watching a Jordan Peele movie from now on, you will know you are in good hands and thus he has turned into an event director, which mean that whatever he does in the future, it will be an event that all film lovers must see. Once Us was over, I went to the Stateside Theater next do and caught a film called Yes, God, Yes from first time director Karen Maine, whose short story was the inspiration to the 2014 film Obvious Child. Yes, God, Yes follows a high school girl named Alice (Natalia Dyer) is discovering herself sexually while going to a strict Catholic high school. While the film can play like a conventional high school coming of age story, it is elevated by hilarious humor and a lead performance from Dyer that is truly special. The movie plays like a rift between Eight Grade and The Miseducation of Cameron Post but done in such a lighter tone. This was a great discovery and I hope you all get to check it out soon because I think this could be a real fun discovery for anyone that gives it a shot. And with that, my day one was complete. Stay tuned for more coverage here on the website and some full reviews once the festival is done. Follow me on Twitter also to get my instant reactions and more from SXSW."
"Jul 24, 2023",positive," Synopsis: The story follows Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel is an all-new adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like Carol Danvers into the end of Phase Three. Not only she comes from nowhere (as far as I remember, she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before Infinity War), but it’s the last movie before the climactic, era-ending Avengers: Endgame. She is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against Thanos, the bad guy who I dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment. So, while I was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action, I was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from Phase One. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what I got. Everything is fine. Just okay. There’s no exceptional fight scene, but most of it is decent. There’s no visual wonder, but it doesn’t look bad. The characters’ potential feels wasted, but they work for the plot. Everything is frustratingly balanced, which is something I would praise in a bunch of other movies, but this isn’t 2008 anymore. Marvel isn’t starting its cinematic universe, it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments! I’m going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about: Goose … Sorry, Captain Marvel!  Jokes aside, this is one of the issues I was worried about going into the film theater. I escaped 99% of the marketing for this movie as I do with every other flick. I didn’t watch a single clip/trailer, I know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and I kept my expectations realistic having in mind what I truly know about the film and only the film itself. The one thing I was not able to hide from was the headlines giving tremendous praise to… a cat.  Now, follow me on this: I’m going to watch a superhero origin movie. A whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen. I’m excited to know more about her, where does she come from, what her powers are and so much more. Some headlines show up on my social media feed, and I find that a CAT “steals the show,” “deserves a spin-off,” and I don’t even know what more. Granted, the cat is indeed funny. It provides some chuckles here and there. That’s it. I love cats, but I honestly can’t figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things. Maybe it’s because the rest of the film isn’t that entertaining… or perhaps just because people really, really love cats. Like the movie itself, I think it’s a mixture of both options. Back to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about: Brie Larson. Marvel rarely misses its casting choices, and being Larson an Academy-Award winner, her talent is undeniable. She has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance, so I’m surprised that she couldn’t stand out from the film’s overall blandness. I repeat, the movie isn’t bad, at all. However, I was expecting an actress of Brie Larson‘s caliber to elevate, at least, her own character, but she’s like everyone else: just good enough. I don’t know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions, but the potential is there, and I’m sure the Russo Brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in Endgame. The two best attributes of the entire film are, without a single doubt, the buddy-cop relationship that Carol and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) develop, and the groundbreaking de-aging CGI. Story-wise, the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear. Carol‘s past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition, so it’s a breath of fresh air to have SLJ and Larson play off of each other. Nevertheless, the de-aging technology used is absolutely astounding. My fellow readers, welcome to the future of filmmaking, where any actor/actress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing. I completely forgot SLJ is 70-years-old! The best visual effects/CGI are the ones you don’t even know they’re there and Captain Marvel succeeds in delivering mind-blowing, realistic, younger versions of well-known actors. Character-wise, Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet should have done way better. So much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the MCU. Carol Danvers has a great backstory, but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact. Still, as Captain Marvel, she is indeed a badass woman! There are some cool action sequences, especially in the beginning, but as the movie slowly progresses on its story, the fight scenes got more sloppy, choppy, and way too dark. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) is amazing as he always is, and Ben Mendelsohn is brilliant as Talos. Both characters have interesting subplots that come together well, which is not something that can be said for the rest of the Marvel “villains.” Technically … You guessed it, it’s okay! Taking away the jaw-dropping de-aging CGI, the visuals seem to lack some sort of style. Looking back at Black Panther, Captain America, or Guardians of the Galaxy, each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to its own stories. Captain Marvel doesn’t really feel like it has its own style. I truly feel that with other directors, this film could have been way better. Boden and Fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers, but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster. That said, the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movie’s period. There are a couple of moments where the VFX regarding Carol Danvers‘ powers are spectacular, but everything ultimately feels like this is a Phase One film, instead of the 21st MCU installment. All in all, Captain Marvel achieves the minimum requirements: introduce the fans to a new superhero, who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of Thanos. Carol Danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory, but the screenplay isn’t structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible. Brie Larson delivers a strong performance, pushing aside her haters, even if I feel that under other directors, she would have reached her character’s full potential. Her scenes with Samuel L. Jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie, as well as the groundbreaking de-aging CGI, which is absolutely mind-blowing. The action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography (this is MCU‘s Phase Three and 2019, so I want to be able to actually see what’s happening), but the most prominent “issue” is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin film’s formula. This isn’t exactly a flaw or a problem, it’s just that I was expecting more. A lot more.  In the end, there’s not a memorable fight scene, an emotionally overwhelming moment, or even a genuinely bone-chilling, epic scene. It doesn’t leave you salivating for Avengers: Endgame, but it also doesn’t leave you less excited. Everything is just… fine. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But there’s also nothing extraordinary."
"Mar 31, 2023",positive," It might not be labeled a vintage year, but 2019 delivered some of the biggest and best movies ever made. We got emotional about Booksmart and Marriage Story, but the year also saw a little film called Avengers: Endgame steamroll the box office and nab the title of highest-grossing movie of all time (it was also one of the most expensive movies ever made). This Christmas, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker caps off the space sequel trilogy that began with The Force Awakens, followed by The Last Jedi, also known as the one Adam Driver forgot the name of. The Irishman saw unprecedented viewing figures on Netflix (according to Netflix), and the brilliant Korean ""comedy"" Parasite reminded us to watch movies outside Hollywood. If I had to pick the essential movie of the year, I'd probably go for the scathing The Report, a piece of real-life big-screen reportage that radiates rage. But I can pick what I like, and I pick Beats. I saw Brian Welsh's Scotland-set coming-of-age rave movie at a parent and baby screening. It was the first time my wife and I left our house with our 5-day-old newborn daughter. Beats is a heartwarming and hilarious film about friendship and belonging and music, which are exactly the kind of values I want to instil in my kid. So even in a year when I visited the set of Shaun the Sheep and bumped into Martin Scorsese in a bathroom -- these were separate events, obvs -- seeing Beats with my beautiful baby daughter remains my favorite movie memory of 2019. Hereditary, Ari Aster's debut, was a movie dialed in to the subconscious horrors of the nuclear family. Midsommar is disguised as a slasher film set among Swedish cultists, but it's essentially a slow-burn drama about the terrors of Florence Pugh's slowly decaying relationship. It's visceral, inventive and -- most importantly -- savagely honest. Anyone who's been in a bad relationship, or even argued with their partner, will recognize the aching realness of Midsommar's human interactions. That combined with the literal acid trip of its final act, which delves into horrifying (and surprisingly funny) Lynchian nightmare territory, has stayed with me ever since. I doubt it'll ever leave. That final shot. Of that one character just… smiling. After sitting through roughly 59 hours of Marvel movies over the past decade, I'm exhausted by same-same sequels and popcorn blockbusters. Tired arcs, cliched beats -- I've been grinding through a cinematic universe that no longer delights me. So, looking for something different, I took a punt on The Farewell and found my film of the year. The film follows Chinese-American Billi Wang (Awkwafina) who is living in New York when she learns her aging grandmother Nai Nai has been diagnosed with cancer back in China. But the diagnosis comes with another blow -- the family is hiding the cancer from Nai Nai in a bid to shield her from grief. The movie effortlessly jumps between worlds: America and China, English slang and Mandarin, snort-out-loud humor and pure pathos. It paints such a vivid picture of the interplay (and friction) between cultures that comes with the immigrant experience. That's not an experience I know, but as an Australian living in America at the time, it spoke to me. I left the cinema with an exploding heart -- I missed my own grandmother, I was longing for family, my cheeks were sore from laughing, and I felt lifted by a story I never expected to find. That's the joy of the perfect film. The second installment in 
  Disney
's Frozen juggernaut proves that animated movies -- and sequels -- can still make best-of lists. Frozen 2 felt like the story Disney actually wanted to tell with Anna and Elsa. It was so strong and compelling that it made the first Frozen feel like a prequel that existed to set up the second movie. Frozen 2 has a seriously talented cast (the infamous Samantha joke was even an improv by Josh Gad, who voices Olaf). With the voices of Kristen Bell as Anna, Idina Menzel as Elsa, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff and Evan Rachel Wood as Queen Iduna, we also get amazing songs like Into The Unknown, Some Things Never Change, Show Yourself and of course Lost in the Woods. They're easily on par with Let It Go, Do You Want to Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever. To me, Booksmart is the definitive coming-of-age movie. It's hilarious, charming and real. Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein are absolute powerhouses and you can just feel their love and friendship through the screen and it makes your heart feel warm. Every cringey moment and situation is relatable without feeling forced. Billie Lourd ascends to legendary levels with her bewildering Gigi. Director Olivia Wilde allows each super-awesome cast member to shine in their own weird way and it just works. I think Letterboxd member ""Jay"" said it perfectly: ""Olivia didn't have to Wilde out this hard."" But she did. She did that for us. And I am thankful. Parasite will move you like nothing else. The latest feature from Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Okja) starts almost as a con movie, allows you some laughs, portrays an unconventional family you want to spend more time with, takes a quick detour toward horror and ends up being a drama that delivers barbed commentary on class. It gives us a glimpse of how privilege and background can shape who we are or what we're capable of. This is a film that's best enjoyed if you don't know much about its plot. It's a story that will stay with you for days and days, and it's pretty much a given that Parasite will win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. If only it could win the biggest prize of the night too. There aren't many movies that can inspire me to get off the couch and train for a 5-kilometer run. But Brittany Runs a Marathon isn't a typical movie. It's the story of a 28-year-old woman who parties hard, makes bad choices with men, has bad eating habits and pretty much drifts through her life in New York without a game plan. Until one day, amid an attempt to score a prescription for Adderall, she gets a wake-up call about her health. After reluctantly trying running for the first time, she eventually grows in confidence. That leads to a better outlook on life, a better job and better fitting clothes. But this isn't a rom-com about losing weight and falling in love with the first guy who notices you. Brittany finds that dropping pounds is a lot easier than dropping her insecurities and self-loathing. For anyone who has suffered through endless fad diets with zero results -- this movie will change your life for the better. There's a lot to like about a superhero flick that features a powerful, self-sufficient, smart, courageous woman -- especially since until recently (thank you, Wonder Woman), there were too few of them to even talk about. Captain Marvel does its part to showcase the challenges that Carol Danvers, a fearless, self-sufficient, courageous Navy pilot, has to deal with as a woman. She shares those challenges with her best friend and fellow pilot, Maria Rambeau, which means the movie handily passes the Bechdel Test. But Captain Marvel isn't one of my 2019 favorite films just because it gets girls and women right, showing you can be strong and emotional and still kick butt. It's because Captain Marvel is a great story. We get well-thought-out characters played by an engaging cast, fun action scenes set to a cool '90s soundtrack and a sense of humor. Captain Marvel is a fearless, self-sufficient and courageous, fighting for what's right. That's the stuff that superheroes are made of. And how great that in 2019, she's a woman. Ready or Not isn't the best movie of the year, but it's the most enjoyable horror of the year. (Midsommar is stunning but definitely not enjoyable.) That's because it's a perfect 95-minute bundle of black comedy and thriller contained in a big stooping manor. The setup is simple: Grace marries into a family that's rich and privileged and naturally super-weird. They have a ritual for newbies: You have to play a game. And in this case it's hide and seek with hunting weapons. It's the literal wedding from hell. A vein of social commentary on class and marriage runs through the cat-and-mouse hunt before building to a cathartic ending. Extreme coolness exudes from Grace in her ripped dress, Converse shoes and big rude sash of bullets. Just don't watch this if you're about to get married. The Lighthouse is an absurd comedy. It's a slow, anguished descent into madness. It's the result of Andrew Wyeth dropping acid, reading Lovecraft and spending too much time on a Maine coastline. It's a film that lingers in the corner of your mind as you find yourself wondering how the hell they shot certain parts, replaying monologues and drunken arguments in your head, resurfacing shots that perfectly pair the repulsive and beautiful. It doesn't invite you to its world or ask to accurately reflect ours. It reaches out from the depths, grabs you by the neck and drags you down to its lair. Whether you enjoyed the film or not, you'll always remember it. Fart, fart... fart. The Lighthouse was filmed in a square aspect ratio. It's the perfect prison for two men as they watch over a New England lighthouse. Fart. When you confine two people in a small space, there's not a lot of room for secrets, lust, fights, hallucinations, kinship or farts. And even though the film is black-and-white, the men are hundreds of shades of gray and salt. Over time, such confinement can make any sane man question reality. Yeah, you could go outside, but you'll be cold and wet. And before you go up top, just remember that the light is mine. Hang on. Am I going mad watching the movie? Are the characters? And why is there so much farting? I'll just have another sip of this turpentine wine and relax. Fart. I didn't see a lot of movies in 2019 (too much great TV, dammit!), but I'm so glad I managed to catch this in a theater. Danny Boyle's little slice of fantasy is the kind of movie that rarely gets made anymore. Yesterday is wholly original and utterly charming, bolstered by music that's woven into our collective DNA. It's funny, romantic, thought-provoking and ultimately just one of the most satisfying movies in years. And without spoiling anything, I'll just say there's a late moment that caught me totally off guard and left me wrecked. Note to superhero-soaked Hollywood: More like this, please! Quentin Tarantino's journey from directing fast-talking crime flicks to subversive genre pics to history-rewriting revenge porn has had its ups and downs. But Once Upon a Time represents the apotheosis of the filmmaker's late phase. Rather than simply rewriting history for the sake of some pseudo-cathartic climax (shooting Hitler or killing a plantation-owner), Tarantino stays with the central characters after the ""bad guys"" have been offed, and shows the very real people -- full of dreams, hope and love -- that might have been spared had history taken an alternative route. The end feels mournful, but it also shows the power of film not just to enact bloody justice, but also to save, if only for a moment, those who have been lost to great injustice. It was the first movie ever from the director to move me to tears. Clare, a young Irish convict, chases a British officer through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness. She is bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence the man committed against her family. To aid her search, Clare enlists the services of an Aboriginal tracker named Billy, who is marked by trauma from his own violence-filled past at the hands of British colonialism. There are moments of loss and redemption, of anger and anguish. I found myself yelling at the screen, crying with the characters and smiling during their rare moments of joy. The Nightingale beautifully illustrates the spectrum of humanity and what human beings are truly capable of -- the atrocities we commit as well as the indefinite well of strength we never knew we could muster. The cinematography, the dialogue and the performances of the actors highlight those innumerable events in history which should never be forgotten nor forgiven. From the opening frame, The Last Black Man in San Francisco drops you right into its world and keeps you there, simply because you want to watch the characters, whose rich inner lives unfold with a gentle and masterful ease. The drama touches on serious themes, ranging from gentrification to environmental racism, interspersed with absurdist comedy.  Every frame is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the acting is beautiful, the camerawork is beautiful. It's perfectly crafted top to bottom, inside and out.  I can't recommend it enough. When a best-selling author of detective novels is found dead the morning after his birthday, you're left wondering if a tale is too on-the-nose for its own good. Knives Out flips the whodunnit tropes of whimsical murder mysteries (fans of Clue and Murder on the Orient Express, please raise your hands) by giving you more details up front than you might expect. It subsequently leaves you guessing for the remainder of the film just how all the pieces fit together and possibly resemble a coherent picture. Pair that with the fantastic Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Chris Evans trying desperately to hang on to their family fortune and you're in for an intense and hilarious series of events. You'll be hooked from the moment the accused tries to awkwardly cover their tracks but you'll stay for Daniel Craig leaning so far into his incredible Southern accent that you're not sure whether you're watching a movie or are in fact inside the hole that is this mystery's donut... within a donut... within a donut? I haven't been through a divorce myself, but I'm even more motivated to be a better husband after watching Marriage Story. Noah Baumbach has made some excellent films (Squid and the Whale, The Meyerowitz Stories), but Marriage Story might be my new favorite of his. It's clearly an actor's film, as Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deliver Oscar-worthy performances in a film with almost no plot. What I like most about Marriage Story is how grounded the story feels. Unlike other films tackling the subject of divorce, both characters in Marriage Story are equally likable. Not only that, the characters clearly like each other, making the process they're struggling through even harder to watch. I couldn't find myself rooting for one over the other, as both characters are as flawed as they are charming. Marriage Story feels like the most honest insight into the divorce process I've ever seen on film, but it's also one of the most realistic portrayals of two characters falling out of love. If The Return of the King can receive all the praise as a culmination of an epic trilogy, then so should Avengers: Endgame. The feat alone of taking 22 films and piecing them together in a perfectly produced climatic event is simply staggering to think of. Endgame came up with an ingenious plot to revisit past movies and show how far the 
  MCU
 has come, while also creating this Ocean's Eleven-type heist to save Earth. For all the criticism some give to comic book movies for not taking risk, just think of the risk that was taken in 2008 with Iron Man -- a movie about a barely known superhero starring a supposedly washed-up actor. To see Marvel's cinematic universe start there and last for more than a decade is mind-boggling."
"Mar 8, 2023",positive," Synopsis: Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe’s most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. Captain Marvel is the origin story of Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) or Vers (pronounced Veers), a member of the Kree Starforce with no memory of her past and some interesting super powers. Her team of warrior-heroes is tasked with ridding the galaxy of the terrorist, shape-shifting Skrulls and their leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). During one of their missions she is separated from her team, ends up on Earth, and begins to learn more about herself and her powers. The film also reintroduces us to known MCU characters like Ronin the Destroyer (Lee Pace) and one of his future henchmen Korath (Djimon Hounsou) from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. We also get to see a younger Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and new-ish S.H.I.E.L.D. I am so happy with the casting of Brie Larson, she met all my expectations. Sadly, I’m not too familiar with her prior work, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect (I will remedy that shorty). Larson expertly portrayed the Carol Danvers I’m familiar with from the comics. She was snarky and tough, and a perfect counterpart to Nick Fury. They had some awesome buddy cop / Men in Black vibes going on. Her characters growth throughout the film was relatable and fun to watch. I loved all the little details Brie Larson put into the character. The film has a message of embracing who you are and perseverance- get back up, don’t give up even if everyone is telling you to. I think it’s an excellent “girl power” movie, while also being a good superhero movie. It’s not an in-your-face feminism, just for girls film, I think anyone can enjoy it. The supporting cast was also great, especially Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn. I’ve decided I’m a Ben Mendelsohn fan for life and have to go out and watch everything he’s ever been in or will be in. I also liked Jude Law as Kree commander Yon-Rogg and Lashana Lynch as awesome pilot and Danver’s bff Maria Rambeau. I think everyone will agree that the true star of this film is Goose, an adorable orange cat. She (Yes Goose is female in the movie and in the comics) manages to share the screen with Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson and still stand out. The movie also has lots of fun things to try and spot. It’s filled with 90s nostalgia and takes place sometime between the release of True Lies and The Smashing Pumpkins’ Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. There are also comic book references sprinkled throughout the movie. There are two huge, but subtle, hints at another awesome female character potentially making an appearance in future MCU films. Another positive for me was the music. The score was appropriately epic and the use of cleverly timed 90s tracks was fun and also added something extra to the film, especially the action sequences. It made me think of all my favorite action movies from the 90s, but with much better special effects. I’m a fan of the MCU and the comics, so I did not want to be disappointed by Marvel’s first female led film. I had a few questions and expectations going into this movie- Is this going to be a good stand-alone film, or will the viewer need 10 years of MCU backstory to understand what’s going on? Will Captain Marvel give us hope or any clue into what is going to happen in Avengers: Endgame? Does it live up to the comics? Thankfully, it answered most of my questions and fulfilled my expectations. First, the film 100% stands on its own; you don’t really need any prior MCU knowledge to enjoy it. It obviously helps, and there are inside jokes and things to look for, but it’s not required. It doesn’t give us any clues as to what’s going to happen in Avengers: Endgame but seeing Captain Marvel’s powers on-screen definitely has me excited and even more impatient to see how things with the Avengers pan out. I did have a few complaints. There are some continuity issues this film creates within the MCU. One in particular (a certain valuable object makes an appearance) is perhaps unnecessary and I’m not sure why they did it other than to bring in an element fans were familiar with. The Kree were also confusing and I don’t think they explained their lifestyle or society very well. The beginning of the film is jumpy and it’s hard to follow what’s going on and who’s who. It does get better when Fury shows up. None of these things were “bad” enough to make me dislike the movie. I also saw this at an Alamo Drafthouse theater, they show short relevant clips and movies in the 20 minutes before a movie starts. For this film they used that time to explain the history and many variations of Mar-Vell, Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel, and Shazam. I think that was beneficial, especially if you haven’t read any comics. To wrap up, I loved Captain Marvel. It gave me almost everything I wanted and introduced us to an amazing new character. It was fun and inspiring and gave me lots of fuzzy 90s nostalgic feelings. I can’t wait to see her in Avengers: Endgame later this year. If you do see this in the theater, make sure to stay until the very end of the credits."
"Jan 21, 2023",positive," One of the most prominent gifs from the Captain Marvel trailer features Carol getting up over and over again through the years. Fist clenched, knocked down but not staying there, pushing up against the weight of everything and everyone trying to keep her down.  Captain Marvel had a lot stacked up against it before its release, and honestly, the character of Carol Danvers has had a lot stacked up against it since she took on the mantle in 2012. Just like with Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel is expected to be the pinnacle of feminism and appeal to every woman or she is not doing her job right. The movie is expected to wildly succeed because performing on par with other origin movies will be deemed a failure. It’s expected to “prove” that 10 years into Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe a female superhero “deserves” to star in her own movie. To be progressive despite being late. To be diverse and inclusive but not too in your face about the messaging. To change the minds of those who go in looking for reasons to hate the movie on principle. Odds are stacked up designed to make sure everyone is extra conscious of every reaction. Don’t want to be seen as hyping up too much just because it’s a woman front and center. Don’t want to criticize too hard and give ammo to those who see inclusion as a threat. With all of that going on it can be hard to let go and evaluate Captain Marvel on its own merit, to remember that it’s ok to both want something to succeed and be critical of it. There’s no mistaking it, Captain Marvel is very much an origin story set deep into the layers of movies that make up the MCU. Writer and director duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck reportedly had a lot of free reign to introduce Carol (Brie Larson) but her story is inextricably linked to setting up her appearance in Avengers: Endgame. By nature, origin stories tend to be formulaic and a little messy. The best ones happen when the character has already been introduced elsewhere so there’s less to establish in the limited time given to introduce the character, have them struggle, experience a betrayal, learn who they are without their powers and ultimately triumph. It’s a story all genre fans know and Captain Marvel doesn’t deviate far from it. In this case, we see our hero the alien planet Hala, home of the Kree. She doesn’t know who she is and would rather fight than dwell on that. Part of an elite team, Starforce, under the command of Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and known only as Vers, all she wants to do is kick some Skrull butt as the Kree-Skrull War wages on. Captured on a mission and learning that in her memories lies something the Skrull want, Vers ends up on Earth circa 1995 on a journey to the past Anastasia-style. She meets new and old friends and learns who she can trust and remembers that at her core, powers or no, she gets up again, as always. The key to getting through origin stories is the characters and Captain Marvel has no problems there. Brie Larson is an absolute force. Her Carol is messy, emotional, fierce, and determined. She connects with just about every character. Unfortunately, Gemma Chan’s under-utilized Minn-Erva isn’t a fan of Carol’s but she can’t win them all. She is very much the total disaster she is in the comics come to life.  Too often women-led movies mean one woman surrounded by a bunch of men but here Lashana Lynch slays as Carol’s fellow pilot and childhood best friend Maria Rambeau. She is her equal in every way that doesn’t involve firing photon blasts from her hands, Rambeau stands strong with the not quite yet legendary Captain Marvel and Nick Fury, for whom this is also a sort of origin story for. The computerized de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson sure is something and the banter between the young Fury and the amnesiac Carol is delightful. The two real scene stealers though are Akira Akbar as Monica Rambeau, Carol’s longtime friend in the comics and Maria’s daughter in the movie, and Goose the (sort of) cat.  The back and forth between space and 1995 Earth invokes a lot of 90s sci-fi nostalgia and the soundtrack is another star on its own. It is as integral to the movie as that of Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack to its own movie. There are a lot of moving parts to the plot that don’t quite all slot together seamlessly and the amnesia storyline hampers some emotional moments. Luckily, the fun and charm of the characters and excitement of the setting make it so that’s not as big a deal as it would be with a less engaging cast, at least while watching the movie itself. Because that moment in all origin stories that makes it all worth it? The one where the hero has their big realization and fully embraces themselves? That moment where we see Captain Marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly? That moment Captain Marvel absolutely delivers. There are a lot of moving parts to the plot that don’t quite all slot together seamlessly and the amnesia storyline hampers some emotional moments. Luckily, the fun and charm of the characters and excitement of the setting make it so that’s not as big a deal as it would be with a less engaging cast, at least while watching the movie itself.

"Dec 7, 2022",positive," Based on the international bestseller by Neil Gaiman, “American Gods” is an epic battle between the Old Gods and the New Gods. Led by Odin (traveling incognito as Mr. Wednesday and played by the rakish Ian McShane), the Old Gods have migrated to America from around the world. Led by Mr. World (a chilling Crispin Glover), the New Gods reflect modern society’s obsession with money, technology, and mass media.  When Season One of “American Gods” premiered on STARZ last year. LGBT viewers were delightfully surprised to find an intimate and tender gay love story in the middle of Episode Three (newcomers can find it on YouTube). The hapless salesman Salim (Omid Abtahi) gets in a cab driven by the Jinn (Mousa Kraish) and the two are instantly attracted to each other. The sizzling sex scene that followed was both graphic (including full frontal nudity) and deeply moving.  Salim and the Jinn go their own separate ways after their one-night stand, but LGBT fans will be pleased to know that they are reunited at the start of Season Two and embark on a heroic quest to find the magical spear Gangnir. In fact, a segment of their touching reunion scene is included in the season trailer. Fans of Season One will be pleased to know that the second season maintains the high production standards and rather trippy sensibility of the first season. The color-saturated cinematography and design are dazzling and sometimes wonderfully lurid. The pacing is rather deliberate (the show is still only partway through Gaiman’s book, but Gaiman has been closely involved in the adaptation and alterations of his original story) and the dialogue is frequently loopy, but the actors and directors all know how to make the most of every moment. “Captain Marvel,” ranked as the most highly anticipated release of 2019, zooms into theaters today. It’s the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but only the first to star a female character. Even though it doesn’t get everything right, the movie is a fun and fresh take on the superhero genre. It’s amazing what happens when women and people of color take center stage. Set in 1995, and loaded with wonderful pop culture references, the movie is both an origin story and a mystery. Written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (with Geneva Robinson-Dworet also receiving screenplay credit), the movie opens with “Vers” (the excellent Brie Larson) training to be a Kree warrior. She’s haunted by dreams of her past but is fully committed to helping the highly regimented Kree in their galactic battle against the shape-shifting Skrull. Vers ends up on Planet C-23 (aka Earth) and slowly starts gathering clues about her real identity (Air Force pilot Carol Danvers) and learning how to harness her superpowers to become Captain Marvel. In a neat twist, she becomes a true superhero by embracing her human emotions. The movie is strongest, freshest and most interesting when it focuses on the mystery of Vers’ identity and her evolving relationships with the other characters. Those moments look great and crackle with both humor and emotion. Unfortunately, some of the outer space sequences look and feel like they’ve been phoned in. Brie Larson, who won an Oscar for her powerful performance in “Room,” is a wonderful addition to the superhero pantheon. She brings a fierce determination, aching vulnerability and sly sense of humor to the character and it’s great fun to cheer her on. Larson is surrounded by a great supporting cast. She has a lively rapport Samuel L. Jackson (Agent Nick Fury) and their banter is wonderful. To maintain continuity with present-day Marvel outings, both Jackson and Clark Gregg are digitally “de-aged” by twenty-five years and the results are incredible. Their digital transformation is seamless. Annette Bening finally gets a role worthy of her stellar talents: the Supreme Intelligence. Like Frank Morgan in “The Wizard of Oz,” she plays several characters and appears in different guises to different people. She’s stunning and badass and the key to unraveling the fascinating twists and turns and shifting alliances of the unfolding story.  There are also fine performances by Lashana Lynch as Danver’s best friend Maria Rambeau (Rambo – get it?) Jude Law as Kree commander Yon-Rogg and Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull warrior Talos and various humans, but they are all upstaged by a captivating cat named Goose (one of many “Top Gun” references). Both “American Gods” and “Captain Marvel” are fun reconsiderations of ancient myths and modern mythologies. They raise interesting questions about power, belief, gender and sexuality, and history and the power of storytelling, but both take themselves lightly. They’re great popcorn fodder, but they’ll leave you with something to think about after the credits roll. By the way, make sure you stay for the credits of “Captain Marvel.” The fun doesn’t stop until after the last digital technician is acknowledged.  It might come as a shock to some comic book fans, but the idea of super heroes and super villains has always been very queer. Think about it: the dramatic skin-tight costumes, the dual identities and secret lives, the inability to fit in or connect because you are distanced from the “normal” world by your powers  – all the standard tropes that define this genre of pop culture myth-making are so rich with obviously queer-coded subtext that it seems ludicrous to think anyone could miss it. This is not to claim that all superhero stories are really parables about being queer, but, if we’re being honest some of them feel more like it than others; an obvious example is “Batman,” whose domestic life with a teenage boy as his “ward” and close companion has been raising eyebrows since 1940. The campy 1960s TV series did nothing to distance the character from such associations – probably the opposite, in fact – and Warner Brothers’ popular ‘80s-’90s series of film adaptations with gay filmmaker Joel Schumacher’s much-maligned “Batman and Robin,” starring George Clooney and Chris O’Donnell in costumes that highlighted their nipples, which is arguably still the queerest superhero movie ever made. Or at least it was. That title might now have to be transferred to “The People’s Joker,” which – as it emphatically and repeatedly reminds us – is a parody in no way affiliated with DC’s iconic “Batman” franchise or any of its characters, even though writer, director and star Vera Drew begins it with a dedication to “Mom and Joel Schumacher.” Parody it may be, but that doesn’t keep it from also serving up lots of food for serious thought to chew on between the laughs. Set in a sort of comics-inspired dystopian meta-America where unsanctioned comedy is illegal, it’s the story of a young, closeted transgender comic (Drew) who leaves her small town home to travel to Gotham City and audition for “GCB” – the official government-produced sketch comedy show. Unfortunately, she’s not a very good comic, and after a rocky start she decides to leave to form a new comedy troupe (labeled “anti-comedy” to skirt legality issues) along with penguin-ish new friend Oswald Cobblepot (Nathan Faustyn). They collect an assortment of misfit would-be comedians to join them, and after branding herself as “Joker the Harlequin,” our protagonist starts to find her groove – but it will take negotiating a relationship with trans “bad boy” Mr. J (Kane Distler), a confrontation with her self-absorbed and transphobic mother (Lynn Downey), and making a choice between playing by the rules or breaking them before she can fully transition into the militant comic activist she was always meant to be. Told as a wildly whimsical, mixed media narrative that combines live action with a quirky CGI production design and  multiple styles of animation (with different animators for each sequence), “People’s Joker” is by no means the kind of big-budget blockbuster we expect from a superhero — or in this case, supervillain — film, but it should be obvious from the synopsis above that’s not what Drew was going for, anyway. Instead, the Emmy-nominated former editor uses her loopy vision of an alternative “Batman” universe as the medium for a kind of mythologized autobiography, expressing her own real-life journey, both toward embracing her trans identity and forging a maverick career path in an industry discourages nonconformity, while also spoofing the absurdities of modern culture. Subverting familiar tropes, yet skillfully weaving together multiple threads from the “real” DC Universe she’s appropriated with the detailed savvy of a die-hard fangirl, it’s an accomplishment likely to impress her fellow comic book fans — even if they can’t quite get behind the gender politics or her presentation ot Batman himself (or rather, an animated version voiced by Phil Braun) as a closeted gay right-wing demagogue and serial sexual abuser. These elements, of course, are meant to be deliberately provocative. Drew, like her screen alter ego, is a confrontation comedian at heart, bent on shaking up the dominant paradigm at every opportunity. Yet although she takes aim at the expected targets – the patriarchy, toxic masculinity, corporate hypocrisy, etc. – she is equally adept at scoring hits against things like draconian ideals of political correctness and weaponized “cancel culture”, which are deployed with no quarter from idealogues on both sides of the political divide. This means she might be risking the alienation of an audience which might otherwise be fully in her corner – but it also provides the ring of unbiased personal truth that keeps the movie from sliding into propaganda and elevates it, like “Barbie”, to the level of absurdist allegory. Because ultimately, of course, the point of “People’s Joker” has little to do with the politics and social constructs it skewers along the way; at its core, it’s all about the real human things that resonate with all of us, regardless of gender, sexuality, ideology, or even political parties: the need to feel loved, to feel supported, and most of all, to be fully actualized. That means the real heart of the film beats in the central thread of her troubled connection between mother and daughter, superbly rendered in both Drew and Downey’s performances, and it’s there that Joker is finally able to break free of her own self-imposed restrictions and simply “be” who she is. Other performances deserve mention, too, such as Faustyn’s weirdly lovable “Penguin” stand-in and Outsider multi-hyphenate David Leibe Hart as Ra’s al Ghul – a seminal “Batman” villain here reimagined as a veteran comic that serves as a kind of Obi-Wan Kenobi figure in Joker’s quest. In the end, though, it’s Drew’s show from top to bottom, a showcase for not only her acting skills, which are enhanced by the obvious intelligence (including the emotional kind) she brings to the table, but her considerable talents as a writer, director, and editor. For some viewers, admittedly, the low-budget vibe of this crowd-funded film might create an obstacle to appreciating the cleverness and artistic vision behind it, though Drew leans into the limitations to find remarkably creative ways to convey what she wants with the means she has at her disposal. Others, obviously will have bigger problems with it than that. Indeed, the film, which debuted at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, was withdrawn from competition there and pulled from additional festival screenings after alleged corporate bullying (presumably from Warner Brothers, which owns the film rights to the Batman franchise) pressured Drew into pulling it back. Clearly, concern over blowback from conservative fans – who would likely never see the film anyway – was enough to warrant strong arm techniques from nervous execs. Nevertheless, “The People’s Joker” made its first American appearance at LA’s Outfest in 2023, and is now receiving a rollout theatrical release that started on April 5 in New York, and continues this week in Los Angeles, with Washington DC and other cities to follow on April 12 and beyond. If you’re in one of the places where it plays, we say it’s more than worth making the effort. If you’re not, never fear. A VOD/streaming release is sure to come soon.  There’s something about an anti-hero that appeals to us all. Why else would so many of our greatest stories revolve around a character whose behavior goes against everything we’ve been raised to believe is right? Actually, that question probably answers itself. For many of us, the things we are raised to accept about life in the human world often feel less acceptable once we’ve gone through a few years of adult experience, which tends to put us at odds with the so-called “norms” of conformity. Naturally, this can be frustrating from time to time – and while that might not be enough to make us go “rogue” without regard law or ethics, it’s certainly sufficient to fuel our guilty fantasies. That, along with the literary skills of Patricia Highsmith, the queer novelist who created him, is why the character of Tom Ripley has been engrossing us in various forms for nearly 75 years. The eponymous anti-hero of “The Talented Mr. Ripley” (originally published in 1955) went on to feature in three additional books by Highsmith, and was subsequently brought to life in multiple small-and-big-screen incarnations, perhaps most prominently by Matt Damon in Anthony Minghella’s 1999 film adaptation. These versions managed to skirt the book’s obvious queer subtext, but queer audiences recognized it anyway. Now, thanks to creator, writer, and director Steve Zaillian, Highsmith’s starry-eyed sociopath has returned in an eight-episode series – which pares the title down to the short-but-evocative “Ripley” – that debuts on Netflix April 4, and portrays his adventures with an eye toward honoring Highsmith’s intent while delivering the kind of up-front queerness that the author could never have dreamed of accomplishing in her heyday. Not that this “Ripley” is exactly “out and proud,” though the actor who plays him – Andrew Scott (“All of Us Strangers”) – certainly is. The acclaimed Irish thespian brings his own queerness to the table in illuminating a character whose survival depends on never calling attention to himself – and though the series moves the action ahead a few years to1960, it’s still a world where any hint of “deviance” is likely to draw suspicion. That’s the last thing Tom Ripley needs; he’s a con artist, the mid-20th-century equivalent of modern-day “phishing” scammers, grifting gullible marks from his squalid, one-room New York City apartment. He’s good at what he does, an anonymous figure hiding in a sea of strangers – but when a wealthy shipping magnate tracks him down with a request for help and the offer of an all-expenses-paid excursion to Italy, he sees it as an opportunity to change his life for the better. That opportunity, as it turns out, involves a barely remembered college acquaintance named Dickie (Johnny Flynn), whose post-graduation trip to Europe has become a years-long vacation on the Mediterranean coast from which his father – Ripley’s surprise benefactor – would like him to return. Sent on a mission to convince his old schoolmate to go home, he is instead spellbound by the idyllic seaside setting and opulent lifestyle that surrounds him – and also by Dickie himself. He ingratiates himself into the young man’s life, winning his sympathies despite some initial awkwardness. Not so easily persuaded is Dickie’s girlfriend, Marge (Dakota Fanning), whose lingering distrust must be overcome if Ripley is to enact his new master plan to claim Dickie’s life of expatriate luxury as his own. Thanks to its source’s relative familiarity, “Ripley” makes no effort to hide the fact that its anti-hero is a shady guy; we see from the start that he’s a liar and an opportunist. What Zaillian manages to do, unlike others who have adapted the novel, is move past a clinical focus on Ripley’s psychology to give us a less prosaic – and therefore more complex – interpretation of the character. Much of this comes from a script that echoes Highsmith’s hard-boiled style by framing the story (and its protagonist) in a shadowy, amoral universe, enhanced by the stylish black-and-white treatment delivered by Robert Elswit’s cinematography, which leans into both the paradigm-challenging Euro “art cinema” from the period of its setting and the gritty chiaroscuro contrasts of film noir, setting up an instinctual understanding that this narrative, like its visuals, is composed entirely in shades of gray. In the show’s engrossing first episode, this is a particularly effective hook, style coupling with context to underscore the bleakness of Ripley’s daily routine in New York, which is no less soul-crushing, perhaps, than the more lawful ones into which most of us are locked. Though we see that he’s a predator, it’s hard not to relate to his struggle, and by the time we get to the next chapter and meet Dickie and Marge, we’ve already entered a mindset in which easy ethical judgments become unconvincing and shallow. Our sympathies are effectively split; we’re either on nobody’s side or on everyone’s, and maybe it’s a little bit of both. Needless to say, perhaps, this tricky transference would not be possible without the presence of a consummate actor in the title role, and Scott fits the bill beyond expectation. Though at first he reads as a bit old for the character, that notion quickly disperses – indeed, his weathered features bespeak the effects of a hard-knock life, the kind that makes a person willing to do anything to break free. More crucially, the unmistakable authenticity of his inner life is communicated with exquisite precision, engaging our empathy even as we recoil from the Machiavellian logic that guides him, and the clear conflict between his not-so-hidden feelings for Dickie and the agenda to which he has committed is made all the more stark by the ring of queer truth that underpins the performance. It’s a tour-de-force turn by an actor whose skills become more breathtaking with each subsequent role. Fanning, whose equally adept performance provides a powerful counterpoint to Scott’s, is a strong contender for our sympathies, by virtue as much of the intelligence she brings as the peril into which it will eventually put her, and Flynn’s Dickie wears the weight and damage of his upper class status like a chain he can never quite break, making us dread the seemingly inevitable fate that awaits him even as we subliminally sign on to Ripley’s endgame with a sense of guilty (but unapologetic) satisfaction. Also notable is nonbinary actor Eliot Summers (child of former Police frontman Sting), who brings another level of queer identity into the narrative as another old acquaintance of Dickie’s that throws an unwelcome wrench into the works of Ripley’s plan. Based on its first two episodes, “Ripley” certainly lives up to the anticipation that naturally awaits any adaptation of a high-profile story, and reasserts the queerness of an author who boldly pushed boundaries as far as censors of her time would allow. That’s more than enough to warrant staying with it until the end – and, if audience numbers warrant a renewal, through additional installments that might chronicle the less well-known escapades spun in Highsmith’s sequels. What cinches the deal, though, is the masterful performance that takes centerstage, which represents yet another escalation – and well-deserved triumph – in the rise of the talented Mr. Scott. Not only that, but a surprising number of these movies – more accurately described as “neo-noir” to distinguish them from the formative black-and-white classics in this murkiest of all genres – are also very queer. We’ve seen Ethan Coen’s Tarantino-esque darkly comic lesbian road trip “Drive-Away Dolls” and the UK drag queen revenge drama “Femme”; now, from sophomore director Rose Glass (“Saint Maud”) comes “Love Lies Bleeding,” which might be queerest of the bunch so far. It might be the “noir”-est, too; though there are a lot of vagaries around the characteristics that are required for applying that label, one of the most essential qualities is surely a morally ambiguous story. And morality can’t get much more ambiguous than it is in this retro-nostalgic throwback tale set on the fringes of the Albuquerque underworld of 1989. That’s where Lou (Kristen Stewart) has been for her entire life, and where she continues to stay – working as the manager of a run-down gym – out of protective loyalty to her sister Beth (Jena Malone), despite a longtime estrangement from her father (Ed Harris) and a desire to distance herself from the shadowy family “business” that he runs.  Reclusive and guarded, she mostly avoids social interaction – until an aspiring bodybuilder named Jackie (Katy O’Brian) hitchhikes into town on her way to a championship competition in Las Vegas and in need of a place to crash. There’s an instant spark between them, which quickly leads to flaming passion. Unfortunately, it also leads to an incident of explosive violence which puts both of them not only into the crosshairs of Lou’s ruthless and powerful dad, but those of the law as well. There’s no need to say more than that in terms of synopsis; in fact, it would be unfair to the film, which unfolds with an exquisitely slow burn before igniting into a climactic powder keg as satisfying as it is gripping, because so much of the thrill comes from the feeling of uneasy expectation it delivers through its gradual revelation of details. Even without knowing more, however, it’s clear that there’s a lot going on in “Love Lies Bleeding” that doesn’t quite line up with the comforting ethics of a black-and-white worldview – and that, of course, is what gives it the kind of unpredictable edge that makes it both a tautly engrossing thriller and a deliciously subversive saga of queer and feminine empowerment. This latter quality is something it shares with movies like “Bound” – the 1996 debut feature by the Wachowskis, which pushed mainstream acceptance by presenting its lesbian protagonists in a realistic manner and refusing to frame them in the then-usual trope of “queer victimhood” – and elevates to a refreshingly contemporary tone while still reveling in homage to the stylistic flourishes of their era.  Indeed, Glass peppers her film with echoes from dozens from the past that so clearly provided inspiration in both its visuals and its themes; from the twisted duplicity of Clouzot’s “Les Diaboliques” to the chaotic irony of the Coens’ “Blood Simple,” from the slick-but-gritty nihilism of William Friedkin to the disquieting body horror of David Cronenberg and the transcendental surrealism of David Lynch, “Love Lies Bleeding” borrows liberally and unapologetically from an array of cinematic touchstones almost as exhaustive as the one employed by Greta Gerwig in “Barbie” – and, like Gerwig, manages to incorporate them all in a sort of “metasphere” that allows our recognition of them to enhance and inform her own piece. Far from coming off as derivative, the effect is something akin to a “mash-up” of iconic eighties and nineties films and genres that uses their easy familiarity to both pay open tribute and tickle our nostalgic fancy, even as they are deployed as the building blocks for something with a singular identity of its own. If you think that all sounds a little campy, you’re not wrong; there’s a definite element of tongue-in-cheek self awareness that permeates it, and a deliberate will toward underscoring the grimness of its outward scenario with the sly satire of its subtext. That, after all, is something else it shares in common with many of the older films it draws upon, in which “coded” characters and plotlines often served as subtle lampoons of the absurdly conventional messaging being conveyed on the surface. Camp is one of the oldest weapons in the queer artist’s arsenal, and Glass wields it like a pro. Yet while she might use it to undermine cliches and upend expectations, the director never lets it distract – for long, at any rate – from the deadly stakes of her story. With a tight, terse screenplay (penned by Glass alongside Weronika Tofilska) that patiently sets up the dominoes for us until we’re quivering in anticipation of their fall, “Bleeding” takes time to relish in the details – the quirks of its characters, the unspoken dynamics between them, the secrets they keep and the moments they choose to reveal them – while making sure every one of them serves to wind the tension tighter. The effort pays off in a series of escalating climaxes that we know are coming yet still manage to surprise, shock, and ultimately, thrill us. Gorgeous cinematography from Ben Fordesman helps, as does a period-perfect Tangerine Dream-esque score by Clint Mansell, but in such a character-driven film as this one, it’s always the actors who are most crucial to selling the director’s vision. In this case, Stewart and O’Brian are the linchpins, delivering a pair of deeply realized performances and a sultry-yet-sweet chemistry that wins us over almost before it does their characters. Both shine, with Stewart’s growth as an actor continuing to stretch her beyond her “Twilight” years and O’Brian’s earthy femininity bringing a welcome – and provocative – layer of gender ambiguity to the mix. Backing them up are fine supporting turns from Malone and Anna Baryshnikov, whose hypnotically oddball performance as a clingy admirer who complicates Lou’s newfound romance is a highlight – as is Dave Franco’s simultaneously hilarious and repellant performance in a role it’s best we let you discover for yourself. Finally, though, it’s veteran screen baddie Harris who dominates, filling us with the kind of irrepressible dread that the most memorable movie villains always inspire – all while sporting a set of over-the-top hair extensions that immediately (and intentionally, we’d like to think) call to mind Richard O’Brien’s Riff-Raff in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Because of its skillful blend of such campy bold strokes and a genuine spirit of righteous rebellion that makes even its most broadly ridiculous moments cut with both sides of their satirical blade, we find “Bleeding” to be a new addition to an ever-growing canon of “essential” queer movies – with the disclaimer that some of its “weirder” moments might leave some viewers a bit perplexed, and those with a low tolerance to “gratuitous” violence and uninhibited sex scenes will likely want to skip it."
"Aug 19, 2022",positive," As tempting as it may be, I’m not wading into the controversies that have swarmed “Captain Marvel” since well before its release. The bulk of criticisms have been silly, pointless, and some of it downright bizarre. Yet through all of the fanboy backlash and insecure outrage Marvel Studios has another big screen cash cow on its hands. “Captain Marvel” is already pushing $1 billion. Not too shabby. Let me start by laying out my credentials. I’m a comic book guy and I’ve followed the Carol Danvers character for a while. I became a genuine fan in 2006 when her second solo series launched. Much of its 50-issue run was fantastic and it did a good job opening up the character (not to mention giving us 19 stunning covers from artist Greg Horn). So I’m more than open to a Carol Danvers/ Ms. Marvel/ Binary/Captain Marvel entry into the MCU. In fact I love the idea of Carol being the first female to have her own movie. And it didn’t hurt when Marvel Studios announced she would be played by Oscar-winner Brie Larson, an actress I really enjoy. Turns out the movie is a good one. It doesn’t necessarily break the MCU mold but it does an amazing job considering the massive challenges it faced. Think about it, “Captain Marvel” is asked to show that a female-led MCU picture can be a big money-maker. It has to tell a fresh origin story of a character not exactly among Marvel’s upper tier. It must connect itself to the already immense MCU timeline. And it has to put certain pieces in place that lead up to next month’s “Avengers: Endgame”. Talk about a full plate! There are moments where you can sense the filmmakers working hard to meet the many demands. At the same time the writer-director duo of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck deserve a ton of credit. They may be unlikely choices to make a blockbuster Marvel picture but they turn out to be solid fits who have a good sense of how the movie should land. Their balancing act is pretty amazing. At its core this is a story of a woman (Larson) in search of her true identity. Practically the entire film is a slow drip of information and revelation about who this clearly gifted person truly is. It’s a cool way of telling an origin story as the character is learning alongside of the audience (think along the lines of Jason Bourne). At the same time it doesn’t allow you the chance to get close enough to her past. Call it conventional but I felt her backstory could have used a tad more attention. We first know her as Vers (pronounced “Veers”), a member of the alien Kree Empire’s elite Starforce. She clearly has untapped power but she’s taught to contain it by her mentor and Starforce commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). This is also where we get our first handful of memory flashes which she dismisses as nothing more than dreams. When a rescue operation goes bad, Vers is abducted by Skrulls, the Kree’s shapeshifting enemies. The Skrull Commander Talos (a really good Ben Mendelsohn) probes her mind giving us yet another batch of memories to parse. Vers escapes to nearby Earth where countless gags and a barrage of musical cues lets us know it’s 1995. She quickly draws the attention of the fledgling S.H.I.E.L.D. organization and agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) but his investigation is quickly sidetracked when the Skrulls attack. Vers and Fury set out on the most unusual of buddy-cop adventures to find out what the Skrulls are after. Along the way she learns more about her true self, namely that she was a former Air Force fight pilot named Carol Danvers. The quest for identity hops from Los Angeles, to Louisiana, and even back to Earth’s orbit. Throughout we watch Vers/Carol wrestle with her otherworldly powers and her humanity. Larson is good, a bit dry but by design. Her character has been trained to suppress her emotions and she’s even told humor is a sign of weakness. As Carol slowly breaks lose from that mindset Larson is given more room to examine the pent-up emotions that not only come with the character but that ultimately unleashes her true power. The supporting cast is just as strong. Out of the nine MCU films Jackson has appeared it, this may be his beefiest role yet. He and Larson have a good chemistry and he has no problem leading a scene or falling into the background whenever needed. Mendelsohn is excellent giving us as performance a shifty as the slippery Skrull he portrays and Lashana Lynch brings a timely warmth playing Carol’s old friend. Oh, and there is a cat named Goose who is an absolute scene-stealer. Can’t forget the cat. While I wouldn’t put “Captain Marvel” in the upper echelon of Marvel movies, it does really well at introducing its character and setting her up to be a major player in the MCU. It does some peculiar things with the Marvel lore and it ends in an interesting but weird place in terms of a sequel. But once again Kevin Feige and his Marvel masterminds have shown an incredible knack for expanding their already mammoth cinematic universe. “Captain Marvel” feels right at home and finally fills a sizable hole in MCU. As for its relevance as the first female-led MCU movie, I’m not sure how much more audiences have to prove. I realize the cultural significance of “Black Panther” and “Captain Marvel”. But audiences have already shown they will not only go see these films but fully embrace them as they do all MCU pictures. Sure, a smattering of internet infants will make an online scene, but clearly their impact has been non-existent. If the story is good, the characters compelling, and the respect for the source material reasonable, any potential “outrage” is all but meaningless. People will come to the theaters. So perhaps it’s time for the fingers to point solely at the studio and not the audience. I didn’t like this as much as you. The overall message is fantastic and one I agree with and want to see more of, but I really didn’t think the story was anywhere near as strong as it needed to be. And unlike the best superhero films, never felt she was in enough peril. But you’re right about the cat, and her scenes with Samuel L Jackson. I’ve seen them interviewed on chat shows and they have this amazing warmth and chemistry. I agree the peril wasn’t as global or even universal as so many of these films but I honestly appreciated that. To me it was a bit refreshing to see the stakes as more personal. Ultimately I enjoyed it as yet another fresh installment into the MCU. I gotta admit, I’m pretty amazed at just how strong this collective universe is despite how big it is. And I keep waiting for the wheels to fall off but they keep adding quality installments. I get that, just wish she had more backstory. I really preferred Wonder Woman. But there will be plenty that prefer Captain Marvel, and just think how many will be inspired to be a pilot or even just inspired in general. One of the reason I love movies is to hear stories I wouldn’t otherwise hear. Another is to be inspired.  Oh I agree. That was my biggest gripe. And I’m with you, I too prefer Wonder Woman and by a pretty big margin. While the WW vs Ares fight wasn’t great, I adored everything leading up to it. I felt Jenkins did a great job letting us know where she came from. Captain Marvel doesn’t venture that deep. As I wrote, it may be a little conventional but I’m like you. I kinda wanted more in terms of backstory. For sure. And it lacked that big moment when WW walks admires the battlefield. But hey, at least it was set in the 90s (see previous discussion) and Samuel L Jackson is a riot. I would watch that movie of them on a road trip.  I’m a comics guy and I admit to wanting some time of respect for the source material especially when it gives us great stories to tell. The internet goofs aren’t true fanboys. Their whining goofs who are impossible to take serious. Pitiful people. I really enjoyed it too and I’m genuinely excited to see it again. Like I said it does some weird stuff with the lore (especially with the Skrulls) but let’s see where they take it from here. It’s interesting that you mention the No Doubt background music. I didn’t care for that. To me it was so on the nose. Worth a laugh at first but then a little silly. And it was during the first part of her big ‘leash off’ fight. I would have went for something more dramatic. But not that big of a deal. I understand the film criticisms (though, the butt-hurt meninist backlash can fuck right off). The film is mysteriously dim– enough to make one sleepy; I, too, wanted to see Carol’s backstory flushed out more, and I didn’t quite understand why it needed to be set in the 90s. But the more I watch Captain Marvel, the less these things bother me. The dimness, I realized on a 2nd viewing, makes her photon energy stand out PHENOMENALLY; I enjoyed the clipped flashbacks because her step-by-step upbringing isn’t nearly as important as knowing that she falls and gets back up again; and, as a 90s baby, I can’t help but adore the references to the time period, however throwaway. I would never have pegged “Just a Girl” as a pivotal climax number, and it rules. Among its accomplishments, Captain Marvel introduced current generations to vintage No Doubt. Amazing. Ha Ha. My wife and I had a fun debate over the No Doubt song. She liked it while I felt it was ridiculously on the nose. To me it made a meaningful fight into more of a goofy joke. Definitely not a deal breaker though. Being set in the 90s was a weird one and you could probably pick apart the timeline if you tried really hard. Personally I don’t care to. I’m fine with the setting. And I agree we get the gist of her backstory but I do think Danvers is a rich enough character to warrant a touch more attention without it being a step-by-step history. But as you said, we do get the things that shaped and challenged her along the way. I can tell you enjoyed writing this review, Keith, and I appreciate it. I doubt I will go watch it — I’ve long been tired of the genre, but I’m the minority. Obviously, a billion dollar take in illustrates that. Thanks for the thought-provoking review. Thanks so much Cindy. I did indeed enjoy writing it. I completely respect those who are burnt out on superhero films. I understand that. I’m still onboard and can definitely recommend this one. I will say if you’re tired of the genre this one doesn’t do anything especially fresh to change your mind. I thought that the movie was good as well. It wasn’t super fantastic like some of the other more recent ones from Marvel, but it was definitely another solid feature film. You’re a stronger person then I am, my review might as well have started with “lol fuck you incels!” Either way, I enjoyed this. it’s not perfect by any means but I’m looking forward to her in Endgame. I’m kind of expecting/hoping that it’s a bit like Doctor Strange. He was fine in his solo movie but he really came to life bouncing off the other Avengers. I hope Carol will too. I can completely see her having a Doctor Strange-like vibrancy when paired with the other Avengers. But I’m like you, I did enjoy this one and I’d be up for a second Carol Danvers movie. Fury was a lot of fun. This was definitely his meatiest role and Jackson was great. He and Brie have some killer chemistry. Anxious to see how they do in “Unicorn Store”. Been going back and forth about checking this out. I will likely wait for DVD to check it out. Glad to see that you enjoyed it! I did enjoy it, maybe a bit more than I expected to. The biggest treat was Larson and Jackson’s buddy cop relationship. It worked really well. I know several people with similar experiences. They weren’t Marvel fans but since have been pulled into the MCU thanks to some really good movies. And the Cap movies are my very favorites. Especially Winter Soldier. "
"Aug 17, 2022",positive," The MCU’s Captain Marvel is well-paced, with a handful of moments of strategically-placed humor, is solidly acted from start to finish, and now has a crowning character to replace Captain America in the future phases. A few months back, Brie Larson spoke out against film criticism being dominated by white males, which you can’t object to; for every female critic, you average 3.5 male ones. It’s a good point. One would think she would also point out the lack of minorities starring in big-budget films today. If you delve deeper, you will find 82% of the reviews performed by the top-100 Rotten Tomatoes-approved critics are white. In which, I would like to point out, maybe the cool kids’ gathering spot for film critics needs to reevaluate who should be added to their own top-100. As a white male critic judging a unique feminist comic book film on International Women’s Day, should I feel the pressure of the herding mentality while reviewing Captain Marvel? No. That’s just being honest. Ultimately, you have no other choice than to give any film your honest opinion. No matter the heat that may be around the corner. I’m here to say this: the film is a stellar addition to the Marvel universe. I’ll also add that Brie Larson is auspicious in it. In her origin story as the Kree warrior Vers, the film opens with Captain Marvel training with her leader, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). She is his prized student of sorts. Yon-Rogg “mansplains” to her how to use her head instead of her power to keep them hidden. You’d be hard-pressed to find a subtler way of portraying an overwhelming statement of anti-feminist machismo trying to keep feminist ambition at bay. The team gathers to take on a battle between the Kree and the ever-shape-shifting Skrulls. They have captured one of their comrades, who infiltrated them. They then travel to get him back but are led into a trap. Vers is taken to their ship for answers. The enemy extraterrestrial race thinks she has something they are searching for. They then start to flip the pages of her memories to find it (memories that are new to her). She escapes and lands on planet Earth sometime in the early 1990s. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and now rookie agent Paul Coulson (Clark Gregg, with hair and looking like he is playing Dennis Quaid in The Dennis Quaid Story) find Vers by a payphone next to a Radio Shack and a Blockbuster (not the last one in Bend, Ore.). Captain Marvel/Vers is played with a cocky, almost brazen ambition by Brie Larson. This is not out of sorts from any action film starring a youthful male lead (think back to Tom Cruise in Top Gun; the Hollywood landscape is littered with them). The team behind the latest installment is smart enough to know this is an age thing. It has nothing to do with gender. Jackson has a lot of fun as a younger Nick Fury (he surely doesn’t move like a junior Nick Fury, though). The chemistry between the leads is apparent. Though, from a friendly/platonic standpoint (the film has one too many “feel you out and get to know you” moments for my taste). Jude Law and Ben Mendelson (as Skrull commander Tolas) are far from thin supporting characters. With Mendelson, in particular, owning the scenes, he is in (in reptile makeup or not). Let’s face it that is nothing new. The weaker moments of the film come from the flashback sequences, particularly those that involved Annette Benning as Dr. Wendy Lawson and needed more time to flesh out the backstory to sell the ending of the film. I wish they also made better use of the often under-used Djimon Hounsou (Amistad, In America) and the outstanding Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asians), so much. Hence, I almost wish the film added more running time, even though a Marvel film under 2.5-hours is welcomed. The MCU has never had trouble with an overall satisfying character-driven origin story. I mean, even Edward Norton’s version of the Hulk had its moments. Captain Marvel lands somewhere in the top-third of Avenger films. However, it falls just short of Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: First Avenger, though just ahead of films like Thor. This latest outing is well-paced. The addition of a handful of moments of strategically-placed humor is welcomed. Overall, this, is solidly acted from start to finish from its stellar cast. The MCU now has a crowning character to replace Captain America, to lead its franchise into phase four. The film is not only a shining moment of action-genre feminism but maybe even, most importantly, an excellent genre picture. It just happens to be a lot of fun. And has an overall positive message about female empowerment behind it. Having a film produced by the Hollywood machine that is not just another genre picture, but another good genre picture with a female lead, along with Wonder Woman, seems like progress in the right direction. We hopefully won’t have to distinguish between the two in the future. Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website. Since a young age, Marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous “Rotten Tomato” approved status – in 2023, he achieved that status."
"Mar 3, 2022",negative," About midway through Captain Marvel, the titular hero Carol Danvers, played with energy and charm by Brie Larson, speaks to a member of the Skrull, an alien race making its first appearance on Earth. The scene takes place in a country house, where the Skrull makes references to “jazz hands” and annoying neighbors who come over to borrow sugar. Somehow, the lizard-faced alien is familiar with such Earth-specific references. But when someone threatens to put their foot “where it doesn’t belong,” the Skrull is confused by the saying. Where will they put their foot, he wonders? It’s baffling that a humanoid from another planet knows the concept of jazz hands or the outmoded practice of borrowing sugar from one’s neighbor, yet he cannot decipher a threat of bodily harm. Seemingly inconsequential, incongruous details and Huh? moments like this accumulate in the script and threaten to unravel the first female-centric entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With a story credited to five writers and a screenplay credited to three, the film feels underwritten in areas and scattershot in others. And in general, it doesn’t have the usual surface polish one anticipates from a Marvel production. To be sure, though Captain Marvel arrives with high expectations for what it represents both on and off the screen, it underwhelms in its sheer averageness.  Similar to many Marvel superheroes, Captain Marvel borrows from an established DC Comics icon, Green Lantern, in that both characters were U.S. pilots who, after a crash, join a group of intergalactic space cops. Although the Captain Marvel character was created in 1968, the film borrows many of her traits from a recent iteration in the comics penned by Kelly Sue DeConnick, including the character’s star-laden costume to her rebellious attitude. When the film opens, it’s on the technologically advanced Kree planet Hala, where our hero Vers (Larson) suffers from amnesia, yet she trains under Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) to become a bona fide member of the Kree’s Starforce. Fragmented images flood her mysterious dreams, suggesting that Vers had a past on another planet—one vaguely reminiscent of Top Gun. Yon-Rogg warns her that emotions and dwelling on the past are signs of weakness, and to gain approval from the Kree overseer, known as the Supreme Intelligence, she must control herself. But rather than submit to the notion that emotions prevent women from doing the same quality of work as men, Vers eventually proves that her emotions are her strength. Things accelerate when Vers is separated from her other comrades during a mission to stop the Skrulls, a shape-shifting species known to infiltrate and take over other planets.  Soon enough, Captain Marvel turns into a kitschy, ‘90s-era comedy more interested in nostalgia than developing its hero. In her pursuit of the Skrulls, she ends up on Earth, here dubbed planet C-53, which is described as “a real shithole” by the Kree—a remark reminiscent of Donald Trump’s view of other countries. She finds herself in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s and teams with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to stop the Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) from a worldwide takeover. The plot has an Invasion of the Body Snatchers quality given the Skrull’s ability to mimic the appearance and DNA of anyone they see. Her amnesia, combined with the throwback setting, makes for a predictable amount of both fish-out-of-water and flashback-to-the-‘90s humor. The screenplay relies on countless references from the era, including humor about the slowness of AOL internet and CD-ROM load times, a nod to Blockbuster Video, and countless alternative rockers (Garbage, Hole, Nirvana, etc.) on the soundtrack. One of the big fight sequences near the climax is set to No Doubt’s “Just a Girl”—a choice that emphasizes the film’s rousing feminist intentions, albeit in the most unsubtle way imaginable.  Over the course of the film, Vers learns that she was originally an earthling named Carol Danvers, and she’s been imbued with untold powers that, even by the final scenes, never become clear or well-defined. The same goes for the character. Carol Danvers is an uncertain personality full of pluck and quips, but she remains caught between the flashes of her former self in her dreams and the hero she has the potential to become. She’s a hero that, not unlike this film within the greater MCU continuum, feels out of place and in need of situating amid off-screen contexts to fully appreciate. Her past is vague at best, captured in a series of all-too-brief snippets of her memory, and her future will play a crucial role in the next entry, Avengers: Endgame. She spends the duration of Captain Marvel in a state of uncertainty, serving up a shallow relief rather than the strong personality that so many Marvel characters are. And though her former Earth friends Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) help bring some dimension to the character, she’s never an in-depth personality—she’s someone defined by what other characters say about her, as opposed to what she does. Only by the final scenes does it seem as though Carol Danvers understands herself, but before we learn more, the film has ended. Many have claimed that Captain Marvel is a film more interested in what it represents than what it is. Admittedly, the film wears its politics on its sleeve—a quality that’s not inherently a bad thing. For instance, Spike Lee is unabashedly political in last year’s BlacKkKlansman, but Lee also knows that a political statement in a film means little without three-dimensional characters to engage our emotions and invest us in the drama. There are scenes in Captain Marvel that do not occur naturally in the story, so they feel like forced statements, such as the No Doubt song—whereas others have been handled with a measure of elegance. An effective twist during the second act resituates our perspective to see perceived criminals and “terrorists” as living beings that do not deserve to be discarded. In a fascinating and unexpected turn, the Skrull become sympathetic and displaced immigrants, while the Kree fanatic Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) would prefer to wipe them out of existence. Elsewhere, the final bout between Carol and the real enemy is also a perfect demonstration of a woman who refuses to play by the rules established by men. Even so, it’s not difficult to see that Wonder Woman (2017) made more of a feminist impact by simply telling a compelling story and not overemphasizing the point.  Whether Captain Marvel is successful in its attempts to assert Carol Danvers as a strong female character demands some consideration. If by “strong” you mean physically powerful, as well as capable of flying and shooting energy beams out of her hands, then sure, Carol Danvers is a strong character. However, she’s not strong in the sense that she’s well-defined or follows a personal code. She’s not a dynamic character—she’s brave, sometimes even a rebel; she’s curious about her past; and she trusts her instincts, even if she sometimes makes mistakes. She’s admirable but not engaging. That characterization doesn’t amount to much, nor does it give her much room to grow, besides filling in informational gaps in her past. That she spends much of the film in a state of flux, caught between her past and future, is not very commanding or inspiring. Thus, the issue might be one of structure. Had we followed Carol from pilot to space cop to Captain Marvel, the journey might have been more involving. Unfortunately, the lackluster writing and serviceable production diminish the basic thrills we expect from the MCU, making Captain Marvel a letdown, if only because of its vast potential. It remains diverting, and that’s all. At the very least, the film boasts a touching tribute to the late Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee, including his best cameo yet. "
"Sep 30, 2021",positive,There's some great visual humor. Once you get on Earth things start picking up.
"Sep 3, 2021",neutral,"Despite many redeeming qualities about Captain Marvel, I found it to be a very safe film with slightly heavy-handed elements, which wasn't very exciting."
"Aug 17, 2021",positive," If you've seen the ads for Captain Marvel, you might be curious exactly what type of movie it's going to be. Is it a candy-colored space opera like Guardians of the Galaxy, a mystery about a soldier caught between allegiances like the Captain America trilogy, or a comedy about a high-flying hot shot who doesn't plays by her own rules like Iron Man? It's actually all those things and more, because like its hero, the film has no identity of its own. Make no mistake, Captain Marvel is a ton of fun, especially after the grim pillars of Infinity War and the upcoming Endgame. At times, it's like many films you probably enjoyed in the '90s, including The Fugitive and Forever Young, as well as older hits like Alien Nation, Top Gun and Superman. But for being such a big piece of the MCU puzzle – she’s a major factor in Endgame, as teased in a mid-credits scene – this is a movie that feels completely disposable. Brie Larson is a great addition to the future Avengers roster, but here it often feels like she's being held back a bit. There's a great moment when she's trying to escape a Skrull ship and snarls back at a henchman. That's the character right there, but she gets too few moments of outright silliness. She has some sarcastic quips, but that about it, as if there's a fear we won't buy her as a badass ""noble warrior hero"" if she's allowed to be goofy. She's also got serious trust issues, made all the more believable by the supporting cast. It's absolutely perfect to have Jude Law play her Kree commander, with Ben Mendelsohn as the leader of the shape-shifting Skrulls. Both men have made careers out of playing untrustworthy scumbags. But the real heavy hitters are Annette Bening, whose identity is practically a spoiler in itself, and Samuel L. Jackson, reprising his role as Nick Fury. The de-aging effect that Marvel has toyed with for years finally works and it's pretty spectacular (although its less effective on Clark Gregg, playing Agent Coulson as a fresh-faced recruit). Jackson, who already looks much younger than his 70 years, looks like he just wrapped shooting on Die Hard with a Vengeance. Much has been made of the fact that this is not only Marvel's first film with a female lead, but also one with its first female co-director. As a fan of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's very human dramas about feeling lost, there's nothing here that would lead you to seek out their earlier tiny indies. Whatever your varying opinions on Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther, at least there's an authorial stamp there. This feels like a very by-committee MCU entry. At least they actually shoot in daylight at some honest-to-god recognizable locations in this one. Captain Marvel is a long-overdue chance for its star to shine, and to focus on a female superhero. Had this happened four years ago, I might be more impressed. In 2019, there's nothing to make it stand out."
"Aug 16, 2021",positive," As the first woman-led film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (despite it being the twenty-first instalment of the franchise – but who’s counting?), Captain Marvel lands in cinemas already burdened with glorious purpose. Meanwhile, Rotten Tomatoes had to update its terms to ban the hordes of trolls and incels intent on review-bombing the film before it even released. What an age we live in.  Carol Danvers (a perfectly-cast Brie Larson), or Vers as she
is known on Hala, is part of an elite team of Kree warriors. Tasked with extracting
a Kree undercover operative before the Skrulls get to him, it is not long until
the mission goes awry and Vers is taken prisoner. Under interrogation by Talos (Ben
Mendelsohn), Vers recovers fragments of her past life on Earth, a life she had
no memory of.  There are glimpses of a rebellious child and an unsupportive father, military training alongside her best friend, alcohol-fuelled karaoke nights, and an enigmatic mentor (Annette Bening). All are puzzle pieces to figuring out who she was, and who she is now, on her way to becoming the hero she is destined to be.  As she escapes and chases her shape-shifting captors to 1995
Los Angeles, eventually teaming up with a young Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), she
begins to realise that everything she thought she knew, may have been a lie. What
ensues is a witty, uplifting, badass and deeply moving superhero epic.  A wonderful and unexpected aspect to Captain Marvel is Carol’s relationship with fellow pilot Maria Rambeau (played splendidly by Lashana Lynch) who has since left the air force to take care of her daughter (Akira Akbar). The tender and uplifting female friendship is what lends heart to the film. It’s also in those scenes that Larson really shines, not just in her girl-boss, warrior badass way, but equally in her character’s more vulnerable, understated moments.  It might be a little corny, the pacing might start off a
little slow, the fight sequences might be a little murky, but none of this does
anything to detract from what is a truly great film. And critics or viewers
reading this may think that’s contradictory, or that it’s wilful blindness to Captain Marvel’s flaws. The fact is, it’s
pointless and closed-minded to rate this film based solely on its cinematic
merits, when its importance exists in its message. "
"Jul 22, 2021",positive," ""Captain Marvel"" arrived with serious controversy among fanboys who felt horrified when their comic book icon transformed into a woman. In turn, star Brie Larson noticed a disproportionate number of male versus female film critics, inspiring questions about how gender influences reviews. Gender obviously affects reactions to stories, hence the term ""chick flicks"" and their counterparts from the male end. Overall, I remain open to casting choices that switch the source material. Tall or short, human or alien, male or female, some roles work regardless of physical appearance. ""Captain Marvel"" falls in that category, and actress Larson plays the role with energetic physicality and an engaging partial smile, not quite a snicker. A snick? In any case, she plays a woman who enjoys bantering and friendly competition but willing to throw in every bit of force when jousting turns into war. Had ""Captain Marvel"" served as audience introduction to Larson, few would foresee a career that includes winning a Best Actress Oscar for the movie Room. ""Captain Marvel"" provides the challenges of getting into terrific shape and looking good in a tight costume, but it requires little in the way of emotional range. The same goes for other top performers in the film. Anette Benning, Jude Law, and Samuel L. Jackson all provide their usual skillful screen presence without generating any thoughts of future awards attention for their work in this film. Jackson especially keeps the tone light, frequently raising his voice and eyebrows for comic emphasis. Well-regarded acting talent follows the Marvel Studios program of top-notch production values, though oddly, ""Captain Marvel's"" sets and special effects look cheesier than most. Dim lighting and gray tones undermine the sharp and colorful visual qualities found in both comic books and such standout Marvel productions as Black Panther. ""Captain Marvel's"" numerous writers and directors focus more on story than appearances, crosscutting time periods and locations as their amnesiac lead character pieces together her past. Audiences may share her confusion at times, but events eventually pull together for a cohesive finale that in true Marvel Studios fashion leaves room for sequels. After all, it turns out a female captain handles duties and defeats gender stereotypes. By repeatedly emphasizing resilience, ""Captain Marvel"" makes an effective role model for girls and boys alike."
"Jul 13, 2021",positive," Even after 20 installments of wildly successful movies that have turned the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a box-office blockbuster factory, Captain Marvel arrives in theaters as one of the studio’s most controversial, seemingly risky projects. Not only is Captain Marvel the studio’s first female-led superhero movie, but it relies on a hero off mainstream audiences’ radar to tell a story set in the shadow of two of the MCU’s most hyped-up projects so far: Last year’s Avengers: Infinity War and its upcoming conclusion, Avengers: Endgame. It isn’t entirely apparent from the previews, but Captain Marvel also happens to be the studio’s most self-aware movie to date — a quality that can either work in a movie’s favor or against it, depending on how it’s handled. Fortunately, Captain Marvel is a winner on all fronts, offering an exciting, thoroughly engrossing chapter of the MCU that manages to tell a compelling standalone story while also putting its stamp on the overarching MCU saga. That it does all of that while also managing to blend in some powerfully relevant social themes makes its achievement that much more impressive. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they penned along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Captain Marvel casts Academy Award winner Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, a U.S. Air Force pilot whose explosive encounter with an alien race results in her gaining powerful, superhuman abilities. The film is a prequel story set in the 1990s, with Carol recruited by the aliens known as the Kree to fight in their war with the shape-shifting Skrulls. When a mission goes awry and she ends up back on Earth, Carol’s mysterious past is revealed, and she teams up with a young Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) to stop the Skrulls from acquiring powerful technology hidden on the planet. Along with Larson and Jackson, the film’s cast also includes Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull officer Talos; Jude Law as Carol’s Kree mentor, Yon-Rogg; and Annette Bening in multiple roles throughout the film. MCU veteran and Agents of SHIELD actor Clark Gregg also reprises his role as SHIELD agent Phil Coulson. It becomes clear early on in Captain Marvel that Larson was the right choice for the film’s titular hero — which is no small feat, given that there’s been near-constant debate over her suitability to play the character since her casting was first announced three years ago. Unlike typical superhero origin stories, Carol isn’t a hero who finds her swagger and confidence once she gains superhuman abilities or learns a lesson about responsibility. In Captain Marvel, Carol has always had to fight to be what she wants to be — often against men telling her what her limits should be — and Larson’s portrayal of the character exudes a confidence and charisma that comes from a life of defying expectations. Everything from Carol’s dialogue to her posture reflects a certainty of purpose that makes her stand out from her Marvel peers, who typically have to overcome crippling self-doubt or moral uncertainty before they can become the hero they need to be. There’s never a point in the film when Carol is not a hero, though — she just becomes a different kind of hero as circumstances and her awareness of them change. The subtleties of her character’s arc could easily be lost amid all of the action and spectacle of Captain Marvel, but Larson handles Carol’s evolution with an impressive level of nuance. The end result is a character that stands out from the rest of the Marvel pack in ways that have more to do with Carol’s personal journey and Larson’s compelling performance than simply her gender. Reprising his role as Nick Fury, Jackson manages to present a version of Nick that’s appropriately familiar but still different in all the ways that his young age and lack of experience reflect. This version of Nick Fury is a bit more trusting and idealistic than the grizzled operative of The Avengers and subsequent films, and Jackson is clearly enjoying the chance to show off some new sides to the character. Although Larson’s portrayal of Carol is the film’s defining element, Mendelsohn also delivers a standout performance as Talos. Despite his character’s shape-changing attributes, Mendelsohn’s part in the film could have easily slipped into the realm of one-dimensional foils, but the Rogue One actor injects so much flair into the character that you don’t want to see him dispatched too soon. Captain Marvel also offers up some impressive visual effects to go along with its intriguing characters, and a story that doesn’t shy away from toying with its audience’s expectations. Given the intense, detail-oriented coverage each Marvel movie gets in the lead-up to its release, it’s a welcome surprise that many of the story’s most rewarding twists and turns weren’t spoiled during the promotional press circuit or, even worse, in the trailers and clips released by the studio. On the visual side, Carol’s energy-blasting powers never look silly or poorly envisioned for the action, and when she finally takes full control of her abilities for a stirring outer-space battle against a fleet of warships, the sequence feels appropriately triumphant. In fact, it’s difficult not to cheer right along with Carol as she revels in her ability to dispatch one ship after another as she twists, dives, and rolls through the cosmic field of battle. Also cheer-worthy is the ease with which Captain Marvel handles certain elements associated with the sort of toxic fandom that targeted the film in the weeks leading up to its release. Captain Marvel simply persists in telling the great story its talented cast and creative team know they can tell, and lets the final product speak for itself. The film does indeed feature Carol dealing with the sort of misogyny — casual or otherwise — that sadly remains part of the female experience today, but the message the movie hammers home (and the real hero’s journey that Carol makes in the film) is one of realizing your own self-worth and potential. Carol’s battle in Captain Marvel might ostensibly be against alien villains, but it’s really against the elements in her life that would hold her back from being the hero she’s capable of being. This is new ground for Marvel Studios’ heroes, as thus far the MCU has featured protagonists who overcome physical or moral dilemmas in order to use their powers for good. For Carol to reach her full, heroic potential, however, all she needs to do is stop listening to everyone telling her what she should be or can be. Put in the unenviable place of having to establish a new character in the midst of one of the most climactic moments in the MCU’s history, Captain Marvel succeeds as a film because it approaches its real-world situation in much the same way its hero does with the predicament she finds herself in. Instead of trying to prove its value in the MCU, Captain Marvel simply persists in telling the great story its talented cast and creative team know they can tell, and lets the final product speak for itself. At a time when the cultural divide in Hollywood and the nation at large has never felt greater, Captain Marvel dives into the fray and emerges with a truly memorable big-screen adventure that stands toe-to-toe with the best solo features the MCU has to offer. Director Kenny Ortega's 1993 film Hocus Pocus wasn't a hit when it was first released, but history has been kind to it, and turned it into a Halloween tradition of sorts for children of a particular generation (and their children, in many cases). And because this is a time when everything old is eventually new again -- particularly if it's gained the sort of post-release popularity Hocus Pocus has enjoyed -- Disney has decided to bring the sorcerous Sanderson sisters back for another adventure in Hocus Pocus 2. Hocus Pocus 2 conjures up original cast members Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as Winifred, Sarah, and Mary Sanderson, respectively, the trio of witches who were accidentally resurrected in the 1993 film and terrorized the town of Salem before being defeated by a group of precocious teenagers and a magical black cat. This time around, the film features Step Up and 27 Dresses director Anne Fletcher behind the camera, and follows another group of Salem teenagers who unwittingly unleash the Sanderson sisters on the town again, 29 years after the events of the original film. Disney's live-action adaptations of the studio's classic, animated features have generally been hit-or-miss affairs. While some have managed to breathe new life into familiar stories, others have fallen flat, delivering cold cash grabs that never quite channel the magic of the films that inspired them. Arriving on the Disney+ streaming service on September 8, the live-action Pinocchio falls into the latter category, and it really is a shame, because the Robert Zemeckis-directed film has plenty of potential to go along with its impressive cast. Anyone familiar with writer Dan Slott's celebrated run on the She-Hulk comic book series already knew that Marvel's live-action She-Hulk: Attorney at Law series had plenty of potential, but for everyone else, the introduction of Bruce Banner's superhero cousin likely seemed a strange -- and perhaps, unnecessary -- addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And yet, it doesn't take long for the new Disney+ series to make it clear that actress Tatiana Maslany's green-skinned alter ego, Jennifer Walters, is a character the MCU sorely needed. Created by Rick and Morty and Silicon Valley writer Jessica Gao, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law casts Maslany as Walters, an ambitious lawyer whose professional aspirations are seemingly derailed when an accidental blood transfusion with her cousin, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), gives her powers similar to those of Hulk. Unlike Banner, however, she's able to control both her transformations and her psyche as She-Hulk. As she attempts to get her life back on track, she soon finds herself dealing with supersized problems she didn't ask for -- including a new job at a legal firm specializing in cases involving superpowers.

"Apr 29, 2021",positive," There are two types of Marvel movies. There are the ones that follow the classic superhero arc, like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, in which a good, smart, strong protagonist battles evil, and usually public suspicion, in a way that’s been familiar to audiences since 1978’s Superman (not Marvel, we know. Don’t write in). Then there are the weirdo ones, like Guardians of the Galaxy or Ant-Man, which tend to be pretty cavalier with plot, more interested in character eccentricities and gags, so you might reach the end somewhat unsure of what just happened but certain you had a nice time. Captain Marvel has a foot in both camps, which makes it surprising, silly and refreshing, if also a tad messy. If you haven’t already read up on Captain Marvel you may spend the first hour fairly confused. When we meet our hero, played by Brie Larson, she is already a superpowered being, known as Vers. She lives on an alien planet as part of the Kree, a race under permanent threat from shape-shifting aliens called the Skrulls, led by the ever brilliant Ben Mendehlson as Talos. She’s a skilled member of a military group, with super-strength and the ability to shoot energy blasts from her fists. Yet Vers is troubled by weird half-memories of a different life on a different planet. A near miss with the Skrulls finds her stranded on Earth, which she starts to realise is oddly familiar. It’s an origin story told in a jumble, with Vers finding out how she gained her powers then becoming a superhero. Directors and co-writers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Mississippi Grind) have opted for a 1990s setting for the film. The reason why becomes clear later. In keeping with the setting, they’re shooting for a ’90s sci-fi tone – a little bit Men In Black and a smidge Independence Day – with Vers as the no-nonsense alien come to Earth, baffled by its primitiveness. Samuel L. Jackson, made 30 years younger by some flawless CG, is her startled guide, the rookie Shield agent who will eventually become the Avengers’ boss Nick Fury. There’s so much fun stuff in this approach that it’s a shame the film doesn’t embrace it more. Last year’s Bumblebee nailed the nostalgia of ’80s sci-fi without overloading the references and this is aiming for a ’90s equivalent, but its grip is less sure. As the movie progresses the ’90s element becomes less about tone and style than soundtrack and visual reminders. Nirvana and Garbage on the soundtrack remind us when we are. What starts out weird and individual slips into Marvel formula. Good Marvel formula, with some genuinely surprising twists and strong action, but a familiar groove nonetheless. Larson is tremendous throughout. The fact this is the MCU’s first movie with a woman in the lead puts a lot of weight on her and she carries it easily. She’s got star-power swagger and charisma to burn. The movie becomes the most fun in the last half-hour when she’s really allowed to enjoy herself, living the superhero dream the movie has promised would eventually come. The two parts, the traditional and the weird, coalesce into something nutty and exciting. If Captain Marvel is going to be one of the driving forces of the MCU after Avengers Endgame then the universe is in good hands."
"Apr 26, 2021",positive," La película estelarizada por Brie Larson cumple también con la tendencia de los estudios a diseñar productos dirigidos al público femenino. En ese contexto y con mas de $524 millones de dólares reacudados, pues… la cinta es un éxito. Capitana Marvel gira en torno a Vers (Larson), una humana que vive en el planeta Hala, habitado por los Kree. Vers forma parte de un escuadrón militar liderado por Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), cuyo objetivo es acabar con la amaenaza que supone una raza alienígena llama Skrull, quienes tiene la habilidad de metamorfosearse en cualquier persona que vean. ¿Cómo llegó Vers a ese planeta? Nuestra heroína tiene sueños extraños los cuales podrían ser parte de su vida en la Tierra, pero no está segura. Las cosas cambian a partir de una misión fallida su equipo, quien luego de sufrir una emboscada. Vers es capturada por los Skrull e interrogada. Es ahí en donde emergen recuerdos de su vida en la Tierra, los cuales están relacionados con el conflicto entre los Kree y los Skrull. Los Skrull se dirigen a la Tierra para buscar, a través de los recuerdos reprimidos de Vers, un artefacto que los puede ayudar a ganar la guerra. En el viaje Vers se libera, lo cual es también el parteaguas de la liberación de su enorme poder. En la Tierra se topará con un Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) más joven —la acción se desarrolla en los 90—, con el entonces agente novato Coulson (Clark Gregg)  y con un par de personas más de su pasado. Capitana Marvel es una cinta divertida, con mucho chiste fácil, y ligera… en ocasiones demasiado ligera de tal manera que a veces es complicado tomarla en serio, sin mencionar que los nudos en la trama se resuelven relativamente fácil, en parte gracias al poder de la heroína que parece ser la más poderosa del universo. Prácticamente parece invencible. A pesar de lo anterior la película es entretenida y sirve de ante sala para Avengers: End Game y seguramente es el inicio de más películas sobre este personaje y de seguro hasta podría integrar un nuevo equipo de Avengers.

"Mar 12, 2021",positive,"The chemistry between Larson and Lynch propels the last half of the movie; Lynch brings depth, love, and believability to Maria."
"Mar 8, 2021",negative," Love them or hate them, Marvel films have become as culturally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola or the color red. Yet with the immense critical and commercial success of last year’s Black Panther, the studio’s first film with a predominantly black cast, it seemed that Marvel tapped into something genuinely fresh, far from the flat soda rebrands of years past. Unfortunately, Captain Marvel doesn’t bring the same creativity to the table, instead folding back into familiar, overplayed territory to tell the first woman-led story in its cinematic universe. Brie Larson stars as the titular hero, originally known as Carol Danvers and later Vers, a trained pilot and fighter who must navigate her own memories to learn how she got her powers, who she can trust and who she really is. This nonlinear narrative adds interest beyond your typical origin story, but it’s quickly overwhelmed by the same shtick that’s in all these movies—uncompelling action sequences, recycled villains and flat direction. In many ways a spiritual successor to Guardians of the Galaxy, the film is heavy on ’90s nostalgia (Carol rocks a Nine Inch Nails T-shirt and leather jacket for a good portion of the runtime) and the decade’s girl-power feminism. Larson also gets some decent one-liners, but lacks a sparring partner to keep up the energy, because Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury is too busy being reverse-aged with CGI to care. Young girls deserve to see themselves represented in mediocre superhero movies, too—they just might have more fun with Alita: Battle Angel. Watch it at Assembly Row, Boston Common, Fenway, Seaport, South Bay and the suburbs."
"Mar 4, 2021",positive," The tagline for “Captain Marvel,” the latest Marvel origin story, is “Higher. Further. Faster.” but I would like to suggest another. “In Space, Everyone Can Hear You Scream Whee!” As Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) pierces our atmosphere, her banshee cry of sheer exhilaration pierces the soundtrack. “Whee!” She’s having fun and so should fans of the high-flying character. There’s a bit of backstory. “Captain Marvel” begins, as all good superhero flicks do, on an alien planet. Hala is the home of the Kree, a race of powerful ETs ruled by an AI leader called the Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening). Among the inhabitants of the planet are Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), mentor to Vers (Brie, not yet dubbed Captain Marvel). She is being trained as part of an elite band of space cops, who, shooting energy bolts from her wrists, tracks and hunts shapeshifting creatures called the Skrull. An insomniac, she is haunted by nightmares and mysterious images of another life. To find context for her existence she travels to C-53—earth—during the Clinton years. There, while hunting down Skrulls who are searching for a weapon that would make them unstoppable in the universe, she meets Nick Fury, Agent of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson), who becomes entangled in her hunt for the earthbound Skrulls—including the world-weary Talos (Ben Mendelsohn)—and her search for her true identity. “Captain Marvel” begins with a trippy, time-warping introduction to Vers’s past. It’s an orgy of fast cuts and establishes the film’s spirited tone. There’s a lot going on here, maybe too much, but at least it rips along like a cheetah attacking its prey. Things slow down once the film lands in 1995 California and the “Terminator-esque” story of a benevolent alien with superpowers kicks in. Larson finds the right tone, playing someone grappling with two identities, otherworldly and stoic one moment, swaggering playfully the next. Vers is a total girl power hero, with no love interest, other than a female best friend, she kicks but while the soundtrack blares “I’m Just A Girl” and tell her male mentor, “I have nothing to prove to you.” Larson keeps her interesting even though through much of the film Vers isn’t quite sure who she is or where she belongs in the universe. Further separating her from her superhero colleagues is a purpose driven mission not born out of revenge but by powerful emotions and a sense of loss. Those motivations alone give the film a slightly different feel from others in the Marvel family. Visually Vers, harnessing all the hurt of all the times she was told she wasn’t good enough or that girls shouldn’t try to do boy stuff, is a powerful feminist statement that helps drive the story and define the character. That it’s visually stunning is a bonus. Supporting actors Jackson (we finally learn the unlikely why Fury wears an eye patch) and Mendelsohn find a balance between the film’s dramatic, action and lighter scenes. Co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, handle the character work with aplomb. Their previous films, indies like “Half Nelson” and “Mississippi Grind,” are studies in nuance, a trait lost in “Captain Marvel’s” larger set pieces. The action—and there is plenty of it, tends to be of a generic frenetically edited style. The convoluted origin story mixed with the cluttered action sequences suck some of the air out of the theatre but their take on the superhero character as both an outsider and one of us is as refreshing as it is unusual. “Whee!” Richard Crouse shares a toast with celebrity guests and entertainment pundits every week on CTV’s exciting talk show POP LIFE.Saturdays at 8:30 on CTV NewsChannel, midnight on CTV."
"Feb 18, 2021",positive,"  The storytelling / business model that Marvel Studios has developed over the past 10-plus years is both genius and puzzling. Because each subsequent film is connected to those that came before it, they have created a world in which filmgoers feel the need to see each and every movie that comes out. At the same time, not allowing a new film to stand on its own two legs sometimes prevents new characters from establishing their own identity.  Before a second of Captain Marvel comes on screen, there are already huge expectations on the title character (played by Brie Larson), as her symbol was famously seen in the final moments of Avengers: Infinity War when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) desperately sent her a message as he crumbled into dust. So instead of this movie being a true origin story about the first lead female superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it serves as a retconning of events to fit that certain cataclysmic event.  Still, it’s a heck of a lot of fun to see her story play out, even with that extra weight attached to it. Writer/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (moving up to the big time after four acclaimed but under-seen independent movies) structure the film in an unexpected order, starting off with Vers (Larson) in space helping Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and her fellow race of Kree warriors protect their way of life from the menacing Skrulls, led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn).  That battle results in Vers crash-landing on Earth in 1995, where she, with the help of a much younger version of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Fury, discovers that her past consists of more than just her time with the Kree. She used to be known as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot who, along with her best friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), helped test out new planes for her boss (Annette Bening).  To say much more would be delving into spoiler territory, but suffice it to say that the discoveries Danvers/Vers makes on her way to becoming Captain Marvel change her perspective a great deal. As with most of the Marvel movies, the film is most successful when it stays small and focuses on the personal aspects of its characters. The interplay between Danvers and Fury, and later Danvers and Rambeau, evolve the characters much more than any action scene could ever do.  Another Marvel staple is to keep the story light and entertaining, and Captain Marvel is on par with Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man in that respect. Part of it is the ‘90s setting, which Boden, Fleck, and co-writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet use to their full advantage. Clever references abound, including everything from Blockbuster Video to Mallrats to the slowness of dial-up Internet. They also load up the film with ‘90s-era music, perhaps a bit too much; among others, the cue of No Doubt’s “Just a Girl” is enjoyable but obvious.  In fact, predictability is where the film falters the most. It’s not just the general story arc, which, given the prior knowledge about Captain Marvel, can only go in one direction. Several twists are telegraphed from early on in the movie, lessening the impact of their ultimate reveals. However, because the filmmakers play with the form of the story, the film never succumbs to its failures.  Oscar winner Larson makes for an ideal hero, tough but vulnerable, with the acting chops to sell both the big and small scenes equally well. Jackson, as well as Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, is digitally de-aged by 25 years highly effectively, something that has been done before but not to this extent. His performance represents either a bold new era in filmmaking or the death knell for actors as we know them; time will tell.  As engaging a film as Captain Marvel is, it’s a tad disappointing that it mostly serves as an appetizer for the main course of Avengers: Endgame in April. Captain Marvel may wind up being the one to save the galaxy, but she’ll have to wait for a film where she can shine on her own. If you go by the movies, life in small towns can either be quaint and neighborly, or drudgery where even the smallest change to the daily routine can be cause for excitement. The latter is certainly the case in LaRoy, Texas, where a case of mistaken identity leads to the small Texas town having more crime than it’s seen in its entire existence. Ray (John Magaro) is a sad-sack character seen as a pushover by the most important people in his life: His former beauty queen wife, Stacy-Lynn (Megan Stevenson), and his brother Junior (Matthew Del Negro), who manages the hardware store where they both work. Early in the film, Ray is shown evidence that Stacy-Lynn might be cheating on him by wannabe private detective Skip (Steve Zahn), bringing even more misery into his life. While sitting in a parking lot, lamenting his horrible life, one night, Ray is approached by a man with an envelope full of money and a request to kill a man. Although initially taken aback, Ray decides to take the job if only to bring something different and exciting into his life. The real hitman (Dylan Baker) doesn’t take kindly to someone stealing work from him, and Ray soon finds himself in several situations that upend his world completely. Written and directed by Shane Atkinson, the film is a lightweight but still enjoyable take on a Fargo-esque story. The fact that Ray has three separate elements with which to deal – his cheating wife, the seemingly ever-present Skip, and his inadvertent entry into the world of crime – gives Atkinson different avenues into which to channel the story, which keeps the film from becoming repetitive. He also upends expectations at multiple points in the film, from the excellent opening scene to the climactic sequence. While some of the characters adhere to storytelling conventions, several take detours that keep the film from relying too much on Texas stereotypes. Ray especially keeps viewers on their toes, as just when it seems he’s becoming predictable, he makes an unanticipated choice. The film does get bogged down a bit in the middle section after an initial jolt of energy that comes with the set-up of the story. Stacy-Lynn and Junior are both mostly one-note characters whose importance to the plot doesn’t help them much. The real hitman, after making a great first impression, recedes into the background too often. The few times he does pop up make you wish his role called for him to be in more scenes. Magaro is good casting for this role, as – much like he did in Past Lives – he plays the well-meaning guy who is overshadowed by others in a way that makes you root for him and hate him at the same time. Zahn has the type of face that allows him to easily play the comic relief, but he’s also good in more earnest moments. Baker makes the most of his relatively limited screentime; if only had had more. LaRoy, Texas doesn’t do enough to be a completely absorbing crime thriller, but with a few good performances and a story that’s familiar but still surprising, it has more highs than lows. With a deadly crime spree the most interesting thing to happen in this small town, it might be worth visiting again. LaRoy, Texas is now playing at Galaxy Grandscape in The Colony; it is also available on demand at home. It will screen as part of the USA Film Festival on April 19."
"Feb 10, 2021",negative," The production and release of Captain Marvel, the new science fiction superhero adventure from Marvel and Disney, has a number of remarkable features, but none of them involve the film’s drama, action or characters. Briefly, Captain Marvel, in convoluted fashion, follows US Air Force pilot Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) who absorbs an awesome energy source, making her potentially “one of the universe’s most powerful heroes ever known,” according to the film’s publicity. However, six years later, she is suffering from amnesia, doesn’t know who or what she is and has become a member of the repressive Starforce Military under her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). The shapeshifting Skrulls, the apparent enemy, force Danvers to crash-land in the US in the mid-1990s. But all is not what it appears. Danvers discovers secrets about herself and about a “galactic war” between two alien races. Not much of this is interesting, although it is noisy and “action-packed.” Captain Marvel, as a film, is predictable, empty and tedious. The more “sensitive” scenes on Earth, focusing on Danvers and her African American friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and daughter (Akira Akbar), are possibly the most contrived and least convincing. Disney, the film’s distributor, is the world’s largest media company, with some $100 billion in assets. With a market value of $152 billion, it ranks as the 53rd largest company of any kind in the world, just behind Total (oil and gas), Merck (pharmaceuticals), the Bank of China (one of the four leading state-owned commercial banks in China), Unilever, DowDuPont and BP. Media reports place Captain Marvel’s combined net production and global marketing costs at $300 million. To date, the film’s global box office stands at $774 million. Captain Marvel is truly “corporate entertainment”—i.e., the very process by which it came into being prevents it from being entertaining or enlightening in any meaningful fashion. This type of large-scale, officially sponsored filmmaking, whose success is avidly promoted and tracked by the media and business publications in particular, inevitably intersects and overlaps with other aspects of American establishment culture. In the case of Captain Marvel, this means militarism and feminism specifically. In fact, Task & Purpose reported that Marvel Studios launched the official start of production “with a photo of Larson, and Air Force Brig. Gen. Jeannie M. Leavitt, then-commander of the 57th Wing and the service’s first female fighter pilot, atop an F-15 at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.” “To prepare for her role, Larson,” according to The Wrap, visited the Air Force base “to join simulated dogfights. The film’s red-carpet premiere included testimonials from Air Force men and women and a flyover by the Air Force’s Nellis-based Thunderbirds.” Task & Purpose, a website that follows the American military, also cited the emailed comments of Todd Fleming, chief of the Community and Public Outreach Division at Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs: “The Air Force partners on any number of entertainment projects to ensure the depiction of Airmen and the Air Force mission is accurate and authentic. Our partnership with ‘Capt Marvel’ [sic] helped ensure the character’s time in the Air Force and backstory was presented accurately. It also highlighted the importance of the Air Force to our national defense.” “[Captain Marvel] is not part of a recruiting strategy but we would expect that audiences seeing a strong Air Force heroine, whose story is in line with the story of many of our Airmen, would be positively received,” Fleming said. The issue of female recruitment is no small matter. American imperialism, recklessly gearing up for war against Russia, China and other rivals, needs vast new supplies of human fodder. Task & Purpose explains, “The spotlight on airmen [in Captain Marvel] comes at a time when the Air Force, like the other services, is hunting for the next generation of pilots. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are all short 25 percent of their pilot billets, according to a GAO [Government Accountability Office] report published this summer; the Air Force in particular has doled out cash incentives like candy in a vain effort to prevent pilots from defecting to the private sector. Indeed, the branch’s plan to increase its number of squadrons by 76 to Cold War levels will require an additional 40,000 personnel, further straining the service’s recruitment capabilities. At the Air Force Academy, female cadets are increasingly encouraged to vie for pilot spots to help bridge that gap.” Larson, who has made all sorts of useless (or worse) comments about #MeToo, alleged sexual abuse and her own “social activism,” like most of affluent Hollywood, is entirely oblivious to the criminal role of the US military, the greatest source of terror and “abuse” on the planet by an order of magnitude of 100 times or more. The female heroism in Captain Marvel, of course, has been greeted with plaudits. Entertainment Weekly noted excitedly that the film would “mark the first time a woman will be headlining her own solo superhero movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also marks the first time a woman will direct a superhero film for Marvel Studios: Anna Boden will co-direct with her Mississippi Grind partner Ryan Fleck.” The hope is that Captain Marvel will do “for women” what Black Panther did “for African Americans”—which is, of course, nothing whatsoever, except for a small layer of prominent studio executives, writers, performers, etc. This comment from Deadline is typical: “One film finance source believes that it’s pretty much certain that Captain Marvel  will see $1 billion around the world and break the glass ceiling for female-led pics at the global B.O. [box office], dashing past Wonder Woman’s final global of $821.8M.” As is this Vox headline: “Why Captain Marvel’s milestone status creates so much pressure for it to succeed—Why Captain Marvel represents more than just a superhero movie.” The article proposes to answer these important questions: “What does a woman superhero mean for Marvel Studios and the MCU [Marvel Cinematic Universe]? What are the takeaways from Captain Marvel’s already overwhelming box office success? What does the film have to say about feminism? What might have happened if it had flopped? And who gets to shape the conversation and narrative surrounding it?” The final and perhaps most remarkable feature of Captain Marvel involves its writer-directors. (And, secondarily, its performers. What are Larson, Jude Law and the talented Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn, whose acting in The Land of Steady Habits we recently praised, doing in this rubbish?) We have made the point previously on more than one occasion about the objective significance of the “long march” of numerous so-called independent or art filmmakers toward empty-headed, “blockbuster” movie-making. We noted the examples of Steven Soderbergh (Ocean’s Eleven, etc.), Alan Taylor (Terminator Genisys), the Russo brothers (the Captain America and Avengers franchises), Kenneth Branagh (Thor), Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, etc.), John Singleton (a Fast and Furious installment), Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day, one of the James Bond fantasies), Marc Forster (another of the Bond films, Quantum of Solace), Sam Mendes (yet another Bond film, Skyfall) and Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman). To that list, one can add the more recent examples of Jon Watts (two Spider-Man films), Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok), Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle in Time) and Ryan Coogler (Black Panther). In a number of these cases, the filmmakers had earlier indicated vaguely oppositional political views or a certain concern at least for the fate of broader layers of the population. The lure of large amounts of money is obviously an issue. But perhaps the more pertinent question is: what are the social and ideological conditions that make writers, directors and performers susceptible to this “lure”? It is not inevitable. Artists, including in the US, have been known to repudiate such offers with contempt. Almost inevitably, however, such resistance has been rooted in political and social conceptions and opposition of a left-wing character, sustained by a confidence in the better instincts of the population and its willingness to struggle. Those conceptions and that confidence are sorely lacking today. The directors of the dreadful Captain Marvel, Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, should not be entirely unfamiliar to readers of the WSWS, although the context—big-budget Hollywood—may be unexpected. We have reviewed two of their films in the past, Half Nelson (2006) and Sugar (2008). The Atlantic notes with surprise that Fleck and Boden “until now have worked in the realm of quiet, sensitive indie films.” More than simply “quiet” and “sensitive,” Half Nelson centers on an obviously left-wing high school teacher working at an inner-city school in Brooklyn. A 2006 New York Times article about the making of Half Nelson is worth citing. The Fleck-Boden film, wrote Dennis Lim, “is a political allegory, a film about a would-be visionary who wants to change the world but can’t get his act together and is often his own worst enemy. It’s not a stretch to read it as a comment on the sorry state of the American left.” “‘That was more or less conscious,’ the film’s director, Ryan Fleck, said of the political subtext.” Fleck and Boden “started writing Half Nelson … four years ago, as the Bush administration was preparing to invade Iraq and the antiwar movement was gaining momentum. ‘It felt like we were going to protests every other week,’ Mr. Fleck said recently. ‘But ultimately you don’t have the energy to do it all, and you feel like you’re doing very little. A big part of the frustration was the inability to make meaningful change.’ “The activist spirit comes naturally to Mr. Fleck, who was born to socialist parents on a commune in Berkeley, Calif. As a child he was taken to rallies and protests. As a teenager he read Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn.” Fleck and Boden’s Sugar, about a Dominican baseball player playing in the minor leagues in the US, the WSWS commented, was “about immigration and acculturation, capitalism and exploitation, hospitality and loneliness.” “Mr. Fleck said he hoped that their future projects would remain, however obliquely, rooted in a sense of social justice. ‘Filmmaking is kind of a vain hobby when maybe we should all be taking to the streets,’ he said. ‘But it seems irresponsible not to be informed by politics in some way.’ “Ms. Boden’s idealism is more tempered. ‘I don’t have an inflated sense of what a movie can do,’ she said. ‘But you can at least try not to put something out there that you don’t believe in.’"
"Feb 9, 2021",positive," Studios used to open their major blockbusters after Memorial Day. Over time, that release date crept earlier and earlier, and now we have Captain Marvel, which just had one of the greatest box office openings ever, and it’s not even spring yet. It makes sense—Marvel’s putting out a couple movies a year and they’ve got to spread them out, but it does seem like a bit much. Thankfully, while Captain Marvel is definitely a super hero movie, it does sidestep some of the usual by-the-numbers plot points and finds a pretty novel way to tell its story. Captain Marvel is Carol Danvers, who’s fighting alongside an alien race called the Kree. They’re locked in an interstellar battle with another race called the Skrull, who have the ability to shapeshift into anyone they see. The Kree have given Danvers many of their powers, so she’s a sharp fighting machine, although she has absolutely no memory of her time before the Kree, not even that her name is Carol Danvers. She ends up on Earth in the 1990s, where she meets Nick Fury, the eventual mastermind behind the Avengers, and where she learns about her own past, and that not everyone is what they seem to be — even beyond the Skrulls’ shapeshifting. This is Marvel’s most narratively ambitious movie, cutting through time and memory, and it’s occasionally a little hard to follow. But I’ll take that trade, given that it’s showing us something new. The movie stands just fine on its own; it’ll work even if this is your first Marvel movie, but it will be more meaningful if you’ve got a basic idea of what we’ve seen before, and it’s a major part of the setup for what’s to come. Brie Larson plays Captain Marvel fantastically, with determination, vulnerability, and an emotionally resonant resilience. And, in the end, Captain Marvel isn’t just a worthy hero, she’s maybe the most powerful one we’ve ever seen."
"Jan 29, 2021",positive," Captain Marvel is a film that bears the burden of several responsibilities. As the last entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Three before Avengers: Endgame, a launchpad for a new Avenger, and the first female-led movie of the entire franchise, the film wears a myriad of important hats. In addition, as a followup to the awe-inspiring hat trick of Thor: Ragnarok, the now Oscar-winning Black Panther, and Avengers: Infinity War, Captain Marvel has the unenviable task of living up to a string of significant critical and commercial successes. So, does the newest member of the Avengers deliver in her solo debut? Yes, and no. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has an unprecedented track record of quality, a streak of 20 films that range from solid to fantastic with few outliers (sorry, Thor: The Dark World). Captain Marvel isn’t a film to tarnish that reputation, but at the same time, it is also a film that harkens back to the nascent MCU of the late 2000s, with much of the esteemed studio’s worst tendencies back on full display. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, Sugar, Mississippi Grind), the film buckles under the enormous weight of its responsibilities with messy and uneven storytelling, an over-reliance on vague CGI, and a severely underdeveloped heroine. However, that isn’t to say that Captain Marvel isn’t fun - buoyed by an excellent supporting cast and Brie Larson’s breezy chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury, the film is a delight when it’s not taking itself too seriously. Captain Marvel wastes no time introducing us to our protagonist, throwing us right in the middle of an alien conflict. Vers (a clever play on Carol Danvers’ burnt up dog-tag), as she’s known, is an amnesiac member of Starforce, an elite squad of “noble warrior heroes” from the Kree home planet of Hala. Led by Yon-rogg (Jude Law, cranking up his smarm and charm), Starforce is on the covert back lines of a conflict with the Skrulls, a race of green-skinned shapeshifters that are allegedly an invasive and belligerent threat to the entire galaxy. When a mission goes awry and Vers is captured by the Skrulls, they set their sights on Earth after probing her buried memories. The story’s setup is problematic right out of the gate - by introducing tidbits of our heroine’s Earthbound history and making her an amnesiac, it takes the wind out of its sails almost immediately. Being privy to important information that our protagonist isn’t even aware of, the audience is forced to watch Vers play catchup for over an hour, draining a significant amount of dramatic tension from the film. With no memory of who she really is, Vers is also a literal cipher, an unrelatable blank slate that comes into her own way too late as our headlining hero. It also doesn't help that the first act is muddled and uninspired - the Kree/Skrull war just isn’t that interesting, and a frustratingly dark filter over the picture really confuses the visuals.  Once Danvers crash lands on Earth, however, the film peps up dramatically. With the introduction of a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury, the mood lightens and Captain Marvel really finds its footing. Brie Larson is a tremendously gifted actress, coming off a well-deserved Best Actress win for 2015’s Room - and even though the occasionally sleepy script doesn’t live up to Larson’s caliber, Carol Danvers shines particularly brightly opposite the film’s excellent supporting cast. Whether it’s an oftentimes hilarious buddy-cop vibe with Nick Fury or a deeper exploration of female friendship with Maria Rambeau (a resonant Lashana Lynch), Captain Marvel is elevated by the characters in Danvers’ orbit - when Larson is given the slack to play fast and loose with the cast, the pace and energy feels right at home alongside Marvel’s best. And while the film suffers from the lack of a real impactful villain, there are some refreshingly interesting surprises and swerves in store that give Talos the Skrull (Ben Mendelsohn) more to do than just twirl his mustache. Unfortunately, however, with all the things it’s trying to accomplish, Captain Marvel lets many of its inspired ideas slip through the cracks. The film’s 1990s setting, while charming at times, feels extremely reductive and haphazard. An effective throwback allows its time period and nostalgia to seep into every frame and every corner of the film, where it floats in the background as a gentle reminder. By no means am I expecting Zodiac-levels of fidelity in a Marvel superhero film, but it needs to be more than just Nine Inch Nails tees, Blockbuster stores, and the occasional No Doubt riff - Captain Marvel’s 90s references, unfortunately, are just jarring when they should be seamless. The film also suffers from many of the worst attributes of the MCU, with tedious CGI sequences and a mostly uninspired third act. One only needs to look at Danvers’ encounter with the Kree Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening pulling double duty in two mostly thankless roles) to diagnose many of the Marvel Universe’s biggest problems. The last act of the film, a slapdash clash of CGI beams and explosions, has high physical impact but almost zero visceral or emotional heft thanks to Captain Marvel’s ill-defined superpowers. When Danvers is finally allowed to cut loose, she becomes nigh invincible, able to fly through the air and obliterate anything in her path, including any stakes the film once had.  It seems that I’ve complained a lot about Captain Marvel, but the truth remains that it isn’t a bad film. Not even close. The movie knows how to have its fun, even with some glaring flaws. Brie Larson remains a captivating screen presence, and even though the film isn’t breaking ground like many of Marvel’s other Phase Three films, we did finally get our female-led superhero film. Even though it aims to be a big-gun headliner, Captain Marvel ends up resembling more of a supporting player, and that’s just fine. There are fates much more dire than fitting right in with Marvel’s library of films, for better or worse. "
"Jan 29, 2021",positive," I want to preface this by saying that I may reveal more spoilers than I would otherwise for the sake of the argument I seek to make. Read ahead with this caution, or return here once you’ve seen the film. Despite my love of film, Hollywood makes me groan. I understand why it’s a point of contention for a majority of the general public. The “shut up and entertain us” argument has a leg or two less than it once did, now that our President is a former reality star, but I understand where the case sits on the list of nausea-inducing self-aggrandizement. In spite of all this, Hollywood is finally getting one thing right: the expansion of its inclusivity initiative. Behind my eye rolls and faux gags, I think this is incredibly important. Based on a study released last year, I am in the stark minority – somewhere around 18 percent – as a female film critic. I don’t think about it often, but as I sat in “Captain Marvel,” watching the first female superhero to lead a feature in the Marvel Universe, it struck me just how, for lack of a more precise word, COOL it felt. “Wonder Woman” made history as the first female headlining super hero, but that was a Warner Brothers film in the DC Universe. It’s a fierce movie in its own right, directed by a woman to boot. While it pains me to even bring the lasso-wielding hero up – in no article written about Batman would I feel obligated to mention Superman – that’s just where we’re at still. But watching Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel did something to me that Wonder Woman didn’t. A note hit higher and truer and stirred something in me. Maybe it’s the fact that she doesn’t don a sexy outfit, revealing her thighs or boobs or both. Maybe it’s because she isn’t some goddess from a mythical land, but an American woman who overcame adversity to work in a “man’s job.” Both are excellent reasons I could have gravitated to her, but it’s something more than just those things. If you don’t know, “Captain Marvel” tells the story of Carol Danvers, played in this iteration by Brie Larson. Danvers is a United States Air Force pilot who has lost all memory of her past and gained supernatural powers that allow her to shoot beams of fire from her palms. She’s fighting for the Kree civilization, an alien society from a galaxy far away that seeks to bring peace everywhere by eradicating the rebels Skrulls, a green-skinned, shape-shifting alien race. When a mission goes awry, Danvers is expelled back to Earth. It’s 1995 and the soundtrack won’t let you forget it. With the help of S.H.I.E.L.D agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) she must choose: complete her mission or uncover her past. I won’t sugarcoat it for you. “Captain Marvel” is a clunky, imperfect origin story. There isn’t a high enough prescription for your rosy glasses that can prevent you from overlooking some glaring deficiencies. Some character motivations feel underdeveloped. There’s a lack of exploring her origin, something we traditionally expect in the first film of a franchise. Larson as the Kree warrior is purposefully robotic in her delivery to create an obvious contrast to when she unravels back into Carol, an artistic choice that, while understandable, impedes any sort of emotional connection we have with her. At first watch, this seems to hold the character back. A lot. Taking her for what you see and nothing more, Carol Danvers is as close to one-dimensional as we’ve seen in this genre, an uncomplicated superhero whose tribulations growing up play more like a Nike ad, highlighting snapshots of Danvers as a young girl, falling and getting back up again without deep diving into anything of substance. But Carol Danvers isn’t cold. She’s doing her job and doing it well. She is constantly reprimanded by her mentor, played by Jude Law, for succumbing to her emotions instead of allowing logic to guide her fight. She is told to suppress her instincts when something rubs her funny. She is told not to think for herself, not to act unless commanded, not to shine like the light that flows through her veins. It is only when she releases these invisible bonds – the expectations placed on her, the decorum dictated by others, et cetera – that she regains her humanity and has full control of her indomitable powers. That is her enemy here. Not aliens and their fight for power, but her imprisonment by the rules society places upon her. It is the only real struggle we see, and I say that quite literally. Once Carol becomes Captain Marvel in all her flying, blazing glory, there isn’t a battle to fight. She – and here are those pesky spoilers – literally takes out dozens of nuclear alien bombs and scares away the aggressors in under a minute. Maybe two.  Written and directed by longtime collaborators Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the film doesn’t follow the formula. Typically, there is a defining moment in their childhood, a turning point, often a death of someone close. An enemy emerges. There is no epic showdown like we’re used to seeing in these kinds of movies. You know, where the hero *almost* dies but somehow regains the strength to defeat the bad guy one-handed in the middle of a snow storm or on top of a moving train. That’s not what we get here, and that can be kind of a bummer. We like seeing the underdog fight to survive and come out victorious. We want to see them work, to show off just how powerful they are. So while I also felt let down by the lack of action, I left the theater with far more to chew on. I felt vindicated too. Here is a female superhero who, once she let herself be the powerful vigilante she was meant to be, was more everything than all the male superheroes of the past. She personifies strength and courage, and she's a character our daughters should see represented on the big screen."

"Jan 27, 2021",positive," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- When you think about the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Black Panther,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""The Avengers"" come to mind. ""Captain Marvel,"" the 21st film in the franchise and the first led by a female, belongs in that conversation. The movie, out Friday, is a blast-- a rip roarin’ thrill ride full of humor, heart and guilty-pleasure ’90s nostalgia that flips the expectation of an origin story genre on its head. When we meet our heroine, known at first only as Vers and played by Oscar winner Brie Larson, she already has her powers. The problem: she's not exactly sure how she got them or why memories she swears aren't her's keep popping up in her head. As much as DC's cinematic universe is criticized, the studio broke the superhero gender barrier two years before Marvel with ""Wonder Woman."" ""Captain Marvel"" makes up for being late to the game by casting three strong women in lead roles. Larson's Carol Danvers teams up with Lashana Lynch's hot-shot pilot Maria Rambeau and their mentor, a mysterious scientist named Wendy Lawson, played by Annette Bening, in an attempt to save Earth from getting in the middle of a war between two alien species. Female empowerment and equality are part of the film's DNA and the aspirational impact the movie is sure to have on a generation of young girls can't be understated. Yet, this isn't an overtly political film. Think more ""Top Gun,"" less ""Jane Eyre."" Marvel says the Academy Award-winning actress from ""Room"" was the only choice to play Captain Marvel and it's easy to see why. Larson brings humanity, vulnerability, strength, spunk, humor and general bad-assness to the role of a woman with extraordinary powers who has no idea who she really is. The Australian actor (""Ready Player One,"" ""Rogue One"") is this decade's version of Alan Rickman, a villain-for-hire who brings nuance and complexity to every bad guy he plays. His green-skinned, shape-shifting Talos chews up the scenery, stealing every minute he's onscreen, well, except whenever that aforementioned cute, cuddly cat shows up. Mendelsohn's Skrull warrior follows in the recent Marvel tradition of interesting villains like Black Panther's Killmonger and Infinity War's Thanos, nemeses who are at once cunning and dangerous, yet complicated and even empathetic. If you grew up in the ’90s, you’ll get a kick out of the old websites, Internet cafes, Blockbuster Video, Radio Shack, payphones and grunge fashions. You’ll also probably feel a little old. There are more ’90s references in “Captain Marvel” than an episode of “Saved by the Bell.” Fury boasting about the technological marvel that is his two-way pager and the group impatiently waiting for an audio recording on a CD-ROM to load are two of the movie’s LOL moments. Forget about trying to decide if the CGI de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson is convincing or not, if you've ever wondered why Fury (never call him Nick or Nicholas) wears an eye patch or how he came up with the name for the Avengers initiative, well, wonder no more! Fury and Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson aren't the only faces you'll recognize. Yep, that's Djimon Hounsou as Korath and Lee Pace as Ronan, reprising their roles from ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" So, in essence, you're getting five origin stories for the price of one. What a deal! The movie's MacGuffin is also a familiar one. And, the big reveal towards the end of the film will have you sneaking on to your phone to Google what happened between the end of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and the opening scene of ""The Avengers."" You don't have to be a cat person to be smitten by this adorable kitty who may or may not be of this planet. Don't even try to fight its charms. The damn cat is that irresistible. If you're not all that excited about ""Avengers: Endgame"" hitting theaters next month, the first of two post-credits scenes will change your mind.

"Dec 7, 2020",positive," vicious war rages between the Kree nation and the shapeshifting Skrull race. After obtaining new intel indicating the Skrulls are attempting to acquire a light-speed engine, Kree Starforce Command sends an elite squad of soldiers, led by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), to retrieve a spy hidden on a besieged border planet. But when the team arrive, they are quickly ambushed by Skrulls, allowing Yon-Rogg’s brash, impulsive recruit Vers (Brie Larson) to be captured by the enemy. Probing the girl’s mind for clues, the Skrulls discover that a Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) has the technology they’re looking for – and she resides on Earth. Unaware of her own connection to the scientist, but determined to stop the Skrulls at any cost, Vers escapes and heads to the human homeworld to find Lawson first. Once there, she convinces the leader of a counter-terrorism agency, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), to aid in her quest to eliminate the Skrull menace. But as the resolute warrior inches closer to her target, memories from her past return, threatening to destroy both the mission and her life. From the very first scene, Vers has vaporous, orange energy billowing from her fists. And she’s on another planet, much like the alien worlds of “Star Wars,” serving as a soldier of Starforce. This introduction instantly generates a difficulty for the cohesiveness of Marvel’s other entities, especially since most of those are, at the outset, earthbound, gently easing the extraterrestrial elements into the frame – rather than beginning with outlandishness outright. Nevertheless, the plot itself is actually largely independent from the last few Marvel chapters, which have been so steeped in storylines and subplots from other pictures that the previous entries were essential prerequisites for understanding the current characters and motives. “Lose control again and you’ll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence.” Despite the standalone nature of “Captain Marvel,” the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design, structuring, and visuals. Not only is Vers suffering from amnesia (a concept so hackneyed that it initially appears irredeemable), but she also hasn’t harnessed her superpowers, and she doesn’t know how she came to be superhuman (the eventual revelation offers only further questions). During some introductory training and combat missions, audiences are treated to a succession of rousing speeches, valiant endeavors, and physical formidability – all peppered with witty yet unconvincing banter (as if the writers were forced to copy the language of “Guardians of the Galaxy,” whose successes with levity ultimately changed the direction for a lot of the franchise’s scripting) – along with action sequences that are so poorly choreographed that it’s impossible to know with certainty who is getting the upper hand at any given moment. Perhaps the filmmakers are using their easy CG accessibility to hide the lack of real fighting skills mustered by the cast. As one obligatory set piece follows another (a train chase in daylight fairs better, allowing viewers to clearly follow the freneticism), a prominent ‘90s soundtrack accompanies each significant transition, once again stealing a move from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” playbook. Fortunately, it’s effective, especially during climactic showdowns toward the end. A blithe buddy-cop vibe also crops up, as Vers partners with Fury to highlight the inefficiency of deprecated technology and to decipher the colossal advantages of their shapeshifting adversaries. Curiously, the story grows more interesting as the film progresses, aiding in mitigating the disappointment of the start. The mystery of Vers’ Earthly ties, paired with the task of discovering her purpose (like in “The Matrix”) boosts her appeal; as she uncovers her past, the picture itself begins to find its identity. It’s beneficial, too, that a glimpse of pathos works its way in, comparable to the original “Iron Man,” through one of its most influential supporting characters. “You struggle with your emotions.” Despite the storytelling stumbles, a number of trite lines, and the routine nature of the meteor-sized plot holes (or standard superhero deficiencies, such as a failure to give boundaries to Vers’ abilities or limitations to anyone’s intermittent invincibility), it’s notable that Vers doesn’t have a romantic counterpart. She’s never once driven by cinematic love, nor does she need to protect (or, worse, be saved by) a lover; somehow, the film has excluded all scenes of light flirting, which are staples of many space operas. Plus, there’s not a bared midriff, exposed calf, or hint of cleavage in sight. “Captain Marvel” has expunged virtually all sexuality from its premise – and it doesn’t hurt it a bit. The movie is airy and entertaining, with an uncommonly resolute finale, all without Vers needing any sort of romantic entanglements to connect with (or titillate) viewers.

"Oct 1, 2020",positive,"Captain Marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor... But regardless, it's still a satisfying entry in the MCU carried by an effortless star turn from Brie Larson."
"Sep 4, 2020",positive," If you're expecting Captain Marvel to inspire the same kind of awe that Black Panther did, you may find yourself a touch disappointed by this Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson) directed entry into the Marvel Comics Universe.  While Black Panther carried the weight of an entire culture on its shoulders, Captain Marvel quietly breaks its ground while telling a good story well enough that you'll likely find yourself eagerly anticipating the next Captain Marvel adventure.  Captain Marvel is a good film that does great things for the Marvel Comics Universe, the first Marvel film to be co-directed by a female and second to be centered around a female superhero, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel.  Captain Marvel doesn't truly marvel until late in the game, choosing to immerse itself in the vastness of Larson's depth of talent. An Academy Award-winner for 2015's Room, Larson brings to Captain Marvel something I've often found woefully lacking in the Marvel Comics Universe - depth of feeling and emotional expression. It's not particularly surprising given the indie cred of co-directors Boden & Fleck, but it's almost shocking and jarring within the Marvel Comics Universe, a universe that has often emphasized razzle, dazzle, and emotional frazzle.  In Captain Marvel, Larson plays a Kree Warrior known as Vers, who brings a kick-ass sort of bravura to her usual Marvel mix of martial arts meets photon blasts. Larson not only brings emotional depth to the Marvel Comics Universe, she restores the kind of fun and frivolity we used to experience from the universe before Avengers started avenging and it seemed like the entire universe became ultra self-aware of its ultra self-importance.  Part of that, one could suppose, is that Captain Marvel is set in 1995, a time period that allows for more than its share of fun and a time period years before recent events in the Marvel Comics Universe as most vividly indicated by Samuel L. Jackson's rather fresh, full-eyed appearance as Nick Fury. There's a freshness to Captain Marvel that is refreshingly unburdened by co-existing with other storylines, at least for the most part, within this increasingly layered and complex universe.  Larson's Vers lands on planet Earth, known as Planet C-53 within the film, and it's a place that feels familiar to her with memories, good ones, of her days as an Air Force Top Gun-style fly-girl, hard-flying and hard-partying and a genuine badass all the way around. These scenes serve up hints of bawdiness, though we're never quite sure just how authentic these memories existing in her mind really are. Captain Marvel is in many ways a film that emphasizes Vers's search for her place within her powers and her place within the universe.  She believes herself to be a Kree, mentored by Kree leader Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), a good guy with an aura of being something else that we can't quite define. The Skrulls are the bad guys, led by slimy bad guy Taros (Ben Mendelsohn).  Yet, we know that this is a Marvel Comics Universe film and we know that within the universe things are not always as they seem. The same may very well be true here, but it's how Larson brings this searching to life, even when the script disappoints (and it does!), that makes Captain Marvel such an infinitely enjoyable film.  The way that Vers's search for her own identity is played out in the usual Marvel paint-by-numbers way, the obvious patriarchal references with the fumbling do-gooder spirit of an Elmer Fudd cartoon, yet what's not even remotely paint-by-numbers is how Larson spiritedly brings it all too life. Larson is simply far too gifted of an actress to do anything paint-by-numbers and she rather magnificently finds every nuance of Vers, Carol Danvers, and Captain Marvel.  Does Captain Marvel have hints of sexism and stereotype within its story's framework? I learned long ago that just as I, a film critic with a disability, don't tend to listen to those without disabilities when it comes to ableism neither is it my place to speak to a level of sexism I've never experienced. I rather look forward to hearing from the nation's female critic voices and from audience members as to their own experiences in watching Captain Marvel.  What I will say is that as much as I enjoyed Wonder Woman, I had a deeper appreciation and a fuller understanding of Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel, perhaps owing to its being a true origin story, feels more fully alive and vibrant and complex and real. While feeling ""real"" isn't necessarily a Marvel Comics Universe requirement, it works rather nicely here.  Boden & Fleck were seemingly unusual choices to direct within the Marvel Comics Universe, their low-budget indie cred possibly even more indie than a filmmaker like Taika Watiti and their signature style so pronounced that it was hard to imagine how they could possibly get out of their own ways and really pull this off.  The good news? They do. They're filmmakers, after all. While they undeniably have a signature style, their work here is in service to the story and the motion picture and, while the story itself gets a bit mumbled and jumbled, Captain Marvel works on a far greater level than a good majority of us ever expected. Captain Marvel is both stylish and substantial, a film that emphasizes meaning as much as mayhem and a film as much emotional badassery as kick-ass action sequences. Will it necessarily please every Marvel Comics Universe fan? Not a chance. Is it the best MCU film to come out of the gate? Nope, it's not.  Set in 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. is a fledging agency and Jackson's Nick Fury, digitally de-aged here, is lighter and funnier and doesn't yet have the weight of the universe on his shoulders. Boden and Fleck clearly have fun digging within the Blockbuster Video-dotted landscape of 1995 America and Captain Marvel feels like a throwback that really isn't that much of a throwback. Captain Marvel gives us the accident in which Vers and her superior, Lawson (Annette Bening), crash-landed into a desert and how this crash landing ends up planting within Vers, and if you don't see the relationship with Carol Danvers you're not paying attention, and ends up giving her the powers that she will have to learn how to harness. There is, of course, a connection to other MCU films if you're watching the details and paying attention to everything that unfolds.  On earth, Larson's Carol begins to find her community within the likes of Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), a former fly-buddy, and her daughter (Akira Akbar), while a new group of alien compatriots will enter the picture and add depth and meaning and soul to the entire scenario.  Captain Marvel is the film that it needed to be, perhaps just a tad less than we hoped it would be yet if we're being honest it's also just a tad better than we expected it to be. Much of this credit goes to Larson, who embodies the fullness of Vers/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel with emotional depth, action badassery, intelligence, and an abundance of humor that gives you an identifiable, relatable superhero who is more badass than you will ever be. Boden and Fleck rise to the occasion of creating something far outside their usual cinematic universe yet they do so with intelligence, wisdom, occasional chaos, a little too much playing it safe, but ultimately more funk than clunk. While Captain Marvel may lack the culture-shifting force of Black Panther, it's a force unto itself and a mighty entertaining one at that. "
"Sep 2, 2020",positive," Dirigida por Anna Boden y Ryan Fleck y protagonizada por Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law y Ben Mendelsohn. La primera superheroína de Marvel en obtener su propia película, una historia de origen que por momentos no se siente tan fascinante, que causa arrugas en la perfectamente llevada línea del tiempo del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel, que desanima por su carencia de posición antagónica, pero que de alguna forma logra su cometido de introducir el personaje más poderoso que hemos visto en este universo cinematográfico, logra su cometido de, en algunos momentos, hacernos saltar de la emoción, y logra su cometido de conectar la historia con los eventos actuales mientras a la vez revela verdades, dejando a muchos fanáticos con sentimientos encontrados. “Captain Marvel” sufre de un problema grave en la historia de un héroe, y es la falta de un villano que establezca una verdadera amenaza para ella, o una posición antagónica en sí. Tanto así que a veces se sentía ella misma como su propia enemiga, el camino a saber la verdad sobre su pasado era el combustible de la historia, no el tener que destruir o evitar las acciones de un antagonista. Esto hace que la película se aleje del género acción e incursione más en la aventura. Sin embargo, el pasado mismo del personaje es suficientemente intrigante como para despertar el interés de verdaderos fanáticos, a parte de que juega un papel muy importante en el esquema completo del MCU. Así como también los posicionados pero no tan impresionantes tiros en la historia funcionan y permiten un sabor distinto y alejado de lo cliché. Siempre he dicho qué Samuel L. Jackson es una de esas adiciones invaluables al MCU, verlo joven no solo revitalizó nuestro cariño por el personaje de Nick Fury, sino que nos interesó en ver más sobre su pasado. Quizás en la película de Black Widow también, que dé más está decir, debió venir mucho antes que esta. Otros personajes como Agente Coulson y los Kree, son prueba de la magia de crear un universo cinematográfico donde hasta el más mínimo detalle agrada. Las escenas de acción son como tesoros que añoramos pues aunque no obtenemos muchas, son verdaderamente entretenidas y tenemos un pequeño avance de la magnitud de los poderes de esta heroína. Brie Larson pudo estar mejor, pero no me disgustó. Sus escenas post-créditos causan preguntas serias sobre la cronología de los eventos y el manejo del tiempo. Y aunque al final termina siendo un simple enganche para “Avengers: Endgame”, fue una buena adición al universo. Hay que ser francos, “Captain Marvel” está lejos de ser la mejor película del MCU, pero eso no la hace una mala película. Y es que después de “Avengers: Infinity War”, Marvel no solo subió las apuestas y las expectativas de cada uno de sus fanáticos, sino que al parecer no han logrado levantarse. Las dos películas que hemos recibido luego de la tercera entrega de Avengers, no han podido darnos aquel inigualable sentimiento de asombro que usualmente tenemos al salir de una película del MCU. Poniendo a muchas personas a preocuparse sobre el resultado de “Avengers: Endgame”. Todo esto recae en la osada opinión de que quizás el hype les está matando la película a muchos fanáticos, pocas cosas viven a sus expectativas poniéndole un reto a los creadores y limitantes a ellos mismos."
"Aug 27, 2020",positive," There’s a long overdue essence within Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Ten years of interconnected and episodic storytelling of a male-driven diaspora, we finally get to see Marvel’s first female-led adventure story – Captain Marvel. If there is something we’ve learnt recently from the cinematic world, Wonder Woman, Black Panther and even Crazy Rich Asians have all represented the incremental changes that highlight the world we see.  Captain Marvel flies into the fold as another step forward in that enriched development. There’s no escaping the magnitude.  It’s a huge deal, and as the cinematic universe gears up for its literal endgame, the role she will play will be pivotal in re-shaping its future.  The disgusting troll behaviour can have their meltdowns, attack Brie Larson for the relevant comments about the lack of diversity amongst press critics and proceed with an attempted derailment in its financial prospects.  But as Captain Marvel soars at the box office, it’s another indicator at how inclusion speaks volumes in captivating and inspiring the audience.  In other words, you can’t stop progression. But as the quality of the film goes, Captain Marvel continues the trend of solid additions as part of the MCU line-up.  It’s far from perfect but does enough to provide the escapist fun and entertainment needed to roll into its anticipated main event. If Avengers: Infinity War was the emotional and consequential reckoning of Thanos’ finger snap, Captain Marvel is the light-hearted, joyful pick-me-up.  Straight out of the Phase One manifesto,  Captain Marvel’s introduction attempts to balance character story, a ‘connect the dots’ mystery-arc with the lingering question that everyone had on their minds since the end of Infinity War. Immediately for directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the rush of juggling the exposition and pressure to tell Carol Danvers’ (Brie Larson) story struggles in its opening act.  Thrust into the big-budget Hollywood machine (and occasionally, their lack of experience shows), it’s an understandable slow start.  Similar to Wonder Woman’s transition from the comics to her cinematic debut, the Carol Danvers story has evolved, undergoing a transforming cultural shift from the sexualised ‘damsel in distress’ characterisation (that was laced with controversy) into a feminist icon.  When there has been a lack of exposure for female superheroes on the big screen, resorting to comparisons is a pointless exercise.  The Carol Danvers story is another female example where her uniqueness doesn’t conform to a standardise agenda or stereotype as a single definition of a female superhero.  She’s not called ‘Marvel’s mightiest Avenger’ for no reason, and her quick introduction covers her struggling grasp of reality and physical training in an ‘off-world’ environment (known as Hala) that is preparing her for an upcoming mission against the Skrulls.  However rough around the edges, it’s better than an empty void. It’s also understandable when our central character is starting from an unconventional position, already possessing her powers from the get-go, having no prior introduction besides the pager reveal in Infinity War and informing non-comic audiences with the basic information about her character. That’s a lot to take in, especially when we are used to a conventional template structure where character arcs are defined by the growth from their powers.  Captain Marvel’s beginnings are psychological rather than physical, not driven by ego or arrogance (Tony Stark) or a physical disadvantage (Steve Rogers).  It’s not weighed down by a burdening love interest nor is it overly sexualised.  Again, the transitions are not perfect, choosing to rush to its endpoint, but as I said before, it’s better than an empty void. Thankfully, Captain Marvel finds its feet once it escapes the space drama.  Crash landing on Earth (circa 1995) through a Blockbuster video store (aka the biggest statement of its cultural environment), it adopts the classic ‘fish out of water’ scenario that we’ve seen previously in the first two Captain America films. It grounds its narrative into something tangible, warming in a 90s glaze with cultural milestones to Independence Day, Pulp Fiction and The Long Kiss Goodnight (thanks to Carol’s partnership with Nick Fury (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson)) and even The X-Files with a classic alien autopsy scene. Just reading that sentence, I can already envision the outrage.  What?  Are you mad?  Don’t you dislike that director?  Girl Bye!  My response would be like The Emperor from Star Wars – “Good, release your anger!” If Michael Bay had directed Captain Marvel, it would have been atrociously incoherent.  If you take a look at the Transformers films for example, collectively they tick all of the trope-based boxes he has defined himself by; fast editing cuts, headache-inducing action spectacles, sexual objectification, horribly misguided societal stereotypes and juvenile lampooning.  You’ll be glad to know that’s not where my head was thinking – but at least I got your attention regardless! But think back to the decade in which Captain Marvel is set.  In that repertoire, you had films like Bad Boys, The Rock and Armageddon – arguably peak Bay.  Or, let me lead this with better examples from directors that helped shape the decade – Tony Scott with The Last Boy Scout, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State or James Cameron with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and True Lies (which got an explosive nod in the film).  Yes, these examples are hyper-masculine adventures that subject their lead characters to heroic statuses (sadly female-led action-adventure films were far and few in between).  Yes, those examples were male-driven by male directors with a ‘male gaze’.  But from a visual aesthetic (which is important to note), those films embodied a ‘larger than life’ quality where it was bombastically over the top.  Specifically, with Michael Bay and Tony Scott, their commercial backgrounds opened the doors to over-saturated shots, low camera angles and dramatic lighting that embraced a dynamic colour palette and composition.  Take away the flaws in its narration (and maybe watch it with the sound off), but when the magnetism is done right, it creates a recognisable excitement within its direction that perfectly captures a mood.  Whenever I think of the 90s amongst all the treasures and cultures that Captain Marvel managed to revisit, the visual stylisation didn’t go far enough. To put this in a broader context as to why I think this is important, think back to the impact of Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther.  When it was nominated for Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars, the typical backlash appeared – “it was good, but was it Oscar-worthy?”  In a rarity amongst the MCU films, Black Panther felt different. On a cultural basis, it positively showcases an African civilisation, escaping the damaging yet reinforced stereotypes often perpetuated in the media as criminals, gangsters, jive-talkers, mammy figures, poverty-stricken citizens, generic tribal figures, comic sidekicks or angry black women.  We’re introduced to a black superhero in the MCU who is allowed to be the hero with female characters empowered by their confidence and contributing voice.  That essence is cultivated within Wakanda, an integral part of its evaluation with afro-futurism and beauty running through its veins.  It’s an aspect you rarely question, and because Coogler establishes an identity behind its multi-layered concept, its presentation made the fictionalisation of Wakanda believable.  Whether you agreed it was Oscar-worthy or not, it’s still unlike any other MCU film to date with the degradation of the visual effects in the third act its only fault.  Also, it’s just a great [bleeping] movie – end of story. Honestly, this is just a personal preference.  Summing up the 90s with every factoid is an impossible mission for a two-hour movie.  This was not going to be ‘the Con-Air of the MCU’ (although visually, that would have been cool) and you’re not going to get Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson singing Aerosmith’s I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing as its end credits!  Your enjoyment of Captain Marvel is not hinged on this point.  Who knows, the decision could have been intentional, avoiding alienation from unfamiliar fans who may not have lived through that culture.  But I feel like it missed a trick in not indulging that atmosphere. If you look at the impact of Netflix’s Stranger Things and how the 80s is tightly interwoven within its plot structure, it acknowledges the subtle balance of reinforced nostalgia and an engaging mystery told through that familiarity. Even Captain America: The First Avenger sold 40s America with soft visual palettes and patriotic jingoism from Star Spangled Man. Therefore, Captain Marvel acknowledges Blockbuster Video, acknowledges the CD-ROM joke (which was brilliant) and even acknowledges the jukebox collection of Garbage, No Doubt, TLC and Nirvana, but because of its lack of interest in absorbing its atmosphere, its exploration of the decade could have been a richer experience. In the end, Captain Marvel played it safe. It was the 90s but dealt with a modern lens. The MCU shouldn’t be afraid of making their films stand out visually.  Instead, some scenes have a ‘washed-out’ palette.  Baring in mind, this commentary is not directed solely at Captain Marvel as if it is the only victim of this trait – other MCU films have suffered the same visual characteristics.  But the suggestive visual throwbacks could have been a small gesture without brazenly going over the top.  Could Marvel have placed a twist in that convention?  It wouldn’t have impacted the heart and soul of its overall narrative, especially when Brie Larson carries the film with assurance and confidence. It’s unfair to label Brie’s characterisation of Carol Danvers as ‘robotic’, ‘weak’ or ‘stiff’.  I mean, let’s not forget the ‘smile more’ commentary directed towards her (in which she had a brilliant response on Instagram thanks to Jane Ritt’s poster memes).  As detrimental as they are, these societal elements neatly feed into Captain Marvel‘s response and its goal-achieving message. The film utilises female stigmatisation as its driving motivator, exposed through Carol’s fractured memories where she’s criticised for being a woman.  There’s no escaping the subtlety.  Carol is told she’s told he won’t make it as a pilot (because it’s named a ‘cockpit’ for a reason).  Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) is the embodiment of misogyny and patriarch control.  The exploration is basic, but the referential aspects illustrate the daily subjugation women face.  Whether it’s labels, disparaging language or double standards, they are gestures which rob a voice and identity which thematically sums up Captain Marvel. For Carol Danvers, identity is defined by others around her.  Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) and Yon-Rogg are examples of fear and control, curtailing her natural curiosity for emotional repression – you can’t be a good soldier if you’re doing the ‘in my feelings’ challenge.  Her brainwashed indoctrination into the Kree lifestyle is a mission of ‘blind faith’ which goes unquestioned and unchallenged until Carol arrives on Earth.  She wears a chip on her neck which limits her powers for 3/4 of the film. You can’t get more ‘on the nose’ than that! It says a lot about its messaging where ‘trying to find your place in the world’ can have a relatable outcome.  It’s a weak argument to suggest that Carol lacks personality when her personality is wrapped up in the conflicts surrounding her.  Showcasing her allegiance as a ‘noble warrior hero’, it’s a reinforced ideology which is no different from warlords recruiting child soldiers or individuals groomed into extreme factions for terrorist causes.  They are timely conversations about rhetoric agendas and its consequential damages, especially in regards to refugees and the nature of war (in which Ben Mendelsohn’s Talos is the one to watch out for – a pleasant reversal from characters he has played in the past).  Where it starts to fall into resemblance is Carol’s growing sense of humanity, finding her wit in her partnership with Nick Fury (with some terrific Samuel L. Jackson reactions) and vulnerability in her friendship with Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch).  The power of change resides within her. However, despite its implied context, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still limited by design.  It wants to be brave and challenging, yet its concepts are given a ‘brush stroke’ treatment, remembering that it needs to be in certain places to make sure its overall arc aligns with the rest of the franchise.  Given the longevity of its storytelling, it’s something that we probably take for granted, accepting the flaws as a natural given.  But as a sacrifice, we also lose out on further character definition to make this film more complete. How cool would it have been if the formula was broken for a split second to allow the full-weight of Carol’s revelation to sink in?  Show anger or a rage knowing that six years of her life went missing where she was used as a weapon for an unjust war?  How cool would it have been to delve more into her struggling insecurities between her reality and her memories or play up the dividing paranoia of ‘anyone could be a Skrull’?  Again, it doesn’t dismiss the enjoyment, but it provides Brie Larson and her counterparts with more ample material to play with that adds more flavour to the pot. It leaves you with a feeling of wanting more.  It could have utilised more of the ‘buddy cop’ partnership between Carol Danvers and a softer, cat-loving Nick Fury.  It could have featured more scenes with Maria, utilising the breadth of emotional history they share.  Gemma Chan’s Minn-Erva was underused and should have gotten more screen time.  It ventures to certain points but teases a threshold that’s never crossed.  It doesn’t make it a bad movie, just a missed opportunity to further embrace its hearts and motives. Despite the notable limitations, Captain Marvel delightfully serves its purpose both as a final cornerstone in this epic-long saga but the inspiration gained from seeing a female superhero on screen.  It’s not quite the revolutionary or pioneering film that we expected it to be, but it introduces scope for growth and scale that hopefully is not lost amongst all the loose-threads posed for Avengers: Endgame. Great write-up! I really enjoyed this movie, and the addition of Carol Danvers to the MCU, but it felt like it was missing just a little something that would have taken it from good to great. Agreed, and I think a lot of that has sadly come from the limitations of the universe building from the MCU, playing safe in making sure everything lines up in the bigger picture. Nevertheless, it’s a good start, but it easily could have been more than what was delivered. Yeah, I am hoping that, going forward, the MCU will be less inter-connected, so they can tell some standalone stories that feel a little more unique. I’ll be curious to see what happens after “Endgame,” and if that really does serve as a “reset” for the MCU. "

"Jul 24, 2020",positive," It’s hard to believe it took 21 installments before Marvel introduced a female lead, especially with Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow, Jennifer Lawrence’s Mystique and Halle Berry’s Storm. Ironically, it’s the one area where the DC Extended Universe actually beat Marvel to punch thanks to the blockbuster success of Gal Gadot in Patty Jenkins’ “Wonder Woman” (2017). Be that as it may, the time has finally arrived with “Captain Marvel,” a film that plays it safe with familiar formula but is so entertainingly empowering that it will inspire girls everywhere. The story opens with former U.S. Air Force pilot Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as a member of the intergalactic fleet Starforce, fighting alongside Kree to battle the rival alien Skrulls. Along the way, she’s haunted by visions of her human past, forcing a return to Planet C-53 (Earth), where she overcomes her amnesia to discover the source and extent of her super powers. Oscar winner Brie Larson is a compelling choice for the lead, having appeared in the quasi-superhero flick “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” (2010). Her breakthrough came in the South By Southwest champion “Short Term 12” (2013), followed by “The Spectacular Now” (2013), “Trainwreck” (2015) and her Best Actress win for “Room” (2015), which remains one of the best films of this century. Since then, she’s stumbled a bit from the overblown “Kong: Skull Island” (2017) to the lackluster adaptation of the best-selling book “The Glass Castle” (2017). Now, “Captain Marvel” is the blockbuster rebound she needed, thrusting her into the spotlight for a whole new generation of young moviegoers to admire. Ironically, she’s an enigmatic icon whose personality remains uncertain due to the amnesic premise of Carol piecing together her backstory alongside the audience. We never feel like we get to know her until the final act. At least she holds her own in the action sequences, starting the film in a training bout of hand-to-hand combat. The scene opens with her already on the ground, joking that she was just punched in the face by her male counterpart. At first, we think this is a calculated attempt by Marvel to avoid man-on-women violence, but the scene ends with such a punch on screen. It’s a fascinating cultural bellwether, showing the erratic evolution of Hollywood ethics from (a) acceptability with James Cagney grapefruits in “The Public Enemy” and Cary Grant face palms in “The Philadelphia Story,” to (b) a taboo subject only reserved for villains (i.e. Michael slapping Kay in “The Godfather: Part II”), to (c) now equal footing in men vs. women slugfests. Jude Law and Annette Bening memorably play flip sides of the coin, respectively playing her alien mentor Yon-Rogg and her human mentor Mar-Vell. Rounding out the cast are Ben Mendelsohn as the shape-shifting Skrull leader and Lashana Lynch as the wise veteran friend Maria raising her precocious daughter Monica (Akira Akbar, Young Beth from “This is Us”). Best of all, we get the glue to the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson, who was digitally de-aged 25 years in order to play a young Nick Fury. The technology has increasingly improved over the past decade, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800 in “Terminator: Genisys” (2015) and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in “Rogue One” (2016). It’s also fun to see Fury before the eye patch, as we learn exactly how he lost his eye (it’s hilarious). Beyond the deep roster, the most memorable roles are actually cameos, first by an adorable cat named Goose (i.e. “Top Gun”), and second a touching tribute to the late Stan Lee in both the opening credits and his final cameo. My vote: if they can digitally de-age Jackson, they should keep digitally putting Stan Lee in every Marvel film (surely, he’d want it that way). Filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (“Half Nelson”) carry on Lee’s legacy of lighthearted popcorn fare despite a slow start in outer space bogged down by a gloomy, cluttered Act 1. Like “Aquaman,” it’s disorienting to fracture the narrative of an origin story, rolling out the source of her powers in jarring flashbacks rather than active, high-stakes moments. It’s too cute by half and the one place where a more linear approach would prove more accessible. There are other more formulaic moments, as Larson spares the villain for another sequel. We won’t spoil why or how, but it’s consistently odd how superheroes have no qualms killing a million henchmen then feel guilty about harming the evil mastermind in the final showdown. Do supervillains pay superheroes under the table to ensure that there’s another prize fight? While this reveals flaws of the larger franchise model, there’s no denying the nostalgic joy of the “fun and games” in Act 2. The script takes off when Larson lands on Earth for a distinctly “Men in Black” vibe, genuinely surprising plot twists and plenty of ’90s pop culture references. You’ll delight at CD-ROM gags, Nine Inch Nails T-shirts and Blockbuster Video settings where Larson zaps a cardboard cutout of “True Lies” and inspects a VHS copy of “The Right Stuff.” Hailed by The Washington Post for “his savantlike ability to name every Best Picture winner in history,"" Jason Fraley began at WTOP as Morning Drive Writer in 2008, film critic in 2011 and Entertainment Editor in 2014, providing daily arts coverage on-air and online."
"Jul 20, 2020",positive,"At a positively brisk two hours, the film has an old-school action movie vibe that is a long-overdue introduction to a character who holds great promise in years to come."
"Jul 20, 2020",positive," Late into Captain Marvel, the first-ever female-fronted superhero film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a series of sequences shows Carol Danvers physically falling and rising at different junctures in her life. Every small act that she completes of getting up on her feet after hitting the ground is a sort of replay of the mishap that put her the alien Kree capital of Hala as much as it is a pointer to the big flight that she is will take once she is able to figure out how and why she is meant to be an invincible superhero. Her fall-and-rise montage is at the same time a measure of the magnitude of the struggle that her ascent has been - and her battles will be going forward. Captain Marvel, MCU's 21st movie and the first co-directed by a woman, Anna Boden, plays largely by the rules of the genre, but it juggles with its narrative sequencing to mirror the unsteady state of the protagonist's mind, which assailed by self-doubt and amnesia. This is, therefore, a solid character-driven arc: not surprising because the lead Brie Larson and Boden and her directing partner Ryan Fleck have come this far in their respective careers on the back of subtly affecting human stories crafted in the independent space. Both the actress and the two directors, newcomers to this scale and nature of moviemaking, are able to infuse the story of the creation of a new avenging angel with a degree of freshness, both in terms of substance and narrative approach. The film might appear a touch low-key, but that could well be the principal factor that sets it apart from most of the others that have gone before. Captain Marvel, set in the mid-1990s, is an origin story but it works also as a self-contained tale of a girl who discovers that she can fly and shoot photon blasts from her ""supercharged hand"". Larson is terrific as Vers/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. She is infinitely better at etching out a believable figure than Gal ""Wonder Woman"" Gadot, who had to fall back on more conventional means. The Room actress brings the skills that she displayed in her Oscar-winning performance in the hostage drama to bear emphatically upon the fleshing out of a larger-than-life alien-human hybrid warrior who has to reckon with many hurdles on the way to claiming her place as one of the most powerful superheroes among The Avengers. Larson is impressive as she moves smoothly from the discovery of her superhuman qualities to the understanding of her purpose in the universe to the emotional tugs and pulls of friendship - with her flying companion and best friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), with whom she is reunited, which ignites in her mind flashes of the past as does the incursions into her memory by Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mandelsohn) - and fractured remembrances. Footage from the next Marvel outing (The Avengers: Endgame) is revealed half way through the film's end credits. It is set for release in April. With five more Captain Marvel entries up ahead, Larson seems rather well suited for the job, but she does in ways that are markedly different from the ones that conventional screen superheroes are known to favour. The lead actress receives great support from a cast of charismatic actors - Annette Bening (in a dual role), Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury, digitally de-aged, minus the eye-patch and with a full mop of hair) and Jude Law (as Yon-Rogg, the mentor of Vers, supposedly the ""best version"" of Carol Danvers that the film introduces at the outset). Surprisingly, one of the most consummate scene-stealers in Captain Marvel is a cat. You sit up and expect a surprise every time the feline actor is on the screen. Other enjoyable moments are delivered by the game of verbal one-upmanship that Carol and Fury play. In one sequence, the two banter over whether Marvel or Mar-Vell rings better. Fury mentions the 60s African-American girl group The Marvelettes and insists that 'Marvel' scores higher on the phonetic front. It is an in-joke of course, but does it contribute anything to the narrative besides a bit of mild diversion? The rushed first quarter of Captain Marvel is strewn with moments and characters that come and go without causing a ripple. So you may not marvel at some of the film's jabs at revisionism. Yet owing to a lively pivotal performance, Captain Marvel generally flies well clear of the turbulences in its path. When she is just Vers - an abbreviation of Danvers - a warrior in the elite Kree military unit, Starforce, Yon-Rogg advises her to ""control her impulses"" because ""there is nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion"". There isn't much point in the advice: she unaware why she has wound up in Hala. The audience does know. Vers is a former US Air Force pilot, who now has super strength but does not quite know how to channel it. She is a crucial cog in the Kree wheel in the fight against the Skrulls, a race of shape-shifting aliens threatening to overrun the universe. There is too much crammed in the initial stages the two-hour film for all of it to make sense. Captain Marvel hits its strides once Carol Danvers, at the end of a botched mission, returns to Earth, crashing through the roof of a Blockbuster store. It is the 90s and six years have elapsed since the aircraft crash that separated Carol from her best friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch). The reunion is inevitably emotional, if not always convincing, and it imparts a strongly human touch to the tale. Carol teams up with Fury, who is still figuring out the ropes of being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. They form an unlikely pair - not that Captain Marvel warms up to him immediately - but they complement each other as they go about defying expectations and seeking to pull off the impossible. Of course, Captain Marvel is a superhero movie and nothing is impossible here. Apart from the slew of de rigueur action sequences, the film's sense of 'humanity' and dollops of wry humour - this despite the fact that Yon-Rogg asserts early on in unambiguous terms that humour is a distraction for a warrior - keep it flowing pretty nicely. If not an outright marvel, this script has more warmth than, and just as much power as, Wonder Woman."
"Jul 13, 2020",positive," Finally, The MCU has followed Warner Bros DC lead with delivering its first female lead superhero film despite the dummy throwing of certain fanboys for this particular comic book adaptation. Leading the charge with our own real-life feminist hero in Brie Larson, a woman who has been compared to Hitler simple for stating she wanted a more diverse roster of press on the recent tour for the film, like the character she has had to fight off some pretty toxic attitudes and she has done it with style. Set during the ’90s and pre Avenger’s, Larson plays Carol Danvers aka Vers aka Captain Marvel, a fierce fighting machine on an elite Kree Military team with no recollection of her past. Under the guidance of Jude Law’s Yon-Rogg, Vers tries to control her powers which spiral into a superhuman strength once her emotions take hold. If there are any comparisons to be made with an emotional woman at this point, I for one don’t mind being compared to a scary mean fighting machine when my emotions take over. The origin story gives birth to our new saviour – if rumours are too believed in regards to Avengers: Endgame – As Vers takes root on Earth while on a mission to stop an intergalactic war between two Alien forces. We aren’t just here to see a fierce woman save worlds, we are here to witness her journey of self-discovery, a journey that opens up her mind to a new world of possibilities with a subtle hint of unspoken feminism. A token raising of the eyebrow or a damning look with an all-knowing smirk screaming to the fellas I am just as good as you are… in fact, watch this I’m better. Comedy has always been a staple of this universe and it’s still here in abundance. Why not pair that with the internet’s most cherished thing, a cat by the name of Goose, once belonging to Annette Bening’s Mar-Vell. Goose plays a pivotal part in the second half of the film, pairing the cat with a de-aged and eye-patch less Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) hit a few moments of comedy gold. Oh if you’re still asking the question of how Fury came to lose his eye, all is explained here. Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have come from an indie background with films such as Ryan Gosling’s Half Nelson and Mississippi Grind, atheistically their grainy raw stamp gives the picture an edge we don’t usually experience in the genre. It’s a perfect pairing for its 90’s nostalgia setting. Heavily featuring a mixtape soundtrack of iconic tracks to a crash landing scene in which a Blockbuster store breaks Vers fall. You’ve got that Top Gun vibe with the switched gender-flip and most importantly it speaks to all those little girls always pigeon-holed as tomboys screaming the message, no matter how many times you’re knocked down, get back up and try again. Even Captain Marvel’s ascent into space has an animated CGI vision you would expect from any good 90’s kids series. Larson brings an understated cheekiness to Captain Marvel; sometimes vying on the corny in her superhero stance she gives meaning to an unusually nuanced character. Fury can almost be considered Jackson’s second skin but here, 90’s Fury is still wet behind the ears, full of naivety and optimism before the cynicism creeps in. Ben Mendelsohn as the shape-shifting Skrull Talos is nothing short of deceptive drama and tickling funny. Full of knowing nods to the Universe including Agents of Shield, it’s bound to push a few buttons when Fury stumbles on the name for his team of superheroes – Avengers. Like any of these films, it’s always worth waiting until the very end credit has left the screen."
"Jul 8, 2020",positive," After ten years and twenty films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally provided us with a female-lead entry. Captain Marvel (2019) contains much of what we’ve come to expect from a superhero origin – both positively and negatively. There are some peaks and valleys all throughout the narrative, resulting in a story that has some show-stopping moments but is also hindered by the limitations of having to fit into a larger overall canvas. This isn’t as great as Wonder Woman (2017) was, but that’s ok. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has some of the cooler powers we’ve seen on screen. She has the ability to fly, shoot flames from her hands, has elevated strength, and when she really cuts loose, can ignite an energy explosion from her body that resembles an atom bomb. Needless to say, you don’t want to get on her bad side. On a more personal level, she goes by the name of Vers, member of an alien race known as the Kree, who have been engaged in a long war against the Skrulls, a green-skinned species that has the ability to transform into other forms of life. Under the guidance of her mentor, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Vers has to learn to control her powers so that she can effectively protect her people. Or does she? Co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (who helped write the screenplay with Geneva Roberston-Dworet), gives us a glimpse into another side of Captain Marvel that she is not fully aware of. We get flashbacks to a human life on earth, as a fighter pilot known as Carol Danvers, working on a hush hush project under a mysterious boss (Annette Bening). The flashbacks come fast and often, filling up much of the plot. The editing jumbles these bits, tossing them around so frequently that much of the mystery behind Captain Marvel is revealed by the time we get to the “A-ha!” moment. The setting is in the 1990s. This allows us to see the birth of S.H.I.E.L.D., the government agency that will become a force once the in-story timeline arrives to The Avengers (2012). Thanks to the magic of CGI de-aging, we get introduced to a younger Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) – still with both eyes – who joins Captain Marvel’s adventure. The setting, the question of Captain Marvel’s past, the twists and turns in alliances and betrayals contributes to a cluttered overall whole. There’s a lot going on here and not much time to sit back and iron out all the wrinkles – from Carol Danver’s past, Vers’ responsibility to the Kree and battle against the Skrulls, the vagueness of Bening’s character, and to Nick Fury birthing the idea of a superhero team. All of these pieces are mushed together, barely holding on to coherency. Luckily, Brie Larson sits as the anchor, providing a performance in which all other elements revolve around. While the plotting is a little messy, Larson’s commanding presence helps us feel like we’re never lost. Her work as Captain Marvel/Vers/Danvers is a combination of strength, confusion, and determination, and never at any point does she feel like she’s reaching for a reaction. I’ve read in other reviews that her character arc is like Maverick’s (Tom Cruise) in Top Gun (1986), but that is only partially true. Where Maverick had to learn to control his emotions, Captain Marvel has to learn to let go and ride her instincts to their fullest potential. There is a poignant moment in which we see her, at different ages, stand to her feet after taking a fall. While the execution is clunky, the theming behind it is all too clear – this is a person who won’t give up. I really wanted to like Captain Marvel more than I did, but I couldn’t help the passive feeling I got walking out of it. It suffers much of the same issues that plague other MCU titles, especially when it comes to the depiction of action. Once again, we have set pieces in which the framing and editing hinders us from seeing what the hell is going on. An early battle scene, set on a remote alien planet, is so under lit and covered in smoke/fog that we can’t tell who is doing what. All we get are dark silhouettes firing energy blasts against other silhouettes. And when Captain Marvel attempts to escape an enemy spaceship, the camera shoots the hand to hand combat so up close that we can’t see what’s happening. It’s just arms and legs flailing around, edited together to give the impression of action. Fortunately, the production sticks the landing with a high-octane climactic battle, but at that point it’s almost too late of a recovery. An even bigger issue is the abundant pop culture references that are splattered throughout. I get that this takes place during a certain time, and thus the filmmakers were obligated to provide symbols representative of the era. But the film is so stuffed with them that it became a distraction. Do we really need Captain Marvel crash landing into a Blockbuster Video Store? The soundtrack – consisting of 90’s grunge/pop/rock songs, is questionable at best. Hearing Nirvana, No Doubt, Salt ‘N Pepa, and Hole ring out while watching the movie may work for some, but for me came off as shoehorned. There’s a lot to like with Captain Marvel, but there’s a lot to forget as well. It’s perfectly fine, it doesn’t bring the superhero genre to new heights but it’s not a train wreck either. At this point, the MCU has solidified their blueprint on giving the audience what they want but holding back just enough to keep them coming back for more. In that regard, Captain Marvel – warts and all – works according to plan."

"Jun 30, 2020",positive," 
B, really? This movie makes the mediocre marvel movies look extraordinary by comparison. This movie was literally shoehorned into the schedule as a direct response to the success of DC’s Wonder Woman. The plot (if you really want to call it that) is weak. Almost every reference to a previous marvel film is completely contradictory. And let’s be honest, character is by far and away the weakest link in this particular chain. Perhaps you were given a different cut of the movie to critique. I would suggest watching say, the first Ironman movie then watching captain marvel again. I’d be surprised if you didn’t have a change of perspective afterwards.

"Jun 30, 2020",positive," Vers (Brie Larson), a warrior of the Kree Empire who can fire photon blasts from her hands, is having recurring nightmares about her mysterious past. When she talks about it to her mentor, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), he urges her to control her emotions and take control of her powers. She, along with a team of other Kree warriors, was sent on a mission to rescue one of their operatives lost in a nearby planet overrun by Kree's rival race, the Skrulls. During this mission, their team was ambushed and Vers was captured by their leader, Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). The Skrulls used a memory probe on her to extract information causing her to remember parts about her past, including her relationship with a Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening). She escapes from the Skrulls and crash-lands on Earth with the aliens still in pursuit. She contacts Yon-Rogg for backup, and he urges her to stay put. On Earth, the crash attracted S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). They talk to Vers, who told them about a possible Skrull infiltration unless she first finds who they're looking for. Nick offers to assist her in finding Lawson first. As they search, Vers starts to piece together her past and meet with her best friend before the events that led her to Kree. Talos and the other Skrulls inevitably catch up with Vers. Talos shows her proof about her true identity and how she ended up with the Kree. They locate Lawson's laboratory and find what the Skrulls were really after. Yon-Rogg and his team eventually find Vers and a big confrontation between Kree and Skrulls happen. Vers, a trained warrior, finds out about her lost past and rethinks her allegiances. It's an origin story for Captain Marvel as well as other key figures and plot points in the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe like Nick Fury, Agent Coulson, and the tesseract. Brie Larson rose to fame in 2016 after winning an Oscar for her work in the film Room. But before her big win, she has been working for over 15 years, appearing in short-lived TV shows as well as supporting roles in films, like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, The Spectacular Now, and Trainwreck. Her last big film prior to Captain Marvel was Kong: Skull Island in 2017. When he's not playing Nick Fury in the MCU, Samuel L. Jackson is a prolific actor, appearing in iconic movies such as Pulp Fiction and frequently works with director Quentin Tarantino. He was also in the Star Wars prequels as the Jedi Mace Windu, and is the voice of Craig T. Nelson in The Incredibles movies. You may have also seen him in the cult thriller, Snakes On A Plane. No stranger to big film franchises, Jude Law was last seen playing the young Professor Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. He was also Dr. John Watson to fellow MCU pal, Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes in the Sherlock Holmes film franchise. '90s kids would also remember him as Haley Joel Osment's fellow robot friend in A.I. Artificial Intelligence. He may be heavily made-up as a Skrull leader in the film, but you may have already seen him in big blockbusters like The Dark Knight Rises, Ready Player One, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story as Orson Krennic. He also stars in the Netflix show, Bloodline with Linda Cardinelli who is also part of the MCU as Hawkeye's wife. Annette Bening is a well-known dramatic actress, having earned four Oscar nominations for The Grifters, American Beauty, Being Julia, and The Kids Are Alright. You might have seen her in movies like the film adaptation of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull starring Saoirse Ronan, or the 2016 drama 20th Century Women co-starring Elle Fanning and Greta Gerwig. 1. Actors Clark Gregg (reprising his role as Agent Coulson) and Samuel L. Jackson were digitally ""de-aged"" in the movie. The MCU has used this technology before in Captain America: Civil War, Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2, and the Ant-Man movies. 2. Aside from Nick Fury and Agent Coulson, other previous MCU characters that appear in this prequel are Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou) who both originally appeared in Guardians Of The Galaxy. 3. Brie Larson is allergic to cats, and performed opposite a puppet or video effects for her scenes with Goose the cat. The cat was also renamed after a character from Top Gun in the film. In the comics, he was called ""Chewie,"" after the Wookie from the Star Wars franchise. 4. This is the first MCU film released after Stan Lee's death. He makes a cameo in two scenes in this film, and has reportedly filmed his cameos for Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Captain Marvel, on the surface, feels like your typical superhero origin story where an unsuspecting person finds out they're meant for bigger things. There are chase sequences and fight sequences, aliens and tech centuries away from being realistic. In this regard, this film is no different from others in the genre. It even takes a while before we get a sense of Carol Danvers (or Vers) as a character. It's somewhat of a nostalgia trip not just for the '90s, but with its little callbacks to other parts of the MCU. MCU's usual tricks like Stan Lee's cameo (now poignant because of his passing), slow reveals to how exactly Carol fits into the larger world is satisfying and exciting, but if this is your first ever MCU movie, they might be easy to miss. All of the things that may make the film seem limited such as its reliance on exposition and its quick pace is due to it needing to serve the larger narrative. Remember that each MCU movie isn't a stand alone. An origin movie isn't just an origin movie, but a sequel to whichever film came before it, as well as a chapter of something larger. That's a lot of things to pack into one film, where you have to introduce a completely new character and her world. It really shines when it isn't working too hard to tie itself to the larger universe it serves. Vers and Fury's partnership is highly enjoyable, with their characters being a perfect fit for each other. They trust each other pretty quickly and you don't really question it, either. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson's dynamic is really the core of this film. Jude Law's character, Yon-Rogg, is one of MCU's more interesting (spoiler!) ""villains."" Jude, always so amiable on screen, is not hard to trust which makes the movie's second act twist even more exciting. The film's exemplary strength is how it explored its themes that address the feminist pursuit and even the refugee crisis. When the plot turns itself on his head with the fight between the Skrulls and the Kree, the allegory to the plight of refugees is not at all subtle, which works in the film's favor. It's an important point the movie was trying to make, and they made it very clearly. This call for empathy is such a moving moment, and that emotion was carried through the fight scenes. We see Carol fight single-handedly like a badass, and as a woman, it's so empowering to watch. Her final confrontation with Yon-Rogg was also particularly cathartic. We see her break away (literally and figuratively) from him and his control disguised as care and mentorship. Captain Marvel is, of course, necessary viewing for Marvel fans who just want to know everything about the cinematic universe. It is full of satisfying callbacks and backstories for fan-favorite characters like Agent Coulson and Nick Fury. This is the kind of film everyone should watch, if only to understand and gain empathy for the plight and struggles of other people. It teaches audiences to look closer at their personal relationships, and assess whether the people closest to us are helping or actually harming our growth. I recommend it to females everywhere, especially young girls, who should be taught that each and every one of them are forces to be reckoned with. I recommend it to males, too. Captain Marvel is an exploration of complex female strength, and while she is different from Thor or Captain America or Iron Man, she is a superhero all the same.

"Jun 28, 2020",positive," It's time, once again, to revisit the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Enough time has passed to temper the emotions felt at the conclusion of Avengers: Infinity War, as well as during the mid-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp. In fact, it's time to go back in time to meet one of the greatest superheroes in the entire universe. It's time for Captain Marvel. The year: 1995. The place: Hala, home planet of the Kree, a race of warriors (previously seen in Guardians of the Galaxy as the race of Ronan the Accuser). Their elite team is known as Starforce, led by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). For several years, now, he has been helping one of their members, Vers (Brie Larson), learn how to control her special powers. Vers has no idea how she acquired these powers, nor anything about her past. Hala is ruled by the Supreme Intelligence, an A.I. that appears to everyone as the person they most admire. To Vers, it appears as a woman (Annette Bening) who, of course, Vers has no recollection of ever knowing. Though, after being captured by the Kree's mortal enemies, the Skrulls, and interrogated, Vers learns where this woman might be: A planet that its inhabitants call Earth. While on Earth, she meets a rookie S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his superior, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who currently still has the use of both eyes. Fury gets pulled into Vers' mission to stop the Skrulls that have followed her, a difficult task since they can alter their appearance to mimic anyone they've seen. During their search, Vers learns that she may have come from Earth, her real name may be Carol Danvers and she discovers the origin of her powers. Captain Marvel hits all the right buttons for an MCU origin story, while also pushing a few that make it stand out from the others. Writing/directing team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, along with co-writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet, have significantly changed the character's story from the comics, but in a way that not only updates her for a modern audience, it also meshes her into the creation of the MCU. Of course, it's difficult to view Captain Marvel without the inevitable comparisons to Wonder Woman. Both are significantly groundbreaking in depicting strong female leads in very positive ways, with doses of similarity and difference. The backward time jump both films take is the obvious similarity. This allows both characters their own moments in the sun, setting them apart from their male superhero counterparts. Yet, while Wonder Woman is allowed to carry the full weight of her plot, Captain Marvel has to share. You see, this film isn't just the origin of Captain Marvel. In a way, it's the origin of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s current incarnation, where they now realize that there are worlds beyond our limited understanding of the universe, and both threats and allies can be found out there. While it is a bit disappointing that Marvel decided to do this with their plot, it's also understandable. Wonder Woman wasn't just trying to stand out from the male-centric entries, it was also trying to stand out from what, up to that point, many viewed as a disappointing franchise. In contrast, the MCU is not only a decade strong, now, it's also all about connectivity. So, while a small part of me wishes that Captain Marvel could have been allowed to hold the entire plot on her own, the rest of my brain gets why S.H.I.E.L.D. has to play a role. It's here that we really have to credit the filmmakers. Even though they had to give part of the plot away, Captain Marvel doesn't suffer when it comes to character development. We follow along with Carol as she fits the pieces of her missing memory together, thus we get to know her well, and we get to grow with her, too. This brings in another major difference between Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman. Diana had to rely on, then fall in love with, Steve Trevor in order to give her final act purpose and gravity. Carol has no romantic lead to play off and is all on her own, despite having Fury along for the ride, who's really only there to help her navigate this unfamiliar world. In fact, Captain Marvel's real emotional connection to Earth ends up being Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), her best friend from her life as Carol, as well as Maria's daughter, Monica. Another fun bit Boden and Fleck add to the mix is music. Taking a cue from James Gunn, they pepper the film with hits from the 1990s, giving the soundtrack a very Now That's What I Call Music! feel. It works in the fun way that the songs in the Guardians films and the 1980s music used in Bumblebee did, even adding that certain something to a couple key scenes. Speaking of music, I have to mention the fantastic score by Pinar Toprak. Like Mark Motherbaugh's score to Thor: Ragnarok, she has produced incidental music that is both playfully fun and sweepingly grand, with tiny bits of synthwave periodically sprinkled in, for good measure. Captain Marvel is a familiar origin story that terrifically stands on its own merits, coming at the right time for both the MCU and the real world.

"May 29, 2020",positive," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC Captain Marvel  arrives at an interesting inflection point in the Marvel Comics Universe, preceding the apocalyptic events of Infinity War by decades, while introducing what could possibly be their most powerful superhero yet. The film is directed by the husband/wife team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who have a demonstrable knack for complex character building, which is surely why they were chosen to bring Marvel’s first female led superhero film to theaters. Brie Larson was recruited for the title role fresh off her Oscar winning turn in Room, which only amplified the feeling that this film was going to be something a bit different than the testosterone-soaked popcorn fodder we’ve come to expect from Marvel. Taking place in 1995, the film begins on the Kree planet of Hala where Vers (Brie Larson), as she has come to be known, has been training with the warrior race ever since they found and assimilated her six years ago. She doesn’t remember how she came to their planet, or how she was imbued with her fearsome cosmic powers, but we meet her right before her first mission under her mentor/commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). Their mission to rescue a Kree informant goes south when they fall into a Skrull trap aimed at kidnapping Vers, who is thought to have information on a light speed engine that was being developed on Earth. The problem is, like a lot of things in her back story, Vers has forgotten it. It helps if you know that the Kree have been at war with the shapeshifting Skrulls, a race that can copy a being down to their DNA for thousands of years, and what Vers forgot could bring an end to the war. Eventually, Vers escapes from her captors and ends up stranded on Earth where she meets a much younger agent Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who helps her track down the Skrulls responsible for her kidnapping and find a way back to Hala. The best compliment I can give Captain Marvel is it doesn’t feel like a Marvel film. Over the years we have been conditioned to the assembly-line plotting and exacting narrative MCU films tend to deliver, and every new character is introduced spouting pop culture references while firing off an endless string of deadpan one-liners with roguish charm. That’s not what we get here. When we first meet Vers, AKA Carol Danvers, she is a shell of a woman who’s been broken and brainwashed with Kree propaganda, struggling to recover her past and her identity. It’s a transition she makes over the course of the film as she slowly evolves into Captain Marvel. This is not your typical origin story and all the better for it, and thankfully it doesn’t go overboard with the tie-ins and call backs to other films in the franchise, which, given how endlessly self-referential last few Marvel films are, is a welcome breath of fresh air. Filled with an empowering message and sharp-elbowed clapbacks at the toxic male naysayers of the Marvel fanboy universe, Captain Marvel is just what the MCU and fandom in general needs right now. While the non-stop nostalgia blam-blam of ’80’s/‘90s needle drops (Blockbuster! Top Gun! Elastica!) can be a bit much at times, they are a welcome reminder that Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were originally slated to tackle Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 1, making them Marvel’s logical go-to choice for Vol. 3. Brie Larson has given us a different and more complex hero than we have seen from the MCU stable thus far and a great way to transition from the old to the new guard, which will no doubt be a result of Infinity War: End Game. Captain Marvel feels less like the last film of Phase 3 and more like the fresh first chapter of what will be Phase 4."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive," Last year, after the veritable trauma created by watching Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel used their follow-up film, Ant-Man and the Wasp, as a metaphorical sorbet. A palate cleanser of sorts. The film was lighthearted,  favouring the entertainment factor after the intensity of it’s predecessor. And it worked, quietly amping us up for April 24th 2019 and the release of Avengers: Endgame. Now Captain Marvel is here to build that tension back-up again, but just enough to get us excited whilst leaving us craving for more. And what a film they give us in the form of Marvel’s first female-led superhero movie. Brie Larson does an excellent job in the lead role, as Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel, who is probably best described as being in possession of the wise-cracking of Star Lord, the impulsivity of Thor, the deadpan of Ironman, the goodness of Captain American and the general kick-assery of Black Widow. She’s yet to have a a fully rounded and unique personality, yet. There’s definitely room for it to grow and, as can be seen with the developing characterisation of Thor (look at 2011’s Thor then compare to 2017’s Ragnarock and 2018’s Infinity War). Often it feels like we are told more about her than shown, *many* characters inform both us and Carol how great/noble/brilliant she is. We just don’t see it all that often, yet. We first meet her when she is a member of an elite Kree army, being mentored by Yon-Rogg (an extremely excellent Jude Law) whose prevailing advice to her is to ‘not let your emotions override your judgement’. Things happen, during which we find out how she got there in the first place. The film initially takes a different approach to telling her origin story, it’s unique but there’s a strong chance younger viewers may get a bit confused as the story-telling at this point is slightly convoluted. After this section the film then transitions to a by-numbers action movie; all of these aspects are soldily good and very enjoyable. But the film has flickers of greatness, most of which are when the film takes on the form of buddy comedy with Larson paired with Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury. Jackson and Brie have a hilarious rapport, it’s during these moments the film really feels fresh and it’s own movie. To quote any of these scenes would be giving the game away. Ben Mendelsohn is also reliably brilliant, he too has some cracking stand-out moments. Another key aspect of the film are the friendship scenes between Carol and her best friend Maria (a charismatic Lashana Lynch). Their friendship is a lovely one and something that would be enjoyable to watch explored further."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive," I’ll be totally honest with you. I had never even heard
of Captain Marvel before. I’m not nor
have I ever been a comic book person, but at least I had heard of characters
such as Captain America, Thor, the Hulk and Spider Man. But this Captain Marvel
was a complete unknown to me. And even though I enjoyed the heck out of Black Panther, the whole Avengers saga
has been totally lost on me. I watched Avengers:
Infinity War just because I wanted to be in on the conversation, but I
found it to be another cookie-cutter piece of CGI brain noise. With the
exception of Black Panther and the
first Guardians of the Galaxy movie,
I can truly take or leave the Avengers and all their iterations. But when it
was announced that Marvel Studios was casting a woman to play the originally
male titular superhero and Avenger Captain Marvel, I was intrigued. And when it
was then announced that the woman who would play her would be Brie Larson, I
was in. See, that’s what Marvel keeps getting right: they keep
finding ways to attract new audiences while maintaining their loyal ones. Brie
Larson’s casting was yet another step in this Studio’s march to industry
dominance. Prior to her casting, the entire Marvel universe had only two Oscar
winners in their midst, Gwyneth Paltrow and Lupita Nyong’o, neither of whom
have starring roles in any Marvel movie. Brie Larson, however, is a Best
Actress Oscar winner carrying a Marvel superhero movie—there are so many things
in that sentence that are groundbreaking, and I love every one of them. So, not only did Marvel change it up by making Captain
Marvel a woman, they changed it up by casting an actress who had critical
success, but not too much mainstream recognition. Larson won her Oscar for a
little-seen independent movie, Room,
and her first attempt at a big Hollywood blockbuster, Kong: Skull Island, fell a bit short of expectations, so I can’t
imagine the Disney (Marvel Studio’s parent company) big shots were thrilled at
the idea of this possible flash-in-the-pan being the one to carry a franchise
on her shoulders. But Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, has been given
the keys to the kingdom, so whatever he wants, he gets. And, as always, Feige
has done it exactly right. Larson may have been the reason I went to see Captain Marvel, but, surprisingly, she’s
not the sole reason I liked the movie. She’s great, I want to make that absolutely
clear, but I always knew she would be. It was absolutely no surprise to me that
she could handle this role and all its challenges, but what did surprise me was
how affable and unassuming this whole movie was. Directors Anna Boden and Ryan
Fleck and screenwriters Boden, Fleck and Geneva Robertson-Dworet take the time
to build a world here, and they make it intimate and relatable. There is the
perfect amount of ‘90s nostalgia, the perfect amount of modern girl-power
resonance, and the perfect blend of superhero mythology and organic,
earth-bound humanism. There is humor and charm everywhere, and there’s even a
cat who literally steals the movie. Speaking of the cat, I loved the intentional or
unintentional callbacks to science fiction classics that are scattered
throughout the movie, from Star Trek
to Alien to Star Wars. I love so many things about Captain Marvel, I just wish that I had been able to follow it a bit
better. Even though it is the ultimate Marvel Comics Universe origin story, I
still felt like I was lost without knowing all the mythology. There are so many
references to characters and plot points that I felt like I was not in on the
secret and some of the twists lost their effectiveness. What Wonder Woman
achieved through familiarity, Captain
Marvel achieves through sheer will. While the movie is squarely a superhero
movie cut from the same cloth as Captain
America and Thor, the hero of
this movie is completely different. Her powers may come from the outside, but
her strength is all from within, in relatable tropes of kickass womanhood:
fighter pilot, tomboy, athlete, friend. She is neither a lover nor a mother.
She is a woman, identified not as an attachment to anyone or anything else but
singularly dependent on herself for survival and identity. It feels odd to me
to point this out, because this sort of feminist ideal is such a no-brainer in
my life, but when I think about how rare it is to see in movies like this, it
really is extraordinary. There are some oddities about Captain Marvel that contribute to its unevenness, like the digital
reverse aging process they use to make Samuel L. Jackson 30 years younger and
the weird fight sequences that make me wonder why alien life forms are fighting
each other with guns and hand-to-hand combat, but these really are quibbles.
It’s made up for by so many great things, including Jackson reminding us that
he really is funny, and Jude Law and Annette Bening shining in roles that
highlight their strengths. Overall, Captain
Marvel is an enjoyable escapist movie that happens to check all the boxes
for a modern progressive audience and delivers humor and action in an easy to
watch, slickly-made package that maybe even the fanboys might like. If
superhero movies aren’t your thing, I certainly understand, trust me. But if
you want to go out on a limb and give one a try, well, that one still should be
Black Panther. But Captain Marvel won’t disappoint you
either. At the very least, you’ll know that you are supporting a sea change in
what a movie superhero can look like. And it’s about time."
"Dec 20, 2019",positive,"  When we first meet Captain Marvel (Larson), she’s working at her pre-superhero job, high up in space, as part of an intergalactic military unit called Starforce. After a new mission calls her back to Earth, she runs into young government agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and discovers truths about a past that she’s long forgotten. Teaming up with Fury—and getting into entertaining verbal sparring matches with him—she defends the planet from a mysterious alien force.
  Set in the 1990s, well before audiences have met any of the other Avengers (and before Fury lost his eye), Captain Marvel has a spry, playful tone, and Oscar winner Larson (Room) ably carries such a colossal super-production.
  While the feminist message is sometimes muddled—why should a woman be told to control her emotions instead of using her strength?—Marvel’s first stand-alone female hero is definitely formidable. And very likely a key component in the next movie.

"Dec 15, 2019",negative," (Welcome to Road to Endgame, where we revisit the first 22 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ask, ""How did we get here?"" In part one of our two-part look at Captain Marvel: how the movie tries, and fails, to frame memory and perspective.)Between the two halves of its massive finale — the apocalyptic Avengers: Infinity War and the upcoming Avengers: Endgame — the Marvel Cinematic Universe feels like it's being stripped for parts.Ant-Man and the Wasp, a smaller, more intimate entry, did away with the trappings of the Marvel formula, though it failed to supply a working substitute. Its leads no longer provided quip-laden momentum (a task that fell to supporting players independent of the plot), but the lead characters had no internal conflict either, despite pasts that so clearly called for some. The film sidestepped the usual pre-visualized mayhem divorced from story, though its climax might as well have had no stakes at all. And rather than Marvel's half-hearted expression of meaning — often a character arc culminating in punching harder — the film had no real theme to dramatize.  Captain Marvel, on the other hand, is a swing in the opposite direction, amping up the well-worn Marvel template to the point of inducing whiplash. It's fun in parts, and it magnifies the series' strong-suits; though in doing so, it exposes just how low the bar was set to begin with. The film can't help but magnify the series' weaknesses too, since they're often one and the same.Everything that was missing from Ant-Man and the Wasp comes rushing back, with the studio's very name stamped across the title, as if to parody the common through-lines of twenty prior films without the self-awareness to do so. And while it's filled to the brim with metaphor and ostensibly political outlook, the film is both haphazardly assembled, and shackled by the same constraints as fellow military-funded entries Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Only this time, the effects of the film's mandated propaganda are significantly stronger.Captain Marvel is a Marvel movie through-and-through, and that's a problem. After a tumultuous comic book history, Carol Danvers (then Ms. Marvel) rejoined the Marvel A-list in 2006, before graduating to the ""Captain"" mantle six years later. Brie Larson brings a combination of wit and gravitas to the character, and a self-assured demeanour that captures Danvers' recent incarnations. The problem however, is that the Danvers of the comics — a headstrong leader with agreeable charm — builds on decades of stories, absorbing the ones that work while subverting those that don't. Whereas the Danvers of the movie, the amnesiac ""Vers,"" is an awkward fit for a story about someone still trying to find her place.Wit and charm aren't just this Danvers' affectations. They're her equilibrium from start to finish, despite the film being about her losing and subsequent re-discovering her identity on Earth.In an early training scene on Hala, the Kree home world and the only place Danvers fully remembers, Star Force commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) learns of the disjointed dreams and memories Danvers can't seem to piece together. In response to this, and to Danvers' aggression as they spar, Yon-Rogg tells her to keep her emotions in check. A loaded statement no doubt, and one particularly gendered, though from this point on, the film seldom positions this mandate as something for Danvers to overcome.Even the Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening), the Kree A.I., which takes the form a mystery woman from Danvers' past, frames these flashes of lost memory as torrid, intrusive impulses. ""You struggle with your emotions,"" the Supreme Intelligence tells her, ""With your past that fuels them."" Though Danvers' emotions and fractured memories never manifest as struggle, nor do they compel her to go against the grain of authority to embrace her apparent fervour (she seems to have already done so before the movie begins). Being told she's too emotional is a problem on paper, but it rarely manifests in practice.  Danvers is incredibly personable, and her dynamic with a younger Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) offers delightful momentum, but scarce are the moments when Larson is allowed to express something more nuanced than cheer. Danvers' journey on Earth involves both gathering intelligence, and in the process, solving the mystery of who she is. Yet this lack of identity never feels urgent, beyond once yelling ""You don't know who I am. Even I don't know who I am!"" when confronted with new information. Shortly thereafter, Danvers resumes her natural, seemingly unfettered state. The film's visual framing falls victim to a similar indifference. Except for a single moment when the camera holds on Danvers — a key beat, where a filed photograph confirms her human past — nothing about the way she's shot, or the way her perspective is framed sees any kind of shift, despite change in perspective being key to the plot of Captain Marvel. It's as if the film is on auto-pilot, with actors tasked with line-readings that rarely, if ever, unearth the potentially riveting subtext of a woman having her identity stolen and re-molded by hostile masculine forces.Danvers' relationship to authority is key to her persona. She rebels against Yon-Rogg's orders, though she does so from the get-go, resulting in her later betrayal of the Kree feeling all too easy. When confronted with evidence that all she knows is a lie, there's little struggle involved in actually changing her perspective. In one moment, she believes one thing. In the next, she believes another. If anything, she comes off as instantly, perhaps naively trusting, even though it's likely unintended; the film rarely clarifies when gaps in her memory have been filled, so what drives her decisions in a given moment feels uncertain.  This wishy-washy P.O.V. goes hand in hand with Danvers starting out rebellious. This is who she already was on Earth, rather than having to grow into this rash persona (or grow back into it, when she re-discovers herself). Her disentanglement from brainwashed militarism feels almost insignificant; starting out so defiant means her embrace of emotion is fairly acceptable too. It's only a mild issue for her commanders — despite what Yon-Rogg says, he seems to delight in their banter, and there are no consequences when she lashes out at him with lasers — and it even seems like a non-issue for Danvers herself, rather than something she's forced to suppress, and subsequently embrace or reclaim.Many of these problems are rooted in the film's expression of memory. The film opens with a potent, abstract depiction of Danvers' dilemma. Having been fed misinformation, her mind contorts her memory to include an evil Skrull where the devious Yon-Rogg (now her friendly commander) should be.Danvers' initial discovery of her life on Earth is shot with verve; these flashes exist in her external vicinity, like a tangible history waiting to be touched or danced with. But after the first time Danvers experiences this, upon entering her old bar, this vivid sensation of recalling the past never returns. The film then ceases to depict memory in a manner visually befitting its story — or any visual manner at all. The result is dramatic confusion.  When Danvers does regain her memories (or parts of them; how much she actually recalls is unclear), the film only ever communicates these re-discoveries through dialogue. Danvers tells her friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) that she needs to piece things together, but rare are the moments when she acts like it; her renewed understanding, what she sees of herself and more importantly how she sees it, is never the focus. When Rambeau tells Danvers who she is (or was), the emotional resonance is limited to the two friends embracing. A sweet moment, no doubt — female friendships are largely lacking in the MCU — but it's a moment that, if excised, would subtract little from Danvers' arc.Flashbacks of Danvers falling and being taunted by male authority figures help colour her Earth-bound past. But while she alludes to these memories in conversation, they don't seem to pound against the walls of her subconscious (let alone bother her), nor do they impede her actions or decisions in the slightest. Her own memories feel like mere curiosities to her; they're neither vital parts of herself that she needs to chase, nor do they stir something within her when she finally finds them. There's no desperation, no hunger at the heart of Carol Danvers that drives her journey, and thus, no real dramatic change for Larson to externalize.The tidbits Danvers discovers about herself are just that; pieces of factual information, with little emotional payoff. They alter neither how she interacts with people (even those she once knew), nor how she fights, or moves, or speaks, or approaches conflict, even once that conflict is radically changed thanks to what she now believes. There's nothing delineating ""Vers"" from Carol Danvers, aspects to her identity separated by fundamental outlook. In a story about new information changing one's core (or at the very least, one's perspective), this is a significant failing.Despite the film's stellar introduction to memory (it occupies physical space at first, making it feel both lived and within reach), how much of Danvers' memory returns, and what impact this has on her, is left entirely vague. Until Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) reveals the truth about Yon-Rogg, nothing Danvers learns of her past informs her emotions or helps her overcome obstacles; her search merely takes her from place to place, the mystery of her old life could have been solved by someone else entirely.Danvers' breezy dynamic with Fury is delightful, but how her story is told begs several questions: Who are these people? What do they learn from one another? Who is Carol Danvers, outside of another Marvel hero for whom change is far too easy (and yet, non-existent), and for whom levity is a more important function than her own vital re-discovery? 
Captain Marvel hinges on change in perspective. While this change is never prompted by Danvers' arc — the Kree's actual ideology is barely touched upon— the shift in narrative P.O.V. pertains to our own perception of the film's apparent antagonists, the diabolical-looking Skrulls.The Skrulls have been a largely ruthless, villainous species ever since there has been a Marvel universe. They debuted all the way back in Fantastic Four #2 in 1961, but even without foreknowledge of the comics, the Skrulls' visual framing sets them apart and plays on audience expectations.While the Kree are discernably human (with variations in pigment), the Skrulls are distinctly the ""other."" They have a sickly green tinge, Vulcan ears and facial grooves. Their method of impersonating people — ripping apart and re-stitching their own flesh — is intentionally stomach-turning. Everything about them aligns with Hollywood's typically ""alien"" coding. So, it's all the more surprising when we're told that these apparent ""terrorists"" are actually a persecuted people in search of refuge.Ben Mendelsohn's charisma as Talos is used to terrific effect. Upon re-watch, his playful deviousness carries a weight and desperation, which we may have been conditioned to miss. The Skrulls only come off as villains insomuch as this is what we're told of them. In fact, the first time we actually see a Skrull on-screen, he takes the form of Kree fighter Att-Lass (Algenis Perez Soto) in order to stop Minn-Erva (Gemma Chan) from gunning down innocent, starving tribesmen.The reveal of Talos' hidden family is particularly touching. High above the clouds, on Mar-Vell's spacecraft, he summons them with a guttural chant, as if calling to prayer and manifesting a sacred reunion. Though the slow-motion beat where his daughter sees him killing Kree soldiers goes nowhere in particular. Shortly after Talos mentions his hands being filthy from war, he tells his wife to shield his daughter's eyes, but she witnesses this harsh reality anyway. And yet, there's no sense of how this moment actually affects her. The film simply cuts away to Danvers' fight with Yon-Rogg, and never returns to this question.In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, war and death seem to have few long-lasting consequences. Talos' admission has little impact on Danvers, despite providing elbow-room to reflect on her loyalties. In fact, this introspective element is largely absent from her story, whether concerning the Skrulls she killed in earlier scenes, or her time in the U.S. Air Force.After all, Captain Marvel is a Marvel Studios film with significant ties to the U.S. military. While it's nominally critical of war, its hands are filthy with government propaganda.

"Dec 6, 2019",positive," To say that Captain Marvel is overdue in joining the ranks of the MCU is a bit of an understatement — but now that she’s here, and here to stay, we’ll let it slide. It took Marvel over 10 years to get a headlining female hero in their lineup, which would be maddening if Marvel wasn’t also a part of Hollywood. For all its progressivism, Hollywood is slow. Why? Because old white men have all the power. Tale as old as time. Captain Marvel (and Black Panther) was only possible because Marvel Studios managed to break free from its oldest, whitest, most conservative keeper of the status quo. Thank goodness for that; anyone with a brain will tell you movies starring women and people of color make heaps of money. Add “superheroes” to that equation, and, well, there’s a reason Disney owns Marvel Studios, and Marvel isn’t going anywhere any time soon.  This all gets pretty meta when one considers Captain Marvel itself. On the production side, it has more women involved in creative and executive positions than any other Marvel film, including co-director Anna Boden and composer Pinar Toprak, both the first in those roles in the MCU. It stars Brie Larson, who won my heart forever when she presented Casey Affleck with the Academy Award for Best Actor in 2017 but refrained from clapping for him. Its story is one of a woman overcoming psychological abuse and finding her strength — and herself — amid the muck of lies a man told her to keep her under his control for years. On every level, Captain Marvel is about a woman refusing to give up when men tell her she is not enough. Because of this, and because of Larson’s layered performance and excellent supporting cast (Samuel L. Jackson! Ben Mendelsohn! Lashana Lynch! Annette Bening! Jude Law!), it also stands as one of the most rewarding rewatches in recent Marvel memory. It takes a second viewing, or even a third, to really see how sinister Jude Law’s villainy is and to appreciate how well he weaponizes his handsomeness to trick everyone into thinking he’s not just a hero, but a mentor and a friend.  This is just one example that shows just how well crafted Captain Marvel is. The execution is easy to miss in a first viewing — I left the theater that first time feeling a bit mixed about it — but repeat viewings really make Captain Marvel shine. The directors and writers managed to create a story that, from a woman’s perspective, feels universal in spite of the comicky spectacle of warring alien races and a cat who turns into a tentacle monster. So many things that only women experience are seeded throughout the movie — don’t let your emotions control you, if I’m wrong then prove it, got a smile for me, honey? — and never in a way that feels pandering (like, say, Dark Phoenix). We have a majority of female writers to thank for that. As a new parent, I appreciate that most of the special features on the Blu-ray of Captain Marvel are four minutes or less. The short featurettes highlight standout aspects of the film, like the feline actors, Larson’s experiences flying with real Air Force pilots, and the comics’ inspiration for the film’s Carol Danvers (shoutout to Kelly Sue DeConnick!). The longest features clock in at eight minutes and are also the most worth watching. The first is the film’s deleted scenes, which shed some more light on Jude Law’s villain, and the second is a longer featurette emphasizing visual effects producer Victoria Alonso’s longtime contribution to the MCU.  While part of me wishes the special features were longer and more akin to those found on the Black Panther Blu-ray, Captain Marvel is also a film with less world-building and thus less need to explain itself. At this point, you can’t really go wrong with adding the latest Marvel movie to your DVD collection, and Captain Marvel is no exception. "
"Nov 22, 2019",positive,Brie Larson packs a punch as one of Marvel's great new heroes.
"Nov 6, 2019",positive," More than anything, Captain Marvel suffers from the constraints of existing in a cinematic universe. Maybe it’s the placement, a month and a half out from Avengers Endgame, that makes it seem like the most shoehorned Marvel movie. There are numerous good things about this film, but the parts that would make it great are lost in service of connecting the dots to the 19 films before it, and more specifically, to Endgame. But first, let’s talk about the good things. Brie Larson is, of course, perfect. Whether it’s as the amnesiac Vers or the badass Air Force pilot Carol Danvers, Larson imbues humor, wit, and vulnerability into the role. Her chemistry with Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson, digitally aged down to fit the 90s setting) is on par with the best of buddy-cop comedies. Jackson gets to do more with Nick Fury here than he’s been able to do for a while as we get to see the birth of SHIELD we now know it as. There’s a significant amount of time dedicated to an entire alien race, and for a cinematic universe that first introduced space seven years ago, it’s refreshing to learn more about the races of the MCU besides the humans or the Asgardians. The Skrulls are a shape-shifting species that start out as the enemy but turn out to be a misunderstood species who are just trying to find a home. Ben Mendelsohn’s Talos is one of the funniest characters in the MCU. Giving him a family turns him into something more than just comic relief. The aesthetic of the 90s is also on point, with great music cues from Nirvana’s “Come As You Are,” No Doubt’s “Just A Girl,” and TLC’s “Waterfall.” However, certain parts of the film feel underwhelming within the scope of the MCU. The narrative structure is odd. While this take on an origin story feels refreshing in that Carol already has her powers, the amnesiac beginning feels like a tough place to start for a character we need to get to know quickly if she’s going to be the saving grace in Endgame. Not to mention, the more time Larson spends as Vers, the less time we get to know her as Carol Danvers, and the friendship she has with fellow Air Force pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch). There’s a lovely story of lost friends and a lasting friendship somewhere in here, but very little time is spent really getting to know these characters before aliens come knocking on their door. Because this film is set in the 90s, and since it’s the 20th film in the MCU, there are certain issues it runs into with MCU history. As far as the audience knows, the Kree has always been the villain, with Ronan the Destroyer (Lee Pace, reprising his role) headlining the villainy in Guardians of the Galaxy. Here, Larson’s character starts off as part of the Kree team, notably: Jude Law as Yon-Rogg, Gemma Chan as Minn-Erva, and Djimon Hounsou as Korath (also reprising his role from Guardians of the Galaxy). The issue is that we already know the Kree are the bad guys so when Talos reveals he’s actually the good guy, the moment gets lost under the weight of the history before it."
"Oct 21, 2019",positive," Expectations are sky-high for Marvel Studio’s latest superhero film Captain Marvel. It’s not only the movie studio’s first big-screen adventure with a female lead, in Academy-Award winning Brie Larson from Room, but it also stands as a critical bridge between the two-part epic of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. (She’s the one that Nick Fury paged as he disintegrated in that first part’s post-credit sequence.) Marvel can rest easy that they’ve got another fun movie on their hands, and yet its greatest strengths are those moments more human than hero. And, in some instances, more feline, as a supporting orange tabby almost steals the entire picture. Married filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck do a decent job of delivering the requisite action here, but their strengths lie in creating quirky characters and the loosy-goosy interactions between them. In movies like Half Nelson (2006) and It’s Kind of a Funny Story (2010), they showcased quirky characters that drove simple stories. Much of the same comes through in Captain Marvel when heroine Carol Danvers isn’t acting like an avenger. She is far more interesting when she’s down-to-earth, literally and figuratively. In fact, Boden and Fleck seem far less interested in a lot of the typical beats of a Marvel origins stories as evidenced by their minimalizing of the time they spent on such tropes. Their script, written with Geneva Roberston-Dworet, truncates Danvers’ youthful flashbacks that would normally take up a ton of screen time in other Marvel movies. The script moves things along so swiftly that the back-story of Danvers’ strained relationship with her father gets covered in a breathless, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment. Boden and Fleck don’t seem all that interested in the excessive backstory about the Kree warring with the Skrulls either. They gloss over a lot of the alien hooey and don’t even bother to give most of the Kree brotherhood any personality. (The formidable Djimon Hounsou is one of them, but he’s given virtually no character to play). The directors seem almost apathetic about the lore of this galactic conflict, preferring to get past the makeup fest so they can turn their attention to the silly stuff. Indeed, Danvers’ fish-out-of-water story that occurs when she lands back on earth is where this movie starts to hit its stride. Because Danvers’ origin story takes place in the ’90s, it gives Boden and Fleck all the more opportunity to make hay out of 90’s pastiche, in addition to making fun of a younger Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). It becomes an out-and-out comedy at times, especially with Fury fretting about and interacting with a wayward cat. (More on that later.) It all allows Larson to play something she’s more comfortable with, specifically wry banter and ping-ponging off of the game Jackson. Watching her act stoic and pose dramatically in her heroic postures doesn’t quite suit her any more than the clearly padded costume to make her more buff. Her strengths, despite all the chopping and kicking she’s asked to do, genuinely lie in her droll wit and dismissive side-eyes. The filmmakers have a field day with the schtick as they take the piss out of antiquated 90’s relics like Blockbuster stores, the painfully slow downloads on early computers, and a lot of the music from that period that hasn’t aged particularly well. (Sorry, Gwen Stefani.) The most fun comes from seeing Fury 25 years younger, with a full pate and both eyes. Jackson doesn’t get that many chances to be comedic onscreen, and he relishes playing a version of his character when he was less stoic. He also plays well off of Larson, and they enjoy a breezy chemistry together. Soon, Danvers and Fury are running all over hill and dale, trying to figure out what the Skrulls are up to, as well as figure out her mysterious history since her memories were lost after she crashed on the Kree planet. That past of hers, as well as the true motivations of the Skrulls, hold the key to her powers that include the ability to harness energy, be immune to bullets, and fly. As the two schlep all over Los Angeles, Danvers gets to apply her skills on earth, often in front of bewildered bystanders. The scene on the LA subway where she throws down with a Skrull disguised as an old lady is one of the film’s comedic highlights. Still, the funniest moments involve that cat previously mentioned. The orange tabby is named Goose, and it keeps popping up while Danvers and Fury are sleuthing. Cutaways to the orange tabby account for some of the choicest comic punchlines in the film, and when the feline and Fury become buds, it’s adorable and pretty cheeky. The cat even manages to stow away aboard Danvers’ jet earning the film’s biggest laugh when the kitty is shown reacting badly to zero gravity. Adding to the burlesque is the fact that the Skrulls fear the little creature, thinking that it’s a tentacled alien out to eat them. It seems every critter in this movie is dealing with identities in question, from Danvers not knowing her backstory to the Skrull abilities to morph into others. The Kree are not all they seem to be, including hunky mentor Yon-Rogg (a game Jude Law), let alone Skrull leader Talos (an insinuating Ben Mendelsohn). It’s even hard to get a bead on just who Dr. Lawson (Annette Bening) is in the overly complicated plotting. She looks dynamite in her green contacts and fitted leather jacket but is she friend or foe? One of the most surprising things about this film is that there is no extraneous love interest given to Danvers, something almost miraculous for material like this. Instead, the relationship that is given time, outside of her professional connection with Fury, is with fellow pilot Maria (Lashana Lynch). Single mom Maria fought hard to make it in the macho world of the military alongside her bestie, and daughter Monica (Akira Akbar) isn’t missing a father figure. To that end, the film is a bit too on-the-nose with the “girl power” machinations, but at least neither female adult in the story requires a man for fulfillment. How refreshing is that in the he-man, superhero universe? Less fresh is the somewhat typical final battle in space as Danvers takes full ownership of her powers, a third act that echoes the finale of 2017’s Wonder Woman far too closely. Fully embracing her Captain Marvel persona, Danvers throws all the alien baddies into a lot of scenery but is careful not to kill anyone. It’s all a little too safe and too dull, and the excessive CGI doesn’t help matters. It would be nice if Larson were genuinely participating in most of the action, but she seems to have been replaced by a digital version of the character. As expensive as all of the effects are here, the greatest ones remain the ability to shave 25 years off of Jackson, as well as fellow agent Coulson (Clark Gregg, reprising his earlier Avengers film role.) For all of Marvel’s success in 20 some movies, their third acts too often play anti-climactically. The superiority of the MCU (look it up) over the films from DC remain with their more memorable characters and the humor swirling around them.  Such attributes get lost when these endings trot out the inevitable, wham-bam smackdowns. Wouldn’t it be great to have a climax in one of these films where fighting didn’t solve the galaxy’s problems, and smarts did instead? The purpose of Danvers powers is to end all wars, but it seems like it’s really there to keep her one helluva war machine. So much for marvelous.

"Oct 14, 2019",positive," The Marvel Cinematic Universe finally gets a headlining female superhero as Brie Larson plays a super soldier with a mysterious past alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn. It’s uneven but worthy, writes critic Craig Mathieson. Captain Marvel begins briskly, omitting a villainous prologue and a genial introduction, in presenting the unsettled Vers (Brie Larson), a gifted rookie in the Starforce, an intergalactic military unit in the service of the Kree, an advanced alien race. A rebel without applause, Vers has fractured memories starting with trauma and no history, a situation that requires a sparring session and stern advice from her commanding officer and mentor, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). Marvel’s belated introduction of a lead female superhero works to keep you entertained and yet off balance – co-directors’ Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck’s film is a surreptitious dismantling of the genre they’re successors to, sometimes awkward but ultimately uplifting. Vers’ murky past includes time on Earth, a situation revisited when she plunges from the sky above California one day in 1995 after an unsettling encounter with the Kree’s shape-shifting enemy, the Skrulls, and their leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn and his Australian accent). Firing photon blasts from her hands is enough to convince U.S. government agent Nick Fury (a digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson) of her bona fides, and the manipulative spymaster of previous Marvel movies is a jaunty sidekick here, offering banter amidst the cultural gags of video stores and dial-up internet connections. This is the most Gen-X friendly movie the studio has ever produced. A year ago with Black Panther, director Ryan Coogler and his collaborators were able to offer an alternate Afrocentric history of strength and resilience. Captain Marvel doesn’t have that exterior strength, instead working to distinguish itself through interior self-realisation. Too many Marvel films have been about the responsibility of greatness and carrying a mantle, but Vers – or Carol Danvers as she previously was on Earth – doesn’t know who she is, only who she’s been told she can be. Amidst the sleuthing by mismatched pair of Vers and Fury, complete with grunge gags and tasty musical cues, there’s a thorough dismissal of authority figures and allegiance to the state while refugees are protected from a “shameful war.” Make what you will of Annette Bening’s sly take on Hillary Clinton. Boden and Fleck made their bones with independent dramas, notably 2006’s compelling Half Nelson and most recently 2015’s Mississippi Grind (co-headlined by Mendelsohn). They have a feel for the friction of characters who can’t find contentment in their world, and the self-destruction that can eventuate. That continues here, with Vers rediscovering her life as Carol, and the intensity of her friendship with a fellow former pilot, Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch). The scenes between them, particularly where Maria recounts what she lost when Carol disappeared, have a genuine empathy and connection, with Brie Larson more at ease than she is as initially cocky woman who fell to Earth. Unfortunately they can’t find a similar finesse visually, with rote chase scenes and hand-to-hand combat that lacks a distinct sense of spatial feel or an illustrative dynamic. In Wonder Woman Patty Jenkins kept the frame open, so that the commanding strength of Gal Gadot’s Diana shone through, but Carol has to fight her out of a box, much as she has to battle to piece together who she is. What makes the film work is that a woman claiming her identity from a life that’s told her otherwise is explicitly feminist, and when Captain Marvel asserts herself it’s not just with noble intent but also galvanising pleasure. Nevertheless, you realise, she persisted."
"Sep 27, 2019",negative," If you asked me to recite the Marvel Cinematic Universe origin story of any Avenger, I’d say just about the same thing for most of them: ordinary person living their normal life, strange event, they try to figure out their powers for a while, they chase a MacGuffin, yadda yadda. What I’m more likely to remember is that one funny scene where they did this, or that other part where they did that – these origins tend to function more as sandboxes that give the characters room to breathe and a collection of small moments where we get to know who they are and what makes them special. If we’re speaking in terms of technicality, Captain Marvel’s plot has the same ingredients as most origin stories, but they’re added in a different order, so we end up with a new dish. She starts the films with powers and without a memory of her life or who she was before she had them. This difference yields more depth and mystery in the plot than I ever anticipated, but at a cost. The movie’s central premise asks: Who is this person? I’m not sure we get more than a superficial answer. Captain Marvel opens on the planet of Hala, home of the Kree – you’ll know them by their blue blood and combat skills. That’s honestly about all I can say about the Kree, even though they’re the only part of Carol Danvers’ (Brie Larson) life that she can remember up to this point. Danvers has spent the last six years being raised as a soldier and honing her powers with mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) after they find her near-death after a mysterious accident. Unfortunately the time we spend on Hala feels rushed and full of exposition but also somehow missing context at the same time. Danvers gets captured on a mission against the shape-shifting villains, the Skrulls, and ends up escaping to Earth a la 1995. Once we get to Earth, Captain Marvel switches gears a bit and also begins to function as a semi-origin story for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his role in assembling the Avengers. A side note: the visual effects used to de-age Jackson in this film are nothing short of incredible. I was worried I’d be dealing with the uncanny valley effect for the movie’s full running time, but it genuinely works. On Earth, the tone and plot takes a turn for the better. For starters, we get a joyous set of 90s songs that are right up there with the Guardians soundtrack. And to my relief, the majority of Captain Marvel’s run time doesn’t feel like one giant, glamorous advertisement for the Air Force. There is plenty of MacGuffin chasing, sure, but we get to meet Goose the cat, which is basically the Groot of this film (there are plenty of Guardians comparisons to be had here). We also get to see more of Ben Mendelsohn’s Skrull leader, Talos. Mendelsohn really ended up stealing the show for me, which again speaks to the intricacy of the plot at the expense of the title character. There’s also a pocket of about 30-40 minutes in the back half of this film where the originality and weirdness of this universe starts to peak out, and this is where Captain Marvel really shines. I think there was enough room in Captain Marvel to have both a compelling plot and solid character development, but two things get in the way: 1) making Danvers’ own life a riddle to be solved, and 2) tying everything into the MCU origins as quickly as possible. Fury’s involvement mostly worked for me, maybe because he already felt like a fully-formed character, but just about everything else MCU-related felt like it took away from the time Danvers could have spent getting to know herself, and her best friend/found family Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) better. I think Rambeau and Fury’s roles could have been swapped (in terms of screen time and involvement) and it would have made the world of difference. But because Captain Marvel’s own life is The Big Mystery, we don’t get to know these two and their friendship as well as I’d have liked. I’m going to need a little more time to digest it and rank this one in the MCU, but I already know it won’t be at the top or the bottom of the list for me. It’ll hover somewhere in the middle, held back by weak character development and so-so dialogue, held afloat by a thoughtful story, an adorable cat, and the impending tweets about Jude Law and Gemma Chan that are about to completely flood my timeline. Hrmm I got that feeling from the trailer, in regards to dialogue. Would you say better outing than the 1st Thor or Cap or Right there with them? Hmm, I’d say I liked it more than the 1st Thor but less than the 1st Cap! It’s somewhere in the same so-so territory as the first Ant Man for me. Wow. This was a much better movie than most of the reviews led me to expect. It’s also a very different movie than I expected, in a good way. I thought Larson was fantastic, and there was some strong chemistry among the actors. Most of the MCU stuff was on the light side–not essential to the plot, so it doesn’t derail the story, but mostly fun enough. Not sure where I’d rank it, but usually I like these movies even more on the second and third (or more!) viewings. It certainly makes me hopeful that the MCU isn’t running out of steam. Justin Chang on NPR’s “Fresh Air” described Captain Marvel as a pleasant and likeable movie, but nothing very special. That does sound like the Ant-Man movies: OK time-fillers. He doubts it will do for female moviegoers what Black Panther did for black moviegoers, because it’s not as rich a movie. But I’ll see it anyway."
"Sep 26, 2019",positive," We’re all familiar with superhero origin story. Ordinary, flawed person is granted superhuman abilities. Ordinary, flawed person struggles with their abilities on a physiological and psychological level. Ordinary, flawed person finally harnesses their gifts in a selfless way. It’s a template for compelling storytelling, because it’s all about growth and self-actualisation and all that good stuff we go watch escapist movies for. On the other hand, the structure of this is well-worn by now, to say the least.  Captain Marvel, a superhero origin story movie, attempts to circumvent this structure. We’re immediately introduced to a super-powered young woman named Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), a member of an advanced alien race known as the Kree. Furthermore, she’s already found her place as a loyal soldier in their elite intergalactic military unit called Starforce. Their mission is to locate and wipe out the Skrulls led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), who’re shapeshifters intent on infiltrating Kree home worlds.  However, it’s not as straightforward as all that. Through Carol’s dialogue with her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), we learn that her past is a mystery to her. After a mission to take out some Skrulls goes sideways, Carol crash lands on Earth (through the roof of a Blockbuster, because it’s the year 1995). There, she meets Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), here a young SHIELD Agent with two good eyes. As they team-up to repel an oncoming Skrull invasion, Carol’s learns more about her past life on Earth.  To paper over this crack, they’ve cast Brie Larson. And she’s as magnetic as other MCU heavy-hitters like Chris Evans or Robert Downey Jr. Through sheer charisma, she gets you to care very much. And perhaps I imagined this because of the film’s ‘90s aesthetic, but Larson imbues Carol Danvers with this specifically disaffected and wryly sarcastic quality that’s highly reminiscent of the ‘90s “tough chick” protagonist (think Dark Angel or Buffy).  Aside from some neat perspective shifts and twists, Captain Marvel lacks Black Panther’s thematic sophistication, Thor Ragnarok’s kooky visual splendor, or Infinity War’s ambition. It’s a middle-tier Marvel movie. And yet I liked it a lot more than that label implies. Brie Larson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Samuel L. Jackson are so much fun to watch. Carol Danvers is so cool. The ‘90s references, obvious as they were in places, tickled me. What else can I say? I got a kick out of it. "
"Sep 25, 2019",positive," Sometimes it's hard to be a woman. Especially if you have superhuman powers and, according to certain men in your life, a tendency to become too emotional. Captain Marvel packages this dilemma in a stylish, thoughtful and funny superhero movie that's a twist on the usual origin story formula. It's less about learning to master new powers than it is about learning to accept already being powerful. For the eponymous hero (played by Oscar winner Brie Larson) — who shoots thunderbolts from her fists, can pilot any spacecraft and actually fly unaided herself — this change of emphasis is significant. The genesis of this ""new"" Marvel character goes back to the end of the 1960s in comic book form, just as second-wave feminism was gaining momentum. Her re-introduction to audiences at this point in time is framed as a story of empowerment that's aimed squarely, though not exclusively, at young women and girls. Co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck — former indie filmmakers who cast Ryan Gosling as a drug addicted schoolteacher in their 2006 debut Half Nelson — introduce her in a way that feels relevant, and occasionally, even bold. The film begins like a sci-fi noir: she greets the dawn alone in a small apartment overlooking a city of concrete towers and floating traffic having barely slept, beset by yet another nightmare of a deeply buried yet vague trauma.  Dressed for work in a hi-tech bodysuit and sporting hair with bounce — she might look like a typical, almost banal Marvel heroine without much of an inner life (Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow comes to mind), but it's immediately clear she has much more to offer. After a blistering introduction featuring a bungled raid on a tribe of shapeshifting aliens known as Skrulls, she ends up in our world, on a mission to recover some top secret tech before they do. It's the mid-nineties, LA, and an old photo of her wearing a Guns N' Roses T-shirt proves she has history here, though she doesn't seem to remember.  She falls from the sky and through the roof of a Blockbuster video store (not the last 90s reference milked for nostalgia or comedy) barely able to get her bearings before she's exchanging fire with more Skrulls. Their leader is played by Ben Mendelsohn, a scene-stealer who becomes the source of some of the film's increasingly droll humour — quite an achievement given he's delivering his best lines through a thick green mask. As Elastica's jagged Britpop hit Connection pierces the soundtrack, and before you can say Terminator 2, Larson's character has stolen a motorcycle and changed into the more 90s-appropriate attire of flannelette and Nine Inch Nails T-shirt to start looking around.  It takes the rest of the film for her to put the pieces of her past together, discovering the identity of an older woman (Annette Bening) who reappears in a vision, and reconnecting with an old friend (Lashana Lynch) who's become a mother since they last hung out.  Along the way she's aided by her commander (Jude Law) and partnered with local grunt investigator Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), a man Marvel fans already know has an extraordinary future ahead of him. In two hours the film weaves its story of personal intrigue with some bruising if sometimes confusing action sequences, and the odd cathartic fist pump of righteous triumph. In a key moment, Captain Marvel's shadow will fall across the face of one of her worst enemies as he literally cowers in the sand at her feet. By the end, she will accept her powers and know how terrible they can be, and even emerge from the experience with some innocent blood on her hands. The idea that good people sometimes do terrible things is grist for the dramatic mill in the Marvel universe, and Larson's superhero is set to become just as morally complex as her better-known, mostly male, peers. Given how multifaceted the journey's been, you can't help but feel slightly sorry for Scarlett Johansson's relatively less complex Black Widow, and look forward to when both women are finally on the screen together.

"Sep 17, 2019",positive," Out of all the Moviejawn writers, I’m probably the least qualified to write about a superhero movie, let alone a Marvel Cinematic Universe effort. Yes, I wrote about both Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok for MJ, but…like Captain Marvel seems way more complex. Its many, many, many iterations and history of storylines are overwhelming to say the least. Sooooooooooooooooo….I’m just not gonna talk about all that! Problem. Solved.  What I do feel the need to discuss is Brie Larson’s everything. I’ve been in love with her since she bitch-sang her way into my heart in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World as Scott’s evil ex, Envy Adams. And thennnnn she was adorably smart and funny in 21 Jump Street, a dumb little reboot I never ever knew I needed, but totally and completely did. After that, I started following her as much as I could, and in Short Term 12, as a woman struggling with her own past while managing a group home for teens, well, she blew me away. Besides Brie’s knockout portrayal, the film features a heart-wrenching script and raw performances by Larson, LaKeith Stanfield, Kaitlyn Dever, Rami Malek, Stephanie Beatriz, and John Gallagher, Jr. And then she went on to do Room and we know how that worked out for her! Finally, in 2017 she directed a quirky little gem called Unicorn Store, about a…store of sorts, run by Samuel L. Jackson, that sells…unicorns. Yes. I swear. I caught the film at TIFF that year with MJ’s Rosalie Kicks and I really enjoyed it’s low-key vibe and message of self-acceptance. And Larson directed it! I remember thinking to myself after the screening, “What can’t Brie Larson do?"" and, “I can’t wait to see what’s next for her.” (Unicorn Store is scheduled for an April 5 release, btw).  One of the things that came next was Captain Marvel, and while i wouldn’t call it a near perfect film, it’s one of the more solid in the MCU, and, I would argue, a more soulful two hours than that other female-led superhero jawn, Wonder Woman. I was really happy WW got made and I felt Gal Gadot did an amazing job leading the overall solid effort. But WW feels like it’s missing something for me…heart? An emotional center? Huh? What the hell am I even talking about, anyway? I shouldn’t really be comparing Wonder Woman to Captain Marvel anyway, because that’s not really important, or the point. There is certainly room for more than one female-centered action-packed jam, obviously. And I would love to see more of them. I guess I’m just programmed deep-down to pit female against female which is a real shame considering so many of us ladies, of all backgrounds and experiences, don’t often get a seat at the table. Instead, I should support and be positive and uplift.  So in that vein, back to Brie. Word on the street is mixed, but I think she was a superb casting choice. Larson and Jackson go well together, like vanilla ice cream and applesauce, or pretzels and chocolate chips (trust me, both are really good). As Captain Marvel, otherwise known as Vers, aka Carol Danvers, she brims with confidence, infusing ho-hum dialogue and simpler moments with a little something extra…to me, she always shines. Larson’s scenes with Lashana Lynch (as Carol’s Earthly bestie Maria Rambeau) are warm and lively - I genuinely believed in their friendship and identified them as the film’s heart immediately. It’s these particular emotional threads that can be a hard sell in superhero films (Black Panther is the only other such film I would categorize as showcasing such capable acting) yet Larson, Jude Law, Annette Bening, Ben Mendelsohn, and Lynch do a decent job with what they have to work with. Gemma Chan and Djimon Hounsou have a few small moments, while crowd faves Clark Gregg and Lee Pace reprise their regular Marvel roles as Agent Coulson and Ronan, respectively.  Besides solid acting, the most noticeable to me is the rather subdued look and feel of the film, which isn’t surprising given the previous work of directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. The two started collaborating at NYU and are most known for Half Nelson (Fleck directed, the two co-wrote), Sugar (directed by both), and It’s Kind of a Funny Story (also directed by both). If you’ve seen any of their work you might think…huh. That’s an interesting choice. While featuring a bit of that ol’ Marvel sleek and shine, Captain Marvel isn’t necessarily a marvel of technical filmmaking. It’s capable and sturdy cinematic craftsmanship - a solid effort by two fairly independent directors. But it’s the storytelling aspects of the film, the character development of Carol Danvers that really sticks out. This is, after all, an origin story. And origin stories can sometimes be boooooo-ringly bogged down with exposition and back story. But in thinking about all the films of Boden & Fleck, a pattern emerges - in all of their films there is a strong sense of characters, a real progression and feel for the heroes of their films that is quite powerful. In that way, it’s no surprise to me these two were granted the Captain Marvel reins - to sift through all the possible iterations and past plots in the Captain Marvel back catalog, to fully introduce her character to existing and potential new fans alike - it’s a hefty task. While there are some aspects of her character I wanted to know more about (namely who she was on Earth before getting sent to Kree) I think Boden and Fleck should be proud of the work they did here.  One thing I wouldn’t be so proud of? Using really overplayed 90’s songs to convey an overall 90’s vibe and reference point. Yes the film is a bit of a prequel of sorts, taking place at some point in the 1990’s which, sigh, can we move on from our 90’s nostalgia now? Radio hits by Nirvana, Hole, Garbage, and R.E.M. are all here. Cool. Like, you couldn’t dig a little deeper? Like maybe prioritize mood over highly recognizable songs you’re likely to hear in passing at a Wawa or in an Uber or some shit? And don’t get me started on the fight sequence set to No Doubt’s “Just a Girl.” I get it. She’s a girl! Fighting evil aliens and stuff! And Gwen Stefani is…just a girl, fighting the patriarchy in a bra top and plaid ska pants!  Look, I have nothing against this music or any of these bands - I love No Doubt! “Sunday Morning” is the bomb! “Don’t Speak” is karaoke fire! I recently listened to n-o-t-h-i-n-g but Nirvana for three whole weeks! But picking these particular played af radio jams just smacks of laziness to me. The song choices felt phoned the fuck in and they made me laugh, roll my eyes, and sigh all at the same time, which is quite a feat. In this regard, the film could have benefited from some stronger music supervision. I mean, they had a big budget to work with…have fun with it! It’s like someone opened ANY 90’s playlist on Spotify and said “this one,” oh “and this one,” and, “yeah this is fine.” And then called that shit a day and went to Chipotle for a burrito bowl. I think we can do better.  Captain Marvel, as a standalone film within the MCU, lacks a bit of overall fire power, which is a bit upsetting considering the people involved: Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, the Almighty Jude Law, etc. But what it lacks in wonder and awe-inducing moments it makes up for in warmth and heart and a strong sense of who Captain Marvel is and where she’s going. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing what’s next for her in Avengers: Endgame, a hopefully No Doubt-free film."

"Aug 23, 2019",positive," But what I wanted - what I demanded - was more depth, more potency and a lot less of the box-ticking ham-fisted bids for my female feels. Captain Marvel's kind of girl power isn't targeting me and what she embodies is the pop-culture potential to empower young women all over the globe. I just wanted a more cohesively meaningful experience that's all - without the hollow '90s button pushing and with more cinematic oxygen for Brie Larson to breathe in."
"Aug 22, 2019",negative,"The first half hour of Captain Marvel feels disjointed and poorly developed in part because you're dumped into an alien culture you know nothing about, which you see from the perspective of a woman who has no memories and doesn't know who she is."

"Aug 18, 2019",positive," Comic book fans first met Carol Danvers in 1968 as a supporting character to a male Captain Marvel. An Air Force Security Chief, she was by turns a sharp investigator and a “batty blonde,” as some angry fans called her, often reduced to a romantic interest.  But when she reappeared in 1977’s Ms. Marvel, she was advertised as a “superheroine for the seventies...and equally well set for the eighties and nineties too!” Even the “Ms.” moniker nodded to the feminist movement, paralleling real-life superhero Gloria Steinem’s Ms. Magazine. On her new career track as editor-in-chief, Ms. Marvel took on the fight for equal pay—and won. Since these origins, audiences have seen a total of 7 different Captain Marvels. In making its film entry for the superhero, Marvel Studios could have easily drawn from one of its male iterations but the world would have been the worse for it. We need another male superhero like Tony Stark needs to borrow a dollar. Luckily, Marvel Studios finally seems ready to answer the pent-up demand for more diverse leads, and Carol Danvers was chosen to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), bringing with her a wealth of canonical material to pick and choose from.  With that long canon, however, came a challenge for the filmmakers who had to balance between the central mystery—how did the human Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) become the supercharged Vers of the Kree Empire, and why?—with the need to create a superhero exciting enough to stand with Marvel’s all-star lineup of Avengers. They succeed, for the most part. But for Carol, the problem of a muddled identity and a cookie-cutter villain fail to set her up for the kind of journey we’ve come to expect in a superhero’s origin story, let alone a superhero whose powers go far beyond anything we’ve seen before. The heavy mantle of being the first female-led film in the MCU means that Captain Marvel can’t spend too much time actually confronting systemic issues of gender, lest it differentiate itself too much from the standard fare of kicking ass and saving the world. Rather, Marvel neatly weaves the patriarchy-smashing thread into the larger origin story by gender-swapping the role of Carol’s mentor, Mar-Vell (Annette Benning), making their relationship all the more significant. Mar-Vell—or as Carol knows her, Dr. Wendy Lawson—not only solidifies the importance of female relationships but provides meta commentary on women succeeding in male-dominated fields, be they the Air Force or a film franchise. The bond between Carol and her best friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) proves similarly poignant, recounted in flashbacks as Carol begins to regain her memory of life before she wakes up on the Kree planet of Hala. Maria pervades her past, as both women eagerly become test pilots for Dr. Lawson in the only opportunity for women to fly combat aircrafts during that time. Their bond marks another first for Marvel, which—despite plenty of opportunities—has never deemed the relationship between two women worthy of its own narrative. Along with her role as conduit to Carol’s memories, Maria provides emotional support with the help of her daughter, Monica (Akira Akbar). Monica, in turn, provides affirmation through her belief in Carol, delivered with the sort of clear-eyed certainty that few adults retain.  Despite this brilliant lineup of role models, though, there’s still no staving off disappointment at the absence of Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). After a tragically cancelled series, a painfully short presence in Ant Man (2015), and a heartbreaking death in Captain America: Civil War (2016), seeing the woman who founded and led S.H.I.E.L.D. welcome Captain Marvel into the fold would have felt more like an ending that honored her legacy.  The MCU has a dismal track record when it comes to characters of color, with the notable exception of Black Panther (2018). Consistently relegated to secondary roles with thin backstories, even Gamora (Zoe Saldana), whose history featured heavily in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), lacked autonomy. She was there primarily as a romantic interest to Starlord (Chris Pratt) and a means of tying epic baddie Thanos (Josh Brolin) to the fate of the Avengers. Meanwhile, Captain Marvel centers a white protagonist but offers significantly more fleshed-out roles that rise above the sidekick status bestowed upon Rhodey (Don Cheadle) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) in Iron Man and Captain America: Civil War, respectively. In fact, Captain Marvel offers two origin stories, delving beyond the stoic one-eyed stare and intimidating façade of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). The Fury of the mid-nineties exudes humor and optimism, as well as a baby-talk-filled fondness for Goose the cat (or, as we learn, Goose the flerken). The movie also builds a bond between Carol and Fury that rationalizes how and why his last moments on earth before being “poofed” in Avengers: Infinity War are spent reaching out to Captain Marvel. The relationship Carol rediscovers with Maria conforms slightly more to Marvel’s sidekick model. Like Rhodey to Tony Stark and Falcon to Steve Rogers, Maria is the ally in a deeply personal battle. Unlike previous ones, though, Maria exists in her own right, outside of her relationship with Carol. In preparing for her role, actor Lashana Lynch made a point of meeting pilots who were also mothers, emphasizing that she wanted the character to “have a real through-line that the Black community or people of color will be proud of” and for “mothers to be proud that there’s a single mother in the MCU.” Where Captain Marvel does fall down is in its representation of Asians, something that has long been a problem in this universe. (If only it could take a cue from the Marvel of the small screen.) When Asian characters aren’t being whitewashed or reduced to tropes, they’re prone to being stripped of their Asian identity altogether. In the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, Mantis, played by French-Korean actor Pom Klementieff, has her features distorted to appear “alien.” Filipino-American actor Dave Bautista’s character, Drax, has grey skin covered in red marks. While in Captain Marvel, Gemma Chan’s Minn-Erva is canonically blue-skinned like most Kree, it’s hard not to notice a pattern. That’s part of the problem with colorblind casting: It becomes altogether too easy to erase identity altogether. Captain Marvel finally delivers a female superhero to the MCU, one whose story stands on its own and earns her feminist cred while making for an enjoyable time all around. A few slow moments and Jude Law’s lackluster villain (sorry, Yon-Rogg, but ya basic) are offset by a strong set of allies, the thrill of nineties throwback references, and a peckish flerken masquerading as a cat.  Marvel also deserves major props for tying the Air Force’s past policies that barred women from combat into Carol’s backstory without making it seem contrived. Amidst manufactured outrage from misogynistic “men’s rights” activists and “incels” offended by the idea of a female superhero movie, the acknowledgement of systemic sexism is both timely and necessary. Given everything, one outstanding mystery is why Marvel didn’t spend more time hyping Goose in the lead-up to the movie. Where Nick Fury knew to call in his most powerful weapon in a time of crisis, Marvel never saw to combat the online trolls hellbent on tearing down Captain Marvel and its star with the Internet’s most powerful weapon: a picture of a cat.

"Aug 18, 2019",positive," Evangeline Lilly may have broken ground as the first female titled character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but the studio has yet to deliver an origins story that rivals DC Movies’ Wonder Woman. A decade since Iron Man, Marvel finally puts a female superhero in the limelight. Starring an ensemble cast, Captain Marvel follows Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), an alien Kree warrior suffering from amnesia. Discovering that Earth is in the middle of an intergalactic war, she travels to the planet – only to re-discover her past and truth behind her identity. The events after Avengers: Infinity War have left Marvel’s superheroes – not just the Avengers – somewhat lost. With Captain Marvel teased at the end, there was always the pressure to deliver a badass superhero that is more than capable of assisting the Avengers as we head into the forthcoming Avengers: Endgame.  On paper, it feels like there is a lot of pressure. Up until last year, Marvel has been criticised for its lack of diversity. After the success of Black Panther, audiences have been more eager than ever for a female-led Marvel film. Therefore, Captain Marvel needed to be seen as a celebration of women and what they are capable of. In this respect, the film focuses on Carol overcoming her demons and becoming stronger than her mostly male peers.  It is almost easy to forget how significant it is. While Black Panther highlights its roots in Africa with its focus on the continent and its place in the world, Captain Marvel subtly celebrates women as a gender. This not only applies to its protagonist but the team who bring it to life. This ranges from co-director Anna Boden and co-screenwriter Geneva Robertson-Dworet driving the project, to notable supporting cast members Gemma Chan, Lashana Lynch and Annette Benning, who make an impact in smart and physical roles. The dynamic between Carol and male characters is also interesting to see. While female characters in the MCU are mostly supporting roles or love interests, Captain Marvel offers a complex relationship between her and Starforce commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). He assumes the role of superiority as Carol’s mentor but thankfully, it is not demeaned by romantic overtones. Instead, their conflict stems from their capabilities and allows Carol to be judged by her punch, rather than her looks. Throughout the film, Carol has been trained to control her emotions to make her a better warrior but it is her empathy that truly makes her a hero. Larson offers charm amid self-confidence and smiles, delivering both emotional punch and physical presence. Marvel mainstay Samuel L. Jackson reminds audiences of his comedic talents as rookie Fury, whose eyes are instantly wide open when confronted with his own close encounter. In addition, his trepidation makes him a more likeable and complementary character for Carol, unlike the stoic Yon-Rogg. Combining impending doom, emotional angst and wit, the screenplay is typical of an MCU film. The direction is smart and imaginative, with aerial chases reminiscent of Independence Day orStar Wars and fight scenes brilliantly set against a 1990s’ soundtrack dripping with nostalgia. After 11 years, a cynic could argue Marvel Studios is almost over-compensating for a lack of a female heroine. But you can’t argue with the results – fun, action-packed and empowering, Captain Marvel is the girl power film the MCU needs."

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Captain Marvel had a lot of impossible expectations to live up to that were put in place by the worst kinds of people. There were demands for the character to smile and emote more (after only being shown a couple minutes of footage), anger at the film’s star, Brie Larson, for having the audacity to want to engage with and hear the opinions of more women and people of color during the press tour instead of the usual white, straight males that make up the vast majority of film critics, and a coordinated bombardment of negative reviews for the film, both before and after its release, as a stand against Disney and Marvel Studios for daring to put out a superhero movie with a female lead (played by an outspoken activist). Surely, the companies must be pushing some sort of sinister agenda with all of this. You’d be wise to steer clear of the battle that’s raging online surrounding this film, if not just to be able to form your own, unswayed opinions on it, than to help keep your sanity. Or, if you’re like me, you can take all of Captain Marvel’s discourse and channel it into viewing the film as a direct and necessary response to it, marking it as not only an important moment in movie history but in culture as well. It remains to be seen whether it will have as major of an impact as DC’s Wonder Woman (which beat it to the punch) or Marvel’s Black Panther, but Captain Marvel soars above the predetermined hate and animosity aimed at it, standing tall as both a fantastic standalone movie and a powerful and necessary addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Vers (Larson) is a soldier in the Kree army, an alien race led by an A.I. known as the Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening). The Kree have been waging a war against another alien race known as the Skrulls, reptilian shape-shifters that are able to turn into other life forms, perfectly blending in to society (and they star in many YouTube conspiracy videos!). Ver’s team of “noble warrior heroes”, as she calls them, is sent on a mission to take down the Skrull general Talos (Ben Mendelsohn), but it quickly turns south and Vers is sent crashing down to planet C-53, otherwise known as Earth. If that sounds like exposition overload, that’s because it is. Captain Marvel struggles a bit at the start; the first act is filled to the brim with exposition dumping and learning the names of all the different aliens and planets, but it manages to find its footing once Vers is kidnapped by the Skrulls early on. We’re shown the life she once had on Earth: she was born as Carol Danvers, a young woman who overcame the world’s sexist obstacles in front of her and who, along with her friend Maria (Lashana Lynch), became an Air Force pilot, until an unfortunate run-in with an alien force ended up cutting Carol’s career short as well as giving her superpowers. We’re shown Carol’s life and backstory via the Skrulls scrolling through her brain and watching her memories, rewinding, fast-forwarding, and even adding commentary, which ends up being a fun and unique way to unload the information onto the audience. Captain Marvel is a lot of things at once. It’s a space fantasy adventure, a superhero origin story, a buddy cop comedy, a period piece set in the 90s, a prequel to the larger Marvel universe, and even a piece of social commentary all in one. It miraculously never falters in being all of those things, and the balancing act is a testament to the writing and directing skills of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the duo that Marvel hired to helm their first woman-led film. The studio has often brought on smaller filmmakers before and put them in charge of their massive films, but Boden and Fleck could be considered as indie as they come, so it’s quite impressive that they were able to handle a project as big and important as this particular movie. The film really gets moving once Carol is back on Earth and teams up with Sam Jackson’s Nick Fury. Jackson is having a ball, finally free from having to be the hard-ass director of S.H.I.E.L.D. that we’ve come to know. This is a much younger Fury who isn’t afraid to have fun and show that he’s enjoying himself, and the chemistry between he and Larson makes for one of the better duos in Marvel’s vast list of characters. The de-aging technology used on him is a ridiculously convincing feat of visual effects, so utterly seamless that you won’t even be thinking it after the first couple of seconds. Mendelsohn is also a scene stealer if not an entire movie stealer – his performance as Talos is one of his best and most entertaining performances in years. What Marvel always seems to get right is its dedication to character, and for good reason. The whole idea behind the MCU’s heroes, both in casting and in writing them, is to establish someone that audiences will be happy to see on-screen for the next decade or so, and Larson’s Carol Danvers is a very welcome and long overdue presence. Carol is a hothead who’s fueled by emotions like anger and sympathy, and is constantly told by her superiors to suppress her feelings if she wishes to succeed. It hopefully shouldn’t go over anyone’s head that this story of female empowerment is about a woman who’s told that her emotions make her weak and vulnerable, when in actuality those emotions are her source of strength. There’s no need for subtlety here. Carol’s powerful feelings towards things are what makes her the god-like being she’s destined to become, and I can’t imagine what seeing that kind of story in a massive blockbuster like this must feel like to a good number of women across the globe. Carol is a natural successor to Captain America, and she’s similar him in a good number of ways. She has a moral sense of right and wrong like he does, and always gets back up no matter how hard she’s knocked down. But what sets her apart is how much more empathetic she is than most superheroes. Her motivations are heavily influenced by her need to help the less fortunate. Not that Steve Rogers doesn’t fight for the same ideas, but the people that he’s trying to save are rarely shown to us and given time to exist as characters themselves in his films. The people that Carol chooses to protect and fight for are actual characters in her film, and it makes for one of the MCU’s most righteous and empathetic causes we’ve seen a hero take a side for. I usually consider the Marvel films to be at their best when they reflect certain social issues and events that are taking place in the world today, such as the first Iron Man or Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Captain Marvel joins the list by making some pretty poignant commentary. Besides the obvious themes of sexism and the suppression of women in positions of power, the film also tackles ideas on opening up one’s mind and not being afraid to reconsider everything you think you know. Vers lives her life without questioning her commanding officers and their noble conquest, and it’s not until she’s exposed to the other side and its people that she begins to understand the bigger picture. The ideas and morals you’ve always held true may not be so black and white, and that can easily lead to conversations on blind patriotism and nationalism versus exposure to new viewpoints and ideas. Captain Marvel’s most impressive aspect to me is its unapologetic stance on certain government policies and fascism-like rule of law. There’s dialogue about refugees who are only looking for a home, and how those refugees are treated like dirt and even eradicated. There’s talk about keeping out “invaders” through whatever means necessary, and even family separation and the traumatic consequences of that. It’s bold, moving, and surprising to see issues like these being addressed in a superhero movie, but it’s all the better for it. The film throws so much into its two hour runtime that it doesn’t seem like there’s any way to properly handle them all, and yet it does, and does it well. Despite a clunky first act, Captain Marvel shatters the opposition against it. It’s a touching, exciting, and fun adventure that introduces one of Marvel’s better lead heroes, and it easily exists on its own without needing to cater or connect to the larger universe it takes place in (although it does answer plenty of questions). The story takes some great twists and turns that keeps the energy up, and Carol’s final transformation into the extremely powerful titular Captain is one of the most earned, triumphant, and chill-inducing moments in the history of the genre. Carol Danvers is a monstrous force of good to be reckoned with, and as she herself states, she has nothing to prove to anyone.

"Aug 15, 2019",negative," Bill Murray, as the chief of police in a town beset by zombies, delivers a key line in The Dead Don’t Die: “I was supposed to retire two years ago.” Adam Driver, who plays his junior officer, asks him why he didn’t, to which Murray, breaking the fourth wall, replies, “Are we improvising here?” They leave it at that. This scripted off-script moment and their deadpan delivery evade the question, which the characters, the actors playing them, and writer-director Jim Jarmusch never answer. The Dead Don’t Die alludes to a gerontocracy that has refused to make way for the next generation, holding on to power even if it has to do it from beyond the grave. Tellingly, the first zombies reanimated are Iggy Pop and Sara Driver, playing 1970s rockers who crawl out of a graveyard and head for a vintage diner like the one in American Graffiti. Classic rock will never die, the 1950s will never end. Murray and his subordinates dispatch members of the current generation swiftly and cruelly, without thinking much about it. They invade the motel room of three twentysomethings played, respectively, by a former TV tween turned pop idol, another former TV tween, and an influencer who makes money by wearing sunglasses on Instagram (Selena Gomez, Austin Butler, and Luka Sabbat). The cops find these tourists dead, attacked by the zombies. They chop off their heads preemptively, before they can turn. The three dead tourists are a far cry from the Blank Generation hipster trio who ended up in a Florida motel in Jarmusch’s Stranger Than Paradise thirty-five years ago, bohemians who came from nowhere and ended up nowhere. Back then, Jarmusch implies, such people could afford to be aimless wanderers, to kill time without getting assassinated themselves. Jarmusch does let some kids from juvie run off, but the movie’s one real survivor is Tom Waits, the only hermit left alive, as unkillable as he was in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs last year. The Dead Don’t Die situates our unabated longing for the zombie apocalypse in the permanent October of rural areas where the Halloween store is open year-round. The exurban Jarmusch depicts both the sadness of half-empty towns upstate and the annoyance of having to live among neighbors like Steve Buscemi’s farmer, a right-wing sourpuss in a modified MAGA cap. This is a film unhappy with humanity, right down to specific neighbors. Mild and bleak, idyllic and enamored with hopelessness, the film is either Jarmusch’s version of The Trouble with Harry, the autumnal Hitchcock film in which a dead body keeps reappearing, or one of those goofy William Castle horror comedies from the 1960s with Sid Caesar, in which bodies escape their coffins. In the end, it plays like a country version of Ivan Passer’s bleak-funny 1974 movie Law and Disorder, which starred Carroll O’Connor and Ernest Borgnine as auxiliary policemen cruising the nighttime streets of the pre-Jarmusch Lower East Side. Back then, strung-out thieves and rapists outnumbered hipster artists in the city, the same way zombies outnumber the hipster cops in this movie. Jarmusch has moved upstate and found the same dead-eyed weirdos milling around. From Only Lovers Left Alive to The Dead Don’t Die, alive or dead has ceased to make much difference to Jarmusch. When the high-class vampire couple in the former murdered people so they could survive, they were different from these cops because they were aristocrats, not civil servants. What matters to Jarmusch is that there is a natural order in the universe. When Tilda Swinton removes herself from the scene to take her place among the aliens in this movie, that order is preserved, as it was when she was a vampire in Only Lovers Left Alive. For Jarmusch, these lumpen zombies lack panache, their brainlessness is not romantic, and they deserve what they get. Jordan Peele’s follow-up to Get Out also mines country-city terror, though its point of view is Californian, not bohemian. Unlike Jarmusch, who would never do something so uncool, Peele channels the Steven Spielberg of the early 1980s, the Spielberg who hired director Tobe Hooper to make Poltergeist edgy, but then interfered to ensure it remained family friendly. In Us, Spielberg—as a concept, as a theme, and now as a memory—constrains Peele’s vision the same way Spielberg constrained Hooper. Poltergeist is not The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, because whatever that movie was and however much money it made, it was not commercial according to the aesthetic moralities of Hollywood. Peele is haunted by his Reagan-era childhood and its pop-culture debris, which is understandable, but by compulsively inserting it into his movie Peele makes Us much less frightening than it could have been. Too much of the movie depends on what’s on the T-shirts characters wear. Peele’s wardrobe choices are supposed to ground the film in specific time periods but also have to perform the function of grounding it thematically. This is a recurrent tic of Hollywood filmmaking that is both distracting and flattering to an audience already primed to hunt for 1970s and ’80s shout-outs in every Netflix show. In Us, it lessens the impact of the Hands Across America T-shirt at the film’s climax. Peele presents a class-divided America using this ironic signifier, but it has the effect of implying that what will unite us as citizens is not class consciousness but liking this film, as one audience, because we get the references. Lupita Nyong’o has no trouble being terrifying and disturbing as both the villain and the hero of Us. The scary, constricted voice she uses for her prison-jumpsuited doppelgänger was performance art, with Laurie Anderson vocals that seemed to come from an LP I couldn’t quite remember. Tim Heidecker, as an evil version of the slightly more successful, back-slapping white neighbor, was more genuine in his dangerous frenzy and therefore more frightening. Heidecker comes across as an actual mirror version of himself, revealing in his violence a murderous id he’s channeled from comedy. Us exposes the shadow world of poverty and despair that undergirds the sunny lifestyle of people who are pretty sure, but not quite sure, that they’ve made it as middle-class Americans. It peaks during its home invasion scene, after way too much loving/winking establishment of regular family life, the kind of thing Hitchcock or a TV commercial would have done much quicker. Peele’s slow buildup to the family’s confrontation with the twisted, starved versions of themselves, who seek to eliminate them and take their place, brings something to the screen that black audiences have been denied in Hollywood movies—a chance to see themselves in the Spielbergian glow of alleged American normalcy. The nightmare image of the jumpsuit-clad doubles in the shadows of the driveway, a family car sticker come to life as menacing paper dolls holding their own scissors, is the highlight of Us. The home invasion is the film’s best scene, but it doesn’t last long enough after all the buildup. It could have been the whole movie from that point, and maybe would have been, in a cheaper film. Somehow the clash between the competing versions of this family ends up muddled in post–Black Swan ballet, the same way Luca Guadagnino’s ponderous Suspiria remake did. Ballet, as a signifier of class privilege, lacks shock value in something as all-American as Us. Pretending that it’s eerie and sinister is like hitting all the keys on the organ at once, Phantom of the Opera style; i.e., a cliché, not scary. Captain Marvel takes place in 1995, the year of the Oklahoma City bombing and the O. J. Simpson trial, of “Gangsta’s Paradise” and “Common People.” That’s why I went to see it. I wanted to find out how Marvel Studios handled the mid-’90s. It turns out they handled them like Top Gun, so more like the 1980s. The Blockbuster Video scene in the movie reminded me that people today think the former existence of Blockbuster Video is funny. I guess the existence of Netflix, the contemporary version of Blockbuster, is not funny because you don’t have to go to a store. It’s hard to remember Captain Marvel, because it was boring. Brie Larson, who plays Captain Marvel and two other young women who are also Captain Marvel, gets to kick an old lady’s ass on a bus. The old lady is a shape-shifting Skrull, however, so it’s OK. Later, Larson becomes a god. Her apotheosis reminded me that before the film came out, Larson insisted that instead of the usual superhero-indoctrinated 40-year-old men attending her press junket, there should also be a young woman in a wheelchair in attendance. I thought about this young woman as I watched the rest of Captain Marvel. I might resent Captain Marvel, it occurred to me, if I were in a wheelchair and Brie Larson had summoned me to watch her flying through the air and into outer space. In the movie, the Skrulls turn out to be the good aliens and the Kree, friendly at the beginning, are revealed as evil and destructive. The same thing could happen to an entertainment reporter who gets a special invitation from a movie star. There is an astonishing fight scene in John Wick: Chapter 3 that takes place at night in a glass building with glass floors and walls. The inky set design in this scene, striking and ultra-contemporary, makes everything look like it’s taking place under cracked iPhone screens. But the dynamic between Wick (Keanu Reeves) and the mewling sycophant he’s fighting (Mark Dacascos) took a lot away from the action. There was no way this guy named Zero could get the upper hand for long. The choreography and the black-transparent look of that section of the film gave it a jolt and, for a while, a reason to exist. The rest lacked anything as involving, despite the aggressive, nonstop complication of every second of the film, including the title. There is also a ballet scene that is supposed to be moody and frightening and isn’t. Asia Kate Dillon, a nonbinary actor with a neatly shorn head, would have made a better foe for Wick, but Dillon is instead constricted to Helmut Newton–esque slinking and posing in tight black pencil skirts. Ian McShane’s Winston, a traitorous hotelier, sleepwalks through his role like he’s playing the Most Interesting Man in the World in the Dos Equis beer ads. As incessant gunfire in the lobby and corridors destroys his hotel, McShane responds with ever faker nonchalant bullshit acting, mirroring the overelaboration of everything else in the film. The John Wick franchise has an official weapons supplier, but the film’s target audience isn’t gun nuts. This is a movie for corporate travel agents upset that it costs so much to stay in hotels. Brian De Palma, the director of the first Mission: Impossible movie with Tom Cruise in 1996, and therefore one of the architects of the genre, has, at this point, approximately zero chance of directing a $100 million action movie like John Wick: Chapter 3 ever again. His reputation may have been enhanced by the 2015 documentary about him made by Noah Baumbach and Gwyneth Paltrow’s brother, but his career got no bounce from it. The director of Carrie, Dressed to Kill, and Scarface depends these days on sketchy European producers, who have an unfortunate tendency to mirror the plots of his movies by betraying him. Thus Domino, his latest, arrives bitter and slapdash, more a plan for a movie buzzing or shimmering in De Palma’s angry head. Domino takes place in Copenhagen, where police detectives speak English and used to be in Game of Thrones. The director seems to have contempt for both his leads. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, playing a not-bright cop who sets the plot in motion by forgetting his gun one morning, has a second-choice feel. Carice van Houten, who exists in Domino like she’s waiting for each take to end so she can go outside and smoke, resembles Noomi Rapace in De Palma’s earlier film Passion, but why? In the past, the resemblance would have been evidence of directorial obsession. Here, it’s probably a coincidence. Even in its partly realized form, Domino’s every frame is better than anything in Game of Thrones. In its less-than-ninety-minute running time, Domino links together CIA surveillance, terrorism, drone warfare, ISIS execution videos, and international film festivals. It all has a last-stand feel, in which De Palma excoriates today’s regime of easy-to-make but disposable images, which people, now all spies, use to brutalize each other. Scene after scene features piles of red tomatoes, there for critics to throw at De Palma so they can be tabulated and scored by review aggregators. Politics for De Palma is a bizarre excuse for exploitation. This is one of his films in which he spares no one. Everyone is a torturer and a victim at the same time in Domino—confused, compromised, in for punishment. With some irony, De Palma sets up a Libyan terrorist (Eriq Ebouaney) as the film’s conscience. The CIA (in the person of the satanic-blasé Guy Pearce) forces him to work as a double agent, and the film’s plot comes to depend on him. Yet by the end De Palma abandons this downhearted terrorist without any more hesitation than he gave a minor character whose face gets dunked in a fry cooker. A final scene, which could be the last of De Palma’s career, switches back and forth between a Spanish bullring and a hotel rooftop. The locations are linked by the threat of a mass killing and a camera drone, which De Palma uses to collapse the great distance between mass events and personal ones, a last gasp of mise-en-scène in the age of martyrdom videos on YouTube. Robert Pattinson, the lone adult survivor on a spaceship destined for a black hole, jettisons the bodies of his dead fellow prisoner-astronauts, shoving them into body bags then dropping them one by one into the void. With his shaved and sculptural head, Pattinson would make a good match with John Wick’s Asia Kate Dillon, but in High Life he’s saddled instead with Juliette Binoche’s evil doctor-sorceress, a nefarious Beverly Crusher with a Renata Adler braid. In this very dark (and orange) science-fiction movie, Claire Denis has provided her ship with a cell called the Box, a stainless-steel sex chamber that cleans itself like a car wash and comes equipped with a pneumatic dildo. High Life’s interest in bodily fluids is constant and intense. At one point, Binoche, an insomniac eugenicist, carries a handful of semen around the spaceship, while blood, shit, and breast milk smear its walls and floors. We meet the young co-ed crew in flashbacks. Criminals back on Earth, now institutionalized in the name of science, they are abusive and sexually violent—ugly-minded people who lash out at each other because they’re trapped. Denis pushes bodies to their limit while sending humanity to the margins of the universe in this frustration endurance test posing as space exploration. Technology exists in the film only as a way to experiment on helpless people. The opposite of Interstellar, High Life presents sci-fi without hope, its ship a borstal. In the crew scenes, High Life becomes an Alan Clarke movie in outer space. It’s a companion piece to another arty genre film Denis made, 2001’s blood-smeared Trouble Every Day. Hard to take, unclear in its intentions, it nonetheless delivers hard truths in a new way. High Life’s ending lacks the awesome evolutionary psychedelics of 2001: A Space Odyssey, opting instead for a hookup with an earlier, abandoned spaceship inhabited only by sick dogs who survive in artificial green light. Denis contrasts it with the yellow nimbus surrounding the black hole. The end credits remind us, more than once, that the Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson somehow owns this yellow light, along with his redesign for the supermarket vegetable sprayer misting plants in the ship’s garden. Juliette Binoche also costars in Non-Fiction. The new Olivier Assayas movie about the Parisian publishing world has things in common with Things to Come, the 2016 film by Mia Hansen-Løve, Assayas’s ex-wife, which starred Isabelle Huppert as a Parisian philosophy professor and author. The difference is that Things to Come was a clear-eyed case study in middle age and Non-Fiction is an immature French farce. Binoche plays a TV actress named Selena to whom another character mentions Juliette Binoche, a bit of self-referentiality drawn from the “he looks like that fellow in the movies, you know, Ralph Bellamy” gag in His Girl Friday. The Dead Don’t Die does this kind of thing, too, only more so, with the actors breaking character to switch into script discussions. Maybe Jarmusch and Assayas’s generation of arthouse directors feels trapped by storytelling and wants to leave it behind. The Lettrist ending of Assayas’s Irma Vep pointed in that direction; in the years since, Assayas has become a more conventional filmmaker. Here, he mistakes His Girl Friday for a zany romp instead of understanding that it’s a cynical, fast-talking adventure-romance, like all Hawks’s movies, as well as a comedy about the warlike nature of mass communication. The world of big-city newspaper reporters in the US in the late 1930s must have struck him as akin to the publishing world in contemporary Paris, where the big issues are not capital punishment and government corruption, like in His Girl Friday, but whether ebooks are the future. That adds up to French people saying the word Kindle a lot. This is a variation on the hand-wringing over the future of the cinema in Irma Vep—one thing Assayas keeps telling us is that it’s a changing world out there, with all this technology. Vincent Macaigne is better and funnier than all that as an autobiographical novelist kind of inspired by Philip Roth in the same way this film is inspired by screwball comedies. In the end, whatever happens to book publishing doesn’t matter as long as these French people can sleep with each other’s spouses and have young mistresses and go to their summer houses. In His Girl Friday, when Cary Grant promises to remarry Rosalind Russell then cons her into going away with him to cover a breaking story instead, it was important to the film that they weren’t married anymore. Grant was exploiting Russell and stringing her along to get what he wanted for his newspaper. In Non-Fiction, nobody can get back together again because they never leave each other in the first place. Joanna Hogg’s roman à clef of a movie covers her years in film school in early 1980s London, when she was figuring out how she wanted to make movies and living on and off with an upper-class junkie boyfriend employed by the Foreign Office. Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne), naive, from a good home, doesn’t at first understand that the semi-comatose but well-dressed and handsomely flawed Anthony (Tom Burke) is a user. Her slow realization that something is wrong, and her polite, matter-of-fact introduction to Anthony’s addiction, which they don’t discuss, are the stuff of a horror movie. Hogg downplays the lurid aspects of their love affair, replacing them with the familiarity of everyday life as their relationship unfolds. Strange, awkward scenes begin to pile up. Anthony brings Julie lingerie from Paris, asks her to put it on, tells her, “You’re a dark horse, Julie.” Then she sees the tracks on his arm, not knowing what they are. Their meals at Harrods have a sleepy, well-mannered mood that becomes nerve-racking and narcotic as Anthony runs out of money and begins to steal and sell Julie’s possessions. Burke plays Anthony as Peter Lorre in an Evelyn Waugh novel. He’s creepy but since he’s unaware of it, Julie doesn’t see it either. We never see him away from Julie, so his scoring and shooting up are not part of the film, nor his last hours. The blown-out white light from the windows in their apartment and the pillow shots Hogg uses between scenes, accompanied by snippets of songs from the period by Robert Wyatt, Joe Jackson, and the Pretenders, shield the film from becoming too novelistic—it reminded me of a Margaret Drabble novel crossed with Ozu. The Souvenir is a beautifully realized, painful movie that only hits the viewer in the hours and days after seeing it. Tilda Swinton, in gray hair, plays her own daughter’s mother, communing human-to-human for a change, instead of with the astral beings her muse or casting directors usually put her in touch with. I never thought I’d see Elisabeth Moss singing “Another Girl, Another Planet” as Courtney Love in The Kat Bjelland Story. In Alex Ross Perry’s Her Smell, set in the 1990s post-grunge Amerindie rock scene, Moss plays Becky Something, an alcoholic, drug-addicted guitarist and singer in a band with drummer Ali (Gayle Rankin) and bass player Marielle Hell (Agyness Deyn). Becky is a mess. A thrower of dressing-room tantrums, by the time she is finally able to make it onstage, she insults the audience and can only plow through a song or two before tottering into the drums and collapsing. Between gigs, she annoys everyone by hauling around her shaman, an irritant named Ya-Ema (Eka Darville). In the studio she fumbles between ill-prepared nothingness and rage. Perry and Moss follow Becky’s descent into addict hell and eventual recovery with true commitment to Cassavetes-style self-destruction and enlightenment. The difference is that John Cassavetes did not make period pieces. The 1990s evoked in Her Smell are as cleaned-up as Becky isn’t. A new all-girl band comes to supplant Something She, Becky’s weirdly named combo, and Perry presents them as more post-tween Green Day than post-Hole Veruca Salt. They’re nice, studious, and millennial, like they got extra credit in a college course on riot grrrl for being in this movie. This removes the film by one step from the rawness of Becky’s damaged life, turning Her Smell into an acting exercise with ’90s touches. The film’s five-act structure brings Becky up-to-date at a reunion show, where she almost pulls her disappearing act sober. That could have been more interesting than all the coven-based female empowerment on display in the scenes where other women musicians sit cross-legged on the floor, light candles, and praise her. Those scenes came off as both pandering to a contemporary audience and a rejection of the generation Becky represents. I guess that’s realistic. By act four she had already moved upstate to strum her guitar alone in a big house and ruminate on her misdeeds, a trajectory artists from her era know well. Becky wins her battle with herself, but when it was over I felt bruised and tired, as if she’d been pummeling me, too. Like Roberto Durán fighting Sugar Ray Leonard, she had me holding up my hands and muttering, “No Moss.” Then the credits rolled and snapped me out of it with their fake album covers from the ’90s. The Hustle is very low stakes and I only saw it because I was stuck in a mall in New Jersey for two hours and it was the next thing playing. The point of this remake of a remake is that the genders have been switched. Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson now play roles played by men in the other two versions. Yet by the end, it is a man who fools these two women con artists, blackmailing them into being his employees. Not the ending I was expecting from a film that begins by asserting that all men are suckers. Alex Sharp plays this unconvincing man-boy grifter as a bland nothing whose initial guise is colorless and empty—a nice-guy tech billionaire shy around women. Hathaway has to pretend, by turns, that she is a member of the British leisure class and a German psychoanalyst femme fatale. She excels in the latter put-on, opening a new path for herself she will probably never explore again. Wilson, meanwhile, must pretend she is blind, an acting stunt which I guess is only not offensive because blind people won’t see it. At one point Hathaway demonstrates to Wilson how to produce tears on cue, giving the lie to her award-winning crying jag in Les Misérables. It’s a secret of her craft she reveals too cheap. With his second feature, following his excellent debut, 2015’s Kaili Blues, Bi Gan has done something radical. An incursion into form, Long Day’s Journey into Night reveals the trick of 3D. Instead of a continuous, pseudo-immersive experience that starts at the beginning, here 3D infiltrates more than halfway through the film’s nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time. When it finally enters, Bi reemphasizes its alleged immersiveness, 3D’s main selling point, by having this last, hour-long section comprise one continuous take, a single shot that floats from a gondola lift through a nighttime market and elsewhere through the end of the film. Before this shot begins, the viewer must figure out when it’s time to put on the clunky 3D glasses, a point in the film Bi signals by having his protagonist, Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue), sit down in a movie theater. Bi has established himself as a significant artist with just two films partially by being a synthesist of all previous auteur cinema. Long Day’s Journey into Night combines many strains, from the poetic realism of Le jour se lève to Hiroshima mon amour and In the Mood for Love, from Warhol (a character eats an entire apple in one shot) to Tarkovsky (a glass shakes itself off a table). It all seems put together in a calm, hypnotic state, using the gliding camera of Theo Angelopoulos to move through the torture and violence of Johnnie To and Tarantino gangster movies via the observational modernism of Apichatpong Weerasethakul. That all of this becomes present in the viewer’s mind without taking away from what’s original about his film is a testament to Bi’s skill. He’s an artist who learned online, like some poker champions, watching films at home, and it’s significant that he comes from provincial China, not the NYU Tisch School of the Arts. We inhabit the romance and fatalism of Long Day’s Journey into Night as in a dream—someone says in the film that “dreams are lost memories.” Bi’s camera follows Luo as he searches his hometown for his lost love (the enchanting Tang Wei from Lust, Caution) and his best friend from twenty years ago, Wildcat, probably murdered. I happened to see Long Day’s Journey into Night at the Metrograph at a morning show at which I was the only person present. During the 3D sequence, a woman came into the theater and sat down right next to me, which I thought was odd. I turned to her, wearing the 3D glasses over my regular glasses, wondering what was going on. She looked at me, and in an Australian accent she asked, “Is this the appatmint?” I had no idea what she was saying. I was fully inhabiting the film and her entrance seemed like part of it. She repeated the same question—Is this the appatmint?—and this time I understood. She wanted to know if this was The Apartment. Billy Wilder’s movie of that name was showing at the Metrograph in the other theater. “No,” I told her, “this is a new Chinese movie in 3D.” She looked at me wearing the 3D glasses, then at the screen, and instead of leaving she watched the movie for a while. Something about what was going on froze her in place in front of images that were out of focus for her because she didn’t have 3D glasses on. Suddenly she got up and walked out. Maybe I should have followed her out and gone to see The Apartment, starting my own journey into night, but by then Bi Gan had me pinned in place, stuck in the flow with his moving camera. Jia Zhangke’s latest film also focuses on events in the early 2000s, but since Jia has come to his mastery the hard way, his view of the interrupted relationship between a gangster (Liao Fan) and his moll (Zhao Tao) expands not just in filmic memory, but out into the real world of contemporary Chinese history. His vistas are bigger, plainer, and harder on the people who inhabit them. If this is a genre story in some ways, just as Long Day’s Journey into Night is, it’s a more tragic one, with bitter, unromantic repercussions. There is fatalism and then there is stoicism. Here, it is a woman’s longing, not a man’s, that propels the film. Zhao is one of the greatest actresses in cinema, and her journey in Ash Is Purest White is hardboiled and subtly melodramatic. She begins as the realist daughter of an outmoded communist ideologue, then transforms herself into a cool money-making criminal in the provincial jianghu underworld. She takes the fall on a gun charge for her lover and ends up a jailbird. To get back to him after prison, she passes through the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River on a ship where her identity and money are stolen. The new Chinese capitalism erases her past, rendering her sacrifice meaningless. Zhao’s Qiao is absorbed into a vast audience singing along with pop performers onstage, a wider angle on the individual karaoke in Bi Gan’s film. Jia’s tour of his country displays a 21st-century China that is dirty and mean, punishing its characters for coming into adulthood in a petty, greedy time. There is no progress in their lives, only aging. Qiao ends up where she started, doubly abandoned in her old hometown, serving the old gangsters who never made it out. For Bi Gan, only love can break your heart. In Ash Is Purest White, there are many more things that can break your spirit. This soccer-refugee satire from Portugal by Gabriel Abrantes and Daniel Schmidt is cute as hell and as fluffy and pink as the enormous Pekingese puppies Diamantino Matamouros (Carloto Cotta) pictures in his head when he’s on the field about to score a goal. Unfortunately, it’s also about as savage as those puppies. Diamantino is a modern Candide, a pampered star athlete without a thought in his head. He adopts a refugee as his son after a sudden burst of compassion, then allows himself to be experimented on by scientists who are after his perfect superman genes. Diamantino is too clueless to realize his refugee son is actually a queer girl (Cleo Tavares) scamming him, and that his doctors are slowly turning him into a woman, a side effect of their gene-mapping drugs. On top of all this he is duped into running for office by a fascist, anti-immigrant political party. The plot sounds like next-generation Almodóvar or latter-day John Waters, but because Diamantino is so gentle and nice in its intersectionality, it ends up somewhat hapless, with a downbeat, wistful ending. Surely big pharma, right-wing manipulation, and the endless greed of the already wealthy deserve something a little harsher than this ninety-seven-minute underwear ad, an example of present-day camp too sane and well-behaved to have much bite. Shot by Sean Price Williams, the dexterous cinematographer who also filmed Her Smell, Michael M. Bilandic’s Jobe’z World, which is set, I think, in the present, is way more forthright and weird than Alex Ross Perry’s film. The kind of micro-budget New York indie that exists to get gloriously terrible, out-of-it reviews in the Hollywood Reporter and Variety, Jobe’z World is pretty glorious and out-of-it itself. The film follows Jason Grisell as Jobe, an idiotic former semipro inline skater (“There’s some vids floating around of me on the internet”) turned drug delivery man. He makes his rounds through an absurd demimonde where he encounters an actor, a doomsday prepper, a brain-damaged stand-up comic, a barefoot bum, and his mother, who is a fan of Bono’s music in Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, and whom he tells he wants to get a face tattoo. Jobe has an annoying voice and looks like he’s aging in front of the camera. When his employer (Lindsay Burdge) sends him out on a special delivery, the customer turns out to be his favorite actor, Royce David Leslie (Theodore Bouloukos), a highfalutin sci-fi stalwart in films with names like The Skull Machine. The two discuss the big questions and Jobe shows him a comic book he’s made. After Jobe leaves, Leslie begins livestreaming his drug experience, frothing at the mouth and becoming incoherent. Bilandic multiplies Leslie’s head across the screen in a trip scene set against a backdrop of the cosmos. His death throes resemble the welcome-to-the-movies snipe they project before the feature at the Cobble Hill Cinema. The cast in Jobe’z World is excellent and will do anything, no matter how stupid. Stephen Payne, as the armed and bunkered-down prepper, gets some big threatening closeups from Bilandic and Williams. They hold on him as he regales Jobe with his theories on movies and points the business end of a rocket launcher at the camera. All the characters in the film have made bad lighting choices for the interiors they inhabit, and the nighttime exteriors are similarly cheap green and purple displays. The stand-up comic (Owen Kline, the younger brother from The Squid and the Whale) is barely coherent and wears a large button that reads license to bullshit. This feature film is a concise and action-packed sixty-seven minutes long, and I could have easily watched another half hour of it. Or definitely another ten minutes. “Does the angle between two walls have a happy ending?” asked J. G. Ballard. Jill Magid’s epic troll of a documentary on the Mexican architect Luis Barragán suggests that it does not. Magid, who features herself in her film as prominently as Barragán (he died in 1988), visits the architect’s house in Mexico, where she stays on a one-person residency to make Barragán-centric art of some kind using his personal archives. In this section of The Proposal, we see shots of Barragán’s monumental, colorful, slab-like work, which photographs beautifully and is a pleasure to look at. Magid then reveals that Barragán’s estate and the rights to depicting his work are owned by an Italian woman, Federica Zanco. Zanco is an art historian married to the Swiss billionaire whose family owns Vitra, a design firm that manufactures high-end modernist furniture, runs a museum, and has headquarters that feature buildings by famous architects including Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid. Zanco owns the Barragán estate because her husband, Rolf, bought it for her as a $2.5 million engagement present in 1995. Federica and Rolf have subsequently trademarked Barragán’s name. They don’t allow researchers to see his professional archives, nor do they allow any of his work to be displayed in other museums, including ones in Mexico. Photographers who take pictures of the architect’s buildings are supposed to pay them, as are publishers who reproduce the photos. They’ve got the Barragán intellectual property rights in copyright lockdown. Understandably, Barragán’s family finds these Swiss capitalists obnoxious and creepy, so they allow Magid to dig up the urn containing the architect’s ashes and turn a portion of them into a diamond. Magid sets this new diamond in an engagement ring she offers to Zanco in exchange for freeing the Barragán rights. Zanco will finally get an engagement ring if she accepts Magid’s macabre offer. Magid films her meeting with Zanco from across the street using a long lens, like a police surveillance video. Zanco is barely glimpsed, inaccessible to the public, protected by her wealth. This could be the subject for a Hitchcock or a De Palma movie, and Magid comports herself with a certain allure and mystery even though she is open and cheerful. Her necrophilia is loving and all-American. She contrasts it with the secrecy of these austere Swiss oddballs and their exploitative scheme. Much of the film is epistolary because it takes Magid forever to get Zanco to meet her. In Magid’s letters she compares herself and Zanco to Barragán’s lovers, while Zanco responds with an excessive, perfect cordiality that seems both ultra-cultured and psycho. Somehow the precepts of the art world allow Magid to execute this giant prank flawlessly, hiring workers to dig up the cemetery and paying scientists to make the diamond in a commercial lab, all just to freak out one avaricious Italian woman who lives in the splendor of a great artist’s work, poring over his records and objects in secret. n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year.

"Aug 8, 2019",neutral," Captain Marvel‘s “Vers” (Brie Larson) can’t remember a thing about her past life. She has only known this: training with her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and fighting with her fellow Kree warriors in Starforce.  Things start slowly, as origin films, do with a lot of world-building groundwork in outer space. Starforce includes talented actors like Rune Temte, Gemma Chan, and Djimon Hounsou, but they’re badly underused in the picture, separated from Captain Marvel almost immediately. That’s probably so we can get to Earth quicker, but it makes their obviously forthcoming return later in the picture less emotionally impactful than it could and should have been, given what they represent in the narrative. When we arrive on Earth in the 1990s the movie picks up considerably, buoyed by cheeky nostalgia, plentiful jokes (it's strangely hilarious to see Brie Larson slowly tapping away at old computers), and a stronger focus on the protagonist’s plight.  The best move is an overall lightness in tone, which springs from the fun chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson (reprising his Nick Fury role, this time with both eyes since we’re in the past) and the total relief that the stakes aren’t the destruction of the universe for once (whew) but a war in outer space that we largely aren’t privy to.  We’re on a more personal journey for Captain Marvel to recover her memories and become her truest, most powerful self. With something of a blank slate to play, Brie Larson leans into her star charisma with professional ease.  The supporting cast are all strong. Jude Law is compelling (as usual) but this time with yellow eyes. Annette Bening, who we didn’t expect to see in a superhero picture, is having fun with her dual role, as a mysterious figure from Marvel’s past and the Kree leader known as “Supreme Intelligence”. Lashana Lynch has a largely thankless role as Maria Rambeau, Captain Marvel's former best friend who she has completely forgotten due to the memory wipe. But Lynch rises to the challenge and gifts the exposition with some heart and soul. The film’s happiest surprise, though, is that it features not one but two true scene-stealers in the form of an adorable ginger cat named “Goose” and a very game and rangy performance from Ben Mendelsohn as both a S.H.I.E.L.D agent and the Skrull who impersonates him. Comedy aside, the bread and butter of superhero movies are their action sequences and unfortunately here Captain Marvel comes up bland. Directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck (best known for the fine Ryan Gosling drama Half Nelson) have always been gifted with actors but haven’t yet conquered the unique directorial challenge of fight scenes and crafting memorable action set pieces.  One early sequence requires our heroine to fight without the use of both of her hands (long story) and in another, she isn’t exactly sure who’s she’s fighting, stopping frequently to suss out which “human” is actually the Skrull she’s chasing, giving the sequence a unique rhythm.  These significant obstacles make a world of difference; In the end the problem with the other action sequences, particularly the dreadful finale, may be that Captain Marvel is too powerful. When a character feels unbeatable, action sequences deflate into mere pyrotechnics and foregone conclusions, CGI light displays doing all the work when it’s the heroes themselves and those insurmountable odds that we can’t imagine how they’ll overcome that we’re invested in. If it’s too easy for them, there’s no triumph to cheer on. With film #21 Marvel is breaking no new ground but for the gender of its protagonist. It seems insane in a subgenre that firmly belongs to the action/adventure side of filmmaking that’s already given us iconic female characters like The Bride, Sarah Connors, Lt. Ellen Ripley, Neytiri, Catwoman, and Wonder Woman to name just a few, that it would take this long for Marvel to let a woman lead the way but here we are.  Women and fans of female heroes deserved better than Captain Marvel (a mediocre entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) but there’s no denying that it’s rousing to see a woman triumph within the context of this heretofore excessively masculine universe.  That said, there’s unfortunately not a single moment that’s a patch on the kind of ecstatic cultural charge of the “No Man’s Land” sequence in Wonder Woman (it remains a shaming miracle that the messy Warner Bros/DC school of superhero filmmaking pulled off a great female hero movie before Marvel even deigned to bother trying).  Perhaps now with Marvel’s self-imposed glass ceiling shattered, they’ll be able to reach for that kind of grandeur themselves? We hope they’ll try. Comic books have a rich history of great female characters and all too few of them have been done justice on the big screen.  It was so much fun to see Annette Bening having a ton of fun and reminding us all what a big star she is. I'm so used to seeing her in smaller films now, that it was great to see her in something like this. Hopefully, this is the start to a great year for her.  I mean, I get it: Marvel needed to introduce a Thanos killer and it had to be relatively serious, not an absurdist punchline and that's why this is a Captain Marvel movie, not a Squirrel Girl movie, but...wouldn't that absurdist punchline character make a better movie...? That having been said? Now that they've committed to including Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel, I'm pulling for her Solo Film 3 being a $60-80 million cancer special. I too thought the beginning dragged and the return of her space team towards the end lacked emotional punch, but everything on Earth and especially the New Orleans sojourn was just aces. The latter part especially felt refreshingly ""indie"" to me which makes sense that's where Fleck/Boden excels. I did seem to like the film more than you since Larson and the other actors were just so good and it was damn thrilling to see her kick ass (as well as Lynch in her one big moment). Mendelsohn is perfection and the CGI to Jackson is eerie good. I had a much more positive response.  Some of the film-making criticism is warranted - there are significant holes in the plot and the Hala aesthetic seems, as you put it, rushed and empty.  But the solid performances all around, especially from Larson and Jackson whose Danvers and Fury have the most chemistry of any Marvel duo since Thor and Loki, makes for a great time at the movies. I like Brie Larson but she's totally miscast as Captain Marvel - she seemed out of her depth - her performance lacked her usual charm and fun and charisma.And I didn't think she had great chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson.The dreaded curse of the green screen perhaps?But she CAN work in blockbusters - she worked like gangbusters in Kong Skull Island for instance.So I don't know why she came across so bored and dead in Captain Marvel.She also looked kinda terrible with that awful hair - wig? - very distracting and unflattering. Ulrich: Because she wasn't really here for this, and was more interested in solo movie 2 and 3? As I mentioned earlier, I am honestly SO down for a $60-80 million cancer special ending this franchise. She's the strongest Avenger, according to a short clip I watched on IMDb, and boy, isn't it awesome to finally see a hero who totally dominates? <- we haven't had that in a marvel film. And that someone's a woman! I liked this film a lot.  It wasn't a top-tier film of the MCU!!!!!  However, it did what it needed to do and more.  Plus, I agree Joe on Lawshana Lynch as I liked what they did with Maria Rambeau as someone who would help Vers remember who she is as well as take part in the battle proving that she can kick ass w/o superpowers. Mild spoilers but here are some issues that Captain Marvel may or may not have touched on. Police brutality, the after effects of the 'scramble for Africa,' DADT, immigration, 'the end of history,' gender equality in government institutions. But it handles those issues in a frustratingly problematic way. Jaragon: When I saw that the red and blue costume went with the starburst thing, I groaned. Pure lazy translation with no regard for future continuity. Yes: Carol's Ms. Marvel swimsuit, sash  and heels look wasn't going to translate to live-action. (See: Catwoman, Elektra, Barb Wire. I could mention how dull the MCU versions of Scarlet Witch and Elektra look like as counterpoints of ""anti-sexy gone wrong"", but I'd rather dull design to that creeping feel of wrongness of design.) But, also yes: Carol NEEDED to wear a costume with a thunderbolt symbol on it, and that being the Red and Blue costume makes ALL THE SENSE. I'm with you 100%, Nathaniel. I don't usually care for superhero movies and I cried like a child watching Wonder Woman. Maybe it's not fair to expect Captain Marvel to feel the same, but I thought it was just as forgettable as most Marvel movies. It didn't feel any more special than Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and that's just depressing."
"Jul 30, 2019",positive," One sentence review: Captain Marvel is a fun, corny, and empowering origin story that feels like a bridge between the past and the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One paragraph review: Captain Marvel harkens back to the MCU origin stories that kicked off this wave of superhero movies — and that’s a good thing. It’s smaller, tighter, and more character driven than the other movies in the franchise, even if it feels non-essential. It also helps that Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson have firecracker chemistry and are supported by a stellar cast — Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch are standouts. Captain Marvel had one of the hardest time slots on the Marvel Cinematic Universe calendar. If the forthcoming Avengers: Endgame is the series finale, then Captain Marvel is the penultimate episode. However, like many penultimate episodes, it feels like any typical entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — for both better and worse.  Like last year’s Bumblebee — the out of sequence 80s dripped entry in the Transformers franchise — Captain Marvel is a prequel to almost all of the MCU — except Captain America: The First Avenger. Taking place in the 90s and following a Kree soldier called Vers (Brie Larson), Captain Marvel is less about forwarding the overall storyline of the MCU — though it certainly connects some dots — and more about giving Captain Marvel a warm welcome to the MCU with her own origin story.  And while the movie hits a lot of the same beats as a typical superhero origin story, it presents them in an interesting way. That’s because Vers spends most of the running time of the movie trying to make sense of these dreams of a life on Earth that feel like memories.  Along with her crew of Kree warriors — Vers’ mentor and commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Minn-Erva (a criminally underused Gemma Chan), Korath (Djimon Hounsou reprising his Guardians of the Galaxy role, among others — Vers continues the long-running war with a shape-shifting species called Skrulls. However, after being captured in a battle, Vers escapes only to crash land on Earth. There, she catches the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D operative Nick Fury (a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson — the CGI is phenomenal) who helps her on her quest to find out who she is and defeat the Skrulls. The movie balances funny fish-out-of-water moments as Vers marvels at the 90s culture and technology — she literally crash-lands into a blockbuster — with a charming buddy comedy between Fury and Vers. And while it’s all fun and entertaining, the movie does get at something deeper.  So much of what works in Captain Marvel comes from directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (best known for Half Nelson, which scored Ryan Gosling his first Oscar nomination). MCU mastermind Kevin Feige choosing the duo to tackle the introduction of what is most likely going to be their most important hero to date was surprising. They’ve directed quiet character-centric indies for most of their careers. But it’s that indie intimacy that drives the movie’s best moments.  Vers finally tracks down some answers in the form of her former best friend on Earth Maria (a terrific Lashana Lynch). And instead of it being this huge melodramatic moment where the hero reunites with their best friend or finally learns their identity, the movie slows down and gives a genuinely emotional moment between these two women. Lynch nails the scene. She’s a standout.  To both its benefit and detriment, Captain Marvel is essentially inconsequential in the MCU timeline. We could have jumped into Endgame without this story. It pulls some of the tension and stakes out of it — even the villain of the piece Talos (Ben Mendohlson — truly great) is mostly benign. However, it also allows the movie to be that corny, fun, and uplifting origin story that we’ve seen, but still eat up.  It helps that Brie Larson is magnetic as Captain Marvel. She’s not your typical superhero. There’s something genuine about her. Even when she truly harnesses the extent of her powers, it feels like a real person experiencing something extraordinary. Speaking of the extent of her powers, Thanos better beware.  At just two hours, Captain Marvel is really just a blast to watch. It’s a movie that I think will replay a lot better than in this current moment when we can separate it from the conclusion of the franchise. It doesn’t bring much new to the table other than the fact that the hero is a woman. But with that, it inherently has these touching moments of empowerment that make this an important entry in the MCU.  Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut.

"Jul 17, 2019",neutral," Everyone’s going to be talking about Captain Marvel for the next few weeks, as it’s inarguably the biggest film being released in the world, but precious little of that chatter is going to be about the film itself. As with last year’s Black Panther, the latest Marvel release is being positioned less as an actual film and more a wokeness bargaining chip for social media debate, only where last year the conversation was centered around representation along racial lines, this year it’s largely about gender. Captain Marvel is the first MCU film to be fronted by a female star (in this case, the very talented Brie Larson) after a decade of the opposite, so it stands to reason that there would be a Ghostbusters-esque showdown between mouth-breathing Men’s Rights Activists and feminist film fans, but the digital back and forth is even more convoluted than that simple right and wrong binary. The film’s marketing is reaching Michael Bay levels of military-industrial complex pandering, which, alongside Marvel’s weird relationship with Northrop Grumman, has given folks pause. Does seeing this film mean you’re supporting diversity in genre film or does it mean you’re aiding a corporate-spun military recruitment tool? The answer is neither. This is a superhero movie. In fact, it’s basically the same superhero movie we’ve seen roughly three to five times a year for the last several years. Perhaps the reason so much of the Captain Marvel discourse has expanded into this larger interconnected web of special interest group opinions and the inescapable tendrils of late capitalism is because it’s more stimulating to fight about each of those issues than it is to unpack an empty box. There just isn’t that much to say about this movie and that’s basically by design. Half-Nelson directing pair Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck, along with a coterie of female screenwriters including Nicole Perlman, Meg LeFauve and Tomb Raider reboot scribe Geneva Robertson-Dworet, were tasked with making Captain Marvel’s mixed-up history into a coherent and unified superhero origin story in the MCU mold. Unlike DC’s Wonder Woman, Marvel doesn’t have the luxury of a century old pop cultural icon as their First Lady, so the creative team dismantles and rearranges elements of Carol Danvers’ Green Lantern-y origins into a coherent narrative about an Air Force pilot with amnesia who thinks she’s an alien super soldier. Technically a prequel, the film utilizes its 1995 setting to fill in some MCU history blanks, like figuring out how Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) lost his eye, or finding out how long it takes for things to download on the prehistoric internet. Oh, wait, no, it’s much more of that latter than the former. Anyone hoping for a fascinating expansion of the Marvel mythology is going to have to settle for Buzzfeed ’90s Kid bait masquerading as comedy, all delivered with the identical MCU sense of humor that is effortlessly charming in the moment, but groan-inducing hours later when one ponders how much screen time it took up. What’s so frustrating about Captain Marvel is that, at its core, there’s a truly engrossing narrative surrounding Carol and her best friend Maria (Lashana Lynch) and their mentor Dr. Lawson (Annette Bening), but the decision to make Carol’s history a mystery means we only catch it in glimpses between much less interesting material. In interviews, Larson talks about how much these relationships meant to her in the script, but in the finished product, they’re just glimmers of hope for a better, more emotionally engaging film than the one we get. Larson, herself, is a welcome presence to these films, but her character is less a character than a collection of quirks and entertaining line delivery. At one dramatic moment, Carol exclaims about not even knowing who she is, but the real tragedy is that the audience doesn’t either. When her best friend comforts her with a monologue about her identity and character, that just isn’t a sufficient substitute for letting her actually have one. The closest the film gets to exploring gender equality the way the marketing would suggest is a climactic sequence that, at best, resembles a Super Bowl ad leveraging feminist iconography to get you to buy something. Captain Marvel is one of the most expensive movies of the year and it still looks ugly and drab and universally less cinematic than most modern television series. The editing style used for exploring the non-linear nature of Carol’s story feels formally inventive at times, compared only to other MCU films, but the action and everything else is the same rote, beat-for-beat second unit mediocrity we’ve come to expect from this brand. Why mess with a successful formula, one might ask? Well, it’s because as much as this film breaks a glass ceiling for women in the superhero genre, the MCU still lives under a domed limit of their own creation. Sure, because they’re fun and entertaining and people love the characters, they’ll keep getting high grosses, so they can’t lose. But if there’s no risks taken, ever, then how can they truly ever win? Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Jul 12, 2019",positive," Carol Danvers’ Captain Marvel character has had a long, strange trip from her debut to landing into theaters this year. While Danvers originally appeared in comic books way back in 1968, but wouldn’t be known as Captain Marvel until 2012. In that span of time the character underwent massive changes to a very convoluted origin story (aren’t they all?) and adopted multiple aliases (Ms. Marvel, Binary, Warbird, Ms. Marvel again), outfits, and abilities. It wasn’t until the last decade or so that writers (Kelly Sue DeConnick, chief among them) attempted to streamline all of that continuity, settled on a specific set of superpowers, and a real solid understanding of the character’s role in the comics and her personality as a whole. This scrambled backstory before landing on solid ground is different than most of the other main heroes in the MCU thus far (with the exception of the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY movies). Luckily, writers Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet figured out a way to create a clear throughline for Danvers’ origin and story. Unfortunately, a lot of their characterization ends up feeling flat and not as engaging. CAPTAIN MARVEL is an incredibly mixed bag with a lot of great elements butting up against weak character and thematic work. In the year 1995, on the distant planet of Hala, Veers (Brie Larson) is an amnesiac who seeks to fight with the Kree Starforce under the command of Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). Unlike her fellow soldiers (Gemma Chan, Djimon Hounsou, Rune Temte), Veers is able to shoot out energy beams from her fist—but has great difficulties controlling her emotions. She and the other Starforce members are fighting the Skrull, an alien race of shapeshifting terrorists. After protracted fight, Veers ends up on Earth, with the Skrulls in close pursuit, led by their general, Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). Veers teams up with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to figure out the Skrulls’ plans, save the day, and learn the truth about Veers’ origin as Carol Danvers back on Earth. Also there’s a cute cat named Goose in it. CAPTAIN MARVEL, directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, does a lot of things very well. The casting is utterly stellar with a ton of talent given good moments scattered throughout. Jackson and Mendelsohn are particularly excellent and play so well against each other. Mendelsohn possesses a great mix of menace, humor, and sympathy, while Jackson is clearly in THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT mode and having a ball. Who knew hearing the ultimate spymaster talking with his mouth full of sandwich could be so delightful? Annette Bening as a shadowy member from Danvers’ past has some fun moments and Gemma Chan is incredibly badass as Minn-Erva. Larson is a solid actress who shines best in her moments of being charming and playing off the actors around her. She also can do righteous anger well, but for some reason it is a very bifurcated performance with these two sides never being reconciled or seeming to be part of the same character. A lot of her jokes and action quips fall flat, and while there’s a narrative arc to the character, there isn’t an emotional one. There were plenty of opportunities to build that into the film, but ultimately it’s scattershot and misses a propulsive sense of maturing that would truly engage audiences. Technically, the movie is also kind of a mixed bag. It looks great, with engaging cinematography by Ben Davis and CGI that really creates an expansive galactic world for Danvers to exist within. The costume and production designs and make-up work are similarly great and do an excellent job create an interstellar world that viewers can immediately step into. But then there are far too many visual gags and callouts to “it’s the ’90s!” that it becomes groan inducing. The score by Pinar Toprak is probably one of the top five scores in any Marvel movie, with a great shift between electronic synths in the alien planets and a more melodramatic orchestra on Earth, before becoming very John Williams-y when the two worlds collide. But the needle drops of “it’s the ’90s” hits are so blatant and awkward that it doesn’t quite work. The songs are obvious choices, they are very loud in the mix, and most are meant to be nostalgic gags. The one that is mildly clever doesn’t even make sense within the context of the movie and is so underlined that it goes back to being annoying. One other element about CAPTAIN MARVEL that is also a dichotomy is the fun element in the third act. Embracing her abilities and taking on villains, there is a certain glee to be had when flying around and shooting energy beams — I get that. But when she destroys ships with people on them, and literally shouts “Woo!” right after doing so…it’s just odd. That’s not to say she should be somber and sad, but it’s an odd exclamation to killing people. Obviously Marvel heroes tacitly kill people all the time, but it’s not usually done with such glee. And the arguments that it’s because she’s a warrior/soldier doesn’t make sense, compared to the fact that Captain America, Falcon, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and others are that as well. (It should be noted that I was the only one that felt this way when I asked folks after the screening; the other movie nerds – all white males – said that they would “Woo!” too if they could fly and were killing people that tried to kill them.) It’s just an odd take that could’ve been solved by using “drones” or robots or something, because it’s not like she’s a character with bloodlust or anything. CAPTAIN MARVEL isn’t bad but it isn’t great. It has some excellent moments, terrific performances, and solid lines of dialogue. In the hands of other writers and directors, Larson will shine as the character who will better combine her modes into one well-rounded person (hopefully with much better jokes). It has a few fun “prequel” moments (taking place way before IRON MAN and THE AVENGERS), but it also has a few groan inducing prequel moments. It’s a fine and fun movie that manages to create a streamlined origin that honors the comic roots along with a mostly satisfying narrative arc. But the lack of digging deeper and giving a real emotional character arc, with a true set of goals, keeps it at a distance from the audience. It is still important and great to see such a powerful female character, who is strong yet vulnerable, that is able to be beacon of representation and inspiration for young moviegoers. And audiences should look forward to more adventures with Captain Marvel — but here’s to hoping she soars better in those. Sign up for our 100% Free Daily Grindhouse Newsletter.

"Jul 10, 2019",positive," Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) is a Starforce warrior on the planet Hala. As she is named on the planet, Vers doesn't remember her past. She sees flashes and tries to connect the threads. The home of the Kree race is ruled by an AI called the Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening). Along with her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), Danvers fights against shapeshifting, cunning Skrulls who infiltrate and then take over planets. During one such intergalactic mission, Danvers gets separated from her crew and finds herself in captivity of Skrulls. The escape from their clutches leads her to planet Earth. Here, she meets SHEILD agent Nicholas Joseph Fury (Samuel L Jackson), who out of depth himself, stumbles upon the real point of contention between Kree and Skrulls. During this journey to figure out a solution to this problem, Danvers discovers her past as an Air Force pilot and her future as the most powerful superhero this universe has seen.  Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is amazing from the get-go. She embodies the character in the way she carries herself, the confidence, the poise is infectious. She also has good comic timing. It comes out in brilliant flashes in the tense situations and especially during her buddy-cop banter with Samuel L Jackson's Fury. This is Larson's story to shine. She has your complete attention no matter who she is sharing the frame with. Her chemistry with Lashana Lynch, Carol Danvers' friend from the Air Force, is impeccable. The cast of the movie works together to prop up Captain Marvel. Samuel L Jackson, sorry, young — in his 40s — Samuel L Jackson is a delight. Whenever his de-aged face is on screen, you cannot focus on anything else. It is far more amusing than what we saw with Michael Douglas as young Dr Hank Pym Ant-Man. Sadly, this is where technical superiority ends. Captain Marvel's origin story is the biggest clusterf—k of Marvel Comic books. For some reason, director duo Boden and Fleck thought keeping the past in congruence with the written word is a good idea. Therefore, despite Kelly Sue DeConnick's revival in 2012 serving as the basis for this movie, you never get to know Carol's real origin. After a point, the flashes from her past hurt the pace of the movie. Patchy editing, lazy action scenes, and mediocre visual effects are a few issues with this superhero movie. Nothing a loyal fanbase can't ignore. Captain Marvel is a good movie that finally gives a superhero with practically zero chinks in her armour. She will take out your Iron Man, Captain America in a single punch. It's a huge plus that she is a female role model little kids can look up to. It has taken 10 years and 20 movies for Marvel to deliver a female-led solo feature. Therefore a pat on the back just for establishing the character that shall take the centre stage in the coming phases of Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with highly-anticipated Avengers: Endgame. Marvel fans will watch it regardless. Those who are casual viewers, you should not avoid good entertainer. You can definitely avoid IMAX and save a few pennies."
"Jul 10, 2019",positive,It's a fun movie with some great Nick Fury moments.
"Jul 8, 2019",positive," Kree warrior hero Vers (Larson) has the same recurring nightmare and doesn't know why.  She remembers very little of her past except being in some kind of war.  She trains with her Starforce Commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law; The Talented Mr. RIpley) who tries to help her harness her power and curb her emotions.  They, along with the rest of their team, are fighting the Skrull, a group of alien shapeshifters out to destroy the Kree. After being captured and escaping from the Skrull, Captain Marvel finds herself on Earth searching for the person in her recurring dreams, Dr. Lawson (Annette Bening; American Beauty). While searching for Lawson and fighting the Skrull on Earth, Captain Marvel meets Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson; Pulp Fiction) a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. At first, he doesn't believe anything she is telling him and he simply thinks she is crazy until he has a firsthand encounter with one of the shapeshifters.  Together he and Captain Marvel find Pegasus, a top secret project Lawson was working on which leads them to Carol Danvers' best friend Maria Rambeau (Lashan Lynch; Brotherhood).  After listening to a tape of the black box from her plane crash, Captain Marvel remembers who she and Lawson are and that the Skrull are not the enemy.  She must then find the top-secret project Lawson was working on before it falls into the wrong hands. Larson is a great casting choice to play Danvers/Captain Marvel.  She has an air of power with a soft femininity underneath and a sarcastic wit that helps lighten the mood of the serious, action film.  Seeing Fury digital de-aged was incredible and I'm curious as to what Jackson thought when he first saw it.  Law is well cast as Marvel's Commander because he lulls the audience into a false sense of comfort when in reality his motives are questionable.  Bening plays dual roles here and does so wonderfully.  She is kind and generous as Carol's friend and mentor and deliciously evil as Supreme Intelligence of the Kree. The story is interesting and plays out well on screen.  For me, the 1990's references were a stroll down memory lane and I loved it.  The recreations were excellent and most of the eclectic soundtrack was enjoyable other than an ill-placed No Doubt's I'm Just A Girl.  I'm not sure what directors Anna Boden (Sugar) and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson) were thinking on that one but it definitely didn't work. The film also had a few cheesy moments and the last fifteen minutes of the film left something to be desired for me.  From the glowing Captain Marvel to the cringe-worthy dialogue it loses the momentum it built up throughout the film. However, despite being two hours long, the movie doesn't seem long at all. Captain Marvel had a more interesting story than the trailers led us to believe and it is blended with terrific action sequences and great special effects to make for a very entertaining movie.  After watching this film, I can't wait to see what Captain Marvel brings to this spring's Avengers: Endgame.

"Jun 28, 2019",positive," In 2019, we measure success in Marvel movies. Roughly three times a year—in spring, summer, and sometimes fall—a Marvel film debuts, and becomes the benchmark against which all other blockbusters are weighed. If the film is well-received, we immediately hear buzz about a sequel. If it isn't, well, that's what The Avengers films are for. But after ten years of adapting comic book icons, what was adapted became just as important a question as how. And because of this, Captain Marvel, like Black Panther before it, has become a film burdened with expectation: all this time and all these billions of dollars, and now we get a Marvel film about a woman. And since Marvel is the benchmark of blockbuster success, then a Marvel film about a woman then becomes a yardstick for arguing how viable all blockbusters built around women are. This burden wasn't fair in 2018, and it isn't fair now. In a lot of ways, Captain Marvel is better at the perfunctory origin story than just about every one of Marvel's first wave of films. Instead of merely conveying a conventional hero's journey wrapped in a colorful new setting, Captain Marvel tells the story of how Carol Danvers became the most powerful being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by way of a sci-fi mystery. At the start of the film, Danvers is an amnesiac known as Vers, a member of the Kree Starforce, a team of highly trained, humanoid warriors dispatched to quell threats to the Kree empire—a posh (they're literally blue-bloods), high-tech society with very specific ideas about how the galaxy should be run. In a mission to take on the shapeshifting, green-skinned Skrulls, Vers crash-lands on 1995 Earth at the same time as the Skrulls, and must hunt down the shapeshifters that have infiltrated our world while also figuring out why she can't shake the feeling that she had a life here. At the end of the day, Captain Marvel is a Marvel movie, with all that entails. This means the action is serviceable, with flashes of truly cool, video game-esque inventiveness. There's going to be gestures at complicated ideas that aren't fully explored because we only have so much time to get from there to here. And there's going to be a fun cast—Samuel L. Jackson is having a ball as a young Nick Fury, who spends most of the film on the road with Danvers as an incredulous young S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who still has both eyes intact. The pair are delightful together, as is Jackson with Captain Marvel's breakout feline, Goose, and well, everyone else. Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch deliver warm, understated performances that make you wish for a more low-key film where we spend more time with them. And Ben Mendelsohn is surprisingly wry and funny as the Skrull warrior Talos. As an action movie, Captain Marvel is really clever, with more than a few twists that'll surprise both comics fans and newcomers—twists that also make an effort to tell a subtler story than Marvel movies generally attempt. There are some bumps in that story's telling: the '90s setting is mostly deployed for shallow, cloying humor (the music choices are both on the nose and the opposite of deep cuts) and the sweeping nature of the story—from the Kree homeworld of Hala to the deserts of the Southwest and the suburbs of Louisiana—is too busy constantly moving to really allow for much in the way of character work. The biggest problem then, is that Captain Marvel is doing so much, we don't actually get to know Captain Marvel all that well. We get glimpses of her: Carol Danvers loves karaoke, is fiercely competitive, and knocks back a beer to unwind. But we really don't get to see this person, we're just told about her, and, due to her amnesia, Carol is too. The audience, and Carol herself, spends much of Captain Marvel learning who Carol Danvers is, and as such, we only get to spend precious few moments with her. And that's the most heartbreaking thing about Captain Marvel: we've waited so long to meet this hero, yet by the end of the film bearing her name, we know her about as well as we did at the start."
"Jun 23, 2019",positive," Vers (Brie Larson) is a Kree warrior sent to defend her civilization from the shape-shifting aliens known as Skrulls. Captured in combat, she escapes – only to find herself on mid-1990s Earth, a planet she is shocked to discover she has visited before. Teaming up with SHIELD agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) she fights to stop a Skrull invasion attempt, while working to rediscover her true identity. Marvel Studio’s widely loved and phenomenally successful superhero franchise clocks up its 21st feature with Captain Marvel, heralded as both the first Marvel film with a female protagonist and the first to have a female director (Anna Boden shares those duties with her regular collaborator Ryan Fleck). Dwelling on either point is understandable, since both are well overdue. Dwelling on them may also be a potential mistake, since focusing on either risks overlooking simply what an effective and entertaining blockbuster Captain Marvel has turned out to be. The film opens to a relatively messy first act, dropping the viewer into the Kree Empire and a secret military mission undertaken by Vers, her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), and a team of elite Kree warriors. From there it’s a short dash to a first encounter with the reptilian Skrulls, a crash landing on Earth, and a meeting with a younger and less cynical Nick Fury. While it takes a while for the film to settle down to a comfortable set-up, it does avoid the usual pitfalls of a superhero origin: the pace is faster, and the usual tropes of the genre are either absent or remixed into a less traditional form. It is a great showcase for its cast as well. I am a big fan of Brie Larson’s work, and she does not disappoint as Vers. She also has a natural sort of chemistry – or, at least, it feels natural – with Samuel L. Jackson’s more playful version of Nick Fury. The film regularly acts as a gift for the more continuity-obsessed fans, not only showing off young Fury but also franchise stalwart Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Guardians of the Galaxy alumni Lee Pace (Ronan the Accuser) and Djimon Hounsou (Korath). It is undertaken with a pleasing subtlety: it adds an additional layer of entertainment for the hardcore, while not getting in the way of the actual story for casual viewers. If there is a most-valuable-player to the cast, however, it is Ben Mendelsohn’s spectacular turn as Talos, the Skrull leader and primary antagonist. Mendelsohn plays the role with a deft handle on comedy. His timing is sensational. His use of his own Australian accent when in his lizard form is wonderfully odd. He is also a valuable addition to any film, but here Mendelsohn creates one of the most entertaining characters Marvel Studios have ever had. The film boasts strong, cine-literate action, paired with a solid sense of production design. Once the narrative settles down on Earth for its second and third acts, it presents a good balance of action, drama, and comedy. The film’s pairing of action scenes with mid-90s rock and pop music is a little on the nose, but amusingly self-aware. The ultimate achievement of Captain Marvel is that it can be two films at the same time. It honestly works as a straight-forward science fiction action film, in which a hero discovers their true identity and learns the full extent of their alien super-powers. It also works spectacularly as a feminist text, in which a woman steps out from a patriarchal shadow and challenges a sexist male mentor in the process. It frames the story as a recognisable male-dominated world, and then breaks that world in two. It is this extra dimension that really makes the film rise above the standard Marvel Cinematic Universe fare. I, too, loved Ben Mendelssohn in this film. The “odd” detail of his Australian accent when in Skrull form delighted me and allowed me, as another Australian, to find extra sympathy for his character. Yes, it was an odd choice, but for me, sheer genius. It could have overshadowed the rest of the film, but the film is good enough, entertaining enough and sheer fun enough to work on all levels. I’m in the throes of a third watch, and there’ll be many more. (Wouldn’t Wolverine have worked with an Australian accent? I think it could have. Fake American accents are a pet peeve of mine.) I’m looking forward to future Captain Marvel films, and just hope that Ben Mendelssohn is in them! “It also works spectacularly as a feminist text, in which a woman steps out from a patriarchal shadow and challenges a sexist male mentor in the process. It frames the story as a recognisable male-dominated world, and then breaks that world in two. It is this extra dimension that really makes the film rise above the standard Marvel Cinematic Universe fare.” 1970 just called. They would like their “men suck” trope back. What an idiotic statement. Recognizable? To whom? People like yourself who are trying to find your inner feminine wokeness? Perhaps, but to the grown ups in the room this was just a good action hero movie."
"Jun 18, 2019",positive," For the first 10 minutes, Captain Marvel choo-choo-chooses to chug-a-lug down the same Green Lantern train tracks that ran over Ryan Reynolds. A vomitorium of needless exposition that may as well have had Annette Benning holding a Wile E. Coyote picket sign reading “We don’t trust you idiots in the audience,” the opening is thankfully little more than a bellyflop by a pretty nimble swimmer. What follows is goofy, blissfully weird and wholly original, when it’s allowed to be. It’s either a remarkable coincidence or nakedly obvious why the first major Marvel movie with a female lead is also their first film to feel frequently palpably constrained by studio suits; every time Captain Marvel is poised to spill over into the wacky giddiness to which it so clearly wants to succumb, Brie Larson has to put her hands on her hips and stare off into the distance whilst pondering how war is bad for a minute. Larson actually has a bigger challenge; the wildly uneven script does that old-familiar melodrama “amnesia two-step.” Vers (Larson), whose real name is Carol Danvers, is an alien warrior who can barf laser rainbows from her fists and can’t remember beyond six years ago. After a battle against the Skrulls, shape-shifting baddies, Vers gets stranded on Earth in 1995. There, she discovers secrets about her past while basically starring in a splendid “Oh no! My partner is a space alien!” buddy-cop sitcom with Nick Fury (a digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson). The problem with “who am I?” plots is that they strip actors of their ability to fully define a character. By the end, when Carol is more completely herself and gleefully whooping while testing the limits of her powers, you only wish you had more time with that version of her. Especially when she gets confronted by the extraterrestrial equivalent of a dudebro blogger on twitter yelling “Debate me!” at an elected female politician. Although not quite ideally how to get there, Captain Marvel does render you desperate for more of her. Those quibbles aside, complaints about this film falling into a stupefied sameness with other superhero movies are totally unfounded. From a plot-centric cat to Ben Mendelsohn’s legitimately surprising turn, whenever writers/directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck get the space to make their space opera both sincere and offbeat, it is triumphant. As opposed to something like Aquaman, where the silliness is jarring and too frequently unintentional, Captain Marvel endears itself with its quirky nonsense. This was the first major blockbuster from the duo; they should be brought back and they should be given more latitude to lean into the intimate and weirdo moments at which they so clearly excel. Complaints about this being boilerplate superhero shenanigans ignore unique traits like the single weirdest needle-drop during a fight sequence in recent memory. Love or hate that moment, it is as bold as the hero who emerges by the end. There is a fresh, creative heartbeat pumping at the center of Captain Marvel that wills it into being something special, even if it could have been somewhat more so."
"Jun 17, 2019",positive," The paradox of Captain Marvel is that it’s a diverting lark with seismic sociopolitical ramifications for Hollywood’s most lucrative, widely viewed film franchise. A movie set in 1995 and enamored by Blockbuster Video, Salt-N-Peppa needle-drops, snail’s-pace-dial-up-internet jokes and paying homage to Michael Kamen’s synth-punchy Die Hard score is an unlikely vessel for messages of female empowerment, but this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so you make do, and make concessions.  This is the MCU’s first film centered on a female character in its 11 years of existence, which makes you think, more than once, “It’s about time.” But to the chagrin of its potential, the film settles for just being a fun installment in a bigger scheme.  On one hand, there is something inherently rewarding and desperately needed in watching Carol Danvers soar across the sky like a technicolor firecracker, blasting space baddies left and right and proving that she’s, well, much, much, much more adept to taking on Thanos in next month’s Avengers finale than most of her male counterparts. The natural ascension of on-screen representation is going to inspire any number of young girls in the audience in a way that no Marvel film quite has before. The film gains much of its merit from just being what it is and being willing to represent what it represents. That matters.  On the other hand, Captain Marvel struggles with building Danvers as a character as it simultaneously tries to build her as a symbol. Part of what made 2017’s Wonder Woman so lasting was that the hagiography melded with the nuance and relatability. The image of Diana storming across the battlefield was coupled with natural character progressions and Gal Gadot’s fierce regality and fish-out-of-water curiosity. Star Brie Larson has only so much to work with, though, as the Danvers character is written a bit tepidly and tied to plot. Her development as a memory-wiped space warrior returned to her home planet feels too rigid to sink in from a personal standpoint. Larson has had to do this in the past with roles, though, and she clearly knows how to elevate Danvers to be more than the page allows. Captain Marvel makes for riveting representational cinema, but it lacks the groundswell of genre flourish and gritty character detail that marks the films of her Avengers counterparts. The film should’ve been able to have both.  Its status as a ’90s buddy-cop homage doesn’t exactly do a ton we haven’t already seen before; Shane Black did this to better effect in Iron Man 3, and part of the nostalgia here just comes from shameless reminders that this film, very much, takes place around 1995. It's practically a shaken can of Surge to the face while R.E.M. blares in your ears by the umpteenth reference.  But it’s when Captain Marvel, finally in its third act, harnesses the goodwill of its lead actress and learns to balance its importance with its genre leanings and yearn for flannel and Friends. It learns to fly with much more zeal, and the obvious '90s music cues just begin to feel more apt. It’s a downright shame the film can’t find this tone more consistently throughout.  The good the film will accomplish will far outweighs the standards it doesn’t quite meet. Film is a multifaceted object, able to mean many things for many people. Captain Marvel can stand alone as a step forward for a film series that was long past due making one, just as it can fall short of its potential. That’s the beauty of going to the movies, isn’t it? Imperfection never holds a movie back from, just at that right moment, feeling perfect. You get out of it just what you need. "
"Jun 13, 2019",positive," The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe finds itself in a challenging and unenviable position. More than twenty films in, the franchchise is starting to spread its wings a bit. Not only does Captain Marvel stand-out as this series’ first vehicle for a female superhero and the first installment helmed by a female director, but it also serves as the feeder for what is bound to be the biggest movie we’ve seen to date: Avengers: Endgame. There’s a lot going on here and a lot hinging on Captain Marvel. Does the superhero origin story live up to the hype? Captain Marvel follows the title character (Brie Larson) as she enters the Marvel Cinematic Universe, discovering not only who she is, but also the full extent of her powers. Along the way, she meets up with a baby Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), S.H.I.E.L.D, and finds herself caught up in a vicious intergalactic war between the Kree and the Skrulls. Keeping this spoiler free, so that’s all you’re getting. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck direct the film from a script they co-wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet.  To start, Captain Marvel is a little slow to find its feet. The first act is weighed down by the extent of everything which needs to happen. While the film is loosely tied into the Guardians of the Galaxy universe, these are new characters, new worlds, and new scenes to establish. However, the script makes an interesting decision to start in the middle of the action. Instead of seeing Carol Danvers become Captain Marvel, audiences watch through her eyes as she learns who she is. As a result, the first act feels a bit muddled. There’s a lot of play in the realm of the psychological and this distinct stylistic choice will likely work for some, but definitely not for others.  In the quippy and snarky MCU, Captain Marvel stands as a bit of an outlier. The Oscar winning Larson brings an interesting persona to the character, playing Danvers very straight and almost emotionless for much of the narrative. Considering Carol’s tenuous and convoluted mental state early in the film, this particular stylistic choice could make sense. She quite literally doesn’t know who she is and she’s almost a blank slate in her own mind. However, this does stand out in the scope of the MCU and might not play well with some audiences. Will this make sense as audiences learn and ultimately get a feel for Carol? Of course. At this point in her origin story, its difficult to find an in-road into this complex and complicated character.  Now, this doesn’t mean that this character isn’t incredibly important in the scope of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Larson’s hands, Carol Danvers quickly becomes the biggest and most formidable bad*ss in the franchise. Whether she is saving the universe or simply standing up when she’s told “It’s called a ‘cock’pit for a reason”, women need to see characters like this. For the first time in a long time, young girls are finally seeing powerful main characters who look like them. We aren’t prettier when we smile. We don’t owe anyone anything. Even a moment as simple as Carol repeatedly get to her feet after she’s hit/kicked/falls down is incredibly emotional. With each movie where female characters are shown in a leading, empowered and non-sexualized manner, we take a step in the right direction. Ultimately, while there felt to be some lack of development in Captain Marvel, the possibility with the character feels incredibly bright as she gains traction in the MCU. The performances around Larson are bright and quippy, allowing the movie to soon feel right at home within Marvel. Samuel L. Jackson is probably one of the brightest spots. For the first time in a while, he’s given free rein to be the comedic relief and he excels. Audiences see a new side to Nick Fury. His scenes with a cat named “Goose” are a particular joy. Interestingly, the graphics’ work surrounding Nick Fury show the almost scary advances around “de-aging” actors. Rogue One showed the technology in its infancy, and a mere few years later, things have improved tremendously. Looking at Nick Fury in the film, it’s difficult to tell where Samuel L. Jackson ends and the effects begin. It’s not an exaggeration to say the actor looks and feels exactly how he did in Jurassic Park. Where does this technology advance from here? Do actors no longer need to worry about aging?  Also, fans of Ben Mendelsohn rejoice! In his role as Talos, the Australian actor finally gets a fun role he can wrap his teeth around. While he’s usually cast as a heavy or in thankless (yet challenging) parts, Mendelsohn is an absolute joy to watch in Captain Marvel. He has no trouble diving into what proves to be an incredibly layered and complex character and he shines in a rare opportunity to tackle some comedy. Please, Hollywood, let Ben Mendelsohn keep doing this! Much has been made about Captain Marvel’s mid-1990s setting, and the film has a great deal of fun with its locale. Children of the 1990s will enjoy and appreciate so many references from a Blockbuster video to a number of comedic moments involving dial-up internet (kids, ask your parents!). Do some of the attempts at humor (or social commentary) feel a bit forced? A bit. For example, the choice to stage a full fight scene to No Doubt singing “I’m Just a Girl” might illicit some groans. These moments are few though, with plenty of chuckles set up throughout. Once the movie finds its feet, it’s good fun.  Is Captain Marvel for the comic purist? That’s a difficult call to make. As the final credits roll, the MCU is rapidly approaching “Phase 4” and things are feeling incredibly complicated. Where was the Tesseract in 1994? When did Loki get it again? How did it get to Asgard? Captain Marvel suddenly makes a complete, chronological rewatch feel much needed. Timelines are starting to feel a trifle… full. In setting this film in 1994, the movie comes in a weird (and unexplored) spot in the timeline and viewers watching with an eye for the comic specific plot points might walk away with a bit of a headache. That being said, stay till the end of the credits… there are two cut-scenes.  Alright, is Captain Marvel a perfect movie? No. The next installment of the superhero franchise has its fair share of struggles; however, which of the origin stories haven’t? The superhero scene is a crowded one and some are less memorable than others. Despite the problems, the fact that audiences are now watching female superheroes kick butt on screen is what makes this story special. There’s so much to develop, and here’s hoping that Marvel continues to craft stories outside of Iron Man’s boys club.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History.

"Jun 10, 2019",positive,"Our comic book heroine has to remember her past, and you won't easily forget this fun, milestone movie."
"Jun 9, 2019",positive," The most useful lesson I learned when my undergrad in creative writing is ""show don’t tell."" In the opening of Captain Marvel, our eponymous superhero falls from space into a Blockbuster Video. This shows the audience that Captain Marvel is set in the mid-90s and they don’t need to literally spell out on the screen,, “Earth — 1995.” You immediately know the time period as soon as you see the Blockbuster (as well as her picking up VHS types, one specifically a homage to her character.) Showing not telling is the best way to tell a story because you get to paint a pretty picture for the viewers. What’s more engaging, her falling into a Blockbuster Video, looking at VHS tapes, or the movie opening with a title card of the date?  Show don’t tell method of storytelling is just one reason (of many) why directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (the duo who made the excellent Half Nelson) are two of my favorite filmmakers. I must admit, when I first watched Captain Marvel, I wasn’t a fan. Maybe it’s because I saw it at 11 pm on a Thursday, perhaps it's because I hold Anna and Ryan, as well as Marvel movies in high regard, or maybe I didn’t like it (shame on me for having an opinion). That changed when I watched Captain Marvel in the comfort of my own home. Movies are meant first to be seen in theaters, so saying I liked it better at home is a sentence I never thought I would write, but here I am. I have similar criticisms as I did the first time I saw it (they beat you over the head that it’s set in the 90s with the soundtrack and constant talk of grunge -- this it telling, not showing), but this plot device is a lot easier to digest when I’m comfortably lounging in my favorite green sweatpants and white shirt while watching the movie. Nobody around me is on their cell phone, and I can enjoy it without distraction. Captain Marvel is solid, and there couldn't have been a better choice for Captain Marvel than Brie Larson -- she lights up the screen.  Let’s discuss this 4K release. Like Infinity War and Ragnarok (my favorite film in the Infinity Stone Saga), Captain Marvel’s slipcover is embossed. You probably think, ""Who cares?"" Well, I care, and so do many slipcover collectors. I’m a slipcover collector, so the embossing is a bonus. The 4K transfer is superb, as well as the colors when Captain Marvel lights up on screen. I didn't care much for 4K UHD home releases until I got a 4K TV and player, and saw it with my own eyes. When the transfer is right, no matter what movie it is, you can't take your eyes off the screen. Captain Marvel is one of these films. This 4K is slack-jawing.  Marvel picks a lot of indie directors to make their films because they trust these filmmakers can tell a good story. Before Russo Brothers directed Winter Soldier, Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame, their only credits were Community, episodes of other TV shows, and  You, Me and Dupree; before Thor Ragnarok, director Taika Waititi was known for his gut-busting indie films Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows, Boy, and Eagle vs. Shark. His pleasantly odd sense of humor is peppered liberally throughout Ragnarok, and gave Thor room to be a hilarious and charismatic and not so damn serious and Shakesperean. This is a long tangent, but my point again is, Marvel knows a good storyteller when they see one, and they saw that in Anna and Ryan. The company already has a team that can produce arresting special effects, but as we've learned from superhero movies like Justice League, you need a good director behind the camera (to Snyder's credit, who was forced to leave the film because a family tragedy, Joss Whedon is to blame for the failure of Justice League).  Also with the 4K are some digital exclusives:Journey into Visual Effects with Victoria AlonsoWhat Makes a Memory: Inside the “Mind Frack”Concept ArtOn-Set ImagesPre-order Captain Marvel HERE."
"Jun 4, 2019",positive," The first Marvel Studios production of the year takes things back in time with Captain Marvel, a 1995 origin story for one of the big screen world's most powerful and important heroes. While the story is loaded with new and expansive elements for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, some of its best moments spawn from familiar vibes while the movie (like its titular hero) looks to discover its true identity. Starting the film with tremendous powers and abilities, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers is not on a quest to obtain superhero status. She is already stronger than most Avengers characters fans have come to know. Instead, she is seeking information regarding her past, a puzzle which remains blurry for the superheroine and the audience until later in the film. In fact, Captain Marvel's narrative is built on mysteries straight from launch -- possibly too many mysteries. An abundant amount of questions are posed to the audience within the first few minutes of the film, leaving little room for character development early on. This is why the second half of the film becomes more of a fun thrill ride than its preceding hour. Questions get answered and character personalities are more able to shine through. Larson's presence on screen comes with an earnest sense of determination with little other depth to Carol's personality shining through. It may be an intentional decision as the character's goals and growth are ever-present, but attempts at one-liners indicate a desire to have made her a bit more fun. An early scene including Larson, Djimon Hounsou, Gemma Chan, and Jude Law quickly shows that the comedic chops and timing are going to shine elsewhere as Hounsou steals the first early laugh of the film. Whereas actors such as Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Gal Gadot have an ability to command the screen and offer witty banter on a dime, Larson's attempts seem to be missing that timing spark for true magic. However, toss her into an earthbound scene with Lashana Lynch later in the movie and the rhythm gets rolling as emotion and answers being to pour out. As Captain Marvel sees the titular heroine asking so many questions about the world and herself, it will be interesting to see if more of Carol's personality starts to come through from Larson's character as she becomes more comfortable in her own skin. Avengers: Endgame will be a true test of this, given it takes place more than 20 years after Carol Danvers became a hero and has a Russo Brothers directing team who may make different choices than Captain Marvel's Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Much of the highlights of the film are offered when Captain Marvel heads to earth via crashing into a Blockbuster surrounded by '90s-era references, including a flawlessly de-aged Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. If there is any chemistry in the film worth noting, it's the impressive relationship established by Larson and Jackson as their characters become unlikely friends during a possible space invasion on their shared home planet. No Marvel space invasion would be this compelling without the Skrulls, a batch of shapeshifting menaces who make for tremendously exciting villains. The notion of not being certain whether the old lady beside you on the subway or best friend hanging out in your living room is truly the person they seem makes for all sorts of brilliant, unexpected moments. Captain Marvel capitalizes on several opportunities to use Skrulls in surprising ways, ushering in a group of baddies which could be the Infinity Stone-equivalent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's next phases. Possible wishful thinking, but it could all be leading toward a popular ""Secret Invasion"" story from Marvel Comics. If Ben Mendelsohn's Talos is any part of future Marvel Cinematic Universe movies featuring Skrulls, Marvel Studios is all but guaranteed its next hit. Marvel Comics fans will find extra enjoyment in the film as it fully embraces the cosmic source material in ways which Marvel Studios had to earn over years. Shapeshifting aliens, characters like Yon-Rogg or Minn-Erva, and a Flerken (if you don't know, you will soon) had to be ushered into Marvel's movie world after it eased into the zanier cosmic elements ahead of time in films like Thor, then Guardians of the Galaxy, and then Avengers: Infinity War. The cosmic content of Captain Marvel is among some of the film's best elements, and fans with knowledge of each character's source material history and potential future will have a blast depicting where they might be going. When it gets rolling, Captain Marvel is exactly what it wants to be: an inspirational story told with an abundant level of heart. It's a big, welcome step forward (by stepping backward in time) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which feels like both a history lesson for the long-running fan and a fresh take which a casual moviegoer can walk in to enjoy. The heartfelt, surprising plot twists and a lead character so determined to succeed help this movie do just that. Captain Marvel shines brightest when it uses elements which have worked for Marvel Studios in the past. The film is entirely unique in terms of narrative, timing, and locations. However, Goose (Carol's scene-stealing cat) can be compared to Groot of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, airborne fights bear resemblances to Iron Man in the first Avengers movie, and some characters are outright pulled from previous appearances to reprise roles in welcome fashion (such as Lee Pace's Ronan and Hounsou's Korath). Throw the Captain Marvel paint job on some of these aspects and they feel brand new, if not more fun this time around. In welcoming a female hero to the big screen as the centerpiece of her own film, Marvel Studios has an expansive and fun hit on its hands. Captain Marvel offers up a complex, heartfelt tale which will leave audiences (especially the young girls watching) feeling inspired and satisfied. This is a brand-new type of hero for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and, while it doesn't reinvent Marvel's ever-successful formula, Captain Marvel is an exciting and fresh adventure."
"May 31, 2019",positive," Breezy and light on gravitas, “Captain Marvel” doesn’t shake up the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it does find a few new ways to perk up the umpteenth superhero origin story. It falls short of the intensity that propelled “Black Panther” and “Wonder Woman,” but most do. Set in 1995, the movie introduces us to Vers (Brie Larson), a member of an elite special forces unit of the advanced alien species called the Kree, and mentored by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). A run-in with their sinister, shape-changing enemies the Skrulls brings some of her fractured memories to the surface – those of a human fighter pilot named Carol Danvers. Her pursuit of the Skrulls and her real identity leads her to Earth and results in an unlikely but surprisingly effective team-up with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), an agent of SHIELD at this point in the MCU timeline. Fan-favorite Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) also puts in a few appearances. (He’s a fresh-faced rookie here, and the de-ageing CGI used on him and Fury/Jackson does a far better job of avoiding the uncanny valley than the rubbery renditions of Michael Douglas and Kurt Russell in “Ant-Man” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” respectively). The original Captain Marvel (a Kree man named Mar-Vell) debuted in the late 1960s, and Danvers went from minor supporting character to superheroine (as Ms. Marvel) in the late ’70s; the continuity for – and iterations of – both characters have grown increasingly tangled in the decades since. The MCU boils the basics down in a daring way and throws in some unexpected twists that will intrigue some fans and likely piss off others. Par for the course. Not surprisingly, “Captain Marvel” quickly became the target of trolls and broflakes, and apparently saw them coming. There’s a lot of mansplaining aimed at Danvers, from Yon-Roog, who’s often telling her to control her emotions; from Air Force officers who tell her she’ll never fly; and a father who tells her she shouldn’t even try to compete with the boys. Suffice to say, Larson brings the necessary tenacity and defiance. The movie gets a lot of mileage out of its period setting with the exception of the soundtrack, which plays it safe with some obvious go-to tracks from Hole, No Doubt, and Garbage (on the plus side: no Creed). Larson and Jackson click well as a duo, and the buddy/road-movie vibe and “Memento”-esque hook is strong enough for it to feel fresh and distinct. However, those aspects work against it as well. This movie is a prologue meant to quickstart Danvers a scant few weeks before her proper arrival in the MCU via “Avengers: Endgame”. There’s some withholding going on, and that combined with our protagonist’s sketchy recall means we don’t get a full picture of the hero as a whole until the third act. Fortunately, we’re given enough to make us keen for more."
"May 29, 2019",positive," Let's just say Captain Marvel, which will be available to watch at home at the end of May, was worth the wait. It's two hours of pure female empowerment packaged with all the visual power you'd expect from a 
  Marvel
 blockbuster. Brie Larson is fierce and effortlessly cool as a fighter-pilot-turned-space-warrior trying to discover who she really is. And it doesn't hurt that Hole, Elastica and Nirvana set the beat with some of the biggest hits of the '90s. Larson is Carol Danvers, a member of the alien Kree race's elite military unit Starforce. Her mentor Yon-Rogg, played by a yellow-eyed Jude Law, tries to teach her that the most dangerous things a warrior can encounter are emotions. Danvers doesn't always listen. She's struggling to control her powers, but also trying to figure out why she can't remember her past.  Carol and Fury become a sort of odd couple with little in common besides mutual respect. They share some of the funnier, sharper banter in the movie and he reminds her that emotions don't just make humans human, they're often advantageous.  But there's no love interest in Captain Marvel. Not even a hint of it. And I'm more than fine with that. As much as I enjoyed Chris Pine's Steve Trevor in Wonder Woman, this is an origin story minus the flirtation and seduction and it's all the stronger for it. Danvers comes to terms with her powers, learns to control them, and confronts a society that tells her women can't race cars, join the army or become fighter pilots. That struggle is more than enough to keep her (and us) engaged.  Don't get me wrong. Captain Marvel is far from alone. As well as Fury, she also reunites with her longtime friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and Maria's daughter Monica. ""You were the most powerful woman I knew right before you could shoot fire from your fists,"" Maria tells Carol during a touching conversation when our protagonist needs a bit of a confidence boost. Rounding out the excellent cast, Annette Bening plays the person Carol admires most, even when at times she doesn't recall why. It's very telling that Bening's character isn't about fighting wars, but about ending them. That philosophy will influence Carol's values and give her reasons for becoming a full-fledged warrior and protector. The diverse array of female characters puts Captain Marvel alongside the undeniably feminist Black Panther -- both pass the Bechdel test with high grades. Captain Marvel is yet another title that proves you can have a big superhero film that doesn't forget to represent half of the world's population in a non-reductionist way. They avoid flashbacks that would slow the pace and clumsy exposition is almost nonexistent. We learn about Carol at the same gradual pace that she does -- through interesting, well-executed narrative devices like Skrull leader Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) invading Carol's memories.  You learn about Danvers' humanity through her failings. Falling but standing up ready to attempt again becomes one of our hero's driving forces -- and a quality that reminds viewers that sometimes the most important thing in life isn't necessarily success, but continuing to try. Then there are all those '90s references. Panama Jack's boots and coveralls. Turtlenecks. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Alta Vista. Blockbuster video-rental stores and telephone booths. Pagers. Early (and slow) Macs. The album poster from Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.  It also helps that Captain Marvel's soundtrack is underscored by Nirvana's Come As You Are, Elastica's Connection and No Doubt's Just A Girl. Obvious choices maybe, but it's hard not to tap your feet to the pounding rhythm of Hole's Celebrity Skin even if you've never been a grunge devotee.  There are perfectly choreographed minimalistic fight sequences between two barefoot characters and there are full-blown explosion-driven space battles. Carol flies in space, clad in her blue, red and golden suit, leaving a luminous trail across the sky wherever she goes. ""You know you're glowing, right?"" Fury asks Carol at one point. The movie also pays homage to the late Stan Lee, who was still around to film his cameo for this movie and Avengers: Endgame. The legendary comics creator, who died in November at 95, is remembered in the Marvel Studios opening theme sequence and a ""Thank You Stan"" message opens the movie. Not everything in Captain Marvel is what it appears. There are a couple of twists you won't necessarily see coming. And yes, the feline Goose steals every single scene.  At one point during Captain Marvel, Carol is wearing a Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, leather jacket and distressed jeans. Only Happy When It Rains by Garbage plays in the background. Fury summarizes the whole thing perfectly: ""Grunge is a good look for you,"" he says.  Feeling like watching it again at home? Captain Marvel will be available digitally May 28 and on Blu-ray June 11. You can already preorder the streaming version on Amazon. The HD version costs $19.99 and has bonus content."
"May 26, 2019",positive," First, stop watching trailers immediately. If you’re already interested in “Captain Marvel,” then just go see it; watching any more trailers may spoil certain surprises and plot points for you. Second, go in recognizing that “Captain Marvel” has a lot to do in 128 minutes: introduce a brand-new and obscure titular character (Brie Larson) who has a very deep and complicated back story; introduce a new race of shape-shifting alien Skrulls while expanding on the Kree, an alien race audiences are somewhat familiar with; and reunite us with well-known franchise characters like Nick Fury and Agent Coulson (digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg, respectively) while introducing new supporting characters. Toss into that meaty recipe a heaping helping of subtext on feminism and American colonialism and you’ve got yourself a stew! Be sure to sprinkle it liberally with fan service, easter eggs, `90s references, and some jokes to go along with all the whiz-bang that comic-book audiences have come to expect. Oh; and make sure it ties into the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) while setting up the next installment, “Avengers: Endgame.” Finally, it has to appeal to a massive audience comprised of people from virtually any age, race, color and sex, with many of them being highly critical fans of the source material. Easy peasy! With that extensive list, it’s impressive that “Captain Marvel” is as good as it is; not that it’s perfect, nor the second coming of “Wonder Woman.” Then again, “Wonder Woman” had less to do, considering most people were pretty familiar with her. The wide age spread of its audience may account for much of the dialog being repetitive or over-explanatory, resulting in a possibly lethal drinking game if you took a shot every time someone said Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers was too “emotional.” I know the filmmakers didn’t want the 8-year olds in the audience to miss any of the feminist messages, but the rest of us got it the first 7 times. With Marvel’s penchant for using jokes to undercut any real drama, some of the humor or light-heartedness was unwelcome; meanwhile, there were genuinely touching moments supplied by a tribute to recently deceased Stan Lee, and more so by Danvers’ earth-bound buddy, Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) who shows Larson how to do it, frankly… because the odd ingredient in the mix is Larson herself. She revealed in junket interviews that she was unsure about taking on the role of Captain Marvel, saying it was not only very different from anything she’s ever done before but even a different kind of movie as well. The closest she ever got to this level of blockbuster scrutiny was 2017s “Kong: Skull Island” (again, opposite Jackson), but her character wasn’t on the marquee. There’s a lot more riding on her shoulders this time, and it shows. She doesn’t have much chemistry with anyone onscreen, and many of her lines fall flat since she’s unable to deliver the obvious applause-lines like a more seasoned Jackson can. Some have suggested it’s part of her character to be awkward and feel out of place, and that’s possible but unwise. Remember, we were subjected to acting powerhouse Natalie Portman sleepwalking as Queen Amidala in “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” because we found out it really wasn’t Padmé saying those lines, it was a servant pretending to be her! So naturally, she couldn’t be convincing as the Queen. OK, fine; but we were still stuck with Portman’s stiff-as-a-board performance for most of the movie. Or maybe Larson’s wooden performance was part of the feminist subtext: women are chided for not smiling enough, but then are told get a grip when showing emotion. Again; fine, could be. But then we’re still stuck with an Oscar-winning actress seeming uneasy in her own movie. Larson’s performance may be the biggest issue I have with “Captain Marvel” but it’s not the only one. The script is clunky and spends time on chase scenes when we could be exploring Danvers’ past. Big name actors with big-league roles (like Annette Bening or Lee Pace) get short shrifted. Its first act is somewhat choppy and its second tends to lag, but “Captain Marvel” gets on track just in time to end well, and sometimes a movie is its ending. The subtexts may be its strongest suit. Sure it has all the entertainment value and cool soundtrack cues you’ve come to expect from a Marvel movie, but to personify in Jude Law’s character Yon-Rogg how men have subjugated women by physically holding them back because they feel threatened by their power? And how men further gaslight women into thinking that whatever power they have has been given to them, and can be taken away at any time if they step out of line? And to further demand that Danvers deal with him on his own terms and not by using her own individual abilities? Such gaslighting takes on sky-high, sci-fi heights when the Kree alter Danvers own memories so she recollects only the times she failed, and not the times she gotten back up after she had fallen. Add to that its messages on America’s current stance on immigration, with the Kree thinking they’re the good guys as they separate and scatter Skrull families around the galaxy in their quest to enforce their borders. Meanwhile, the immigrant Skrulls are painted as bad guys — infiltrating our earthly society and literally taking our places — but they’re just looking for a home, a haven away from Kree injustice. Those are bold and potent messages for a popcorn comic-book movie, and I applaud them and “Captain Marvel,” warts and all."
"May 24, 2019",positive," Hace poco un adolescente me dijo que Capitana Marvel ( Captain Marvel, 2019 ) era un insulto. No me explicó muy bien por qué pero una de las razones principales parecía ser la actuación de Brie Larson. Tampoco me dijo muy bien por qué no le agradaba ella. Su opinión es, al menos en apariencia, la misma de varios críticos. Las feministas sugieren que en este juicio se asoma la misoginia, sobre todo porque, desde antes de que apareciera la película, un amplio grupo de fanáticos —y probablemente misóginos— decidió boicotearla. Inevitablemente me sentí acorralado por la curiosidad, que no creo que haya matado al gato: en Capitana Marvel un gato —o algo parecido a uno— es demasiado poderoso como para morir por eso. Entonces fui a ver la cinta con estas dos ideas en mente y lo que descubrí no fue sorprendente en absoluto. En muchos sentidos afirma lo que pienso del cine industrial —para bien y para mal— y también sobre algunos fenómenos fácilmente observables en nuestras sociedades. Como ya lo sabe para este momento buena parte de los espectadores, Capitana Marvel  es la historia de cómo Carol Danvers (Larson), una piloto estadounidense, obtiene poderes y se convierte en una súper heroína. En muchos sentidos es una historia de origen completamente convencional. Hay intriga, un villano y, como es de esperarse de una cinta de Marvel, mucho sentido del humor. Hubo a quienes les molestó pero yo recuerdo que  Los Vengadores (The Avengers, 2012) o Iron Man (2008) se pueden describir de exactamente la misma manera. Es cierto que Los Vengadores  es una mejor película por su inteligente control de su vasto elenco pero no es genuinamente visionaria como la reciente Spider-Man: Un nuevo universo (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, 2018 ). La animación es asombrosa en la batalla final entre Spider-Man y Kingpin: los colores y los espacios se funden en una psicodelia hipnotizante en medio de la cual seguimos las complejas coreografías del combate. Eso por no hablar de las inteligentes parodias y las hábiles técnicas metaficcionales con las que es contada la historia. Capitana Marvel me parece una película regular en su pomposamente llamado “universo cinematográfico”, pero no por eso ignoro sus simpáticos guiños a la cultura popular de los 90 —la época en la que se sitúa—, lo cual es tan loable como criticable. Adentro de un Blockbuster —para los más jóvenes: un lugar donde se rentaban VHS— vemos un anuncio de Mentiras verdaderas (True Lies, 1994) , quizás el filme más desquiciado e interesante de James Cameron, y más adelante se nos muestra una persecución de naves espaciales que alude directamente a la del fabuloso bodrio nacionalista El día de la independencia (Independence Day, 1996) . Por una parte, son detalles que demuestran atención al periodo y una especie de homenaje a todo lo que formó a los que crecimos entonces —aunque algunos acabamos por rechazar todo eso—, pero por otra parte es un ejemplo más de lo que ya es una norma en el entretenimiento popular: la economía de la nostalgia. Entre refritos, secuelas y referencias al pasado, el cine contemporáneo de Hollywood nos habla de nuestras infancias y de los héroes que nos inspiraron con el fin de seguirles sacando jugo a propiedades intelectuales con más de 20 años de antigüedad. El recuerdo se hace comodidad y nosotros nos hacemos consumidores de nuestro pasado. Parafraseando a Roger Waters: ¿A quién le importa de qué se trate mientras sigan yendo los chavorrucos? La construcción ya muchas veces vista de Capitana Marvel refleja ese pensamiento en su trama predecible y su moralidad simple, aunque un poco menos que en otros casos, ya que cuestiona la narrativa de “los buenos”. Sin embargo hay que ver otro lado importante de la película, independientemente de sus cualidades estéticas: la representatividad. En respuesta al argumento en contra de Brie Larson, yo no veo el problema. Algunos se quejan porque la Capitana casi no sonríe. Y no, su rostro suele ser tan serio como el de los hombres en la película. En el papel de Nick Fury, Samuel L. Jackson se carcajea una vez —igual que la Capitana—, y Jude Law, como Yon-Rogg, sonríe acaso menos. Sin embargo es ella la que hace los chistes más graciosos y es por ello que se ganó mi simpatía —no puedo hablar por la de los demás—. Especulando, se me ocurre que quizá sorprenda a la misoginia mundial que una súper heroína protagónica no sea una adorable tonta que no sabe usar puertas revolventes, como la Mujer Maravilla de Gal Gadot. Quién sabe. Lo que sí me parece evidente es la distancia que hay entre esta película de aventura y acción y la celebrada Pantera Negra (Black Panther, 2018) . Aunque ambas son productos regulares que no renuevan el estilo de su cine como, por ejemplo, Capitán América y el Soldado de Invierno ( Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 2014 ), de los originales hermanos Russo, Pantera Negra se toma a sí misma tan en serio que uno se espanta: ¿es esta la metáfora de la lucha por los derechos civiles que deben saber los niños estadounidenses? De por sí Selma  (2014), de Ava DuVernay, ya hizo mucho por simplificar la historia del radical Martin Luther King Jr. y venderlo como una figura apta para toda la gran familia conservadora. Capitana Marvel , en contraste, no intenta decirnos mucho sino meramente divertirnos y, eso sí, recordarnos que una mujer es tan fuerte como cualquier hombre, y más divertida que muchos."
"May 23, 2019",negative," En uno de los tantos documentos que se filtraron en el famoso Sony hack de 2014, había un correo que enviaba el CEO de Marvel Entertainment, Ike Perlmutter, al CEO de Sony, Michael Lynton. En él, Perlmutter enlista una serie de películas de superheroínas que habían sido un fracaso comercial. Esto como continuación de una charla donde presumiblemente el CEO de Marvel buscaba convencer a su contraparte en SONY de lo mala idea que era siquiera pensar filmar una película de superhéroes con una mujer en el protagónico. Catwoman (2004), Elektra (2005) y Supergirl (1984) eran los ejemplos con los que Perlmutter armaba su argumento. Todas esa películas fueron “desastres”, decía en su correo, y no le faltaba razón pero, ¿fueron desastres por estar protagonizadas por una mujer? A siete años de iniciado el famoso MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), Marvel aún creía que tener a una mujer como protagónico en una de sus películas era una invitación a perder dinero. En ese mismo año, el presidente de Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, declaraba sentirse “orgulloso” de cómo manejaban a los personajes femeninos en Marvel, y descartaba en un futuro cercano tener a una película Marvel con una heroína a cargo. El único personaje femenino relevante hasta entonces era Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) cuya aparición cumplía más las veces de compinche y madre de los héroes masculinos, así como de atractivo visual gracias al sexy vestuario de la Widow y los ocasionales close-ups a su bien torneada figura (concretamente a su trasero). Así pues, en un lapso de menos de tres años, la realidad terminó por rebasar a Marvel. El advenimiento de movimientos como el Me Too y la clara tendencia de Disney en impulsar cada vez más cintas protagonizadas por mujeres (Star Wars, para no ir más lejos) obligó a Marvel a replantear la estrategia. Ahora no sólo nos encontramos con la primera película Marvel comandada por una mujer, Capitana Marvel, sino que además es ella misma la que muy probablemente salve al universo entero en el cierre de la saga Avengers (Avengers: End Game, a estrenarse este mismo año). Este repentino (pero obligado) cambio de rumbo permea en todo Captain Marvel, una película que se nota forzada en todas las costuras: un guión con demasiada exposición, narrado prácticamente en flashbacks, con una pobre ambientación de época, y una historia tan mínima que resulta poco memorable. Es otro de esos ejemplos de películas que pudieron ser un tuit. A eso se le debe agregar la absoluta falta de carisma de la protagonista, Brie Larson, quien fracasa en generar la empatía necesaria para que nos importe lo que le sucede en pantalla. Estamos en la década de los 90. Vers (Brie Larson) es miembro de una especie de policía espacial que llega por accidente a la tierra persiguiendo a una raza cuyo signo distintivo es su habilidad para cambiar de forma y así clonar la apariencia de cualquier ser humano. Es ahí donde Vers conoce a Nick Fury (un rejuvenecido Samuel L. Jackson), quien para el caso es también un policía. Vers le explica la existencia de esta raza de metamorfos y le advierte de una posible invasión a la tierra. Luego de 20 minutos de un inicio absolutamente aletargado, lleno de exposición y mucho aburrimiento, la película comienza a agarrar ritmo cuando Samuel L. Jackson entra en escena. Ahí la película se torna en un clásico buddy cop movie al estilo de Die Hard 3 (1995) y Men in Black (1997) con mucho humor y con un Jackson apropiándose de toda la película. Pero cuando el guión -escrito a seis manos por la dupla de directores, Anna Boden y Ryan Fleck, junto con Geneva Robertson-Dworet - abandona la jocosa liviandad del personaje de Nick Fury para regresar al drama impostado en la hosca e inexpresiva Larson, es entonces cuando la película sufre de sus momentos más cansados, monótonos y grises. La estructura del relato se vuelve abigarrada hasta que descubres que todo está diseñado para justificar la “gran” vuelta de tuerca, medianamente predecible y poco emocionante, que no aporta nada más que espacio para meter paja en forma de peleas, persecuciones en auto, explosiones y todos los ingredientes clásicos de una película Marvel. La ambientación de época se limita a algunos teléfonos, algunos comercios conocidos (el ya mencionado Blockbuster o la tienda Radioshack), uno que otro gadget del momento (monitores de los gordos y un Game Boy que salva el día), el internet de dial-up (que al menos da para un par de buenos chistes) así como el soundtrack, efectista a mares y sin la elegancia de un Guardians of the Galaxy (Gunn,2014). El soundtrack parece más bien tener el propósito de inyectar emoción a aquellas escenas que no la tienen, así sean peleas coreografiadas de las cuales no hay una sola memorable ni emocionante. ¿Cuál es el propósito de esta cinta? Pareciera que Marvel quiere lavarse la cara luego de insistir en que las mujeres no hacen buenas películas de superhéroes. Lo peor del caso es que, al menos en esta ocasión, tuvieron razón, pero ello no es por que la señorita Denvers sea mujer, sino por la urgencia en añadir esta pieza en un rompecabezas que a todas luces no le corresponde. Lo peor es que el mensaje que importaba, el mensaje feminista dirigido principalmente al público joven, queda diluído en toda una serie de torpezas y servidumbres que la dupla de directores (procedentes del cine independiente) no supieron ni pudieron sortear, al contrario, se convirtieron en creativos a sueldo a los que sólo les quedaba ejecutar sin el espacio suficiente para desarrollar a su personaje y, más importante aún, desarrollar ideas. El empoderamiento de Carol Denvers, una mujer que de chiquita todos le decían que no podría hacer todas las cosas “de hombre” que pretendía hacer (jugar béisbol, manejar un go-kart, pilotear aviones) se expresa con la misma fuerza y relevancia que un algodón de azúcar. Pero su nueva libertad, ahora asumida al tener superpoderes, queda en entredicho cuando el personaje no es más que una marioneta, una vil escala en un viaje mucho más grande, cuyo armado lleva años y que ahora, tras la nueva realidad, se convertirá en la pieza clave por decreto, así haya llegado ya tarde a la fiesta. Al final, el más empoderado es el gato (que se llama Goose, o sea, Ganso) mismo que se roba la película y único (junto con Fury) que auténticamente hace lo que quiere."
"May 18, 2019",positive,One can't quite help but feel that something this groundbreaking should have felt a bit more fresh and adventurous than it ultimately does.
"May 15, 2019",positive,[Larson's] femininity feels fresh and uncompromising and her presence is intriguingly both grounded and otherworldly.
"May 8, 2019",positive,"Overall, any minor missteps in Captain America aren't enough to detract from the fact that Carol Danvers is an enthusiastically essential addition to the MCU."
"May 4, 2019",positive,"Captain Marvel gives everything a fan girl or boy could want - spectacle, action, heart, and inspiration."
"May 1, 2019",positive," The type of super-heroine that cinema currently needs and fragile fanboys don’t deserve, Captain Marvel is the latest offering in the Marvel canon (its 21st, for those counting).  The first in the roster to focus squarely on a woman, it’s been particularly disheartening to see Brie Larson’s entrance into the heroic realm be tainted by comic book readers dripping in toxic masculinity.  Of course, these are the same people who don’t bat an eyelid at a Bradley Cooper-voiced space racoon or (throwing it to the DC bench, briefly) a Polynesian who can talk to fish, but give a vocal feminist like Larson a platform and they react as if they’ve been castrated. Nonsense aside, Captain Marvel wastes next-to-no-time in introducing us to the titular hero when she’s known as Vers (Larson), a blue-blooded “noble warrior hero” (as she later self-describes) who lives among the alien race known as Kree, a technologically advanced military unit inhabiting the planet Hala. While on a mission with her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law, upping the smarm), Vers is kidnapped by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn, indeed Marvel’s most exciting antagonist since Tom Hiddleston’s Loki), leader of the supposedly villainous Krulls (shapeshifters for the uninitiated), and managing to escape their clutches after an extended probe into her memories (ones that she has no personal recollection of), she crash-lands her way onto Earth circa 1995 via a Blockbuster video outlet. Admittedly up to this point Captain Marvel has been somewhat of a clunky, near-confusing, slightly fractured affair, with co-writing/co-directing team Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (the duo behind such indie darlings as Half Nelson and Mississippi Grind) focusing heavily on flashbacks pertaining to Vers’s life pre-Kree that doesn’t always feel as neatly executed as both the story and the audience deserve.  There’s not much to fear though as once Vers is paired up with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, pre-eyepatch and looking remarkably youthful thanks to some stellar de-ageing CGI), the film embraces a buddy-cop temperament between the two, with enough mileage earned out of the 90’s setting, with the soundtrack offering up its share of choice era cuts (TLC’s “Waterfalls” and Nirvana’s “Come As You Are”, to name a few) and the dial-up internet phase inescapable from a gag or two. Whilst the film delights in a few neat (perhaps not-so shocking) story twists, and certain beats being put in place in a bid to tie it in to the Avengers films we’ve come to know and love, Captain Marvel‘s real journey is that of its subject’s own exploration towards self-discovery.  Learning on Earth she was fighter-pilot Carol Danvers, a woman constantly standing up in an environment where she was put-down by men, the film’s third act reveals its heart when Vers is reunited with Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), a fellow pilot who manages to imbue Carol with strength beyond the radiant energy blasts she effortlessly conjures out of her fingertips. Though it’s easy for Captain Marvel to be accused of not being as aesthetically accomplished as Black Panther, or for even attempting an origin story beyond the expected, it’s still difficult to fight against its pro-empowerment mentality.  Additionally, taking its cue from the more humour-driven Guardians of the Galaxy infuses the film with a sci-fi goofiness that is perfectly balanced against its throwback timeframe.  And then, of course, there’s the unlikeliest of scene-stealers in the form of Goose, an orange cat who steals Fury’s attention and, surprisingly, inks itself to one of the series’ most valuable ingredients. An 11-year span was perhaps a bit too long to wait before Marvel served up a female-led offering, but Captain Marvel, as both a feature and a character within Larson’s capable abilities, is worth the wait – especially given that we know she’s a major asset in the next Avengers film (Endgame) and if this story is anything to go by (as well as the obligatory post-credit sequence), she may be the saviour the MCU needs. Set in the 1990s, Marvel Studios’ “Captain Marvel” is an all-new adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that follows the journey of Carol Danvers as she becomes one of the universe’s most powerful heroes. While a galactic war between two alien races reaches Earth, Danvers finds herself and a small cadre of allies at the centre of the maelstrom. It was a racist white savior film.  Anybody who reads the comics knows who the real first female Captain Marvel was and that is Monica Rambeau.  Marvel disrespected Monica’s character by making her a bratty kids kid who had to be imparted wisdom from Carol Lilly White.  This film was so bad and the film’s lead was so miscast that they had to crap all over the source material, just to help sell this character.  Nick Fury would never just hold a cat for a whole movie and let someone else do all the work.  Ronan the Accuser would not just cut and run because he was up against a strong foe.  They had to miswrite these characters just to sell the idea that the lead was strong.  It was all smoke and mirrors.  The continuity issues were also a big problem, but I leave it here.  This film isn’t really about feminism or empowerment.  It’s about a way too large corporation trying to act like they care about social issues in order to make money.  If they really did care, the would have written this film for the deserving Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau."
"Apr 30, 2019",neutral," It’s the first time Marvel Studios (aka Disney) has been behind the superhero curve. Eager to release their first solo female superhero, they managed to tie “Captain Marvel” (changed from an original male character to female) into the ongoing “Avengers” saga rather quickly. Oscar winner Brie Larson (“Room”) is an ideal champion for this sarcastic, tough trail blazer both on and off screen. Marvel goes the route of an X-Men film for this origin story prequel, taking its audience to the mid-90’s and wallowing in pinball machines, Blockbuster stores and grunge band rock music. The de-aging special effects used on Jackson and Gregg are more impressive than the intergalactic battles, which quite frankly slide into “Star Wars” territory a bit too often. Groundbreaking it is not, but “Captain Marvel’s” most impressive work might be forthcoming when she joins “Avengers End Game” this spring. It’s 1995, Vers (Larson) from the planet Kree, has crash landed on C-53, otherwise known as Earth. This planet, very different from her own, all seems a bit familiar to the woman who can emit forceful blasts of plasma from her fists. Her mission is to track and destroy enemies called Scrolls, shape shifters who can morph into anyone they come in contact with. Her trail of destruction leads to a run in with SHIELD agent Nick Fury (Jackson), a glorified desk detective, desperately trying to comprehend all these alien forces fighting on his planet. Vers and Fury apprehensively work together until they understand they are both on the same side. Every second on Earth gives Vers more recollection about her life as Captain Carrol Danvers. Trying to understand her past, Kree becomes impatient with Vers sympathy towards the enemy, sending in her mentor Yon-Rogg (Law) who is following orders from Kree ruler Ronan (Pace).

"Apr 24, 2019",positive," Packing a $153 million weekend wallop here in her home country, and a huge $455 million on her native planet, Captain Marvel, the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rallies itself after a sluggish start, and ultimately proves itself an acceptable crowdpleaser. Brie Larson, the Oscar-winning actor of Room and the eye candy star of King Kong: Skull Island, shows us earthlings that she’s got the talent and the gumption to launch this big-budget vehicle into the box office stratosphere. A bare six years after her bravura indie performances in Don Jon, Spectacular Now, and Short Term 12, Larson’s moved up to the A team, and the 29-year-old old is destined for greatness leading the Avengers collective, the latest of the 20-some-odd movies (and finally! one with a female title character) in the Marvel franchise. Sure, you know her movie is just a lead in to Avengers: Endgame, arriving next month (gulp!), especially if you watch the scene in the middle of the end credits, but that’s how the comic book company connects their films. For those of you who might finally consider watching a Marvel film – yes, I know there are a few of you – always stay through every second of it for extra scenes. They tease and hook things together. As an origins story, the film is adequately, but never enthusiastically, directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Geneva Robertson-Dworet). Boden and Fleck have collaborated on a handful of small micro-budgeted, character-driven festival favorites like Half Nelson and Sugar. Their last film, 2015’s Mississippi Grind, never crested above a half-million dollars in worldwide grosses (or less than 1/1000th of Captain Marvel‘s opening weekend), but did earn kudos for its lead, Ben Mendelsohn. He’s under their direction again here, playing a dual role in the director-writers’ breakthrough, big-budget space flick. As the film unfolds, Larson takes the stage as Vers, a warrior in training under the pushy supervision of Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). It’s not earth and she’s got no memory of her past, but she’s got some electric juice in her workouts that foretell something super inside her. She’s on Hala, where she’s part of the local Kree civilization, who are trying to eradicate a threat by the shape-shifting Skrulls (led by Mendelsohn’s Talos). Things aren’t what they seem, and Vers soon finds herself on 1990s Earth, crashing into a Blockbuster video store (glancing at a VHS copy of The Right Stuff) and eventually recalling enough of her past as ace pilot Carol Danvers. As she battles aliens chasing her, she’s inching her way through her past, with comic touches of ancient computers agonizingly waiting for ancient (well, 20 years ago) technology to load. That’s just one of the smaller little asides that poke fun at the era. The big joke is seeing, and trying not to obsess over, the CGI effects that allow one 70-year-old Samuel L. Jackson to become young SHIELD agent Nick Fury, when he had two eyes, and another youthfully transformed sidekick, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). Ah, the magic of the movies! So, everyone is racing from here to there, trying to figure out who’s who, particularly with a groups of transmogrifying and warrior aliens around every corner. As Danvers past comes into focus, she gets a big assist from her former pilot friend Monica Rambeau (Akira Akbar). You won’t see the full superhero rise up on Danvers (with an amusing sequence on picking her costume) until close to the two-hour-plus mark, and I can’t say I was that impressed with the electrical arcs that are CGI’d onto her new titular identity. Annette Bening blessedly has a nice role in the film, as the Supreme Intelligence on the Krell planet, and on planet C-53 (a.k.a. Earth) as a memory in her Danvers’ fragmented past. My favorite character was Goose (played by four felines: Reggie, Gonzo, Archie, and Rizzo), an orange tabby that becomes attached to Danvers and her associates. No, it’s not like the Laser Cats of Saturday Night Live, but she does have some good tricks. She also can’t keep a good hair-ball down. All told, Captain Marvel delivers the goods – and the crowds are appreciating that. Another Marvel blockbuster has hit its stride. Expect bigger things once the Avengers arrive at world multiplexes.

"Apr 23, 2019",positive," Captain Marvel is the latest Marvel film to come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is Captain Marvel kid friendly? It’s PG-13 for violence and language. In this Captain Marvel parent review, I’ll give you the scoop on profanity, nudity, and violence in Captain Marvel and whether you should bring your little kids. Comparatively speaking, Captain Marvel is more kid friendly than other Marvel films. First reports indicated that it wasn’t that violent, but I found it to be more violent than people let on. However, if you have girls, it’s hard to say don’t bring them. Because Carol Danvers did not disappoint, and I want all my girls to see this one! On the profanity scale, it definitely did not rival Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. There were 4 uses of the word “hell,” plus one more in the credit scenes. There was one sh** and one sh**hole. There were 3 uses of a** and 2 dammits and 1 damn. They also said bastards and “Oh my g**” once. Also Samuel L. Jackson says the phrase “mother flerken” which is not the use of the f-word, but I’m sure would make children who are familiar with the other phrase giggle or turn red. Were any of those words necessary? Nope. So I’ll still harp on Marvel to just get rid of them. There are other ways to get cheap laughs. Ok, maybe mother flerken was funny.  There was no nudity or romantic scenes in Captain Marvel. There was one scene where some people were inferring about penis size, but I would say it would go over the heads of most small children. While there was not as much violence in Captain Marvel as Black Panther, I still thought there was quite a bit. I did not feel Black Panther was appropriate for young kids in my ‘Is BlackPanther kid friendly‘ review. There were explosions, lots of fighting, some sci-fi violence (almost comparable to Star Wars) and some close-up shootings. You do see a little blood (red and blue).  Children who are sensitive to violence may be upset when they see people hurting Captain Marvel, and there is one scene that made me uncomfortable.  Is Captain Marvel ok for young kids?  If your children have seen all the Marvel movies, then this won’t be any worse than Black Panther for violence, Ant-Man and the Wasp for language, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for crude material. However, I would say no. Keep the little ones at home.  Captain Marvel runs about 2 hours long. The first half is a little slow for young ones as they build up the back story for the second half. However, if your kids have seen every Marvel movie and are huge Marvel fans, then I think they’ll be fine content wise and will love Captain Marvel!  I would recommend Captain Marvel for ages 10 and up, but I lean towards the conservative side for movie content for my kids. My 8-year-old daughter is a huge Marvel fan and is excited to see Carol Danvers on the big screen, so I will take her, but I know when I should cover her eyes. If your children have seen The Avengers, they may be excited for Agent Coulson to be back even though this took place before he died. Check out these Marvel movies in order to get caught up on all the Marvel films! If you don’t have much time, then here are the 5 movies to watch before Captain Marvel. First of all, there’s a cat. Named Goose. And she’s a riot. Goose is definitely a scene stealer and kids and adults will love her. I cried. For several reasons. Finally. A Female Marvel headliner. Shero. Bad-A. Strong. Courageous. Powerful. Caring. Vulnerable. All of those adjectives describe Carol Danvers, and they’re what I’ve been waiting for in a female superhero. I am the mother of 5 girls, and it will always be my job to help them be more self-confident and be a good human. Captain Marvel helps me do that job.  There are real-life examples of strong, courageous women, but sometimes you just want to see them on the big screen in a red and blue suit. You may be able to find flaws and nitpick at what you didn’t like, but at the end of the day, Captain Marvel did its job. This film has so much heart, I can’t help but love it! Higher, Further, Faster, baby."
"Apr 20, 2019",positive,Captain Marvel is the perfect mix of humor and action. Brie Larson brilliantly brought Carol Danvers to life in this film. A must see movie!
"Apr 17, 2019",positive," It took nearly a decade, but Marvel Studios has finally produced a film headlined by a female superhero with Captain Marvel. It has been a long, depressing road, littered with many failures (1984’s Supergirl, 2004’s Catwoman, 2005’s Elektra) that unfortunately gave rise to the perception that female-led superhero movies were inherently bound for disaster (of course, anyone who has actually seen any of those movies will recognize that they failed not because of the gender of the protagonist, but because there were lousy movies). While there has been no dearth of female action heroes in the various Marvel franchises, from Avengers, to Guardians of the Galaxy, to X-Men, there has not yet been a female hero standing front and center. And, although Captain Marvel has been in some form of development since 2013, it is hard not to imagine that its production wasn’t accelerated to some degree in response to the critical and commercial success of DC’s Wonder Woman (2017), a true game-changer that remains a superior film in virtually every way. This is not to say that Captain Marvel is not solid entertainment, but it lacks some of the moral and thematic clarity and visual elegance that made Patty Jenkins’s film such a stand-out—not just as a female-centered superhero film, but as a superhero film, period. Based on the Marvel comic book character that was originally introduced in 1967 and has been through more than half a dozen mutations and reinventions over the ensuring years, Captain Marvel features recent Oscar winner Brie Larson (Room) as the eponymous super-charged hero, who we first meet on the distant planet Hala training with her mentor, Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). At this point known as Vers, Larson’s character is an outsider living among the Kree, a humanoid alien race that is at war with the Skrulls, a shape-shifting lizard-like alien race. Vers has been with the Kree for six years, and she has no memory of anything prior to that. A brief, evocative opening sequence gives us some hints of a violent event that changed the course of her life, but it will take much of the film to reveal the details of her human origins. It is on Earth where most of the action takes place, as Vers finds herself back on her home planet where she teams up with young S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (a digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson)—the story is set in 1995—to fight against the Skrulls, led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn). Along the way, Vers discovers her true past as a human named Carol Danvers, which then leads to her fully embracing her extraordinary powers (which begin with glowing, photon-blasting fists that can punch holes in pretty much anything and eventually lead to galaxy-crossing powers of flight). Lashana Lynch plays an old friend of Carol’s who helps fill in her back story, while Annette Bening shows up in both flashbacks as a mentor to Carol and in the present as the embodiment of the Supreme Intelligence, the A.I. system that leads the Kree. Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who also co-wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Tomb Raider) from a story partially conceived by Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Meg LeFauve (Inside Out), manage the interpersonal drama much better than they do the big action sequences, which should come as little surprise since their background is in dramas like Half Nelson (2006), Sugar (2008), and Mississippi Grind (2015) and television series like The Affair (2014–2015) and Billions (2016–2017). They cannily embed some here-and-now political issues, particularly with one group of characters that are labeled “terrorists,” but see themselves as displaced refugees (there is a consistent subtext about the nature of identity and how others seek to define us, which will resonate particularly with women and minorities, who are particularly susceptible to others’ self-serving definitions and labels). The big action sequences are generically hectic, although there is a nicely sustained bit in an enormous government records facility in which the characters’ attempts to remain unnoticed is undone by the automatic lights in each row that crank on with a loud bang. Boden and Fleck are effective in conveying the enormity of Captain Marvel’s eventual powers (which are Superman-like in their breadth and depth), and the movie retains interest largely because she is constantly learning what she can do. The narrative is a journey of self-discovery, not just about Carol’s past, but also about what her future holds.  The mid-’90s setting doesn’t hurt, as it creates space for jokes about slow-loading CD-ROM drives and allows for the inclusion of all manner of Clinton-era rock and pop music (I have to admit that I admire any superhero movie in which the hero spends at least half of her screen time wearing a faded Nine Inch Nails T-shirt). The fact that Carol is a woman gives the film an edge that it uses wisely (for the most part); there are some cathartic moments in which she is allowed to directly kick the patriarchy where it hurts, particularly when she slams her former mentor and assures him that she doesn’t have to prove a thing to him, an assertion that will ring joyously in the ears of so many girls who have been told that they have to earn what is usually handed to boys. Sometimes the filmmakers lay it on a bit too thick, as when a climactic action sequence is scored to No Doubt’s “I Am Just a Girl.” But, you can’t fault the film’s ambitions, and enough of it works—particularly the engaging friendship that develops between Carol and Fury—that we can forgive its excesses and lapses.
