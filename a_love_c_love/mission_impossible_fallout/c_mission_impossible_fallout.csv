"Apr 4, 2024",positive," Within a jammed pack year of joining this website, joining the Extra Film podcast, to getting married to the love of my life, to losing one of the closest people I’ve ever known, to becoming the proud father of a beautiful puppy, it has been a eventfully, game changing year in my life and while all these things were going on, the year in film was slowly become one of my favorites. The year that was 2018 will go down as the best year of the decade for films with the 2010s.  Not only was it one of the best years in terms of movies from week to week, but the quality of the films and the elevation of genres throughout the year was extraordinary. From starting off the year with Paddington 2 to ending the year with If Beale Street Could Talk, I’m still catching up with films because of the consistent richness that was 2018. This was pound for pound the best year for Foreign Language films, Documentaries, Independent films as well as a very solid year for big blockbuster movies. It was also rich in films that shaped or changed the way I thought about the world around, with some films making me want to become a better overall person by the closing credits. I don’t know how 2019 could top 2018 but I will be interesting in seeing how it try to top the best year in film since 2007. We do encourage you to listen to Episode 308 to hear more about our picks, but as we do every year, listed here is my Top 20 of 2018.  
While They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead is a great investigative doc into the life of Orson Welles, Won’t You Be My Neighbor is one of the most moving, charming, important documentaries of the decade. The documentary about Fred Rodgers is more about the man and his philosophy than about the innocent show he was making. As stated in the film, Fred Rodgers was a revolutionary and he was completely ahead of his time. By the end of the film, there is a clip from one of the major news networks taking show at his work, blaming this generations “laziness” on Mr. Rodgers and that’s wrong because sufficed to say, I wish we had someone like Mr. Rodgers around that was deeply religious and faith based and innocent but also radical and talk about things no one else wants to talk about on TV, let alone on a children’s program, and by the end of the film, all I could do is marvel at the life that was Fred Rodgers. Director Morgan Neville is the new king of documentaries, and I’m fascinated in what subject he will tackle next. Click here to listen to our full review. 
This was my first introduction to the main podcast, and who’d of thought that Debra Granik long awaited follow up to Winters Bone would connect with me in such fantastically layered and real way. The two lead performances here from Thomasin McKenzie and Ben Foster are so authentic that I felt like they were really father and daughter. Thus their connection, their bond is so real to me. It takes the ideas of something like Captain Fantastic, a film I enjoy a couple years ago, and expands them into a discussion over the treatment of veterans, what a home and a family should be and what personal independence is. I wasn’t a fan of Winter’s Bone but I was a huge fan of this movie and I hope it doesn’t take almost another decade to get another film from her about people that we never get to see a lot and the lives that they live.

This was the film that took me so long to see this year and from the moment it starts, I was hooked. I love how Chloe Zhao makes this film almost feel like a bio-pic/documentary within this narrative structure, it’s as real as it could get and feels like something that is personal to everyone that is making it. This movie can strikingly beautiful but also being touching as well as you watch Brady slowly but surely try to put his life back together. It is a film about someone trying to continue their life and live out their dreams but also about coming to an understanding about needing to know when it is time to let things past and move on and find a new passion. This is all he knows and all he thinks he has, and by the end of the film, he realizes that their might be more than that eight seconds. It truly a special film and its one that I will regret the most not seeing on the big screen this year. Click here to listen to our full review. 
Alfonso Cauron’s most personal film of his career is his most visual striking film since Children of Men. The simple story of a maid taking care of a wealthy family in Mexico is not only beautiful from what you are seeing but the story feels so real and from the heart that you can’t fall in love it. It did take a while for it to get going for me, but once this movie gets into it mid act twist, this movie goes on another level and left me wanting to see it again. I wasn’t able to see it on the big screen but that didn’t stop me from loving. Thank you Netflix for giving Cauron a chance at making his vision come true. Click here to listen to our full review. 
When I wrote my review for Paul Schrader’s bombastic struggle between of man’s relationship between religion and climate change, I struggled myself in getting out words to describe what the movie was doing to me and I think that was the point. This movie challenged me in ways that many films this year did not and leaves you with lasting images that make you question your beliefs and what you are doing to protect this world. I said that Schrader was making a battle cry, with a sermon of a script, and he picked the perfect vessel to deliver that sermon in Ethan Hawke, who gives the best performance of his career and of the year.

What can I say that many have already said about what I think will go alongside Mad Max Fury Road as one of the best action films of the decade. From the helicopter chase, to the motorcycle chase through Paris, to the fist fight in the film, director Christopher McQuarrie takes you on an adrenaline fluid ride with characters we have spent five films with but take the time to give us a story that is built from the bones of the rest of the franchise. Tom Cruise is showing what I believe upon re-watch to give one of the most layered performances of his career and you can really feel when watching this film that this might be the one time Ethan can’t fully complete the mission and save everyone. The film lays down this tension from the get go and never lets go. Long live the best franchise in Hollywood and here’s to 2021 and 2022 when we get to accept our next mission.

One of the biggest surprises of the year became also one of the most original story of the year. In a film that follows the last three days of a young man’s probation, we are taken on a world of emotions and a look at the city of Oakland that is a real as any experience in any other major city. This movie is personal and that is because of the script written by the leads of the film in Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal, who take their personal struggles and complaints of the city they live in and make them connect within the large world and struggles that many in their communities deal with on a daily basis. With biting humor, tense cultural relevance and the best use of hip hop I’ve seen in film in a long time, this movie is this generations Do the Right Thing and I can’t wait for the next project by these two truly special talents.

Between the conversation on race, the two co lead performances of John David Washington and Adam Driver, and the confidence of Spike Lee as a master filmmaker, this film brings us a timely story of the past while connecting it back to our modern times. This is a wakeup call as well as a cautionary tale that mixes in pure nostalgia of the past and style of 70’s Blaxploitation films, in a world that seems so divided and angry, it took Spike Lee to bring it all together and make us laugh and cry but also make us think.

The love story shown from Kiki Layne and Stephen James is the most romantic realistic relationship I was on screen this year, the family dynamics and their values are perfectly portrayed in a script that is a love letter to James Baldwin.  Barry Jenkins balances real life issues of accusations of rape as well as mass incarceration as well as it being about innocence and how the color of your skin doesn’t matter if someone’s mind is made up about you, and he does it all with a tender, loving eye behind the camera. Jenkins along with Nicholas Britell’s score paint a beautiful portrait of these characters and the environment and time they live in. If I had more time to digest this movie, it might have made my number one but I also think this movie will be like Moonlight and only grow in my love for it. Barry Jenkins is the real treasure and is slowly turning into one of the best living filmmakers on the planet. Click here to listen to our full review. 
There are so many things I love about this movie: the opening, the empowerment, the political story that is just as interesting as the heist itself. Widows is a deconstruction of a heist movie, taking the genre to new and exciting heights. The best ensemble of the year and twist that, due to the marketing of the film, surprised the hell out of me and then brought this movie to a whole another level. It’s so layered and has a lot going on and while it doesn’t work for everyone, this movie clicked for me at every single moment. By the end of this movie, I wanted to see more, I wanted to be a part of a Chicago world building that hasn’t been as good since The Dark Knight, making that city as much of a character as the actors in the film. If you didn’t see Widows, please see it! I wish more people were talking about this movie because this is a prime example of what we can do when we give visionary directors like Steve McQueen and amazing writers like Gillian Flynn the resources to make not only just a great genre film that is within their style, but a full on masterpiece.

"Jul 24, 2023",positive," Synopsis: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and the IMF team join forces with CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to prevent a disaster of epic proportions. Arms dealer John Lark and a group of terrorists known as the Apostles plan to use three plutonium cores for a simultaneous nuclear attack on the Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca, Saudi Arabia. When the weapons go missing, Ethan and his crew find themselves in a desperate race against time to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Finally, we reach D-day. I have been reviewing all films from the M:I franchise for the past week, and now it is time for the best and craziest movie yet! If you want, you can check my thoughts on the other films by clicking each ones' title: Mission: Impossible, Mission: Impossible II, Mission: Impossible III, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation. Oh. My. God ... These are the three words that kept coming out of my mouth while watching Fallout. In a world where we barely have any real action anymore since everything is or uses bits of CGI, it is a huge breath of relief to be able to enjoy such jaw-dropping, mind-blowing, outstanding action set pieces! I know I have been writing this a lot throughout these reviews, but this one completely floored me. This is going to be the action movie to beat for a few years ... Maybe until the next Mission: Impossible installment, who knows?! My heart pumped like it never did before. The stuff that Tom Cruise actually does (which is basically everything) is unbelievable. Truly unbelievable, like you will have to get home and search for behind-the-scenes videos to understand how were they able to pull those sequences off. He runs like hell, jumps from building to building (you probably already know about the story of his broken foot), performs a HALO jump (a military parachuting free fall where the parachute is open at low altitude and the drop is performed at 25.000 feet), insanely drives a motorcycle through Paris streets, pilots a helicopter ... You got it, right?! This is the reason why the Mission: Impossible saga needs to continue. If it stops, there is never going to exist another film series that can bring such realism and incredible stunts like M:I does. It is undoubtedly the best action franchise of all-time, at least regarding the action set pieces. There is no possible comparison with any other movies. I am writing this because the ending might bother a few people. I have been having some bad luck with endings this year. There are a lot of films that I have watched and loved almost everything about it, but then its ending disappointed me in some way (Avengers: Infinity War, A Quiet Place, and some more). I hate when directors tease a particular end, which would be a shock and something entirely unexpected, and at the last minute they back off and take the safe route. Christopher McQuarrie does that, but Fallout might be the only movie where I understand why he did it. I do not want to go into spoilers territory so I will justify it this way. If McQuarrie chose the bold ending, Fallout would probably be an A+, but the franchise would have to end as well (if it wanted to continue to be successful). By choosing the safe route, he guarantees the saga's vitality, but the film suffers from the issue in the last paragraph since everyone is going to leave the theater thinking ""oh, I wish they would have gone with THAT ending"". This is a minor issue that I have apart from another one regarding the first act's pacing. This is the longest movie of the saga and McQuarrie already answered why. Not to this question in particular, but he did admit that this film was structured around the action set pieces. Usually, this is a problem because it is often awfully executed. Never create a movie without writing your story and characters first. However, this is the sixth film of the franchise, and pretty much every significant character has been in the previous installments.  Nevertheless, this justifies why the first act delivers so much information which causes the plot to start a bit convoluted. It eventually organizes itself, and it becomes a simple story, filled with predictable twists and turns that ultimately accomplishes its mission: to support the fantastic action sequences. Please, do not expect some Oscar-worthy screenplays from M:I movies because if you leave disappointed due to your unrealistic expectations, that's on you. As always, the cast is sensational and every character that we love and care about come back to one hell of a ride. I already blabbed about Cruise's courage, but there are a lot of exceptional performances. Simon Pegg (Benji) and Ving Rhames (Luther) are a hell of a team, providing some needed comic relief moments in such an action-heavy film. Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) continues to be incredibly captivating, Michelle Monaghan (Julia) has some screentime to shine, and Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) also brings his A-game. Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) returns in style, and Henry Cavill (Walker) proves to be a fantastic addition to the saga, by being the protagonist of some of the most potent hand-to-hand combat in the series. Besides the action, every technical aspect is seamless. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, there are so many beautiful wide shots, and some of them are a true filmmaking achievement. The score is remarkable as it usually is in the M:I movies and it helps to raise some goosebumps in the vertiginous scenes (people with a fear of heights are gonna have a hard time with this one). The editing is perfect, and the tone and pacing are very well-balanced with the help of Rhames and Pegg's characters, who bring some stops to the extended action sequences (the driving around Paris sequence could have been shorter). There is still that sense of urgency and the frenetic pacing, which provides a significant level of entertainment. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of all-time, regarding the execution of said action set pieces. Tom Cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history, through dozens of runs, jumps and God knows what more. McQuarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters. A simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action, and it still carries a few (predictable) twists. Only a few nit-picky things forbid me from giving this film an A+, but I promise you, it will definitely be in my Top10 by the end of the year. Go see it! On IMAX! NOW!"
"Jun 22, 2023",positive," Vague Visages’ Mission: Impossible – Fallout review contains minor spoilers. Christopher McQuarrie’s 2018 movie on Paramount+ features Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill and Ving Rhames. Check out the VV home page for more film reviews, along with cast/character summaries, streaming guides and complete soundtrack song listings. Continuing the narrative of his successful 2015 film Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, writer, director and now co-producer Christopher McQuarrie breaks with IMF tradition and commands the director’s seat a second time with Mission: Impossible — Fallout, aka MI6. When it comes to sheer quantity of triple-crosses, double agents, remote control gizmo toys, one-liners, stunts and rubber mask fake outs, Mission: Impossible — Fallout outdoes its predecessors. The big question now, however, is whether the longevity of this franchise is finally taking its toll on the overall quality. Once again, Impossible Mission Force (IMF) agent Ethan Hunt and his spy fraternity face the impossible task of saving the world from an apocalyptic catastrophe. This narrative thread continues to be the bread and butter of the franchise, dating back to Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (2011). Yet, even with slight alterations to the standard apocalyptic tale, the Fallout “plot” remains largely superficial window dressing, consistent with its predecessors. It is the cast/crew chemistry and stunts that are the true selling points. McQuarrie spices things up a bit by bringing back MI5’s villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He is a radical anarchist, hell-bent on taking revenge on Hunt and the world, striving for maximum suffering to yield epic peace. Lane is a constant reminder to Hunt of his past failures and deepest fears. From MI5 to MI6, Lane’s character shifts from more of a strategist to an anarchist. Harris’ acting in MI6 as a doomsday prophet is excellent — yet not as energizing or entertaining as seen in MI5. His portrayal of anarchy is far more subdued and dull than that of Heath Ledger as the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008). This time, a new challenge to the IMF is the tight CIA leash around Hunt and his crew, as the top spook, August Walker (Henry Cavill), keeps a careful eye on them, with orders to terminate if they go rogue. Walker presents the main physical threat to Hunt individually, while Lane taunts the IMF top agent psychologically. Both target Hunt’s heart, and neither characterization is sufficiently strong. The best relationship dynamic is between Hunt and MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), another carryover from MI5. She continues to add new energy and a coolness factor to this veteran franchise. More importantly, as a femme fatale archetype, Faust presents a relationship challenge for Hunt, restoring to this franchise its cagey, team conflicts. Yet, the adrenaline rush of the action sequences is the primary audience pleaser. Surpassing Rogue Nation, which had mid-tier heist stunts, Fallout jumps an even bigger shark with such style and grace that one cannot help but wonder in awe of the absurdity McQuarrie presents on screen. Cruise effectively turns Hunt into a mix of Captain America and Evil Knievel, chucking reality straight out the window. Throughout the stunts, McQuarrie and film editor Eddie Hamilton create a terrific visual narrative flow, and cinematographer Rob Hardy’s use of both medium and long shots in the IMAX format is especially impressive, pushing the IMAX format to its limit, comparable to Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Whether it is Paris’ night cityscape during an intense HALO jump or car and boat chases during the day, each MI6 frame pops with texture and exquisite attention to detail. The best example of the crew’s talents does not come from the more dangerous moments, but, rather, from the smaller ones. McQuarrie’s directorial expertise shines during a tightly storyboarded fight sequence inside a Paris nightclub bathroom. In this scene, the camera is both wide in scope and tightly focused. There is a constant sense of dread, and with hardly any cross-cutting, McQuarrie infuses this imminent danger into the audience’s view. The MI6 editing is lightning fast and crisp; the direction and tone of the film is a hybrid of sorts. It combines the grittiness of the bathroom fight from True Lies (1994) and the cold precision of the restroom scene in Jeong-beom Lee’s The Man from Nowhere (2010). Due to a real sense of immersion in this scene, one feels the pain the characters are experiencing. The audience remains grounded in the heat of the moment and is never playing catch up due to choppy framing or blocking of the shot. Finally, one must consider the Tom Cruise factor, the essence of the film itself. Cruise once again proves he is an actor sewn from a unique material that is all his own. His ability to be both mentally and physically capable of pulling off all his stunts is unparalleled. The fact he learned to fly a helicopter for a chase sequence that rivals cinema’s best — including Bullitt (1968) and The French Connection (1971) — makes the film worth the price of admission. What merits criticism, however, in the MI6 depiction of Hunt’s scripted wholesomeness. We now have a version of this character whose feats of strength and sense of moral justice come off as two dimensional and rather cartoonish. Hunt is no longer the genuine, somewhat flawed guy who first endeared viewers back in 1996. Based on the reported influence that Cruise has on the franchise films, one assumes this specific portrayal of Hunt is based on the actor’s wishes for the character. I suspect that McQuarrie is afraid of challenging Cruise, who gave him big breaks with films like Jack Reacher (2012) and Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation. McQuarrie may feel a sense loyalty to Cruise’s vision, not his own, and based on the way he scripts Ilsa Faust, it is obvious that he can write morally confused characters. Now imagine what McQuarrie could do with Ethan Hunt. By the end of MI6, the biggest question left isn’t about how one can top these stunts, but what constitutes the next stage in Ethan Hunt’s character arc? Overall, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a good summer flick that won’t let you down if you’re searching for cinematic entertainment. McQuarrie has proven himself to be an excellent director for future installments and probably worthy of taking the helm of DC Comics’ film division at Warner Brothers. J.J. Abrams should stay on as a long-term producer of the Mission: Impossible films because he helped mold the series in a sustainable franchise. However, it’s Tom Cruise who may be the issue. Cruise must cease playing Hunt sooner than later, if not now. Otherwise, Mission: Impossible films could turn into a form of spy self-parody, outdoing the worst of the final Roger Moore James Bond films. When it comes to explaining this to Cruise in a polite but matter of fact manner, that might prove to be the most impossible mission of them all.

"Aug 24, 2022",positive," What started as a successful but slightly schizophrenic pet project has evolved into one of my very favorite movie franchises. Aside from the common thread of their high-profile star, the first three “Mission Impossible” installments couldn’t feel more different. It was mainly due to having three very different directors, each with their own unique stamp. While I enjoyed each of them to varying degrees, it was still tough to put a finger on what the series wanted to be. That started to change with “Ghost Protocol” from director #4 Brad Bird. It put pieces in place and set the table for director #5 Christopher McQuarrie and what would be the best “MI” movie to date. “Rogue Nation” not only felt connected to its predecessor beyond Tom Cruise’s presence, but it was incredibly well made and left audiences with a much clearer vision of what the franchise is shooting for. Fans of “Rogue Nation” rejoice. Christopher McQuarrie breaks the revolving director trend and returns for “Fallout”, a movie that ups the ante in terms of breathtaking action yet still tells a thrilling story that well serves its fabulous band of characters. McQuarrie has been working towards “Fallout”, building its framework for several films now. He did uncredited rewrites for “Ghost Protocol”, co-wrote “Rogue Nation”, and handles the entire script for “Fallout”. This is his baby and he knocks it out of the park. Of course Cruise returns along with mainstays Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. Also back is Rebecca Ferguson who debuted and stole the show in “Rogue Nation”. In a prologue 56-year-old (but far from looking it) Cruise’s Ethan Hunt is informed that three plutonium cores have been stolen by a terrorist group calling themselves The Apostles. They are an offshoot of the Syndicate (see “Rogue Nation”) ran by a mystery man named John Lark. Ethan calls in his IMF cohorts, the neurotic Benji (Pegg) and easy-going Luther (Rhames), to help regain the cores, but the mission goes awry and the plutonium heads to the black market. Ethan is able to track the plutonium to Paris where a transaction is set to take place near the Grand Palais. Before he can head that way freshly christened CIA Director Sloane (Angela Bassett) orders him to take along Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), a CIA ‘observer’ and Sloane’s own personal “hammer”. Basically he’s sent to make sure the mission succeeds whatever the cost. As Cavill says in his wriest and driest voice “That’s the job.” If you follow the series you know the story can’t possible stay in one location. In addition to Paris we make stops in Belfast, London, even Kashmir (played by Norway). Along the way we get a white-knuckled motorcycle chase around the Arc de Triomphe, a foot race across London rooftops (which actually resulted in Cruise breaking his ankle), a mind-blowing helicopter duel through the snow-capped mountains of Kashmir, just to name a few. The action sequences are nothing short of exhilarating, mostly done through traditional stunt work and practical effects. The touches of CGI make a handful of scenes even more breathtaking. And what’s best is McQuarrie shoots them with visual coherence. No indecipherable shaky cams and quick cuts. It’s something to behold. But “Fallout” is more that credits-to-credits action. McQuarrie threads these sequences together with a classic-style spy story full of twists, double-crosses, intersecting plotlines and of course one big nuclear threat. In the middle of it all is returning “Rogue Nation” baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), an anarchist with a personal axe to grind with the current world order and with Ethan Hunt. His two-headed mantra “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace” is just as much directed at Ethan as to the world system. Adding another kink is the resurfacing of Ilsa Faust (Ferguson), once out of the game but now back in and with her own mysterious agenda. McQuarrie moves us through his wonderfully knotty plot at a crackling pace, tossing us enough twists and turns to ensure there is no downtime for measuring if every piece lines up perfectly. But it’s smart enough to keep us locked in and constantly guessing. And Cruise remains the heart of the franchise. His insane physicality and daredevil willingness to risk life and limb for every shot has never been more evident. But it’s the character-centric moments that speak volumes. He’s still a vulnerable hero, even a bit naïve. And more than any other “M:I” installment, “Fallout” centralizes his unshakable moral code as key component of not just this film but the entire series. “Mission: Impossible” continues to be the rare film franchise that actually gets better with age. “Fallout” makes no attempt to reinvent the wheel. Instead it takes the best elements of its predecessors and then cranks the dial past 10. Cruise and company’s ability to consistently up their game has culminated in this action movie masterclass that earns every ounce of acclaim it’s getting. Knowing their history I’m definitely onboard for more. But if the next movie’s mission, should they choose to accept it, is to top “Fallout” it could truly prove to be impossible. You have me really pumped to see this .  I have really liked the last 2 and wondered after the last one how they could surpass that one .  One the best movie franchises ever. As you know I was pretty excited for this but over the last few days I dialed back my expectations a bit. It ended up exceeding them. Do you know when you’ll get to see it? These pictures have done got old and they do the same thing over and over. They always cuss at them meddling kids for pulling their false face off, and That Tom Cruiser lady can’t act. All she does is show them white teeth and then frown with her serious face. I have to say this film is easily the best one in the series.  This film along with the last two, as you pointed out earlier, have finally given Mission Impossible its identity, and it works on multiple levels.  While there were some predictable twists, the rate at which they kept coming had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Wasn’t it great? I’m with you – edge of your seat stuff. I’m hoping McQuarrie sticks around because he has something really special here. How was the crowd at your showing? I’m really hoping it does well. Since I went in the morning, there really wasn’t much of a crowd.  I have no doubt in my mind that Fallout is going to make money.  I’ll have to check out Box Office Mojo in a day or so, but I think it’s definitely going to make back its budget by the time Monday comes around.   I’m probably going to go see it again.  Tom Cruise is like 57, but to see him do all his own stunts is mind-boggling.  I’m hoping he can keep it up for at least two more Mission Impossible films. Planning on seeing again too. Just love this thing. I don’t give many 5 star scores (this is my first this year), but this one deserves it. So I definitely want to see it again before it leaves the big screen. Ooooh Cindy, it is one heck of a ride. And hopefully you can see it on the big screen. It’s well worth a trip to the theater. I had a big grin on my face in most of this movie, but none bigger than when Cruise is just BOOKING it through London and McQuarrie’s got the wide shots. Legendary stuff, dare I say. Dude me too! I ate it all up. And Cruise’s stunt work is icing on the tension-filled cake (did that even make sense?). For me it’s more than a gimmick. Subconsciously knowing that him out there adds to the intensity for me. Great review! Glad you liked it! To me, while it doesn’t beat out the original film or Ghost Protocol, Fallout is definitely a great and solid action flick. Loved it. I noticed that too. I was surprised afterwards when I realized how long it was. It zips by. Hoping to give it another look this week. Great review Keith! Funny you should mention the overused quick-cut/shaky-cam method of action filmmaking, I was watching J.J. Abrams’ ‘M:I III’ and whilst it’s certainly enjoyable that’s always my main gripe when rewatching it.  It was cooland inventive when Bourne did it but it’s really become nauseous and lazy. What I especially appreciate is that although we have a returning director, McQuarrie brings a slightly different style and feel to the film in comparison with Rogue Nation that sort of respects the original mission (ahem) statement for the franchise of having a new director come in with each new instalment and make it their own. Thanks so much. That jerky cam stuff drives me bonkers especially on a large screen. I always think back to the last two “Taken” films and how choppy their action sequences are. I always wondered if it was a way to compensate for Liam Neeson (who I love) not being the prototypical athletic action hero. Fallout definitely has a slightly different style. I felt it was a touch darker than the last film while still hanging onto its fun sense of humor. It’s a delicate balance and McQuarrie handles it REALLY well. Haven’t seen this yet but I’m eager to now. They keep hitting this one out of the ballpark. A series that has got stronger and is now making its best entries in the franchise. Oh man, this is a must watch on the big screen. Definitely see it before it leaves the theater. I’m still amazed at how they up the ante without dumbing down their movies. LOVE IT. Loving the review. Spot on! I think Fallout is the best MI movie so far. I’m not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise on a personal level but what he does as an actor is incredible! I think I’m with you. I love the franchise especially Rogue Nation (thank you Rebecca Fergusson), but I do think this tops them all. Did you happen to see it in IMAX. I hoping to before it leaves my area. Most of the M:I movies are fine stand alone films. This one is a little different. You would still be fine watching it on its own, but there are several things directly connected to the last movie. I’m amazed at how they manage to consistently bring the quality with the MI movies… how have they not jumped the shark yet? It must be the same magic Tom Cruise uses to keep himself from aging. It’s pretty amazing. And not only bring the quality, but make the movies steadily better. I’m really impressed and can’t wait to finally see it again."
"May 19, 2022",positive,"Even in their sixth installment, the Mission: Impossible films remain a breath of fresh air amidst the CGI-fueled superhero spectacles of the summer."
"Mar 11, 2022",positive," Tom Cruise is the cinema’s greatest action star. Fortunately, such a hyperbolic claim is not without an argument to back it up. Around the dawn of the last century, Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckled his way to fame by climbing walls, riding horses, and swinging from ropes in titles like The Mark of Zorro (1920) or Robin Hood (1922). Although Fairbanks was an accomplished gymnast, he eventually conceded to use stunt doubles for the most daring feats. After Fairbanks, Errol Flynn took the crown, having shot his own arrows and performed dangerous sword fights in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and The Sea Hawk (1940). In the subsequent decades, actors including Tyrone Power, Bruce Lee, Harrison Ford, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and others became action icons, but few could actually perform the exploits of their characters and instead relied on the talents of stunt workers. Perhaps because their skills are evident onscreen, martial artists have dominated cinematic bravado in recent decades, allowing for Jackie Chan and Jason Statham to impress with their ability to carry out elaborately choreographed fights. But how many of these actors, from Fairbanks to Chan, have tied themselves to the side of a plane? How many have driven at top speeds in fast-paced motorcycle races, hung from a helicopter in midair, climbed mountains without a net, outran an exploding aquarium, or held his breath underwater for several minutes? How many have dangled on the tallest building in the world? Only Cruise has subjected himself to such exploits and more for the sake of screen action, and the above-listed examples remain restricted to the Mission: Impossible franchise, still going strong since its dazzling Brian De Palma debut in 1996. The sixth entry, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, contains some series-best spectacles, among them a memorable car chase to rival the one in The French Connection (1971), brutal hand-to-hand combat, and a breathless helicopter chase—for which Cruise learned to fly helicopters and then piloted his own craft in the film. Director Christopher McQuarrie, who captained the previous entry, Rogue Nation, sells every incredible set-piece not just because he realizes the proceedings in such a clearly presented way, complete with an effortless shot-by-shot logic and visual cohesion, but because Cruise sells the most unbelievable moments in the film by actually performing them. There’s very little reliance on CGI, allowing, subconsciously, the viewer to recognize, somewhere in the back of our minds, that what we’re seeing onscreen is real—as opposed to the usual Hollywood confection. Cruise and McQuarrie engross the viewer by making the most outlandish stunts look and feel like they really happened. More than the first two titles in the Mission: Impossible franchise, the last few have maintained a relatively steady character base and plot after J.J. Abrams reinvigorated the material in 2006. But Fallout follows closely the events and characters from Rogue Nation, and even maintains the same villain and supporting players. IMF point man Ethan Hunt, backed by his behind-the-scenes tech support Luther (Ving Rhames) and his other techie-turned-field-man Benji (Simon Pegg), operates under the close watch of their new department head, Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Hunt’s team has been tasked with taking down The Apostles, a terrorist faction devoted to the notion that “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace”—hence their resolution to cause as much suffering across the globe as possible. The Apostles follow in the footsteps of their former leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who was imprisoned by Hunt and Co. at the end of the last film. One of Lane’s devotees named John Lark, presumably a double agent in US intelligence, hopes to acquire three plutonium cores in an effort to create three nuclear weapons. Hunt’s team accepts the impossible mission to identify Lark, recover the cores, and stop Lane’s Apostles once and for all. At the same time, the CIA’s Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) demands one of her agents, the towering brute August Walker (Henry Cavill), oversee Hunt’s progress. She calls Walker the hammer to Hunt’s scalpel, and more than once, Walker’s unsubtle approach smashes the IMF’s carefully laid plans. Returning to the mix is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), a former MI6 agent who walked away from her life of undercover spying in Lane’s Syndicate. Which is to say, it’s helpful if Fallout’s audience remembers the events in Rogue Nation, even Mission: Impossible III, to appreciate in full the emotional significance of the events here. To be sure, Hunt’s estranged wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, makes several appearances in the film, lending to Hunt’s characterization as a man driven by a terrifying fear that, should Lane and his cohorts succeed, he’ll be unable to save the people who matter most to him. For Sloan, Hunt’s willingness to sacrifice the success of an entire mission, in which millions of lives hang in the balance, in exchange for a single life, means the agent has been compromised. The script, written by McQuarrie, rewards those who pay close attention to the plot machinations and twists throughout, without dwelling on moments or dumbing them down for an inattentive audience. About mid-film, an unassuming sequence that takes place in a series of underground tunnels contains about three twists and double-crosses in a matter of minutes, each more effective and unpredictable than the last, and McQuarrie allows them to unfold thoughtfully, trusting his audience to keep up. Not that it requires much to follow the story, as McQuarrie efficiently sketches out the stakes early in the film’s breezes-by two-and-a-half-hour runtime. The structure, modeled after the Hitchcockian ideal of grabbing the viewer from the first sequence and not letting go, never allows the viewer a moment of ease. Alfred Hitchcock has long been an influence on the franchise, from the elegantly conceived set pieces to the wrong-man-thriller elements, to the way each film forces the viewer to hold their breath until the last possible moment. Throughout the remainder, the audience follows along, either invested in the weighty dramatic arcs for characters like Hunt, Ilsa, and Benji, or attuned to the remarkable action. Most viewers will walk away from Fallout exhilarated, talking about Cruise’s stunts or the downright exhausting chases (by motorcycle, automobile, helicopter, and foot), but the story rewards those invested in the characters. And while McQuarrie’s script contains less humor or moments of levity than the previous two sequels, the lofty threat of nuclear genocide and personal loss intensifies the stakes more than previous missions. McQuarrie began his string of collaborations with Tom Cruise as the screenwriter of Valkyrie (2008); he later directed the actor on Jack Reacher (2012) and also contributed to the deft scripting on Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Even with McQuarrie’s accomplished filmmaking on Rogue Nation, his work on Fallout is a leap in craft and skill. He’s elevated himself from a screenwriter-turned-director to an extraordinarily accomplished visualist with a fully realized aesthetic. Shot by Rob Hardy (Annihilation), there’s a soft, Nolan-esque sheen to the proceedings, recalling the look of Inception or The Dark Knight. Hardy’s rather straightforward, plainly presented lensing of the action, along with Eddie Hamilton’s editing, capture the daring and death-defying stunts in all their considerable glory. The production seems engineered to make the most of Cruise’s devotion to action realism, particularly in the last 20 minutes when Hunt inches up a payload rope attached to the bottom of a helicopter, guides himself inside to the front of the craft, and then takes over above the mountains of Kashmir, India—a stunt marked by its balance of suspense amid beautiful scenery. What’s more, Cruise performs some extraordinary motorcycle work, becomes the first actor to perform a high-altitude skydive, and runs in a wowing extended pursuit (he has long been Hollywood’s best runner). Any of these sequences is incomparable, and yet Fallout is filled with them. Then again, McQuarrie and the 56-year-old Cruise are unafraid to acknowledge that the star may be dimming. Opposite the broad-shouldered Cavill (today’s Superman), who towers over Cruise, Hunt isn’t the invincible hero he once was. In Fallout, he’s out of his depth more than once, which, of course, makes the film all the more thrilling. Over the course of six films, the Mission: Impossible franchise has remained mostly consistent (with the exception of the abominable second film by director John Woo), deepening its hold on viewers with each new entry. With Fallout, McQuarrie delivers not only the best film in the franchise after De Palma’s slick original, but one of the great films of artfully photographed and technically monumental action—to be included on a list alongside other titles of similarly grand scope and design: The Road Warrior (1982), Aliens (1986), Die Hard (1988), Heat (1997), Skyfall (2012), and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Above all, Fallout reminds us that neither Cruise’s talent nor the enduring quality of his Mission: Impossible films should be taken for granted. Each new sequel attempts something new, something we’ve never seen before, and does this with a sense of spy-thriller panache that no other action franchise has matched with such unbridled showmanship and consistent, keeps-you-guessing story. Audiences will be watching McQuarrie’s direction and Cruise’s stuntwork for years to come, reflecting with a sense of awe over how they accomplished what they did, and how rare it is that the filmmakers took the risk to achieve it."
"Feb 12, 2022",positive," Tom Cruise is back as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in “Mission: Impossible – Fallout.” This is the sixth installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and I have to say that the series just keeps getting better. At this point, besides the Bond films, it has a good shot at becoming one of the greatest franchises in cinema history (along with James Bond, of course). It beats the “Fast and Furious” franchise by a long shot, that’s for sure. The last film, “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” was probably the best installment to date with a very slight lead over “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Henry Cavill as August Walker, Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, Sean Harris as Solomon Lane, Angela Basset as Erica Sloan, Vanessa Kirby as White Widow, Michelle Monaghan as Julia Meade-Hunt, Alec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, Wes Bentley as Patrick and Frederick Schmidt as Zola. The marketing team was having a field day promoting “REAL STUNTS” with “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” and for good reason. One of the main draws of this film is that in a world of CGI, seeing Cruise  perform these insane stunts for the sake of the film is inspiring and freaking intense. As a moviegoer, watching them play out one-by-one in “Fallout” made me anxious because I knew that they were mostly real. That’s what a summer blockbuster should be. In a world full of CGI, be a “Mission: Impossible.” (I hope The Rock is taking notes). The film is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie, who penned the last film as well. He’s the first director to stay on for multiple films and I’m not complaining. In preparation for “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” I watched all five movies back-to-back. What struck me from the get-go is how disconnected the first, second and third feel from each other. Luckily, the franchise didn’t stop at a trilogy, or it would’ve done a great disservice. When you go from the third, fourth and fifth installment, there’s much more continuity, fleshing out of characters and getting to what Ethan Hunt is all about. Unlike a Bond or John Wick, Hunt is the only of these characters who is morally grounded, for better or worse. He cares deeply enough about his team to sabotage a mission if one of them is in danger. It’s a fault, but it’s one that is honorable in a character and sets Hunt apart. One of the things that “Fallout” does well – and I can’t sing the praises high enough – is showing the wear and tear the spy game has had on Hunt. Not all of his plans work out in this one. Cavill’s character, Walker, is there to point out how ridiculous some of Hunt’s plans sound, including the infamous masks – a nod to the crazy antics the series has pulled off. I liked that we saw some flaws and saw Hunt in situations that weren’t always going to go his way. This is where a character like Hunt can shine, and seems like a callback to the action heroes of yesteryear (AKA ’90s). It’s when they are down and out that they do their best work. Think Bruce Willis in the “Die Hard” franchise. Another highlight of “Fallout” is that it clears up the whole romantic trio that started emerging in “Rogue Nation,” with the Faust character mirroring Hunt. We never really saw Julia in the last installment, only at the end of the fourth film, “Ghost Protocol.” I didn’t mind the missing mention, because as a viewer you can assume shit happened. One is not exactly going to have a happily-ever-after in spy world. Also, I don’t like a lot of romance in my spy thrillers or action films if it’s not called for. I don’t need to have a damsel in distress to get me to root for the hero. However, in Hunt’s case, this love triangle is heartbreaking and satisfying. It was really touching to have Rhames’s character, Luther, who has been the only character to last the whole series, deliver the heartfelt speech to Faust about Hunt and his two lady loves. Clearly, Faust and Hunt have something brewing even though no kisses have been exchanged. I mean, she’s basically the female version of Hunt and, dare I say, slightly better having saved his butt a few times. I don’t know how they wouldn’t fall in love given these scenarios. I have to mention Vanessa Kirby as White Widow because I am huge fan of hers from her portrayal of Princess Margaret in Netflix’s “The Crown.” She was the perfect White Widow and held her own against the seasoned Cruise. Bravo! Okay, let’s get to the stunts. There’s skydiving into a lightning storm, motorcycling through the streets of Paris, and a HELICOPTER chase, among others, plus an amazing, heart-pumping score to accompany all the action. There’s one scene early on in the film, that is probably one of the best action sequences I’ve seen in a long time. Kudos to Cruise, Cavill and Liang Lang as Lark Decoy. You can see a snippet of that scene in the trailer with Cavill’s infamous arm pumps! Honestly, as an action fiend longing for the days of real stunts, I was in heaven watching “Mission: Impossible – Fallout.” It was the right amount of practical, with the slightly ‘oh, come on!’ experience, which is what I want in a movie. Cruise is better than ever and, however you feel about him as a person, one thing you can’t deny is that he brings the Hollywood blockbuster A-game and we’re all the better for it. With all good things, there are some tiny flaws I have to point out. Henry Cavill. Bless his Superman heart. Look, I love Cavill ever since he was the sidekick to a former “Mission: Impossible” alum, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, in “The Tudors,” but I have to say it: his delivery of the lines are, at times, comical and cringy. I don’t know what it is, but he needs to work on it. There were also some weird transitions from Luther’s speech that felt out of place among other moments, but those are forgivable. All in all, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is bringing action back and I can’t get enough. Make sure you head out and catch this movie on the big screen!  Catherine grew up watching action flicks at a very young age which led to her love of film.

"Aug 21, 2021",positive," From the moment the fuse lights for the opening credits, there isn't a single second for you to catch your breath in Mission: Impossible – Fallout. This is the best, most relentless, most well-executed action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road.
Tom Cruise jumps out of a plane, hangs from a rope attached to a helicopter and leaps across London rooftops, all at age 56. And this is just a fraction of the jaw-dropping action scenes sprinkled throughout this two-and-a-half-hour thrill ride. Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, alongside Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). They've lost a case of stolen plutonium, which is now in the hands of the Apostles, the remnants of the Syndicate from Rogue Nation. So the CIA adds Walker (Henry Cavill) to keep tabs on Hunt and make sure he doesn't lose any more assets. But as Walker asks in one pivotal scene, ""How many times has Hunt's government betrayed him? How long until someone like that has had enough?"" It's a fair question, as moles and traitors have threatened his life and killed his team members in past movies. But that's nothing compared to the double and triple crosses in store in Fallout. Much of the film takes place in Paris, and that chunk of the film is among the best 30- to 40-minute stretches of any film ever, including a one-shot HALO jump, the bathroom fight that features Cavill pumping his fists like he's reloading a gun, a nightclub brawl, a car chase/heist that's extremely reminiscent of The Dark Knight, and a subsequent motorcycle chase that tops Rogue Nation and M:i-2. I literally gasped on more than one occasion. And this isn't even to women the terrific women of the cast, none of whom are leered at or used as pawns. Three in Ethan's orbit (Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Angela Bassett) do a great job of keeping their intentions murky, so we're never sure who's side they're on exactly. There's also a major reunion in the third act that Cruise plays with the right mix of happiness giving way to horror. There's a lot of personal stakes in this film, which make it matter a lot more than the typical end-of-the-world stuff (which is also present). The inevitable bomb diffusion feels a little weightier because of the people Ethan feels like he's letting down, which could play as callous in the wrong hands. But Christopher McQuarrie had already delivered some solid action movies. Now, he's made a certifiable masterpiece."
"Jun 24, 2021",positive," I have something to confess. I have never seen a single Mission: Impossible movie in my life. I had no idea what I was in for when I entered the theater to see the newest installment of the spy franchise. Apparently I’ve been missing out on a lot. What begins as a standard action flick very quickly turns into something else entirely. Something unlike anything I have ever seen before. The second the film reaches an early scene where the indestructible Ethan Hunt (the indestructible Tom Cruise) is about to jump out of a plane roughly five miles up in the sky, and you realize that what you’re about to see is real, with no green screen and no stunt double, you know you’re in for something special. What is Mission: Impossible – Fallout about? They try to keep it simple. Some bad guys have gotten their hands on plutonium and are going to make some nukes. It’s up to Ethan Hunt and his elite team (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) to stop them and get that plutonium back. Along the way they have to contend with the CIA and their operative, August Walker (Henry Cavill), and MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who are going after the plutonium as well. It’s paper-thin, and none of the characters seem to have much of a personality (although that could be attributed to me not seeing any of the previous films), but in this particular case none of that seems to matter.  The story and its characters are all just background noise in Fallout. This movie’s focus is completely on the enormous action set pieces and the outrageous stunts shown in them. There are many of them, and they are jaw-dropping in their presentation. You can’t help but be impressed and blown away by the sheer amount of work put into this thing. Fallout had three thousand set-ups, thirteen helicopters, four weeks of aerial photography, and shooting took place on three different continents. Tom Cruise, an insane human being(?) in every possible way, trained for an entire year to be prepared for the HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) jump stunt, a sequence that gets your heart practically beating out of your chest, and makes your eyes unable to look away from what you’re witnessing onscreen.  This is the movie that broke Cruise’s ankle while he was performing a stunt where he leaps from building to building, and wouldn’t you know it, that’s the take they use in the movie itself. You can see him limp away from his hard fall and continue running. There’s a white-knuckle, high-speed, helmet-free motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris, which includes a portion in which Cruise speeds against traffic in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe. The finale includes a helicopter chase through snowy mountains in which Cruise does most of the piloting himself. All of these are done mostly without green screens and CG (if there are any, they’re not at all noticeable), and the way that all of it is done practically is truly something to behold in all of its glory, preferably on an  IMAX screen. In a perfect world, this is the film that finally gets the Oscars to add a category for stunts.  Lorne Balfe’s (The Florida Project, The LEGO Batman Movie) score is incredible. It’s loud, boisterous, full of life and energy, and a brilliant reminder of what makes a movie’s soundtrack so much fun. The film makes expert use of it, blaring it during certain action scenes so that all other noise is basically muted, or having no score at all, letting the insane stunts you’re watching speak for themselves. Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) never pulls the camera away. It’s with the action every step of the way, supplying plenty of long, continuous takes coupled with far-away wide shots that work to show you the true scope of these insane stunts (like Tom Cruise dangling on a rope attached to a helicopter, something else he actually did in real life). Make no mistake, this film is an adrenaline rush. You’ll feel like you chugged down several Red Bulls after leaving the theater; your heart will be racing and you’ll have to fight the urge to speed out of the parking lot like a madman.  There aren’t any correct words I can use to describe exactly what the experience of seeing this film is in a theater. It’s something you have to go through yourself. Don’t worry about the plot because none of it seems to matter anyway. It’s all an excuse to move along from one action set piece to the next. But you won’t mind. I certainly didn’t. Hollywood has been churning out giant blockbusters for years now where every action scene is a CG-filled party, so it is astounding to see a movie like this where nearly everything that you’re seeing is real and tangible. It’s what makes it feel like such a genuine thrill ride. It’s the perfect summer action movie. It’s edge-of-your-seat excitement, and you need to make like Tom Cruise and run, and run, and run some more to experience it on the biggest screen you can find.

"Feb 28, 2021",positive," Writing a review for “Mission Impossible – Fallout” gave my thesaurus a workout. The film, the sixth instalment in the Tom Cruise franchise, is jammed to the gills with next-level stunts that require an expanded vocabulary to describe. Words like ‘extreme’ or ‘exciting’ or even ‘epic’ (and those are only the ‘e’ words) don’t come close to describing the behemothic action sequences contained within. Cruise returns as the seemingly invincible action man and IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt and his crew, tech wiz Benji (Simon Pegg) and agent Luther (Ving Rhames), are charged with finding and capturing anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a baddie who was the leader of the Syndicate during the last film, “Rogue Nation.” “Whatever you heard about Lane,” explains Hunt, “if it makes your skin crawl it’s probably true.” Lane is working with the mysterious and murderous John Lark, a man with some extreme ideas about squashing the world order. As Lark and Lane collect the necessary plutonium to fulfil their plan the CIA begins to have doubts about Hunt’s loyalty. Add to that the return of former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and some newbies, CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) and black market arms dealer and lady of mystery White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) and you have lots of characters to fill the space between the stunts. Complicating matters is the fallout from some of Hunt’s previous, well-intentioned missions. There are a lot of very good-looking people in “Mission Impossible – Fallout.” Handsome fellas and femme fatale‘s, they are all woven into a stylish story of international intrigue and plutonium. Like the others “MI” movies it’s packed with exotic locations—only James Bond has more air travel points than Ethan Hunt—doublespeak and double crosses but the narrative doesn’t matter that much, it’s all in service of the Bunyanesque action. Choreographed to an inch of Hunts life—Cruise really puts himself out there for this one—the realism of the stunts gives the movie a sense of danger and the Green Screen Department the day off. Monumental, vertigo inducing single sequences take place on land, wheels, water and air. Only the screeching of tires score one eye-peeling chase scene between a motorcycle and a car. Visually it is so visceral director Christopher McQuarrie wisely avoided cluttering the scene with frenetic music. It doesn’t need it. Of course those looking for a finely crafted John le Carré style story of espionage in “Mission Impossible – Fallout” will be bitterly disappointed. While it does contain huggerymuggery it frequently falls just this side of making sense. That’s not to say it isn’t entertaining. Even when Hunt isn’t in action the movie is in perpetual motion, but Frederick Forsyth this ain’t. Instead it is an elephantine (although no actual elephants appear) action epic that breaks the blockbuster norm of cutting away to an action sequence every ten minutes or so. It’s made up of three Brobdingnagian set pieces stitched together by words that mostly make sense.

"Jan 29, 2021",positive," They just don't make them like this anymore. In the age of superheroes and large-scale sci-fi epics, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a refreshing throwback to balls-to-the-wall stuntwork that manages to thrill and amaze just as adeptly as its shinier CGI brethren. The first true sequel in a six-film franchise, Tom Cruise's iron will to entertain with insane physical setpieces, along with Christopher McQuarrie's sharp script and direction, mark this Mission as one of the best. Mild spoilers ahead... Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the latest entry in the Tom Cruise-starring spy franchise, is ironically also the most analog of the series. A dangerous nighttime HALO jump, a frantic chase through the streets of Paris, a sweeping helicopter dogfight through the icy mountains of Kashmir - these are just some of the breathtaking setpieces that take place during the film, and for the most part performed for real by Cruise and company. Fallout is a relentless thrill ride that thrives on practical stuntwork, with its charms conveyed not through a CGI editing bay, but through the notion that Tom Cruise will jump out of an airplane over a hundred times to capture that perfect shot. Even within its own franchise, Fallout explodes forth with its refreshing and reliquary charms; gone are the CGI security camera shenanigans and exploding Kremlins of Ghost Protocol, and gone are the complex underwater heists of director Christopher McQuarrie’s previous Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. This latest installment, the first direct sequel of the series, instead focuses on visceral thrills sans any bells and whistles. And it works like gangbusters. Taking place two years after the excellent Rogue Nation, Mission: Impossible - Fallout sends Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) hurtling on another world-saving adventure after a botched attempt to recover stolen plutonium. The bad guys this time around are The Apostles, splintered remnants of The Syndicate still loyal to anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) after he was put away at the end of Rogue Nation. When Hunt is forced to bust Lane out of Interpol custody in order to retrieve the plutonium spheres, a race against the clock to avert nuclear catastrophe begins. Complicating matters is the addition of August Walker (Henry Cavill, flexing his physicality even more than he did as Superman), a CIA assassin tasked with keeping Hunt and his IMF compatriots on a short leash. Rebecca Ferguson, by far the best part of Rogue Nation, makes a welcome return as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent with her own mysterious agenda. Her role as friend as well as foil hasn’t changed much from the previous film, but Ferguson’s wild-card portrayal is so charming that one finds it hard to complain. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a twisty film full of swerves and betrayals, but not exactly undpredictable - big reveals are heavily telegraphed, and the film’s primary twist is almost disappointingly rote - but where Fallout succeeds is in the execution of the plot. The film dips heavily into the trope jar when it comes to its surprises, but there is always a refreshing and exciting spin that will put a big grin on your face, even if you do see the end result coming a mile away. It also helps that Fallout’s momentum is nothing short of explosive - the film’s 147 minute runtime feels like a blink of the eye when you’re watching Tom Cruise barrel through setpiece after setpiece, seemingly with zero regard for his own safety. Mission: Impossible - Fallout will stimulate the dormant sections of your adrenaline centers, a kind of thrill long missing from action cinema that exploding CGI spaceships and massive destruction can’t even begin to mimic.  Mission: Impossible - Fallout  is the most fun you’ll have at the movies this summer, with a brand of action and spectacle that Hollywood just doesn’t produce anymore. At 56 years young, there’s no sign of Tom Cruise slowing down in his quest to entertain. His mission with this franchise, which he always chooses to accept, is to work as hard as he can to deliver over-the-top stunts and outdo his last effort, and Fallout is the best one yet. One can only imagine what the next installment will bring. "
"Dec 7, 2020",positive," fter megalomaniacal terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) was apprehended several years ago by the IMF, a new threat has emerged in his place. In their leader’s absence, his underlings have formed the “Apostles,” a mysterious group of mercenaries hellbent on continuing in their madman commander’s footsteps. When renounced scientist Nils Delbruuk’s (Kristoffer Joner) designs for a complex set of nuclear bombs are uncovered, the IMF team, including Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), must intercept the three plutonium spheres intended for the weapons before they fall into the wrong hands. When the mission sours, the CIA assigns arrogant agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to accompany the IMF on their next task of locating the missing radioactive metal. As the group tracks their prize to cunning arms dealer “White Widow” (Vanessa Kirby) and elusive assassin John Lark, they engage in a treacherous chase across the globe where a second failure would mean the deaths of millions. Since the series is already six feature films deep, it’s not surprising that this latest entry begins with a number of references to the previous chapters, without much explanation for anyone not caught up. Clearly, the filmmakers aren’t too concerned with gaining fresh fans; instead, they’re hoping to keep the existing enthusiasts who can’t get enough of impossible missions (accomplished always in the nick of time, just as the world is about to succumb to a nuclear holocaust – or within a split second as a bullet is diverted, a knife thrust is blocked, or a parachute needs to open to avoid splattering the heroes across landmarks). To the film’s credit, even with all of the repetition, it definitely lives up to its name. The extremist splinter cell that has been causing troubles for Hunt and his team sounds a lot like James Bond’s SPECTRE, but the last few “Mission: Impossible” entries have managed to avoid the utter dreariness that has been consuming 007 of late. Here, there’s a sensational blend of humor and action, refraining from dismal severity yet staying well out of the range of campy. Hunt probably needs to be willing to kill his enemies more often, but his reluctance enables him to be a clearcut hero, which is refreshing amidst the more common antiheroes that pervade cinemas. And though several of the early ruses aren’t terribly clever, particularly as the 3D-printed faces that everyone dons hints at the likelihood of switches, the plot doesn’t go overboard with the mug-swapping, even though the dialogue makes the grave error of pointing out the signature silliness of this franchise. “The IMF is Halloween: a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat,” huffs the CIA chief, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Believable tech makes an appearance as well, aiming to offset the sci-fi components, highlighted by altitude gear, tracking devices, and computer readouts. The cloak-and-dagger elements also escalate, allowing the story to rely on spy games just as much as the action, despite Ethan’s successes always depending on plenty of luck. “Hope is not a strategy!” Infiltrations, ambushes, extractions, surveilling, tailing, assassins, globetrotting, and shootouts make their standard appearances, too, rounding out – and perhaps needlessly prolonging – the adventure. One of the film’s greatest strengths, however, is that sense of adventure, especially when the stuntwork ensures that Tom Cruise’s features are very much visible for the majority of the shots. His notable dedication to performing his own stunts is admirable, as well as convincing, though most audiences will probably fail to realize just how much effort and pain went into the final product. Martial arts fights are tense, while heists are nicely chaotic (one sequence artistically removes all sounds and sound effects for a welcome change of pace) and the protracted chase scenes are mesmerizing (the bulk of the second act is little more than a chase that segues into another chase that segues into yet another chase, frequently changing speeds, locations, and even modes of transportation). But it’s the finale that really steals the show, making the best of editing and cuts to distract viewers from the fact that virtually every one of the IMF’s tasks boils down to the diffusing of a bomb. And the music is once again outstanding, bolstering every sequence with the right amount of verve.

"Aug 26, 2020",positive," In an age of James Bond and Jason Bourne, the spy genre has become a constant re-evaluation of its modernity.  Both franchises have found a level of adaptability in understanding how the world mirrors the reality of its protagonists.  Not to be left behind, Mission Impossible has earned its right to be amongst the conversation.  Far removed from its 60s past of Peter Graves, Barbara Bain and Martin Landau, the franchise in its current format has culturally redefined its contextual history to this generation of film-goers.  Each film has been a new and enduring lease of life, embodying a stunt spectacle as well as a contemporary spy movie of its era with Tom Cruise as its committed leader. Mission: Impossible – Fallout represents the very best of the franchise. If there was a chance for the Oscars to update its proceedings, then a ‘Best Stunt’ category is long overdue and necessary. One of the many successes from the Mission Impossible franchise is its ability to challenge.  In many respects, it has become the Fast and the Furious of the spy genre, always finding bigger and better ways to outdo its previous film whilst retaining a seminal connected universe.  By proxy, it creates a fantastical familiarity but also a trope in itself where audiences can mindlessly escape without thinking too much of its relevance.  That characteristic has evolved as both franchises have “grown up” to become the behemoths that they are today; Fast Five changed its concept from street racing to a heist movie with cars.  While the stunt edge has always been present throughout, it’s safe to say that Ghost Protocol set Mission Impossible on its current trend of exhilaration. But Fallout is a different specimen, both tonally and as a retrospective piece, a game-changer as some would argue.  Director Christopher McQuarrie doesn’t rely on the laurels of the previous accomplishments of the franchise but decides to re-evaluate its purpose.  What does Mission Impossible and the IMF mean in the global terms of terrorism, political powers and the agencies designed to protect us?  Rogue Nation gave us glimpses of that ideology, putting the IMF on trial so to speak with its confrontations between William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Alan Hunley (Alex Baldwin).  But Fallout undertakes a personalised endeavour as a Bond-esque adventure (more Skyfall than Spectre) by forcing it to look at how it started and evolved.  Fallout might be a direct sequel to Rogue Nation but its lineage ties back to Brian De Palma’s 1996 classic. As a serious and measured spy film, McQuarrie’s imprint is an effective homage, not just to the franchise with its reminiscing stunt sequences but to the genre.  McQuarrie returns us to the world of what spying entails, so synonymous by trademark which we’ve seen in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Atomic Blonde and even James Bond under Connery in From Russia with Love. It’s a return of the Cold War ethics of double agents and crossings, clandestine meetings, shadowy conspiracies, infiltration and trades.  The fact that its first key scene takes place in Berlin, the historical hotspot of Cold War spies is a notable nod to its credibility.  The only thing missing would have been to film in black and white, capturing the undertones of film noir. It’s within this context that Fallout starts to re-evaluate the world and find some grounded perspective, taking a note out of Nolan’s playbook and what he achieved with The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight was a mirrored reflection and allegory of a Post 9/11 world and the efforts on the war on terror where fear was a stepping stone towards a fractious, unpredictable and destabilising chaos that exposed the moral foundations and rules we’ve built our lives upon.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) was unable to fulfil his ultimate plan of witnessing Gotham’s submission to that chaos thanks to Batman (Christian Bale) rescuing the soul of the city. However, his ability to turn a prominent figure, a hero in Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) towards the ‘dark side’ is one of those haunting and psychological traits about the corruption of the human spirit. A similar essence is explored in Fallout.  Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) might as well be The Joker of the MI franchise, someone who lives up to Alfred Pennyworth’s line about “some men just want to watch the world burn”.  Lane’s anti-institutional stance and zealot belief in resetting the world is as symbolically influential as Ra’s Al Ghul and The League of Shadows but represented as an upscaled version of The Syndicate called The Apostles.  Lane’s personal fascination with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) not only makes him a significant villain since the days of Philip Seymour Hoffman back in MI:3, but challenges the obsessive foundations of what Hunt stands for as a corruptible force to Hunt’s moral compass.  Therefore, Ethan Hunt may share some Batman like qualities, but he might as well be the ‘Harvey Dent’ in this equation.  They both share an almost ‘gung-ho’ attitude in stepping in front of danger and considering that once again Hunt has to prove his allegiance, lives up to Dent’s “you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”  It’s a loyalty that audiences may never have questioned due to Hunt’s unprecedented heroics, but with each “impossible” mission, particularly in Fallout’s case, almost entertains the idea of a ‘dark side’. We witness that in a staged hospital scene of that supposed darkness and abject failure where the plutonium he needed to rescue out from the hands of the terrorists is used to bomb three global locations.  The darkness reappears in Hunt’s vision of the heist where he contemplates the possibility of killing innocent people to follow through with the exchange.  Even Hunt’s dreams have become a guilt-ridden infection due to Lane’s radicalised influence.  But coded within its dark, chaotic articulation and Lorne Balfe’s superb Zimmer-esque score, McQuarrie presents a paralleled understanding in the terrific Paris chase sequence.  The mirrored sense of anticipation and impending doom is a role reversal where instead of Harvey being used as bait to lure The Joker out, Ethan is preventing ‘The Joker’ from ending up in the wrong hands. What makes the motivations relatable as it is is how McQuarrie uses Fallout to establish that Ethan Hunt has become ‘the impossible mission’.  As Hunt dives head first into the unknown, he creates consequences, knowing each decision can have long-term damages. Does all of Hunt’s risk-taking actually surmount to anything when it removes one obstacle but creates a vacuum in its place?  What is it good for if the extent of that reach can recruit new followers at an astronomical rate?  How deep does that infection go when supposed allies and colleagues turn out to be double agents?  Fallout almost analyses Hunt as an internalised perspective of his character in the context of the entire franchise and his valued contribution to the world.  The mission itself is more of a personal expression than the physical exertions. It’s very obvious to suggest that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is just ‘more of the same’ from the franchise.  But the key distinction is that Fallout attempts to humanise the concept. This is not just in connection to Ethan Hunt (who will always remain the focal point) but with characters who have been with us since MI:3.  In its attempt to give a conclusion, these familiar characters help reinforce the danger and the sacrifices made. When Spectre clumsily attempted to build a cinematic universe at the last minute by shoehorning all of Craig’s Bond villains as part of the same organisation, the characters of Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) solidify Ethan’s world to allow a mission-driven universe to form naturally.  Ethan has a ‘win at all costs’ mentality in saving the world but his friends have become a cornerstone of his humanity so that the work he does is not always in vain. As a vehicle well-versed in cinema language, it’s how Fallout utilises tension and suspense to a Hitchcockian level.  Like with Psycho and its famous shower scene, Fallout is almost too claustrophobic, opting for an intense, up close and personal feel that puts its audience right into the centre of that action.  That ‘Deus Ex Machina’ that most films love to do by pulling a rabbit out of a hat whenever there is a tight situation would have felt like a cheat move under Fallout, and yet is never within close reach when you want that comforting safety. Similar to the efforts pulled with Rogue Nation and the brilliant opera scene, each stunt in Fallout is like a chain reaction of chaos that seems to escalate and evolve when you least expect it.  It’s no surprise that McQuarrie was directly influenced by the silent movie era of Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton because Fallout is very much a visual art piece of ’cause and effect’.  Films like Mad Max: Fury Road and John Wick: Chapter 2 have used action to that extent where if you turn the sound down, the stunts tell its own synchronised story.  The rising escalation and its upgraded complexity operate like a cinematic dance that works towards its final crescendo and leaves you breathless. What Fallout celebrates is the art of the stunt work at its most visceral best because the more reckless the stunt, the more you believe it.  What Fallout brings to the table is an action authenticity where you feel every brutal punch and every thrilling chase knowing you’ve gone through an experience.  Despite Hunt appearing to have dabbed into the dark arts for an invincibility spell, you steadily sense his vulnerability and desperation, pushed further into the insanity of the stunt. If anything, Mission Impossible has become a living testament and commitment in its constant search for new stylish ways to integrate stunt and story.  Fallout represents the best accumulation of that.  Like the ethos of silent cinema and its incredible stunts, the relentless action is constantly pulling you and its characters out of their comfort zone. Another Mission Impossible film is all but guaranteed.  As one chapter closes, Fallout opens the door for more possibilities.  No matter how it continues, Tom Cruise and his chase for stunt excellence will be a driving force for the continued brilliance of this franchise."
"Aug 14, 2020",positive," Ethan Hunt must deal with a returning terrorist villain, a new group of zealots and an interfering CIA operative in his latest very improbable mission. Being a film critic is the best job in the world – obviously. Sometimes, though, it’s easy to lose sight of that. Sitting through the latest noisy installment in the Transformers franchise, or enduring a comedy that’s about as funny as a Brexit white paper, is enough to make even the most devoted cinephile question their career decisions. Thank goodness, then, for movies like Mission: Impossible – Fallout. It’s a stupid, ridiculous, shlocky romp so enjoyable that it restores every lost iota of faith in cinema to amaze, enthral and excite. Not bad for the sixth film in a fairly generic collection of action movies. For the first time in the 20 year history of the franchise, there’s a returning director at the helm, with Christopher McQuarrie picking up where he left off after the fun but forgettable Rogue Nation back in 2015. Alec Baldwin’s CIA suit is now in charge of the IMF and he has tasked Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with tracking down a trio of plutonium devices before they fall into the clutches of the Apostles – a group of zealots formed from the ashes of the Syndicate, whose founder Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is ricocheting around between the law enforcement systems of various nations. A calamitous decision made by Hunt in the heat of battle leads to the plutonium vanishing into criminal hands and the interference of CIA assassin Walker (Henry Cavill), who is despatched to keep an eye on Hunt and his IMF team as they try to recover the radioactive material before it can become weaponised. Things are complicated further by the reappearance of former MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own set of missions and loyalties. McQuarrie has woven yet another tapestry of double crosses and conspiracies with Fallout, though it’s clear that this is not where the lion’s share of his enthusiasm lies. This movie’s storyline is little more than a skeleton, on to which McQuarrie and producer-star-daredevil Cruise assemble an elaborate musculature of set pieces that are as inventive as they are dangerous. Whether it’s a bruising bathroom fight, a motorbike chase through the streets of a major European city or an aerial battle in which helicopters become high altitude dodgem cars, McQuarrie and his fearless leading man pull out all the stops to batter the audience into submission. And it’s in this quest that the film whole-heartedly succeeds. There is action in this movie to rival anything in the best genre adventures of recent years, from Mad Max: Fury Road‘s vehicular carnage to the superhero smackdowns of Avengers: Infinity War. The climactic face-off, atop a towering Asian cliff, is a bruising battle of fists that is as cathartically funny as it is stunningly violent. It’s a movie that almost dares the audience to engage in their own daredevil stunt – holding their breath for the entire third act. It helps, too, that this franchise is now fully embracing its ludicrousness like an old friend. There’s a running gag characterising the IMF as “a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat” and Simon Pegg’s tech whizz Benji has dialled up the exasperation even further. This new incarnation of Mission: Impossible marks the swaggering confidence of a series that, after decades of tinkering, has found its identity as a cartoonish demolition derby, anchored by its Cruise missile of a star – willing to dangle from, and ultimately jump off, as many tall things as he can find. These movies belong to Cruise, and it’s easy to see why. Undaunted by either his advancing years, or the smashed-up ankle he sustained during filming in London, the 56-year-old man of mayhem is a whirlwind running through almost every frame of the movie’s two and a half hours – a lot on paper, but it flies by – in a constant quest to one-up his own excesses. He’s amply supported by his usual ensemble, but he equally benefits from Henry Cavill, effectively reprising the sneering arrogance of his character in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in a role that is as enjoyable as anything he has done in his big screen career. McQuarrie’s comfort equally shines through in the visual finesse on show throughout the film. Interior scenes have a retro grain, while the aforementioned finale unfolds against an eclectic climate, changing from snow-capped peaks to the verdant beauty of greenery in the blink of an eye, each captured with an eye for sheer beauty by cinematographer Rob Hardy. The sound design, too, deserves credit for some crunching punches and deafening chases, while Lorne Balfe’s score mixes old and new with a seamless sense of the same kid-in-a-sweet-shop joy that powers the whole movie. It’s not a straight slam dunk, though. Michelle Monaghan, returning as Hunt’s estranged ex-wife, hands the film an entirely unnecessary emotional subplot that never works, despite the best efforts of Ving Rhames in a beefed-up role as hacker Luther. Rhames shines in his comedy moments – including a particularly fraught attempt to defuse a bomb – but struggles to do as much emotional heavy-lifting as the script asks of him. Equally, a British society dirty dealer played by The Crown‘s Vanessa Kirby adds an injection of strange energy when she’s on screen, but ultimately flits in and out of the narrative without much rhyme or reason. These complaints, however, are a mere footnote in the face of the towering achievement that Mission: Impossible – Fallout transpires to be. In a movie world in which even the biggest films often feel as if they are holding plenty back for sequels, it’s a joy to experience a blockbuster bonanza that genuinely feels as if it’s tossing absolutely everything it has at the audience in an attempt to deliver pure, unadulterated escapism. It’s possible for a film critic to lose sight of the joy of cinema, for sure, but after I spent the last 20 minutes of Fallout repeating the words “I bloody love movies” in my head, I’d say I’m in a good place for the moment."
"Jul 25, 2020",positive,"The physical proximity to each character and each movement is so minute, so aurally and visually sweeping, that Fallout is often slick as all hell."
"Jul 22, 2020",positive," There is absolutely no doubt as to why Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible is the strongest franchise Hollywood has to offer. In a world where CGI rules the roost, Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie perform their high aerial stunts in the real world. Delivering a thrilling ride proving every mission they undertake is certainly possible whilst not scrimping on its entertainment value. Events escalate no sooner as the picture opens; Ethan (Cruise) and his merry men, Simon Pegg’s Benji and the man-made wall, Luther (played by Ving Rhames) manage to lose three spheres of nuclear material. It proceeds to spend the next two and a half hours trying to get it back and save the world. However, it’s not that simple as the action-packed story weaves through the European streets of London and Paris with a few familiar faces popping up along the way. Whilst Ethan is plagued with guilt and the haunting memories of his wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), Ethan’s boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) returns to continuously butt heads with Angela Bassett’s Erica Sloan. Continuing to think Ethan is moderately a liability; Sloan proceeds to assign the hulking August Walker (Henry Cavill) to accompany Ethan on his hunt to thwart the most recent threat. Each scene hereafter is a bit like me and my shadow between the pair, but there is certainly no love lost between the men as the masculinity fills the air. Even Rebecca Ferguson turns up as Ilsa Faust in the most random of spots. Not just to keep an eye on the situation, but also to give the men a run for their money in the sleek fight sequences as well. She also throws in that unspoken lust connection between Ethan and herself softening the violent edge. Hats off to Cruise, after all these years, his adrenaline junkie side is still pumping strong and taking on 99% of his own stunts. Even his highly publicised ankle break whilst filming a building leap has been left in. It’s just as wince-inducing as when the footage was first published, but just reiterates the man’s professional insanity and desire to carry on. His staple running sequence is one to behold too, one that has become a bit of a running joke. At one point it becomes clear that Cruise is actually auditioning for a role in The Flash. Even though the humour is nevertheless present, it is overshadowed by the jaw-dropping, flawless action set pieces; from watching Cruise sprint through the streets and rooftops of France to the incredible punch-up in the toilets of a club between Cavill, Cruise and the Chinese actor Liang Yang. The fighting is ridiculously relentless as they are punched through walls and slammed into porcelain sinks. Even though the bathroom is destroyed, the men just keep getting up. The winning sequence comes in the gripping dying scenes in Kashmir. Set amongst the glorious mountain setting, as two helicopters manoeuvre between themselves with Cruise dangling from a rope to finally cement his adrenaline lunacy. It’s clear that McQuarrie and Cruise make for an unbeatable combination on this franchise. McQuarrie’s eye for slick, flawless and stunning filmmaking paired with Cruise’s slightly unhinged grip of action fodder has created spectacular, pure unadulterated blockbuster awesomeness."
"Jul 21, 2020",positive," The sixth instalment of Mission: Impossible opens with IMF lynchpin Ethan Hunt in the midst of a bad dream. He wakes up with a start. This would be pretty routine stuff but for the fact that the film's protagonist is an unstoppable spy who thrives on performing death-defying stunts without ever worrying about the inherent dangers. The human facet of Tom Cruise's most abiding screen persona separates this action hero from most others. Mission: Impossible - Fallout isn't only about the lead actor jumping of airplanes and skyscrapers, hanging from cliffs, and even flying a helicopter when he doesn't how to. The screenplay gives the star and his co-actors, whether they are playing his foes or friends, substantial character arcs. The title has meaning that goes beyond just this episode - it links Hunt's actions and decisions from earlier Mission: Impossible entries, including his marriage with Julia (Michelle Monaghan), his decision to temporarily quit the Mission Impossible Force, and his battle of wits with the villain of the very first film of the franchise. But thanks to Cruise, the star who has flamboyantly anchored the Mission: Impossible franchise since it kicked off the under the supervision of Brian De Palma in 1996, Fallout works as a film even if one were to ignore what has gone before. The central character wastes no time in swinging into action and plunging into situations that once again test his physical tenacity, courage and luck. The film itself is a breeze, as smooth a ride as any Hollywood action film of recent times. It gallops full throttle but allows occasional breathing spaces that serve the purpose of setting the stage for the big moments. It is not as if Mission: Impossible - Fallout does anything that is remotely off the beaten track. But even as it stays firmly within the parameters of the game as it has been played in the previous five films of the TV series-inspired franchise, it manages to create an air of creative freshness and excitement. Christopher McQuarrie, the only director to return for a second Mission: Impossible film, clearly has a way with action set pieces. The manner in which he spaces out the thrills demonstrates perfect judgment and the way he imparts urgency and pace to these scenes suggest a special flair for blockbuster action interspersed with intriguing reveals and red herrings. Fallout opens a couple of years adrift of the events of McQuarrie's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015). British secret agent-turned-anarchist Solomon Lane is still in custody since being captured by Hunt. However, the Syndicate formed by the criminal mastermind remains as active as ever. The more intransigent and impatient elements within the outfit have now spun themselves off into a more dangerous group called The Apostles and are plotting the acquisition of nuclear devices powerful enough to flatten the whole world. The Apostles, the audience is told early on through an unusual CNN newscast, plan to target the holiest places of the three Abrahamic religions - the Vatican, Mecca and Jerusalem. For Hunt and his trusted aides, field operative Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and tech-whiz Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames), it is another race against time to save humanity from annihilation. In Hunt's lexicon, 'humanity' of course pertains as much 'individuals' as to all of mankind. So, he thinks nothing of letting the three plutonium cores slip out of his grasp in an early sequence so as to ensure that one of his mates does not lose his life. This act of generosity is held against him and the CIA chief Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) deploys her sharpest assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt as he pursues the dangerous Lane and his associates. Sloane taunts the IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin): ""You use the scalpel, I prefer the hammer."" But nothing that Hunt indulges in from here on evokes scalpel strokes. He is into sledgehammer blows, which fit in pretty neatly with the film's sweep and ambition. Besides his ex-wife Julia, a medic he encounters in Turtuk, Leh, Hunt's path cross those of the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), who makes him a deal that he grabs with both hands, and his former ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), MI6 agent who is, for mysterious reasons, after the very objects that Hunt is hunting for. Fallout settles into a loopy rhythm that sucks the audience instantly into its orbit. The narrative scampers from one thing to another without running into complications and hindrances that could undermine the visceral hold the film establishes over the viewer. But it is also a rare action film that assumes a somewhat political skew - it talks about destroying the existing world order and starting afresh. From great suffering from come peace, says the arch-villain. Greater the suffering, greater the peace. The methods he proposes to use for achieving that end entails a huge deal of violence. Ethan Hunt, like James Bond but in ways that are diametrically different, is willing to go to any length to see that humanity triumphs. The intertwining of the political and the moral itself makes Fallout an action thriller of a completely unique timbre. The fact that it also delivers a vibrant, globe-straddling plot high points, these constitute the crux, makes it all the more exhilarating."
"Jul 9, 2020",positive," Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018) is the best entry into the Mission: Impossible series and is the best action film since Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Throughout this latest adventure, we hear super agent Ethan Hunt utter the phrase, “I won’t let you down.” While that plays as a crucial element in the plot, we can also examine it from the actor who delivers the line. Tom Cruise, at fifty six years young, seems to be talking directly at us – the audience – letting us know that he will give us exactly what we’re looking for: high octane action and death defying stunts. Cruise is one of the last movie stars of his kind, combining his immense screen presence with a keen understanding of how to entertain. He is the ultimate showman, able to adapt to changing times. Although he has had his fair share of duds, he never goes into a project without full commitment. Think about this: the Mission: Impossible series has gone on for over twenty years and is only getting better. Where many action stars fade the older they get, Cruise rushes forward, pushing the limit (both physically and mentally) for our enjoyment. But Fallout isn’t just the “Tom Cruise Show.” Here now is the emergence of Christopher McQuarrie as an elite action director. The previous entry, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) was great fun and had plenty of intrigue, but Fallout tops it with its set pieces, intricate plotting, and breathless pacing. The balance between practical effects and CGI is perfectly handled. To a larger degree is an emotional factor that catches us off guard. We get all the thrills that we expect and yet McQuarrie (who also wrote screenplay) sneaks in a character study that makes the material all the richer. The cinematography (Rob Hardy) is assured and confident. We see everything clearly, the framing allowing us to witness Cruise in full view of his numerous stunt work. Eddie Hamilton’s editing cuts between shots with clarity. At no point is there confusion in the geography of a set piece. Lorne Balfe’s score is pulse pounding, calling to mind the feel of a crime thriller. Breaking the episodic nature of the series, Fallout acts as a direct sequel to Rogue Nation. This time we see Ethan dealing with the moral dilemma of being an agent – whether or not its better to sacrifice one life if it means saving millions more. That idea has always existed in the background of the previous entries, but here is where it comes to full fruition. Ethan is a man who cannot fathom making the hard choice; he would rather sacrifice himself than see a single person perish. It’s that weakness that causes Ethan and his partners Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) to lose a case of plutonium into the hands of bad guys, putting many lives at risk. But that weakness is also Ethan’s greatest strength, motivating him to track down the plutonium with unrelenting obsession. Why does Ethan feel the need to go out on a limb even when the goal appears unreachable? The answer is the same with many other movie heroes: because he has to. Ethan saves lives because he must, and he does it like no one else. Along for the ride is CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) assigned to keep a watchful eye over Ethan and his team. There’s also the reappearance of the mysterious British agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), and Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) the villain of Rogue Nation who has returned with destruction and chaos on his mind. After an early expository scene, McQuarrie puts his foot on the gas and never lets up. Fallout constantly moves, even the quieter, character driven moments are designed with urgency. Ethan tackles his mission like a mad man, and Cruise tackles his role in the same vein. Cruise performs a HALO jump, goes on high speed chases in a truck, in a car, and on a motorcycle through the streets of Paris, engages in a brutal hand to hand fight inside of a nightclub bathroom – and this is all happens before he famously broke his ankle jumping from one rooftop to another (the shot is used in the movie). All throughout, McQuarrie makes the precise right decisions on how to depict the action. The bathroom fight scene is done with no music, allowing us to hear and feel every punch. The motorcycle chase is shot from three angles (in front of the bike, to the side, and from behind), ensuring that we can see Cruise is the one driving it, narrowly missing being smacked by a passing car. During a rescue operation, a character is stuck inside of a truck slowly submerging into the Seine river. The camera inside captures the rising water sideways like a growing wall coming to take its victim. McQuarrie’s biggest improvement as a director is by building the tension all the way up to the climax. In Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011) the key set piece always happened right in the middle of the plot, causing the third act to sink just a bit. That is not the case with Fallout, in which the final showdown is a spectacular feat of imagination, execution, and fearlessness. I dare not describe it to you and spoil the fun. Not enough can be said about Cruise’s fantastic performance. Not only in the physical sense (at one point he runs so hard that it looks like he’s about to take off) but also as a dynamic, fully developed character. To Ethan, every life matters. Occasionally, McQuarrie will bring the narrative to a standstill and focus in on Cruise’s face during a moment of emotional conflict, where he is faced with a decision he simply does not want to make. Every instance of this is effective, causing us to understand that Ethan is not a machine, but a flesh a blood person whose acts of violence against others leave a lasting effect. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the kind of movie that causes people to fall in love with movies. The craftsmanship is stellar, the performances are great, the action awe-inspiring, and the story deeply involving. Being a film fan means being in a constant search for an experience that puts us on the edge of our seats and grab the armrests with excitement. This delivers that in spades. As Cruise says, “I won’t let you down” – and he certainly didn’t."
"Jul 5, 2020",positive,"You'll be witness to incredible helicopter chases, savage fistfights and peak adrenaline. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jul 1, 2020",positive," I walked out of Mission: Impossible—Fallout (2018) still trying to catch my breath from the 147 minutes of near-relentless action. After an afternoon of thought, I had a review outlined in my head, ready to write up the next day. And then, while I slept the sleep of the just, Brian Tallerico went ahead and published a review that says most of what I wanted to say, but much, much better. In sum, this film is elevated action. Believe the hype—all of it. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie doesn’t mess around; we come to action films for action, and McQuarrie doesn’t subordinate the other filmic elements to the action, he carefully molds the action to incorporate other elements into a flowing, organic whole: character, theme, location (that shot of the Arc de Triomphe!). The fight scenes are shot and edited to achieve complete viewer-identification with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), especially one scene that comes off as a quieter, more coherent, and more exciting version of the casino fight scene in Black Panther (2018). There’re also a couple of callbacks to the Henry Cavill of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) during the Paris chase sequence. Speaking of the Paris chase sequence, did you know that the Cruise of every shot in the foot chase had an ankle that had yet to fully heal? You can read about that, the 106 HALO jumps, and a truckload of other insanity in this piece about the stunts. Having said all that, I was surprised to find good acting (see this penetrating piece by David Ehrlich) and a ludicrously complex but logical and thematically resonant plot. The film is about Hunt trying to make up for a failed mission and having to choose the lesser of two evils at every turn. He tries to make good choices, but everything just keeps biting him in the ass. The refrain of the film, “We’re working on it [a plan],” alludes to Hunt’s greatest strength and weakness: relying on skill and resources over forethought. The film portrays itself as a conflict between saving the many (Angela Bassett’s CIA Director Erica Sloane) and saving the near (Alec Baldwin’s IMF Secretary Alan Hunley), but the more accurate conflict is between chess and D&D. In the end, the film (barely) agrees with Helmuth von Moltke: “No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.”"

"Nov 11, 2019",positive," It is strange to think that this film franchise, a reboot of a 1960s TV series starring Martin Landau and Barbara Bach, is 22 years old this year. However, after five films and a global gross of more than $2.6bn, Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in the latest instalment of the Mission: Impossible franchise with  Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation‘s Christopher McQuarrie back in the director’s chair. Mission: Impossible – Fallout sees Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team try and prevent a nuclear threat from escapee Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) while being under the watchful eye of CIA agent Walker (Henry Cavill). What McQuarrie does in this sixth instalment is to integrate a comfort zone – with Pegg, Ferguson and Rhames back as Hunt’s associates, there is a familiarity and camaraderie that highlight the fact that his professional attachments are now stemming into the personal. In a way, it reminds audiences that IMF is more than a job to Hunt – it is his family. Given the traumatic events in the first film all those years ago, we finally see the emotional effects the job has on Hunt and the importance of what he has turned his back on – a normal life. At 56 years old, Cruise shows he has the strength to take on such a physical role. Taking on more death-defying stunts that easily surpass the previous MI films, including one that caused a notable foot injury, he reminds audiences why he is one of Hollywood’s leading men. Although the new boy in the franchise, Cavill is great as CIA agent Walker, whose physicality and detached demeanour makes a perfect foil for Hunt. Pegg and Rhames provide the occasional comic relief, while Ferguson and Kirby deliver cool and collected performances. Even though this is his fourth feature film, Fallout shows McQuarrie’s confidence as a filmmaker. Despite the occasional uneven pacing, he incorporates plenty of twists and turns that allow the recent Syndicate narrative to come full circle. In addition, Rob Hardy’s stunning cinematography makes each scene incredibly sharp. Combined with exciting sequences such as adrenaline-fuelled motorcycle chases to one of the best bathroom fights in recent cinema, Fallout is easily one of the most thrilling action films this year. Easily exceeding its predecessors in terms of action, story, visuals and direction, Mission: Impossible – Fallout shows that there is still life in the franchise and with McQuarrie at the helm, the future looks bright."

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. What started in 1996 as a film adaptation of a late 1960s TV series gradually turned into one of the highest grossing film franchises of all time. As one who tends to avoid the violence and glamour of action spy films, I chose to sit out the M:I series for most of my life. I didn’t expect too much upon seeing Mission: Impossible – Fallout. To an extent, I got what I asked for. There’s explosions, gunshots, and literal cliffhangers, but with solid characters and a good story, the film left me constantly guessing where the plot would go next. Tom Cruise returns in the sixth installment of the “M:I” series as Ethan Hunt, an agent with the “Impossible Missions Force” who’s tasked with saving the world from nuclear-armed terrorists. Like Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan, he’s another American answer to James Bond. At the same time, Hunt is clearly weathered from years of the same old mission. Where he once tried to settle down and have a normal life, we learn that his absence from the world scene has made it a more dangerous place. His latest mission involves the recovery of three plutonium cores which have fallen into the hands of the international terror group, known as the “Syndicate.” Once his mission becomes compromised, he is forced to make a decision between rescuing his colleague, Luther Stickell (played by the ever-wonderful Ving Rhames) and accomplishing the mission. He chooses the former, rescuing his friend, and winds up losing the plutonium cores. While his colleague lives to see another day, Hunt’s decision results in the plutonium falling further and further into the wrong hands. As he begins his quest to find the plutonium, old friends and foes emerge from Hunt’s past, forcing him to decide which is more important – the fate of his loved ones or the fate of the world. The story almost has a Goldeneye feel to it. The protagonist is a borderline rogue agent willing to bend the rules in order to accomplish the mission. Unlike Bond, though, Hunt has more humanity in that he’s willing to put the lives of others before the success of a mission. Cruise gives a solid performance as the personally compromised Ethan Hunt. I never once lost interest in him and was able to bond with the character from the start.  The remaining ensemble give stellar performances as well. Usually, apart from the protagonist, we have plenty of throw-away characters replete with one-liners and slapstick gags in vain attempts to provide comic relief, often failing. We don’t get that with this one. They pop up every now and then, but only when necessary. Every actor does his or her part with their given character, who have their own strengths and weaknesses in the story. Plus, the film also stars Angela Bassett – always one to give your film an extra IQ point. Granted, M:I – Fallout does have its weaknesses, the run-time (2 hours and 28 minutes) serving up the biggest one. While we have a compelling plot with thrilling moments, it does tend to drag towards the end. We’re all on the edge of our seats, which is fine, but when the climax keeps going and going, the suspense tends to dull the senses. But hey, at least the movie kept me in my seat until the credits (unlike, say, Valerian), and I don’t mind being stuck on a rollercoaster, so long as I know the cars are moving closer to the edge. Is this the best action film in the world? No. Is it the best in the M:I series? Probably, probably not. I’ll let the fans decide on that one. For me, it gets a passing grade. It could have been chopped down by 20-minutes, but even then, it never loses its audience – and that’s what you must shoot for when telling a story.

"Oct 17, 2019",positive," It would seem impossible, but the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise keeps getting better and better. For 22 years now, Paramount Pictures has produced one excellent action film after another in this series, and the latest entry may be their best actioner yet. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” delivers the most thrills, the highest level of tension, and the greatest number of “How the hell did they do that?” action sequences of any of the “M: I” films so far. As if that’s not miraculous enough, its leading man is the 56-year-old Tom Cruise and he’s still giving this series his absolute all. He runs, jumps, hangs from the rafters and performs one amazing stunt after another. Impossible? Incredible. In this outing, Cruise’s spy character Ethan Hunt spearheads one of the Impossible Mission Force’s most dangerous assignments. A terrorist organization called “The Apostles” is threatening nuclear proliferation if their anarchist leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is not released pronto. The Apostles will return the three stolen plutonium warhead cores they’ve stolen upon his safe return. Hunt’s team, including venerable supporting players Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), arrange a go-between to get their hands on the warhead cores first, but they’re double-crossed at the exchange by an unknown player. The nukes are now loose while IMF team licks their wounds, and that inspires CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) to send in one of her own to chaperone the IMF team’s rescue mission. Hunt doesn’t like being babysat, especially from a macho thug like CIA agent Walker (Henry Cavill, in that serious mustache you’ve heard so much about.) The two Alpha Males don’t trust each other, and their conflict makes for truly delicious tension in every single scene they have together. Nonetheless, they must find a way to bond for the sake of the mission, and soon Hunt is posing as an arms dealer to sidle up to a black marketer named White Widow with Walker in tow. The Widow is played with coy charisma by Vanessa Kirby from “The Crown” and she still has her regal bearings even though she’s playing a crook here. Adding further complications to the rescue mission are the plethora of thugs that the White Widow employs, and they don’t trust Hunt et al. either. Making a perfect storm is the inclusion of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), their MI-6 counterpart from the last movie. She shows up with a vendetta against terrorist Lane and Hunt doesn’t know if she can be trusted. Is she on the allies’ side or has she gone rogue? What’s Walker’s real role in the mission? And what angle is Alec Baldwin’s Hunley playing, especially since he was CIA in the last film before taking over the IMF? All these untrustworthy characters trying to work together makes for exciting, tense, and drolly funny interplay. This outing is almost as entertaining while they’re all standing around arguing as it is when they are running around and saving the world. However, the set pieces are truly a cut above the quality one finds even in this fantastic franchise. In fact, in set piece after exciting set piece, audiences will be blown away by how adroitly conceived and choreographed they all are. They’re complex, take place in busy locations, and deliver maximum thrills throughout.  A fist fight in a nightclub bathroom turns into a bare-knuckled brawl that would make John Wick envious. A rooftop chase turns into a thrilling obstacle course for Hunt, rendered all the more impressive by its use of London locales and Cruise’s acrobatic leaps and bounds. And an extended car chase through the streets of Paris is as amazing for all its different twists and turns on the streets as it is in the cat and mouse plotting with players turning against each other on a dime. (I’m sorry, Franc.) Yet, the best is saved for the last 30 minutes when McQuarrie literally employs a ticking clock and sets up an actual cliffhanger for his story’s climax. Again, most of what we’re watching onscreen occurs in real locations, not in make-believe green screens filmed in a contained studio. This all looks incredibly real, and most of it definitely is. That includes Cruise doing things like climbing up a rope hundreds of feet above the ground to hijack a flying helicopter. Granted, he’s probably supported by wires that have been taken out in post, but he’s still hovering way above the landscape. Few stars would ever endeavor to do something so dangerous, but it makes this franchise all the more fun because its leading man relishes such challenges. In a summer that has seen too many sequels already, this one stands out from the crowd as its crown jewel. We may be six films in, but if they’re going to be as continually terrific as this, the action franchise should go on and on, even without the aging Cruise in the lead. That probably won’t be any time soon though, especially if he can still show the moves he demonstrates so ably in this one. There’s no slowing him down, or this superior franchise, for that matter.  Jeff York has been writing film criticism online since 2011.

"Sep 2, 2019",neutral," Mission: Impossible – Fallout had the best opening weekend of the entire series with $61.2 million (and another $94.6 million overseas). This is the film Tom Cruise broke his ankle on and the film Henry Cavill just had to have a mustache for that made those re-shoots for Justice League have such disastrous results. The sequel has a whopping 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 Metascore on Metacritic. Critics and the general movie-going audience emphatically and enthusiastically adore this film and personally it doesn’t register why the Mission: Impossible franchise is so cherished by movie lovers. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, Sean Harris as villain Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust all return from Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation; this is the first film where a director and a villain have returned from a previous film. The technical aspects of the film are the easiest to admire and the action sequences are outstandingly breathtaking. The big action sequences include the parachute/free fall sequence with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and August Walker (Henry Cavill), the bathroom brawl with Hunt, Walker, and John Lark, Hunt’s motorcycle chase, Hunt running and jumping across rooftops, and the insane helicopter chase. It’s ridiculous (in a good way) how much room cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) gives each sequence; these are scenes made for seeing and experiencing in IMAX. You can tell that the majority of the stunts were pulled off practically and green screens and computer generated effects are utilized minimally. The most impressive sequence is the motorcycle chase because Tom Cruise races through the wrong side of traffic without a helmet in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. But the helicopter chase features Cruise climbing up a rope dangling in the air while the helicopter is airborne. These sequences are extremely open with perspectives that not only make you feel like you’re with Tom Cruise being just as nuts and exhilarating as he is, but also seem to be making the statement that Cruise is still crazy enough to do the majority of his own stunts at the age of 56 despite his saggy jowls. Many on social media were claiming that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is nonstop action over its nearly 150-minute runtime, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The film seems to be attempting this never ending adrenaline rush found within the likes of films like Mad Max: Fury Road and Speed, but it fails to do so. The action is superb, but everything in between is extraordinarily dull. Missing the first and third films in the franchise may have contributed to that, but there’s not much to miss here if you haven’t seen the other films in the franchise. Hunt obviously still cares about his ex-wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), but currently has a connection with Ilsa Faust. The spy element of the sequel feels so cliché and predictable as every twist and big reveal can easily be predicted even if this is your first Mission: Impossible film. The inclusion of a bomb in a Mission: Impossible film feels explosively juvenile at this point and you legitimately have no investment in these characters whatsoever. With every Mission: Impossible film that’s released, it seems like its main purpose is for Tom Cruise to be like Mad TV’s Stuart and yell, “Look what I can do!” before partaking in extracurricular activities a man in his fifties should probably be distancing himself from. To be fair, Cruise is still more than capable of doing incredible action films and is generally a part of films that aim to be exciting for everyone. Fallout is extraordinary if you scrutinize without any sort of context. The film knows how to make your pulse race and your palms sweat as you gasp for breath. But the story is the same as any other Mission: Impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes. There’s no substance here and impressive action doesn’t make up for a defused storyline."

"Aug 22, 2019",positive,"[Fallout] has a star who takes the risks...that, until someone gets really hurt, create an experience unlike any other. [July 28, 2018]"
"Aug 14, 2019",positive,"It all seems so impossible, but Cruise is impressive and so is this film. It's exhausting as much as it is smart and entertaining."
"Aug 2, 2019",positive," Over the course of six movies, Mission: Impossible has basically turned into the franchise where Tom Cruise does crazy stunts. Fallout, the newest entry, is no exception—and I’d have it no other way. Christopher McQuarrie—he wrote and directed this film as well as its predecessor Rogue Nation—seems to have cracked the code to this long-running franchise. In Fallout, the story is negligible. There’s enough plot to keep the momentum and the twists keep it engaging. McQuarrie seems to be the perfect match to star Tom Cruise‘s unique take on action. The difference between the action in this movie and the action in the equally audacious Fast & Furious franchise is that in Fallout, McQuarrie captures the action in a clean and economical way. It’s the reason Mad Max: Fury Road was so successful. Every action set piece has a narrative pulse whether it be a two on one brawl in a bathroom or an epic car chase through the streets of Paris or a HALO jump from an airplane—the best scene in the film and possibly of the year. In Fallout, we begin, as always, with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) receiving his mission, should he choose to accept it. He is tasked with retrieving three plutonium cores that can be easily turned into nuclear bombs that can reek destruction on any city that the holder chooses. In this case, the holder is a group dubbed “The Apostles,” a terrorist organization born out of the remains of “The Syndicate.” Refreshingly, that main plot, which is set up breezily in the cold open—it features an amusing cameo by Wolf Blitzer—is the goal for the entire film. Unlike the Bond films or Bourne films which have twisting plots that end up somewhere different than where they started, Fallout stays focused. “The Apostles” want to use the bombs to create a new world order by inflicting the maximum pain on the planet. As they say, “the greater the pain, the greater the peace.” Ethan’s search—he’s aided by a skeleton crew consisting of Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (the consummate steady hand Ving Rhames)—leads him to Paris where an arms dealer known as White Widow (Vanessa Kirby is a clear standout in the role) is allegedly selling the cores to a man called John Lark, who wants to carry out “The Apostles'” agenda. However, before going to Paris, CIA director Erica Sloane (a deliciously headstrong Angela Bassett) forces Ethan to take along August Walker (Henry Cavill sporting the infamous mustache) as a failsafe. From there, Fallout puts out some of the most impressive and thrilling action sequences ever committed to film. However, every action set piece has a purpose. The HALO jump adeptly sets up Hunt’s moral center and juxtaposes against Wilson’s more brash tactics. The scene, which is devoid of composer Lorne Balfe’s (The Florida Project) impressive score, is breathtaking. McQuarrie gives every moment and action weight. As the pair tumble towards the Earth, you feel the stakes of what is happening, even if you know everything is going to come out fine. Every set piece is infused with those stakes. At one point, an armored truck carrying former leader of “The Syndicate” Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is rammed into a river. Instead of the truck slowly filling with water, which would throw off the rhythm of the scene, an intense and literal wall of water swallows Lane. The camera is attached to the truck to give the illusion that the water, not the truck is rotating. It’s that kind of innovative filmmaking that makes Fallout a bold practice in the action movie genre. Tom Cruise is infamous for concocting crazier and crazier stunts that he performs himself. While it seemed like a publicity ploy, Mission: Impossible — Fallout makes it clear why he’s been indispensable until now. His screen presence is irreplaceable specifically when he is performing action. Now that he’s found a director that knows how to capture them, the Mission: Impossible franchise has found new life. Don’t let us down Ethan. That is your mission, should you choose to accept it. Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut.

"Jul 13, 2019",positive," A lo largo de los 22 años que han pasado desde que Brian de Palma estrenase la primera y maravillosa 'Misión: Imposible', la que sin duda es una de las mejores y más sólidas sagas cinematográficas de la historia ha evolucionado muy positivamente a través de unas secuelas que han exprimido todo el potencial del material base; rizando el rizo hasta un punto en el que parece no haber cabida para la innovación o nuevas vueltas de tuerca. Bajo este poco halagüeño panorama, Christopher McQuarrie se ha puesto de nuevo tras las cámaras al frente de la franquicia tras la notable 'Nación secreta' haciendo lo único que podía hacer para mantener viva —y de qué manera— la llama: subir las apuestas existentes a un nuevo nivel tomando como base un acertado ""cuanto más grande, mejor"". Una premisa que ha dado como resultado una descomunal y electrizante 'Misión: Imposible - Fallout' que se eleva como el mejor blockbuster de la temporada y una de las mejores cintas de acción de los últimos tiempos. 'Misión: Imposible - Fallout' da forma a lo largo de sus fugaces dos horas y media de metraje a la mejor entrega de la serie desde que se estrenase la cinta original en 1996. Un logro que consigue, en parte, gracias su magnífico equilibrio tonal y narrativo y, por encima de todo, al respetar a pies juntillas las señas de identidad que han hecho grandes las aventuras de Ethan Hunt y compañía, aportando un plus de espectacularidad a la fórmula preestablecida.  Una de estas marcas de la casa radica, como no podría ser de otro modo, en sus espléndidas set pieces. Unas escenas de acción que siempre han mantenido índices de calidad abrumadores, casi impensables, y que en 'Fallout' tocan techo en una frenética orgía de caos, muerte y destrucción que bien merece sus comparativas con 'Mad Max: Furia en la carretera' —aún imbatible en su terreno— por lo artesanal y preciso del inigualable show que brinda al patio de butacas. De este modo, Christopher McQuarrie hace una exhibición de músculo y dominio del lenguaje cinematográfico envidiables; sucediendo en la pantalla tiroteos, peleas cuerpo a cuerpo, persecuciones sobre cuatro y dos ruedas —antológica la secuencia de conducción en París, capaz de sonrojar a la mismísima 'Ronin'— e incluso aéreas con un ritmo óptimo e incansable. Algo que se traduce en un visionado marcado por las mandíbulas desencajadas durante el que es harto complicado reprimir gestos de estupefacción y risas nerviosas fruto del asombro. La otra gran clave que hace de 'Fallout' un blockbuster ejemplar —por no decir soñado— es su igualmente notable guión, escrito por el propio McQuarrie y poseedor de todo el espíritu que sentó cátedra en el filme de De Palma con su enrevesada trama de espionaje heredada por sus cinco sucesoras. Un auténtico festival del giro con dobles juegos, topos, sorpresas y un argumento demencial, excesivamente retorcido pero plenamente satisfactorio, que cohesiona elementos de anteriores entregas con inteligencia.  Pero más allá del aluvión de plot-twists —hay escenas en los que se suceden a pares, para deleite del respetable—, es muy de agradecer el mimo con el que el libreto trata a sus arquetípicos personajes; especialmente a la figura de Ethan Hunt. McQuarrie dota de cierta profundidad al espía, indagando en los rincones más oscuros de su psique, en los entresijos de su duro oficio y en los efectos que este tiene sobre su día a día y sus relaciones personales. Si el abanico de protagonistas y secundarios brilla sobre el papel, estos destacan de igual modo personificados por un reparto entregado al cien por cien a la causa. Mientras los nuevos fichajes cumplen con creces su función —mención especial para un Henry Cavill que exuda carisma—, los veteranos, con sus papeles completamente interiorizados, se muestran en su salsa; destacando como es obvio un Tom Cruise que se gana cada centavo de su salario como el mejor efecto especial que podría contratarse en una producción de este corte.  Lejos de mostrar los claros signos de agotamiento que otras sagas cinematográficas dejan entrever tras, en algunos casos, un par de secuelas, 'Misión: Imposible' no sólo continúa en plena forma, sino que mantiene su racha ascendente en términos de calidad y diversión gracias a una 'Fallout' sencillamente ejemplar. De seguir con esta tónica, sólo queda esperar que la mecha la mecha que alimenta la franquicia no se apague en mucho, mucho tiempo."
"Jul 12, 2019",positive," Dejando aparte 'Misión: Imposible 2', la franquicia protagonizada por Tom Cruise e inspirada en la clásica serie de televisión de espionaje de los sesenta tiene una excelente fama. Las demás entregas (incluida la aclamada última parte) están consideradas piezas más o menos clave del blockbuster moderno: precisas, impecablemente realizadas, con sus gotas de autoría y además, capaces de transmitir la idea de una identidad común, y que con cada nueva entrega se consigue forzar la máquina de su narrativa en inesperadas y excitantes direcciones. Sin embargo, y pese a que es quizás la pieza más irregular del implacable engranaje de la franquicia, ''Misión: Imposible 2' es una película arrebatadora, de un romanticismo ingenuo y tremendo y cuyo gran problema, quizás, es que no encaja con el resto de la serie. Como si la idea vectora de los dos primeros episodios hubiera consistido en un concepto de ""Películas completamente independientes entre sí y con un marcado sello autoral"", y luego esa idea se hubiera desechado en favor de un estilo más homogéneo. Porque lo que es indiscutible de 'Misión: Imposible 2' es que estamos ante una obra de autor: se le podrán echar en cara muchas cosas, pero desde luego está claro que es una película de John Woo, en parte temáticamente -en ese aspecto estaba más atado de manos, claro-, pero desde luego, sin duda, estéticamente. Desde tics específicos -los disparos a dos manos, las palomas- hasta la apabullante planificación o el enfrentamiento final, que parece directamente salido de una película oriental de acción de los ochenta. Lo que posiblemente distancia de 'Misión: Imposible 2' a buena parte del público potencial es su abierta concepción de la trama de espionaje y sus tópicos (el robo, el romance, la némesis, los engaños, las traiciones) como un melodrama, y por tanto, como una ficción en la que todo está fuera de sí. Eso implica personajes esquemáticos, pasiones inflamadas hasta la caricatura, guiños filogays que no vienen a cuento, renuncia a cualquier tipo de realismo... y también acción operística, colorista, hipercoreografiada y enloquecida. Sin embargo, no es como si no supiéramos a lo que veníamos: John Woo llevaba desde mediados de los ochenta rubricando películas muy similares en Hong Kong. La sofisticación argumental de 'The Killer' o 'Una bala en la cabeza' no se repite aquí, pero los romances propios de culebrón y las frases salidas de una fotonovela casposa eran previsibles: Woo siempre ha sido, con más o menos medios a su disposición, un devoto del romanticismo de andar por casa.  Lo que sí podemos, sin duda, es establecer una clara progresión en la trilogía de películas imprescindibles de Woo en Estados Unidos 'Blanco humano' (20 millones de dólares de presupuesto), 'Cara a cara' (80) y esta (125): cuanto más dinero a su disposición, más descontroladas e irregulares son sus películas. De la concisión y contundencia absoluta de 'Blanco humano', una de sus obras capitales, pasamos a la memorable epopeya protagonizada por Cage y Travolta, ya con notorios altibajos de ritmo. Y de ahí a 'M:I 2', una producción plagada de momentos increíbles, pero a la que traiciona su exceso de ambición y medios. Está claro que tiene mucho de Woo pero... ¿qué tiene 'Misión: Imposible 2' de 'Misión: Imposible'? Con las constantes de la franquicia no tan afianzadas como ahora, la película reorienta algo el enfoque de la primera, y plantea una misión para Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) que se tropieza con ciertas dificultades (el amor, cómo no), pero en un contexto que no deja de ser una misión, con su principio y final. En ese sentido, es distinta al resto de la serie, donde el equipo de IMF se ve continuamente abandonado, traicionado, perseguido por los suyos y obligado a operar en la sombra o la clandestinidad. Aquí no: de hecho por momentos la película parece más una entrega de la franquicia Bond que de 'Misión: Imposible'. Hunt está de vacaciones pero se le encarga la misión de recuperar un peligroso virus con la ayuda de una ladrona profesional (Thandie Newton), para impedir que un antiguo agente de la MIF que habitualmente suplantaba a Hunt en diversas misiones (Dougray Scott) comercie con el virus. Es decir, una misión más, que Hunt afronta con su habitual savoir faire, pero más en solitario que de costumbre: quizás es la película de la serie donde el concepto de ""equipo"" es más meramente cosmético. Hunt es un superespía y da la impresión de que puede solventar la situación en solitario. Precisamente por tener un director de fuerte personalidad detrás (quizás la que más en toda la saga, junto al soberbio De Palma de la primera entrega) y por no tener tan establecidas unas marcas argumentales y estéticas que seguir, 'MI:2' es la película más libre de la franquicia. Por ejemplo, coge uno de los iconos de la serie, las máscaras, y las convierte en un delirio sin ninguna credibilidad (¿de dónde salen? ¿Hunt lleva en el bolsillo caretas de todos los secundarios de la película?), pero que encajan perfectamente con ideas sobre la dualidad héroe-villano que Woo había desarrollado en 'Cara a cara' (¡con rostros de quita y pon, como caretas de 'Misión: Imposible'!)... y también en su cine en Hong Kong, con sus argumentos de policías-criminales, asesinos con honor e invidentes que confunden héroes y villanos. Woo lleva esa propuesta hasta el extremo haciendo que en el climax, Hunt y su némesis vistan igual, haciéndolos indistinguibles en la persecución final. Todos estos rasgos de autor no tendrían importancia si no estuviéramos ante una auténtica maravilla visual, rodada y montada con un estilo y una claridad expositiva que deberían ser la norma y no la excepción: esos leves zooms para reencuadrar la acción, esa atención al detalle en las mecánicas de los vehículos (en la persecución de las motos hay planos de ruedas derrapando, manos pulsando frenos, pequeños detalles sobre la conducción que entroncan espiritualmente con el mucho más físico y violento cine de carretera de los setenta). Woo no confunde frenesí con confusión y por eso no hay mejores coreografías en la saga que las suyas de persecuciones automovilísticas. Lo mismo pasa con los tiroteos: la secuencia del atraco está claramente inspirada en el mítico robo de la primera entrega, a veces muy descaradamente, pero es un ejemplo de libro de cómo narrar a través de la acción. Empieza con Hunt intentando robar el virus, pero después de la incursión de los villanos, tiroteos, conversaciones a gritos, decisiones dramáticas y juramentos de amor eterno, los personajes evolucionan, el argumento progresa y la situación de salida es radicalmente distinta a la de entrada. Es decir, todo lo que debería ser una secuencia de ejemplar de este tipo.  Y sí, no vamos a dejar de hablar del elefante en la habitación: la famosa referencia a la cultura española, con Antony Hopkins diciendo que los españoles queman a sus santos, en espectacular cacao conceptual que mezcla Andalucía y fallas valencianas. Dejémoslo en que es lo más parecido a que alguien señale a la luna y nos quedemos mirando el dedo: sería tan ridículo como que los herederos de John Huston tomaran cartas contra nosotros por haber rodado 'Condemor'.  No solo eso, sino que Woo aprovecha los elegantes movimientos del flamenco para rubricar una persecución automovilística con dos coches enzarzándose en un baile que convierte una carretera en un tablao y que es todo arrebatamiento, poesía sobre ruedas y, de nuevo, una lección magistral sobre cómo contar cosas sobre los personajes a base de derrapes, volantazos y acantilados. Así que por lo que a nosotros respecta, esta apropiación cultural queda más que disculpada. Lo curioso de todo ello es constatar que, si nos ponemos estrictos, toda esta pasión culebronera le pasa factura a Woo con un ritmo irregular y una credibilidad bajo mínimos (hay gente que piensa que el resto de la franquicia es cine de espías realista, pero eso ya lo dejamos para otro capítulo). Pero por encima de todo ello hay unas escenas de acción rotundas y extraordinariamente rodadas, con un gusto y una versatilidad que se echa de menos en producciones más bombásticas y taquilleras como las 'Fast & Furious'. Una rareza, en cualquier caso, a la que vale la pena volver ahora que la franquicia se ha convertido en una marca fiable pero sin estridencias."
"Jul 12, 2019",positive," ‘Misión: Imposible’ ha sido durante mucho tiempo la única franquicia de Tom Cruise, aunque el actor ha relajado eso durante los últimos años con las secuelas de ‘Jack Reacher’ y ‘Top Gun’. No obstante, Ethan Hunt es el personaje que mejor refleja sus posibilidades como héroe de acción y además nunca tuvo problemas en dejar que los directores de las diferentes entregas llevasen el material a su terreno. Por mi parte, creo que la saga tocó techo con la cuarta aventura de Hunt, pero la quinta entrega demostró que seguía en forma pese a que echase en falta un mayor empuje en la puesta en escena por parte de Christopher McQuarrie. Ahora se convierte en el primer realizador que repite en este universo con ‘Misión: Imposible – Fallout’, en la cual potencia más la acción respecto a su predecesora pero a cambio muestra más debilidades en su guion. Uno de los detalles más llamativos de ‘Misión: Imposible – Fallout’ es que es la primera secuela directa de la franquicia hasta ahora. Todas las anteriores entregas eran aventuras en la que todo quedaba zanjado, pero McQuarrie ha optado por dar una unión clara entre ‘Misión: Imposible – Nación Secreta’ y la que ahora nos ocupa, una idea muy estimulante sobre el papel pero que a la hora de la versas se ha saldado con resultados un tanto irregulares. El primer detalle llamativo del guion es que McQuarrie tiene algo menos de libertad para definir la película de forma individual, contando con un número limitado de personajes, algo esencial para que ciertas sorpresas del libreto se vean venir de lejos. Quieras que no, eso resta emoción a la aventura cuando las cosas se calman e incluso daña algún momento de mayor intensidad dramática. Es ahí donde se empiezan a ver las costuras a la fórmula de la saga, algo más o menos tapado hasta entonces por los sucesivos cambios de estilo de cada director que iba dejando su sello. Ya en ‘Nación secreta’ fue donde menos noté ese punto, pero hasta cierto punto eso seguía siendo algo diferente en la franquicia. Aquí eso no sucede y los trucos del libreto de McQuarrie resultan más obvios de lo deseable, aunque no tarda en dar con la tecla para que eso nunca llegue a resultar demasiado molesto. Considero que las comparaciones con ‘Mad Max: Furia en la carretera’ son un tanto exageradas, ya que ‘Misión: Imposible – Fallout’ tienes muchos más momentos de calma para desarrollar la historia y que todo respire. Sin embargo, McQuarrie sí que eleva considerablemente las dosis de acción y demuestra una solvencia pocas veces vista en el género durante los últimos años -aunque eso no le da para igualar el impresionante segmento de Dubai de la cuarta entrega, aún hoy la mejor-, algo a lo que ayuda mucho la implicación de Cruise en las escenas más arriesgadas. Últimamente estamos demasiado acostumbrados a que los rápidos cambios de plano en el montaje disimulen coreografías cuestionables, pero aquí todo es muy limpio, algo que atrapa al espectador, sobre todo a medida que la sensación de montaña rusa va acentuándose. De esta forma, incluso lo que en sí mismo consideraríamos locuras o fantasmadas funciona de maravilla, sobre todo volver a ver Hunt corriendo sin que nada pueda pararle o ese “combate” entre helicópteros. Eso no quita para que McQuarrie también incida algo en la ya algo avanzada edad de Cruise. Es asombroso que sea capaz de hacer lo que hace a estas alturas de su vida, pero tampoco es un superhombre que pueda con todo y ahí aparecen en determinados momentos Rebecca Ferguson y un inspirado Henry Cavill para recordárnoslo. Con todo, él sigue siendo la estrella y no seré yo el que se oponga mientras siga dándolo todo en personajes que encajen con él -lo de ‘La momia’ sí que fue un tanto risible’-. En definitiva, ‘Misión Imposible – Fallout’ es una buena película de acción y una nueva aventura de Ethan Hunt que no desmerece dentro de la saga pese a que el guion presente ciertos problemas. A cambio las escenas de acción son impecables y numerosas, lo cual ayuda a que su extenso metraje se pase volando. Me vale."

    It’s on for the relatively young and old in the sixth M.I. go-round, with Cruise, Rhames, Pegg, Harris, Ferguson and Baldwin back on deck, Cavill joining the ranks as an
    agenda-heavy CIA agent and Christopher McQuarrie taking the reins once more after 2015’s Rogue Nation. Conspicuously MIA are three plutonium cores, stolen by terrorists for their
    usual nefarious reasons. Having bungled their retrieval, Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise. Of course!) and his amiable IMF offsiders Benji and Luther (Pegg and Rhames) are now
    tasked with getting them back. Which brings us all to Paris and the bonkers, boundary-smashing stunt work that pretty much the entire world knows T.Cruise actually does in the
    exhausting—and yet so fun to watch!—service of saving mankind.
 
    Because oh, what beauties those stunts are, with a smashing HALO (High Altitude Low Impact) plane jump into the City of Light to blast them off and the
    fanciest of motorcycle and auto footwork on the ground. Plus, the man runs. And runs. And then runs some more, despite an actual broken ankle. That alone is something to see, even before his
    spectacular, climactic chopper action in Kashmir.
 
    When not tearing it up in Ninja Warrior mode, the mood of the lavish production is a nice balance of purposeful to sombre. Everyone involved takes the business of monkey very seriously indeed,
    not least a careworn Ethan, who while still fighting fit plainly carries the shadow of a life hard-lived. As well he should, for in essence the burden of duty is what the showboating is all
    about. The so-called impossible is always a trial by fire and no matter how fast you sprint, that heat has eventually got to hurt.

"Jun 18, 2019",positive," To ask the question on everyone’s mind: Are we really supposed to care about a new Mission Impossible movie without the return of Jeremy Renner as everyone’s favorite character, um, I want to say…Hawkeye? Renner jokes aside, although everyone should always stop to make those, the most ridiculous stunt involving this series is that it has somehow existed for 22 years. Understandably, that longevity has bought the latest film, Mission Impossible: Fallout, some measure of forgiveness for its hubris in assuming we actually retain plot points after these films are over. Self-important and impossibly troubling to anyone who remembers how Tom Cruise has (allegedly) treated women in real life, Fallout is ultimately a pretty fun watch, even if it does feel like an uncomfortably long passionate kiss slurped on the lips of practical stuntwork. Despite a distinct lack of tinkering or tailoring, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie’s LeCarre ambitions bloat what should have been a kinetic MacGuffin chase. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is tracking down three plutonium shotputs before bad guys can nuke stuff with them. Somehow that singular sentence is stretched into 150 minutes, the best of which see Henry Cavill, a punchable meatsack, getting walloped in his infamous mustache. Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) are back to soak up more screen time without offering a single modicum of actual character. Over the course of a half-dozen movies, all we know is that Luther often wears hats and Benji is almost funny sometimes. The series has become this monolithic memorial to the integrity and sacrifice of Ethan Hunt, who is a lucky idiot that makes bad choices like that was his real accepted mission. Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns from the last film and immediately betrays her country and her own well-being because she is powerless before Ethan’s puffy-faced running. The love of Ethan’s life, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), whom he abandoned because his boner belongs to freedom before all else, appears to seemingly reassure audiences that her life as a woman only has meaning through Ethan’s context. Thankfully, the execution of preposterous stunts is feverishly meticulous, with layered components that feel like glorious Rube Goldberg machines of death. Have you seen two helicopters slap-fight before? What about fisticuffs that use bathroom plumbing parts as deadly weapons? In all seriousness, Fallout could have been a silent film and been legitimately better than the version that exists with “Oops! All Berries!” amounts of exposition. To the franchise’s credit, it appears they are setting Angela Bassett up as Ethan’s new handler, they have wisely figured out how using a recurring bad guy saves hand-wringing villain origin screen time and the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is exactly the sort of minor player that could help make Mission Impossible’s next 22 years more fun. Just please remember in the future that when your target demo is men who are likely keeping an eye on their prostatic lab work, maybe pare things down until it’s just the “oohs,” “ahs” and “oh nos?”"
"Jun 3, 2019",positive,"This is top-tier action filmmaking, the kind of no-holds-barred, balls-to-the-wall extravaganza that manages to root its spectacle in actual human emotion."
"May 26, 2019",positive," Although the usual media blitz associated with a Tom Cruise vehicle is in full swing, much of the attention is understandably focusing on the real-life injury that made it into the final cut of Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the sixth installment in the 22-year old franchise. Such an on-set injury not only gets people talking, but Cruise’s passion is on full display in his dedication to giving the audience what they want, even at his own expense. And thank goodness. Tom Cruise is nuts (find out just how nuts here), but he’s nuts on-camera for our benefit; and the Mission Impossible franchise is all the richer for it, record-breaking 80-million dollar insurance claims aside. Fallout is chock-full of breath-taking stunts like the one in which Cruise busted his ankle (which is also featured in the trailers), along with a shipload of exposition right up front. Luckily, the filmmakers wisely follow-up on such pre-titles set-up repeatedly during the movie, so it’s reinforced—you don’t have to remember all of it on your own. Viewing all five of the earlier installments is also unnecessary (but it wouldn’t hurt since past characters resurface) since the filmmakers make it a point to explain everything and everyone, albeit sometimes in a ham-fisted way. But you may have to go to the bathroom during the previews since Fallout is a bladder-busting 2 and 1/2 hours. But at least you don’t have to sit through the entire credit roll since there is no end-credits tag. But MI6 is fun, exciting, and over-the-top right where it needs to be except for some seriously funny overacting between newcomer Henry Cavill and series staple Angela Bassett. But don’t let their scene-chewing distract you since you need to pay attention: Fallout features multiple double-crosses which overlap as the runtime wears on. Fallout would have benefitted from some tightening in its exposition to be sure, but also even in some of the extended action/chase scenes, which would have corrected its main flaw: being unnecessarily overlong. The plot is admittedly somewhat standard stuff; bad guy threatening civilized society with black-market nukes. But in the capable hands of writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Edge of Tomorrow) and Cruise (who also serves as producer), such stereotypical action-flick fodder is elevated—via equal parts personal vendetta and—to something else; the action event of the summer."
"May 21, 2019",positive," Above all else, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an action movie. It has nothing particularly cogent to say about espionage, politics, or human interaction but it has a lot to show in the way of action sequences. Three immediately stand out and there at least another three that threaten to rival them. One standout is a very straightforward chase scene. Our hero, Tom Cruise’s secret agent Ethan Hunt, is on a motorcycle pursued by dozens of police in cars at every corner. The chase seems to go on forever and ends with a riveting bang. But for good measure we’re also given a car vs motorcycle standoff, a helicopter showdown, and a three person bathroom fight. None of these sequences is extraneous or perfunctory. Instead, they are thoughtfully and expertly rendered with technical proficiency. Film, we’re often reminded, is a visual medium but it’s the precision of the sound effects and the smoothness of the sound mixing that turn these action sequences from good to excellent. Listen for the rev of the engine as a stationary motorcycle finally takes off. The screech as a car skids off . The dizzying sound of a fist connecting with muscle. The cacophony of a vehicle hitting into a truck hitting into another vehicle. Those incidents are par for the course in this genre, but the immersive soundscape of Fallout is not just coasting on the familiar but offering a dizzying, sometimes disorienting aural trip for the audience. A trip that deepens when the sound mixing opts for moments of silence in between key points. Or to let that catchy Mission Impossible theme seep into the narrative. This movie sounds better than most, if not all, 2018 releases, even when what it’s actually saying becomes ridiculous. The initial mission of Fallout is compromised early on when Hunt botches a job because he opts to save a member of his team and allows some valuable weapons to be stolen. And so he must now hunt down some missing plutonium that could create anarchy in the world via the nuclear weapons made from it. This early decision is key to the view Fallout has of Hunt as the action hero who cares about the individual life of one as much as the collective lives of many. It’s meant to represent his nobility, but Fallout works worst when it tries to argue for Hunt as a moral arbiter of excellence. Cruise is a reliable action star—the series would not work without his tenacity—but Hunt is strangely hard to root for as a character who is not near as charming or emotionally compelling as the film makes him out to be. This is an action movie, so naturally Hunt’s task of stopping a terrorist group from carrying out a deadly mission with nuclear bombs ends up being more complicated than we anticipated. It’s a strange set-up as beyond the abstract worry of world destruction, there’s little real suspense as to what becomes of this mythical contemporary world that the series represents. But geopolitical verisimilitude is not on the menu here. It doesn’t need to be. What we do have is Ethan Hunt on a breathless new adventure with a number of complications thrown in. He has the new director of the CIA breathing down his neck (an underused Angela Bassett enunciating as if her life depended on it), a beleaguered boss (a beleaguered Alec Baldwin), his trustworthy sidekicks (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, who do fair work but often feel thrown in to prop Hunt up which becomes slightly annoying), a former co-worker and potential adversary in the form of Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa (decisive and compelling even when the film gives her little to do) and a more direct foil in the figure of the CIA assassin he’s forced to work alongside in the figure of Henry Cavill’s Agent Walker. Cavill is my favourite in the cast by a mile even though his role, as large as it is, still feels underdeveloped. Cavill nails the tonal shifts between full-blown action and reluctant comedy with panache. It’s a confident performance that is just the right note of ironic to become subversive. But Fallout is not a film for actors to show their chops, especially if their name is not Tom Cruise. Like any film in the series, it is ultimately only Cruise who is provided with a real platform for much depth. The emotional stakes when they come late in the film make me shrug even though they are meant to be emotionally profound. Ethan Hunt just is not that compelling, and the film’s almost sycophantic view of him (of course, a new female character must find him so beguiling she must make out with him in a heated moment) does not help the situation. It doesn’t really matter, though, because Christopher McQuarrie with his direction (more than his screenplay) has injected Fallout with enough technical finesse that this action movie thrills enough. And so, even the most ridiculous of situations make you gasp from the spectacle of the action rather than strain credulity at the levels to which you must suspend your disbelief for it to make sense. More style than substance. But what style!"
"May 15, 2019",positive," The Mission: Impossible TV series always had a strong focus on teams, but ever since the entire team was killed off in the first movie, the focus has been on Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). While the first entry is a classic, it only seemed to get worse with the second. However, by the time the third movie came along, they were more willing to bring on supporting players including the first appearance of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Then the fourth movie arrived, and it was like they completely changed genres. They embraced the team dynamic entirely, and the franchise became better for it. This sixth entry leans in on that even more and is easily the strongest in the series so far. Director Christopher McQuarrie didn't want to come back after directing 2015's Rogue Nation, but Paramount Pictures and Cruise were able to convince him to return. It was a good thing, because McQuarrie has found a way to amp up the action scenes while also realizing that these supporting players are what set this series apart from the Bournes or the Bonds (the latter of which tend to waste the talents of the supporting players). For Fallout McQuarrie brings back the fantastic Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethan's wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and new female characters as well. We're missing Brandt (Jeremy Renner) because Renner was off filming the Avengers movies at the time, but there are plenty of awesome people here to pick up the slack. The marketing has been playing up the absolutely insane action scenes, and they are rather spectacular. They are also varied, which is nice. This isn't just one car crash after another — it manages to cover all the bases of action movies. The fights are brutal and the stakes are clear, so we understand what happens if the bad guys win. We get plenty of character beats, and Henry Cavill's Augustus Walker is a welcome addition to the team as somewhat of an antithesis to Hunt. That's not to say there aren't flaws, but they are at most nitpicky. It runs a little long, but you don't feel that until you have to stand up after the movie ends. It's a little too obsessed with double-crosses and backstabbing (there might be one too many by the end), but it doesn't drag the movie down too much. Mission: Impossible – Fallout isn't a perfect movie, but it's about as close to Mad Max: Fury Road quality as an action movie has come in a long time. This series continues to get better, and it's been extremely entertaining watching an action series like this find itself in its recent entries."
"May 4, 2019",positive," Up to this point each Mission: Impossible film has operated on their own mechanisms.  The 1996 Brian De Palma-directed original felt like an organic extension of the 1960’s television series it drew its inspiration from; the 2000-released sequel was an orgy of unsubtle combat buoyed by the favoured-slow motion of Hong Kong filmmaker Jon Woo; J.J. Abrams’ second sequel in 2006 felt slightly more grounded in comparison, coming off like an appendage of the director’s own TV project Alias; 2011’s Ghost Protocol, under the eye of Brad Bird (The Incredibles), adopted the IMAX gimmick and went for broke in what possibilities lay in extravagance; and Christopher McQuarrie’s Rogue Nation in 2015 adhered to the modern temperament of the genre by delivering spectacle that didn’t overrun an intricate story. So where do we sit with Fallout? The 6th entrant in this surprisingly robust series –  one that has defied expectation at practically every turn – is very much a continuation of Rogue Nation, perhaps earning it the right to be considered the series’ first legitimate sequel.  Christopher McQuarrie (the first director to pull returning duties behind the camera) clearly knows how to juggle the extremities of the genre, and whilst he is working with a story that is rife with obstacles, he never lets it get the best of him; and why should he when he wrote the damn thing!  Instead he places trust in his ingredients, and what’s the one base flavour that is sure to never fail? One Mr. Tom Cruise. At this point it’s getting a bit tired to continually defend Cruise from an acting perspective.  His personal life and beliefs are open to criticism, but as an entertainer he’s undoubtedly one of the most committed to the craft.  Since the series’ conception Cruise has been performing all his own stunts and, much like each respective film, they’ve only gotten more high-stake (i.e. dangerous) as they’ve gone along.  It was highly publicised that Cruise fractured an ankle bone during a stunt that required him to leap from roof-to-roof throughout a London-based sequence (the footage ultimately remains in the finished film), and instead of taking the recommended 9 weeks off he returned to set a mere 5 weeks later, only to shoot a sequence that required extensive running throughout the streets of Paris.  You can’t tell me that isn’t dedication to your job. As for why Cruise is jumping across rooftops and running throughout Parisian streets, well that’s because his unstoppable IMF agent Ethan Hunt is looking to foil the nuclear plot of a mysterious villain known only as John Lark, the leader of a group of international libertines dubbed The Apostles.  Lark is due to score a suitcase full of plutonium through a trade with a sensual arms dealer known as The White Widow (The Crown‘s Vanessa Kirby, seemingly channeling Vanessa Redgrave), and it’s come down to Ethan and his right-handers Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to infiltrate the deal. This would all be well and good if Ethan wasn’t being monitored by strapping assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill, proving the Justice League-disrupting moustache was worth the growth), called out by CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) who believes Hunt is no longer as dedicated to the job as he should be.  Add to that complication the return of Rogue Nation‘s shadowy MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and homicidal anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), and you’re left with a plot that could potentially buckle under its own weight. It does help to pay attention to the various double, even triple crossing McQuarrie’s script throws about with reckless abandon – not helped by the onslaught of action set-pieces that have been masterfully choreographed to steal focus at every turn – but there’s a brilliance at work here where everything falls so neatly into place once the dust has settled.  But really, who cares about details when the film’s alphas Hunt and Walker graduate from a dazzling hand-to-hand combat in the men’s room of a Parisian nightclub to a helicopter chase above the clouds of Kashmir before battling atop a towering cliff, all the while a duo of bombs begin their inevitable countdown towards expected doomsday. When it boils down to it, Fallout may still be somewhat cliched in terms of genre mentality, but it knows how to toy with the expected and present itself as a fresh product that we can’t help but gobble up in excess.  Now, is it too early to request M:I-7?"
"Apr 16, 2019",positive," Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch Mission Impossible: Fallout and not get swept away by the old-school, over-the-top spy chaos. Should you choose to accept this mission, you'll join Tom Cruise as he confidently returns to the role of Ethan Hunt, indestructible secret agent. Someone's stolen some plutonium and Hunt has to round up his chums in the Impossible Mission Force for more death-defying, gravity-defying and, frankly, common-sense-defying action scenes. A lot of movies are referred to as roller-coaster rides, but in this case it barely seems like a metaphor: very few films throw its stars and audiences around quite as much as the Mission: Impossible series, and this adrenaline-pumping sixth outing is no exception. As cutting-edge as the stuntwork is, the word ""Fallout"" seems like a faintly quaint title. This oddly dusty term evokes the nuclear paranoia of the Cold War rather than the more modern preoccupation with devious data and sinister surveillance often seen in today's espionage thrillers. And Mission: Impossible - Fallout does have a certain old-school feel to it. The story begins in Belfast and Berlin, two cities that have put their troubled pasts as geopolitical hotspots of skullduggery behind them. The bad guys wear moustaches and impeccable three-piece suits. And the implausible high-tech gadgetry is kept to a minimum -- even the iconic introductory tape comes hidden in a book. Pleasingly for anyone struggling to distinguish the Mission: Impossible franchise from other all-action espionage movies, at least one part of the team's plan comes straight from the original 1960s TV show. You might also spot echoes of The Dark Knight's and The French Connection's most memorable action scenes, not to mention surprising similarities to the most recent James Bond movies.  Of course, the title isn't really a reference to the devastation that'll be wrought should the IMF team fail to retrieve the contraband nuclear material. It refers to the fact the film is basically Tom Cruise falling out of things. Helicopters, planes, windows, cliffs, huge sewer gratings: there isn't anything Cruise won't fling himself into, onto or out of in the name of a thrilling action sequence. You've got to hand it to him: you really feel like it's Cruise himself rather than a digital double doing all the running and jumping. And what running and jumping it is. I'm not sure there's anything to quite compete with the realisation that it was actually Cruise clinging to the side of an actual skyscraper in Ghost Protocol or to the side of an actual aeroplane in Rogue Nation, but the relentless breathless action scenes still set the standard for big, loud set pieces. It's definitely worth seeing Fallout in IMAX format, or even in a 4DX theatre -- one of those rollercoaster-style theatres with seats that tilt and vibrate while jets of air and misted water are sprayed over you.  Mission: Impossible - Fallout was my first experience of 4DX, and I can't decide if it's the worst thing that's ever happened in the history of cinema or the perfect way to watch this kind of ridiculous adrenaline ride. Randomly flashing strobe lights are annoying and your seat jostling you at inappropriate moments is distracting, but when slower movement is twinned with subtle onscreen camerawork it's surprisingly effective at drawing you into the moment. And I admit, by the end, when the screen is just filled with absolutely nonsensical carnage, it actually makes sense to have your seat jerking around so violently you feel like you're about to be fired through the screen, where you'll find yourself blinking in the street picking popcorn out of your hair and wondering what the heck just happened. Fallout isn't just delirious action, though it's mostly delirious action. There is also some cinematic deftness on display alongside the theme park convulsions. Director Christopher McQuarrie and cinematographer Rob Hardy inject some elan between the action, particularly in a stylish silent shootout, a sinister opening dream sequence and a party that seems to come from another age. These quieter scenes also give composer Lorne Balfe room to breathe with brooding teases of the iconic M:I music ... before unleashing a bombastic sonic barrage chaotic enough to match the visual bombardment. British actors Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris return from the previous movie, Rogue Nation, bringing a real touch of class even if they're underused. Thankfully, Jeremy Renner's useless sidekick from the last two films is jettisoned to make way for moustachioed Henry Cavill, a CIA agent who's the hammer to Ethan Hunt's scalpel. Cavill is meant to be a wild card, brought into the fold to keep an eye on the team and ready to shut things down if necessary. Mostly though he's too useless to be threatening, coming across as a dim-witted lummox rather than a credible menace. Anyway, where was I ... oh, yes, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come out of this ludicrous movie without a smile on your face. As always, should you or any of your force not be caught up in the comically over-the-top capers, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Wait a minute, is this thing on?"

"Apr 2, 2019",positive," 22 años después de la primera aparición de Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise sigue haciendo de las suyas. Mientras nosotros no podemos soportar una cruda de dos días, este pedazo de Hollywood destilado en músculo irredento salta de cornisas, derriba helicópteros y escala muros de roca sin cuerda a sus 56 años. Basada en la exitosa serie de finales de los sesenta, Mission: Impossible encontró en Cruise a un héroe de acción inagotable que, en la segunda década de los dosmiles, de la mano de Brad Bird (The Incredibles) y Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) ha mantenido una promesa imposible de entretenimiento. Porque ésta no es la era de las cintas de acción. Ya no existen héroes como alguna vez lo fueron Seagal, Van Damme, Norris, Stallone o Schwarzenegger. Ya no se puede hablar inocentemente de terroristas y las películas hollywoodenses no pueden apañarse fácilmente la xenofobia típica de la guerra fría. Pero el género muerto de la acción sigue pataleando a través de un héroe insospechado de eterna necedad sadomasoquista. Mission: Impossible – Fallout es la sexta entrega de una franquicia que, sobre los esfuerzos de Brian De Palma, J.J. Abrams y John Woo, se ha mantenido como un dinosaurio extraño que se niega a la extinción. Frente a los fracasos recientes de la franquicia de Jack Reacher, de la franquicia agotada de Jason Bourne y los esfuerzos horriblemente estériles de Jason Statham en The Transporter, podemos decir que Tom Cruise es verdaderamente uno de los últimos grandes héroes de acción. Un héroe que, antes de irse, nos ha dejado un legado impresionante de sana diversión madreadora. Ésta no es una película inteligente, no es una película bien escrita y no es una película particularmente ingeniosa. Pero es una cinta hecha con inmensa pasión, tremendamente filmada, brillantemente editada y que, sobre todo, entiende qué es lo que quiere y cómo quiere lograrlo. Como una de las mejores cintas de acción gringa que se hayan hecho en los últimos años, Mission: Impossible – Fallout merece una mirada sin prejuicios que sepa reconocer el logro demente de filmar un salto HALO con una cámara IMAX amarrada a un casco. Nada más, es cierto, pero nada menos. Mission: Impossible – Fallout empieza con una secuencia onírica: Hunt está parado, en una orilla, frente a Julia, su esposa perdida. Se observan amorosamente mientras Solomon Lane, el demente terrorista que capturó en Ghost Protocol, oficia una ceremonia de bodas. Horrorizado, Hunt observa cómo explota lejanamente una bomba nuclear que arrasa con todo. Como Sarah Connor años atrás, el personaje interpretado por Tom Cruise se levanta bañado en sudor y dudas. A partir de ahí, la cinta expone claramente cuál es el meollo: los Apóstoles de Lane siguen activos a pesar de la captura de su jefe. El IMF sabe que estos terroristas radicales encontraron a un iluminado científico nuclear que tiene la capacidad de fabricar tres bombas ultrapotentes. El intercambio de los núcleos radiactivos se hará pronto en Berlín. Así que Hunt y su equipo se encaminan para allá. Pero la misión sale horriblemente mal: para salvar a Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) de una muerte segura, Hunt pierde los núcleos y ahora el mundo está en serio peligro. El equipo de Hunt tendrá que hacer una búsqueda frenética para encontrar las armas nucleares y desarmarlas antes de que empujen a la frágil geopolítica global hacia un desastre. Pero el IMF está bajo estricto control y Hunt deberá aceptar la vigilancia de August Walker (Henry Cavill con el famoso bigotillo), un asesino de la CIA cuyos métodos son algo menos discretos que los de Hunt, Stickell y Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Viejos amigos, nuevos enemigos y fantasmas del pasado recorren las 2 horas 27 minutos de pura adrenalina que dura la película. Una verdadera oda a la acción noventera más despreocupada y a la serie que le dio vida, hace cincuenta años. Las series de televisión clásicas no tenían nada que ver con el modelo de Netflix. La serialización estaba hecha para que la gente reconociera, cada semana, a los mismos personajes y a las mismas situaciones sin perderse en arcos narrativos demasiado amplios. Por eso, Mission: Impossible tenía una estructura tan reconocible: empezaba con una mecha prendida e imágenes del episodio para luego pasar a la típica escena del informe grabado (“Tu misión, si decides aceptarla…”, “… este mensaje se destruirá en cinco segundos”), tenía unas cuantas secuencias de planeación y de selección de los agente que integrarían la misión y terminaba con las convulsas secuencias de engaño y acción. Todos los episodios mantenían esta estructura para no confundir a los fanáticos de la serie, para ganar nuevos adeptos y para hacer inmediatamente reconocible una identidad. Cuando Brian de Palma y Tom Cruise decidieron llevar la serie a la pantalla grande, mantuvieron muchos gimmicks de esa identidad pero, también, volvieron la atmósfera de Mission: Impossible algo mucho más oscuro, contemporáneo y violento. Con las secuelas de John Woo y J.J. Abrams, el lazo con la serie original se perdió un poco en la acción convulsa y la caracterización, cada vez más profunda, de Ethan Hunt. Porque, desde Mission: Impossible III, Hunt dejó de ser un James Bond frío y despiadado para tener una debilidad: el amor hacia Julia, su prometida. Ahora, con esta sexta entrega, McQuarrie logra continuar el balance perfecto que cristalizó Brad Bird en Ghost Protocol: Ethan Hunt es un héroe humano, peligroso pero frágil. Aquí encontramos la debilidad de Hunt por los seres que quiere y que amenaza cada vez que emprende sus misiones suicidas. Y, de hecho, toda la cinta será una demostración de cómo Hunt es el más grande héroe porque no puede tomar la decisión de sacrificar una vida para salvar a millones. Así, junto a esta visión de Hunt creada por Abrams, tenemos toda la acción de John Woo, el vértigo de Brad Bird, la oscuridad de De Palma y el recuerdo siempre vivo de la serie original. De hecho, creo que esta cinta es la que mayor honor le hace a los tropos sesenteros de Mission: Impossible. Desde la secuencia de créditos vemos la intención de hacer referencias hasta lo ridículo: por ahí tenemos las escenas de engaño elaboradísimas (una de ellas incluye un cameo raro pero cada vez más frecuente a Wolf Blitzer), quid pro quos, disfraces, mensajes grabados que se autodestruyen, escenas de exposición absolutamente falsas y líneas de guión forzadas para explicar gadgets. Parece que esto fuera una crítica negativa. Pero, conforme más pasa tiempo, me doy cuenta de que, en verdad, esto es lo que hace a Fallout tan extrañamente original. No oculta los sinsentidos que le dieron vida a la trama original y, de hecho, quiere hacerle homenaje a las cuestiones más ridículas de la serie. En ese sentido, no se compromete a ser algo más de lo que es; no tiene pues, las pretensiones más serias de Ghost Protocol o la primera cinta y se deja llevar por una historia algo ridícula para encadenar, una a una, secuencias de acción cada vez más dementes. Todos saben que a Tom Cruise le gusta hacer sus propios stunts. Parte de los grandes actos de publicidad de todas sus películas es ver el placer casi sexual que le da poner su vida en peligro en el set de filmación. En una cinta escaló el edificio más alto del mundo, en otra se amarró a un avión gigantesco mientras despegaba. Después de esos dos trucos demenciales parecía que se le habían acabado los stunts dementes. Pero no, a Cruise nunca se le acaban los stunts dementes. En esta cinta, Cruise protagoniza, junto a Henry Cavill, un salto HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) a más de 30 kilómetros arriba de la superficie terrestre. Es una maldita locura. Pero aún más demente es cómo filmaron el salto: el reconocido fotógrafo aéreo Craig O’Brien grabó el salto amarrando un lente IMAX a su casco. Todo se siente pulcro y real. Al punto en que, cuando llegas al trepidante final de la cinta, con un cronómetro en una bomba nuclear en Cachemira y Tom Cruise saltando de un helicóptero en movimiento a otro, ya nada te sorprende. Como un recuerdo de las más pura locura de acción noventera, esta cinta no se preocupa mucho por el fondo y se deja llevar por las persecuciones en motocicleta, las madrizas interminables (incluyendo una secuencia en un baño que le hace todo el honor al primer James Bond de Daniel Craig) y la acción cada vez más alucinante. El resultado no nada más es divertido sino que es extrañamente refrescante. Hace tiempo que no veía una buena película de acción como antaño se hacían, hace tiempo que no sentía que podían existir grandes héroes de acción, hace tiempo que no experimentaba vértigo real y suspenso al filo del asiento. Mission: Impossible – Fallout es una película hueca, mal escrita, banal y, si se quiere, totalmente estúpida. Al mismo tiempo, está fabricada con precisión de relojero, un gusto hermoso para filmar películas de acción y un exuberante sentido de sus propias posibilidades. En ese sentido, es todo lo que necesita ser una buena película de acción: Fallout se basta a sí misma y destruye toda posibilidad de una crítica más profunda. Esto es diversión que se entiende como tal, que se hizo como tal y que vivirá en el recuerdo como una de las últimas grandes cintas de acción de nuestra generación. Un crítico de Indiewire comentaba que Ethan Hunt es un personaje único porque es el último héroe chapado a la antigua que se sacrifica, sin chistar, para salvar hasta la última vida humana. En ese sentido, Tom Cruise también se está sacrificando, una y otra vez, para mantener vivo un género que ya todos dábamos por muerto. Se amarra a aviones, tumba helicópteros, salta de la maldita estratósfera. En honor al sacrificio masoquista que Cruise hace gustoso, debemos decir que, si esta cinta descuida todo lo que podría darle más peso (guión, historia, personajes), es absolutamente obsesiva con los detalles minuciosos de la acción. Fallout sabe lo que quiere, sabe lo que prometió y sabe que lo entrega. Por eso, con creces, es la cinta más vacía y más divertida de toda la franquicia. Elenco: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin y Wolf Blitzer	."
"Mar 30, 2019",positive," Watching Mission: Impossible – Fallout on the big screen, I was worried I was being too obnoxious to my neighboring audience members. I crackled with glee, and, more than once, threw my hands up in disbelief. I had to react physically; I just couldn’t help myself. The things I saw — Tom Cruise doing a HALO jump from five miles up, Tom Cruise on a high-speed motorcycle chase around Paris, Tom Cruise making ankle-shattering hops across rooftops, Tom Cruise dangling from a helicopter, and Tom Cruise piloting a helicopter like it’s a bumper car — demanded my reaction. Filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Jack Reacher) deserves a lot of credit for pushing his and Cruise’s talents to the edge in a film that does far more than simply tack on an addition to the franchise. He evolves the series from safe summer blockbusters to something that feels wildly tangible and terrifying to watch. Seeing Cruise perform all these stunts himself, some of which took over a year of training, is something you don’t get from most movies. In a film world littered with green-screen solutions to everything, you don’t often see actors putting their lives (and limbs) at risk to fuel a stronger reaction from audiences. It makes the action all the more immersive and intense knowing the filmmakers and talent went the extra mile, and as a result, we get one of the most thrilling action movies ever made. The plot falls in line with many of the other Mission: Impossible films, but enough is shaken up to keep it fresh. In Fallout, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must square up against a nuclear threat from the hands of imprisoned anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, giving us his own reserved-but-creepy rendition of Heath Ledger’s Joker). Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust returns (a change of pace for a franchise whose women are usually nowhere to be found by the next installment) and crosses paths on a conflicting mission of her own with MI6. Meanwhile, CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, and the most expensive mustache) is assigned to watch Ethan’s every move, leading to many trust issues amongst the outfit. While the cast brings its A-game (also including Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin and series newcomers Angela Bassett and Vanessa Kirby), the film comes most alive during its jaw-dropping action. There are fist fights, car chases, foot chases and helicopter chases that ignite the fuse of excitement. To describe them in greater detail wouldn’t do them justice, especially one incredible set piece in Paris, which, like Mad Max: Fury Road, is a long chase sequence that, on many occasions, will make you go, “Ooh,” “ahh” and “ouch!” Then there’s the best scene of the movie — and believe me, there are too many great scenes to count — and it features a bathroom brawl to the death. The scene got a big reaction out of my audience, most notably when Cavill throws his enemy through a mirror and cocks his arms like they’re guns. McQuarrie and Cruise (also a producer) push scenes such as this further than you think they ever could, and it raises the stakes in a fashion that makes the limitations of these characters completely unpredictable. There’s also an incredible amount of intelligence put into Fallout‘s character moments. Solomon’s plot to use bombs to create (as he and the other baddies put it) a suffering large enough to bring about great peace puts Ethan to the ultimate test. Cruise isn’t afraid to show physical and emotional vulnerability this round. He’s always played Ethan as this invincible superhero who could face any mission. But here, he is challenged like he’s never been before. One key scene shows Ethan wrestling with the decision to let a police officer die or give himself over to the mission-driven man he needs to be. It’s like Solomon is inflicting his own philosophy of “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace” on him. Does he let one person die, or does he fail the mission at hand? He finally deals with the weight of his decisions, and it elevates the material. Fallout’s greatest flaw may also be its greatest asset. The film surprisingly shares a lot of DNA with Christopher Nolan’s directed works, principally The Dark Knight. From the smooth and inventive cinematography, to the Hans Zimmer-like score (trivia: composer Lorne Balfe worked with Zimmer on the Dark Knight films) and story beats, you can draw many comparisons. But any movie that takes a page (or, in this case, several pages) out of The Dark Knight, it arguably improves the quality of the product. Just look at Skyfall. Like The Dark Knight, Fallout provides more than a mere hero-versus-villain story. There’s much more on the playing field than obstacles laid down by the villain. At one point in the film, Solomon asks Ethan why he chooses to accept these missions. For Ethan, the answer is obvious: He can save the lives of many, and therefore it doesn’t matter what stands in his way, even if it’s death. For Cruise, it’s also apparent: to top what he has done before."
"Mar 2, 2019",positive," Well, here we are: 6 films into a series that has taken up 22 years of our lives, with Mission: Impossible – Fallout being the most insane entry yet, but also the most fun.  This time around, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) manages to lose Solomon Lane – the big bad from MI: Rogue Nation and the leader of “terrorist members only” The Syndicate. Hunt sets off with IMF members Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames – whose voice I find so intoxicating I honestly don’t know why I’m not at Arby’s every day) to find Lane again, starting with trying to buy some stolen plutonium.  The pursuit of the plutonium, of course, involves a TON of over-the-top action sequences: Tom Cruise speeds through the streets of Paris on a motorcycle! Tom Cruise parkours across Paris rooftops! Tom Cruise flies a helicopter through narrow canyons! Tom Cruise gets the shit beat out of him again and again and again for your entertainment! (TBH, I *do* find that entertaining).  Of course, that’s not all. This is mission IMPOSSIBLE, so the complications keep piling on until the film’s exhausting, satisfying conclusion (at 2 hours and 27 minutes, you’re ready to go home and give your eyeballs a rest).  Everyone knows I’m way more of a Fast & Furious fan than a Mission: Impossible fan, but watching Fallout was big, stupid fun. It helped that I was sitting in a row with my mom and a bunch of guys I’m lucky to call my friends, so we could all “ooh” and “aw” over the same parts, and laugh our entire faces off at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.  And even though Henry “I’m afraid to ask out women because it’s SO HARD TO BE a straight white man!” Cavill is now on my shit list, it was still entertaining to see his engorged arms operate almost independently from the rest of his body, while completely and totally dwarfing Tom Cruise in every scene they shared.  Aside from the pure escapism of this film, I loved so much about it. I loved every bit of action that was on screen; I loved watching the team work together to save the world – masks and all – up against a impossible (haha!) deadline; and I even loved the way Luther gave Ethan’s new special lady friend the DL on his previous special lady friend. Also, oh, hey Wes Bentley! Whatchoo been up to?"
"Mar 1, 2019",positive," The Mission: Impossible film franchise is one of the few that somehow got better and better after its third sequel struggle to make a dent at the box office. Not only did the later sequels were financially successful, they’re also critically darlings. Looking at Rottentomatoes.com, Mission: Impossible 4-6 received mid to high 90% rating. After a mission gone wrong and three nuclear missile heads are in the hands of a new group of terrorists known as The Apostles, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his teammates Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) must retrieve the weapons. When Hunt was getting an intel briefing from his boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), as to where he can find the nuclear weapons, they’re both got interrupted by a new CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Sloan is upset that the IMF team lost the nuclear heads and insists that her agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) must go with Ethan to retrieve them. First on their task is to capture and impersonate a man named John Lark (Liang Yang) and meet with a mysterious woman named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), in Paris who has the connection to the Apostles. But when Hunt and Walker met with White Widow, she insisted that they must break out an international terrorist and Hunt’s nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) from prison or they won’t get the nuclear weapons. Of course this complicates the mission but both Hunt and Walker went along and helped Lane escaped. Along the way, Hunt ran into an old friend Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). She’s also has her own mission and that is to eliminate Lane for good. Well, things never go as planned and Hunt must use all of his skills to try to save the world from chaos and also save those who he cares about. For the first time in franchise history, the same director and writer Christopher McQuarrie of the previous film has returned and take charge of this new mission. To my surprise, McQuarrie has exceeded what he created in the last picture. He crafted a complexed storyline that’s full of twists, drama, humor and big action sequences. By hiring new crew members, notably a new cinematographer and composer, he was able to differentiate this film from the last one. It’s clearly that he used Nolan’s The Dark Knight as his inspiration for this outing. The film even contains a big chase that’s very similar to a chase sequence from The Dark Knight. A big bathroom brawl, a spectacular motorcycle and car chase through the streets of Paris and a helicopter chase are the highlights of the set pieces. Cinematographer Rob Hardy is having a good year. He shot the excellent Annihilation for Alex Garland earlier this year and again for this film, he did a tremendous job. This film contains so many wide shots in the series since Woo’s Mission: Impossible 2. This is good because we the audience can actually see the action and not trying to figure out what’s going on super chaotic scenes. Shout out also goes to composer Lorne Balfe who apparently is the understudy of Hans Zimmer. So, of course this film’s score sounds like it’s was composed by Zimmer. There’s still the well know Mission: Impossible theme but Balfe made it sounded like something very original. Just a little trivia, Hans Zimmer did compose a Mission: Impossible film, he worked on the second one. With three box office bombs in a row, Cruise poured all of his performance into this film. He did the usual crazy stunts but was willing to show his character’s age and flaws by having him get his ass whooped a few times in the film. The rest of the cast members were pretty good too. I was afraid Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust might just be nothing more than a cameo but her role was an integral part of the story and as usual she saved Hunt’s life couple of times in the film. Simon and Luthor didn’t really have much to do except to be comic relief. Luther did have a touching scene with Ilsa, I really liked that scene. I liked the addition of Alec Balwin’s character and he even got involved in one action scene with the team members. Bassett and Cavill were a nice addition and I hope we see more of Bassett’s character in the next Mission film. Kirby’s White Widow is an interesting character and I thought she played the role quite well even though she didn’t get a lot of screen time. Having seen the film twice already, I can declare Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible film yet. It’s full of humor, great tensions and spectacular actions sequences. If there’s an IMAX, Dolby Cinema or other large vendor theater near you, go see it there. It’s definitely my favorite film of the summer and maybe even of the year. Glad you enjoyed it too Cindy. I haven’t felt this way about a summer blockbuster probably since I saw The Dark Knight ten years ago! I agree with you Ted. Mission Impossible: Fallout is especially worth it in IMAX (I saw it at the MN Zoo IMAX over the weekend). Glad Ivan and I saw it at Zoo IMAX too Ted! The scenery is spectacular, and it’s got all the action stuff I like. Dayum the motorbike chase scene is killer! I’m afraid one day Cruise will perish doing one of his crazy stunts! Yeah and Cruise is 56 years old! I don’t know when he’ll give up this franchise and hand it off to a new lead but all those running, jumping and flying helicopter, he seems to have some kind of a death wish. Easiest review I have written all year. So much pouring out of my mind to say. It’s such riveting white-knuckle cinema and I can’t wait to see it again. Hey Keith, glad to hear you’re fan of this one too! I had high expectations for it after seeing the trailer but never thought it exceeded my expectations. Saw this on Friday and had a blast with it as well. That fight scene in the men’s room was amazing as was seeing Tom Cruise doing lots of running again. Plus that scene below the helicopter was stunning…. Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond. Official blogger for the Twin Cities Film Fest (TCFF).

"Feb 27, 2019",positive," I’m not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but when I first saw the trailer for Mission Impossible: Fallout, I was excited. In the sixth installment of the Mission Impossible franchise, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team, Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) race against the clock to correct a mission that’s gone terribly wrong. In an action movie, I don’t go in expecting great line delivery or even chemistry between characters. Most of the time I just want great fight choreography and big stunts. Mission Impossible: Fallout delivered on the former and the latter. The additions of Agent Walker (Henry Cavill) and Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) made for great interactions and when Cavill delivered his lines, they were just as intense as reloading his fists in that bathroom fight scene from the trailer. Not to mention that Bassett and Cavell together have so much chemistry that I wish they were a part of the same comic book cinematic universe. The IMF team of Ethan, Benji, and Luther are as in sync as ever with perfect comedic timing when needed and great gadget exposition when the times call for it. Rhames even has an emotional scene towards the end of the film with Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Unlike other action flicks, the movie was strong because of its characters and script, not in spite of it. I want to note that this installment of the Mission Impossible franchise has more stunts than any other. Not only are they grand examples of adventure but the focus on practical effects, the insistence of Cruise to do his own stunt work, and the use of real locations make its action stong in a visual and visceral sense. The only issues I have with the film are that some of the action scenes dragged on too long. There are pieces of the action sequence where the only sound used is the score. Although the music in this movie is great, 30-seconds of prolonged running doesn’t get better with a great track. With a car chase that just kept going and silent moments of ominous walking, I can’t say this movie was perfect. That being said, for a summer action flick with an amazing cast, new and old, I can overlook that piece and firmly say that I would love to watch Mission Impossible: Fallout on the big screen again. Even if it’s only to watch a supercut of Tom Cruise performing his own stunts. Appearing in the trailer, the rope climb onto the helicopter and jumping onto the other building – which resulted in a broken foot – are just two stunts out of an action-packed two and a half-hour ride.

"Feb 25, 2019",positive," So the last few weeks of movie-going have certainly had their ups and big time downs! Make sure you are following me on my youtube channel because some films I review there and some here (just some content speaks more to writing an essay and others to a video LOL). Also make sure you are following me at smilingldsgirl on Stardust and Letterboxd to have these mini reviews sooner. I did a full review for Sorry to Bother You so I won’t include that here but there are still 11 films I have seen since my last update. There were some highs and some definite lows! The first Mamma Mia is a bit of a guilty pleasure. It’s not a good movie but it’s effervescent vacation porn with some catchy songs sung terribly. In the sequel, we get catchy effervescent vacation porn but sung well so I’m on board! I really liked the entire cast and thought Lily James was great as a young Meryl. The movie didn’t judge her character but just presented her life and gave us happy energetic songs. That’s all I needed. A little more Meryl would have been nice but that’s the only problem I had with it. I have been listening to the soundtrack all summer! I’m not normally someone who decries spoilers (in fact, I find that super annoying) but in the case of Three Identical Strangers try to go in spoiler free. The twist blew me away! This is an incredibly engaging film. It starts out funny and light and then becomes something much darker. I was moved and amazed. If it wasn’t a documentary you wouldn’t believe it could be true. I have never seen an episode of Teen Titans Go but have heard nothing but how terrible the show is and how it is an affront to the original Teen Titans. I also was not impressed with the trailers, so you can imagine my surprise when I walked away having had a great time! I laughed harder at Teen Titans Go! To the Movies than I have at any other film this year except for Game Night. It was a hilarious satire on superhero movies and tropes. I also enjoyed the 2D animation with its comic book aesthetic and the voice cast from the original show were great. Nicholas Cage also gets some good laughs at Superman. I just really enjoyed it! While not as well written as some of the best of this franchise, Mission Impossible: Fallout is a great action film. The action set pieces are above reproach and they happen so much and so quickly that I never had time to think about the story or be bored while watching. The cast is all great including Tom Cruise who is evidently willing to do anything to get a compelling action scene. I still think Ghost Protocol is the best of the franchise because of its story but this is darn good. I wish the women had been used a little bit better but that’s a small nitpick. The Spy Who Dumped Me is a frustrating film of unmet potential. Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis have good chemistry and the action is shot well but its tonal shifts were jarring making the movie unpleasant and long. It had some silly moments but then mixed with brutal violence, nudity and other harsh content it was off-putting. The tone was just all over the place and it felt like McKinnon was the only one trying to make things work but even that got old after a while. I’m not the biggest horror/thriller fan but I do love Gabrielle Union so I thought I would give Breaking In a shot. Unfortunately it ended up being a pretty mediocre film. It’s not terrible and there are some entertaining moments but as a whole it didn’t work. I liked the kid actors and Gabrielle Union is great as usual but it’s all extremely by the numbers and generic. They also obviously decided to make this PG-13 at the last-minute so there are tons of ‘freakin’ where obviously the f word was intended which is distracting. It’s no secret I haven’t been a big fan of these Disney live action remakes, but I was actually excited for Christopher Robin. My hope was it would feel fresh and sweet like the great Pete’s Dragon remake. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The entire premise didn’t work for me with Christopher forgetting his promise to Pooh and becoming the tired evil man of business. This left the 100 Acre Woods as kind of gloomy and sad with the characters waiting for Christopher to return. Christopher is supposed to be a terrible parent but in reality he is working to save his entire team their jobs. He’s the hero! They should have had his daughter Madeline find Pooh. That would have made way more sense since she is being sent to boarding school. Her interacting with the friends of the 100 Acre Woods might actually been magical. Here it is just a weak version of Hook and Paddington without either’s whimsy and charm (especially compared to Paddington). The only things I liked were the overall aesthetic, a scene at a train station where Pooh gets a balloon and a bonus credit song by Richard Sherman! Other than that this movie was an Eeyore! Everyone knows I love a good romance but the cinemas have been alarmingly short of them in recent years. (If you like romances check out my podcast on Hallmark films Hallmarkies Podcast). Before seeing Crazy Rich Asians I read the book by Kevin Kwan and for the most part the film does a good job adapting the novel. It stars Constance Wu and the super hot Henry Golding as a couple who are dating in America but things get rocky when he takes her to meet his ‘crazy rich’ family in Singapore. For what it is trying to be Crazy Rich Asians is just about perfectly executed. It’s funny, romantic, sweet and big hearted. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The cast is great including Awkwafina who stole all her scenes. Michelle Yeow plays a convincing villain because her point of view makes sense. It might be a cold view but it comes from her life experience so it is reasonable. Overall it’s a movie that has it all! I know the title is a mouthful but I loved the book so was very disappointed to hear this was not going to go to theaters but only to Netflix. Sometimes that can be a sign of a poor film but not in this case. I really loved it! Lily James is wonderful as Juliet an author who starts conversing with a man from Guernsey and learning the story about his secret book club. This society or club helped them get through some tough tiems during the German occupation. The entire cast is wonderful including a very dreamy Michael Huisman and Penelope Wilton who is always great in everything. Matthew Goode has a wonderful supporting role as Juliet’s publisher friend Sidney. It’s beautifully filmed by Mike Newell and will make you want to go to the Channel Islands. They do a good job mixing the light and fluffy with sincere and moving moments. I loved it! I wish we could at least get a fathom event to see it on the big screen for one night only. Come on Netflix! I’m normally not a big fan of these ensemble films like I hated Mother’s Day and New Years Eve. However, Dog Days proved to be a pleasant surprise. While it will be too cheesy for some, I found it really sweet and heartfelt. Pretty much every storyline worked for me. My favorites were an elderly man and teenager trying to find his dog and a family with a newly adopted little girl bonding over a dog. I also liked a romance between 2 news anchors that grows because of their mutual love of dogs. It was sweet, funny and I teeared up a few times. Dog Days is a charmer! And now for the movie that made me want to die. I had a feeling Duck Duck Goose would be a bad movie but as someone who loved Son of Bigfoot last year I always go into films with an open mind. Unfortunately Duck Duck Goose proved to be even worse than I could have imagined. It is right up there with Norm of the North for one of the worst animated films I have ever seen. I hated the animation. I hated the characters. I hated the humor. I hated the weird attempts to appeal to a Chinese market. I hated the unearned sentimentality. I hated how mean spirited it was and just overall unpleasant I hated the villain cat. I am someone who liked The Nut Job 2 so I don’t just dismiss films like this but it was atrocious in every respect. Do not show it to your kids! There are plenty of other things to watch on Netflix. I enjoyed ‘Mission: Impossible Fallout’ even more than I was anticipating.  I don’t know why I was surprised.    Maybe it’s because this is the sixth entry and I was expecting to see some signs of fatigue in the franchise by now.  The last three have been uniformly outstanding.  This just might possibly be my favorite, although Ghost Protocol is definitely up there too. One of my favorites of the summer. Again, another nice variety of movies. Mission: Impossible was an absolute blast. I can’t wait to see it again. Christopher Robin is one I haven’t seen and for some reason can’t muster any enthusiasm. Hoping to see Guernsey Literary this weekend."
"Feb 16, 2019",positive, 5 things you might want to know about “Mission Impossible: Fallout” spoiler free and in about 5 minutes! Stay tuned for the best ever challenge at the end!
"Feb 16, 2019",positive," So after catching up on all the awards season favourites and others I missed over the last 12 months, my ultimate summation of 2018 in cinema overall is that it was…a mixed bag. I mean, there were some absolute gems this year, but filling out this list with worthy candidates was a lot harder than it has been in previous years. I wouldn’t say it was a bad year for film though. I just don’t want to linger on negativity anymore, which is a big reason I haven’t done a “worst of” list this year and probably never will again. Moving forward as a critic, I want to put celebrating cinema first and foremost, but by no means does that mean I’m going to stop writing negative reviews or turn my brain off. It just means less disparaging humour and more practical critique. With that said, I do genuinely love every film on this list, even though I could nitpick plenty of them if I was so inclined. In a year that was otherwise filled with uncertainty and impending crisis, we need to focus the positives we do have, and in some ways that makes the great movies we did get this year even sweeter. So enough with the procrastinating. On with the list! We had two dramas about conversion therapy this year, and whilst The Miseducation of Cameron Post was a solid effort Boy Erased goes just that little bit further into driving home how dehumanising a practice it is. Joel Edgerton continues to he’s just as talented a writer/director as he is an actor, if not more so, with this tale of a young man attempting to find himself through this abusive process. Lucas Hedges’ lead performance is yet another stellar role in a still-young career, whilst Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman and Edgerton himself deliver some of their best work in recent years. It is a harrowing but necessary reflection of the bigotry still present in our society, and one I hope can open up a few hearts to acceptance. It seems ever more unlikely that we are ever going to see a third Raid movie, but this spiritual successor featuring two of its stars is a more than worthy substitute. The Night Comes For Us is a straightforward but compelling crime thriller that leaps quickly into the action and rarely lets up from there. Every fight sequence in this film would be the landmark scene in any western action film, but all are executed with top-notch choreography and slick cinematography and editing. Top it all off with a manic leading man turn by Joe Taslim and fun supporting turns from the likes of Iko Uwais, Zack Lee and Julie Estelle, and this is one lovers of dark, bloody action extravaganzas should not miss out on. Moonlight director Barry Jenkins once again returns to exploring the African-American experience through this emotionally devastating adaptation of the James Baldwin novel. An ever-relevant look at racial bias in the justice system, If Beale Street Could Talk somehow manages to find beauty and heart in the unjust tragedy of two lovers kept apart by prejudice. Bolstered by phenomenal performances and Nicholas Britell’s gorgeous score, this is yet another notch in Jenkins’ already well-adorned belt. Winter’s Bone director Debra Granik returns to once again explore the dark side of rural America in this sombre and affecting drama. Ben Foster’s lead performance as a veteran wracked with PTSD living in the forests of Oregon is a career best, but young Thomasin McKenzie is the true revelation here. As Foster’s precocious daughter, she holds her own against veteran actors and comes away with not just the movie but our hearts. A true indie gem likely to be looked over by general audiences and the Academy, Leave No Trace is the perfect antidote for those wanting something other than multi-million dollar blockbusters and flashy awards bait. The rape revenge sub-genre is often used merely for sleaze, and in this day and age it’s a trope we should have left behind long ago. But then here comes Revenge, a biting and relentless retort to the concept that indulges in its B movie inspirations whilst setting itself apart with a definitively feminist point-of-view. Coralie Fargeat in her feature debut directs with style and grit, painting a visceral picture that never shies away from being bloody or racy, but manages to avoid falling into exploitation. Its premise is simple and the characters basic, but they all serve the greater purpose of genre critique, and that simplicity allows the film shine with some of the best non-verbal storytelling in recent memory. Matilda Lutz’s lead performance is a star-making turn, and her character of Jen has the potential to become a cult icon for female lovers of action and horror cinema; she truly is the ultimate final girl. Apparently you can make the same movie four times and still make it work, as this 2018 remake of the 1976 remake of the 1954 remake of the 1937 original certainly proves. Who knew Lady Gaga was this good an actor or, for that matter, that Bradley Cooper was this good a singer and director? Wonderfully updating the timeless story of rising fame and fallen stardom to our modern perception of celebrity, A Star is Born will tug at the heartstrings of even those who have seen this story play out time and time again. Plus, the music is just gorgeous. Perhaps Wes Anderson should just stick to making stop-motion pictures, because that seems to be the only time I can ever stand his kitsch. Isle of Dogs is a beautifully animated and wonderfully witty animated adventure through a near-future Japan, with an all-star cast lending their voices to the slew of pups that are our heroes. Probably the most accessible film in Anderson’s catalogue to date, it has just enough cute factor to keep younger audiences engaged whilst providing oodles of hidden depths and background humour to make it an even richer experience for adults. Yorgos Lanthimos brings his peculiar view of the world to the British costume drama in this biting and unnerving dark comedy that is also effectively a twisted parody of pandering Oscar bait dramas. Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz all deliver career-best performances in this quirky look back at the politics of yesteryear, reminding us that governments have always been rife with squabbling self-serving backstabbers. Whilst The Lobster for me remains Lanthimos’ perfect treatise on his view of humanity, The Favourite is a more-than-worthy companion piece that brings the sleaze and debauchery back to a genre often lacking in it. Rapper Boots Riley makes his feature directorial debut with this wonderfully bizarre dystopian dark comedy that defies reasonable description. Most easily (if reductively) summed up as Brazil for the woke generation, Sorry to Bother You mixes biting socio-political satire and excellent performances from a varied cast with outlandish imagery and imaginative direction. There was no other movie like Sorry to Bother You this year, or in most years for that matter, and I can’t tell you much more than “go watch it” without giving away everything. This is a movie you need to see cold. Black representation in cinema was certainly big this year, but let’s not forget we also had the biggest western film with an all-Asian cast ever this year too, and a really great one at that. Crazy Rich Asians is a classic romantic comedy done right, indulging in the fantasy and glamour of the situation audiences want but also layering it with plenty of smart gags, emotional depth and social commentary. Constance Wu makes for a charming leading lady in the vein of early Julia Roberts, Henry Golding’s star-making turn could charm a hundred snakes at once, whilst Akwafina constantly threatens to steal the show. Can’t wait for the sequels! Melissa McCarthy too often sells herself short with the glut of subpar comedies she puts herself through, so colour me thankful she hasn’t forgotten who good of an actress she can actually be. A witty and filthy caper about forgery and the literary business, Can You Ever Forgive Me? balances comedy and crime expertly and McCarthy’s pathetic yet relatable performance as Lee Israel is a career-best. Richard E. Grant is equally brilliant as her flamboyant accomplice Jack Hock, giving easily his best performance in years, whilst Marielle Heller’s direction is whip smart and captivating. More movies like this please, Mrs. McCarthy! Spike Lee returns to greatness with his best and most approachable film in over a decade, telling the shocking and often even hilarious true-life tale of how a black police officer infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. John David Washington makes a strong leading man debut as Ron Stallworth, with Adam Driver ably supporting as his sceptical partner, along with Topher Grace in a surprising turn as KKK leader David Duke that will make you both cringe and laugh. With some of the best cringe-inducing comedy around and the most gut-punching final codas to a movie in recent memory, BlacKkKlansman is exactly the kind of movie we need in our racially-fraught climate. How can a franchise keep getting better after over two decades running? It’s the same question we ask every time a new Mission: Impossible movie comes out, and it’s one we may keep asking until Tom Cruise either gives up or dies. Whilst perhaps not the strongest film in regards to plot or character, Fallout wins for simply delivering some of the best action sequences of all kinds in recent memory. Every chase, every fistfight, every daring stunt; all of them shot and directed to as near to perfection you can get. There isn’t a moment in Fallout you will find boring, and I will say it again: how on Earth are they going to top this one? It’s taken a while for Drew Goddard to follow up his feature directorial debut The Cabin in the Woods, but the wait was certainly worth it in my eyes. A character-driven, non-linear multi-strand period neo-noir thriller with an all-star cast and a cavalcade of snappy duologues? It’s practically a film buff’s fantasy. Bad Times at the El Royale certainly takes a few pages from the Tarantino playbook, but moves beyond mere pastiche to say something about not only our past but also our present and possible future; trends and behaviours are cyclical, after all. Definitely the most underrated film of the year, and one I hope eventually finds the cult audience it deserves. Most YA books and their adaptations promote a filtered idea of rebellion and justice, but The Hate U Give skips the allegories and fights the real corruption in this hard-hitting but thoroughly digestible drama. Anchored together by Amandla Stenberg’s breakout lead performance, this film is unabashed in calling out police discrimination, biased media framing, cultural appropriation and casual racism without having to apologise for itself. With films like this and Love, Simon taking YA stories in a more progressive direction, I think this is truly a sign the next generation are to be trusted more than anyone in charge right now. The screenwatch subgenre has seen its fair share of usage, but it’s not caught on in the same way found footage did a decade ago. However, Searching uses the style as more than just a gimmick, telling a simple but gripping thriller mystery with nothing but webcams and Google searches. John Cho’s performance as an apathetic father launched into a desperate quest to find his daughter is a career highlight, and Aneesh Chaganty’s direction perfectly captures the paranoia and uncertainty of the internet age. A sleeper hit easily missed by many, this is one of the few films I can think of that may actually benefit from being watched on a laptop rather than on the big screen. Alfonso Cuaron only graces us with a film every so often, but every time it is so worth the wait. Returning to his routes after several big-budget outings, Roma is a simple but effective slice-of-life drama destined to go down in history as one of the masterpieces of foreign cinema. Featuring phenomenal performances from a cast of unknowns and non-actors, led by an especially heartbreaking turn by Yalitza Apricio, this is easily Cuaron’s most personal film to date. It’s a piece of cinema that, whilst mostly grounded in the mundane, finds the grandeur and cinematic potential in every conceivable moment. Cuaron’s beautiful black-and-white photography is gorgeous and features some of the best shots in cinema this year, and that beauty that makes it so tragic that most audiences (myself included) never got to see this on the big screen. On the plus side, Roma being a Netflix film means you have little excuse to miss out on it. Put aside some time, sit back, and experience the potential cinema still has as an art form."
"Feb 13, 2019",positive,"  Since 1996 and over six installments, special IMF (The Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been spectacularly ‘figuring things right in the face of danger, often without a plan. In Fallout , Hunt is older and wiser, but definitely not slower. He’s still as slick and smooth, but now he takes time once in a while to pant a little and catch his breath.   ‘Same old Ethan’ is at it again and as the franchise is wont to do, there’s a larger-than-life plot where the world is at stake yet again and only one man can save the day. There’s a thrilling plot, with plenty of delicious subterfuge, one-upmanship and double crossing. But that’s not the lure of a Mission: Impossible  film. Cruise’s highest grossing film series lassos in its fans with a different charm; it’s the death-defying stunts, the pleasurably perfect fitting of implausible puzzle pieces and of course, the actor himself.  Mission: Impossible - Fall OutDirector: Christopher McQuarrieCast: Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin, Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, Vanessa KirbyStoryline: Terrorist outfit, Syndicate wants to destroy the world with plutonium activated portable nuclear weapons. Agent Ethan Hunt has to once again save the day. Fallout is possibly the best of the six Mission  films, with director Christopher McQuarrie (also behind 2015’s Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation ) upping the ante magnificently. The film’s plot is complicated enough to lull you into a sense of comfort with its slightly arduous first hour. But when things start unravelling, it does so by keeping you constantly at the edge of your seat. No one quite does a chase like Cruise and Fallout  has them all, from an on-foot cat-and-mouse game to speed boats and even cars. Hunt on a motorcycle will give you all the necessary adrenaline to want to ride invincibly against the flow of traffic. And for the final knock-down punch, there’s a helicopter sequence above snow-clad mountains with gunfire thousands of feet in the air.   In Fallout , three plutonium cores will be used to make portable nuclear devices that can destroy the world. To secure them, Hunt has to pluck the leader of terrorist outfit Syndicate, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) off a police convoy. Previous characters like Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) and fellow agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) return. Then there’s the addition of CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill sporting that controversial moustache that got his Superman in trouble in Justice League ).   McQuarrie’s action is superb, at times involving hand-to-hand combat — often with the conspicuous absence of a background score — is intense and potent without the swiftness of an orchestrated and practised attack. Cavill especially shines during his fights, a break from his character’s composed demeanour. It’s easy enough lose yourself in the director’s sleight of hand, but Hunt’s crazy stunts will certainly yank you back to earth. McQuarrie who has also written Fallout , crafts a rewarding blockbuster, succeeding in pushing the envelope with the right dose of humour, an unprecedented amount of action and an explosive bang’s worth of entertainment for your buck.

"Feb 11, 2019",positive," No one expected Mission: Impossible – Fallout to be bad, but the risk of repetition runs rampant. Any fears that this franchise would flounder without its trademark one-and-done directors can be promptly put to bed – Rogue Nation this ain’t. Christopher McQuarrie’s second shot is a reinvention of his own gold standard, building on the successes and motifs of the five before it and making something new – and better. Not content with making the series’ best instalment (sorry M:I2), McQuarrie and Cruise may have delivered the entire genre’s greatest entry. Once MIF hits screens, Bond and Bourne – both evoked throughout – no longer have a scratch on Ethan Hunt. Ultimate action hero Tom Cruise crushes his performance (and his ankle) in his defining role. Equal parts superman and, somehow, every-man, the relentless drive and energy he puts into this project is clear in every scene. Famed for doing his own stunts, it’s not meant to be this hard to say which of the many, many exceptionally imagined set-pieces is the most impressive – viewers are spoilt for choice. Rebecca Ferguson – one of the best parts of the excellent Rogue Nation – returns in a much reduced role and, however smartly it’s toyed with, the plot can be obvious. These can be forgiven however, for making the longest of six films feel the shortest, jamming it full of action and humour, using exquisite craftsmanship in both look and sound, and giving us Henry Cavill’s moustache. Few films truly deserve to be seen on the biggest screen you can find, but this is certainly one of them. One problem: there is not a screen large enough to contain the eye-popping, heart-stopping spectacle and thrill that is Mission: Impossible – Fallout. This summer’s – year’s – must see marvel.  Moonlighting as a reviewer and editor, I'm more at home with recent films than golden oldies and enjoy appreciating the technical achievements as much as the escapism of the movies. Happy to try any film once, if only for fifteen minutes.
I also volunteer with MediCinema - a charity which every film fan should look into if they don't already know about."
"Feb 6, 2019",positive,"[Mission: Impossible - Fallout] once again relies on coherent, well-executed action set pieces, a few moments of winking dialogue and Cruise's complete willingness to hurl himself headlong into harm's way if it might allow him to win our love."
"Feb 1, 2019",positive,Christopher McQuarrie has brought together a great cast and crew to bring his screenplay to life.
"Jan 31, 2019",positive," Tom Cruise is still out here defying the laws of time and space — and “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” proves it. The sixth film in the 22-years-and-counting franchise opens at the box office this weekend to a lot of buzz. This a blockbuster that somehow feels like it’s been two decades in the making; the end result of a slow distillation of the action genre. It is unfettered by such problems as ""logic,"" ""realism,"" or ""physics."" It is two hours of marveling at a man four years shy of 60 doing all his own stunts. It is surprisingly old-fashioned in its message that there are still good people in government who care about the individual welfare as well as the greater good. But to really appreciate this latest impossible mission, one must understand all of the missions that have come before it. The original film was part of an earlier, smaller reboot era during the mid 1990s, when Hollywood mined TV shows from the 1960s and 1970s for big screen fodder. (“The Brady Bunch Movie” was released in 1995, “George of the Jungle” in 1997, “Mission: Impossible” in 1996.) Like the TV show before it, “Mission Impossible” was a spy thriller loosely inspired by James Bond. The film was popular enough to warrant a second installment in 2000, but that felt like the end of the line. And it was, until 2006, when star and producer Tom Cruise decided to reboot the franchise with J.J. Abrams at the helm. (Cruise and his producing partner at the time, Paula Wagner, backed the entire project, and Cruise took a major pay cut to make sure it stayed within budget.) Since then, Cruise has put out a new ""Mission Impossible"" roughly every three years, each of which has slowly improved on the last. This a blockbuster that somehow feels like it’s been two decades in the making; the end result of a slow distillation of the action genre. The problem with action movies in general is that they are fight-first, plot-second endeavors. Many times the story, no matter how simple, is pushed aside to make room for stunt work and combat sequences. “Mission: Impossible,” as a franchise, has had five directors over six films, each of whom has attempt (or hasn't) to solve these issues in their own way. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is notable for being the only film in the franchise with a returning director, Christopher McQuarrie, who helmed the last installment, “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.” McQuarrie’s familiarity with the material, as well as the decision to draw upon the events of the last adventure, makes this film feel less like a standalone project and more like a traditional sequel. Ultimately this is a good thing, because it helps the film balance plot coherence with action, all while maintaining the proper tone. The plot of the movie isn’t that important, and a description of it would sound ridiculous anyway. All viewers need to remember is that Tom Cruise is a good guy, and Henry Cavill is not. Everything else, including characters who flip from bad to good, sometimes in the same scene, is secondary. But as long as the audience remembers that whatever Cavill’s character, the hilariously named August Walker, is doing is bad, and whatever Cruise’s character Ethan Hunt does — even when it makes zero sense — is good, they’ll be able to follow the twists and turns. This binary simplicity also hearkens back to the original TV show’s roots. Launched in the 1960s, it was a show about the good people of the government taking down the bad forces of chaos, maintaining law and order in a world where the social order was rapidly changing. But as cynicism about the American government’s intensions grew, shows that lauded them uncritically decreased in popularity. In order to keep up with the times, the 1996 film finds Ethan Hunt being double-crossed by his government, allowing the agent to be good, but the government to be bad. Over the years, that cynicism has slowly faded. The newest installment ends with a CIA official (Angela Bassett) all but apologizing on behalf of America, having seen the error of her ways, and pledging to help keep governmental institutions honest from now on. If only it were so easy. Believing in the good of complex institutions, like the government, is an important aspect of Cruise’s character. This maybe makes sense, given that in real life, Cruise is one of the world’s most famous believers in institutions some would call questionable. And make no mistake; this is his film. Of course, so has every other “Mission: Impossible” — he’s produced them all. But there’s something uniquely personal about this franchise. Cruise has played a lot of roles over his career, plenty of them award-winning. His time in the spotlight has also been exceedingly rocky. But somewhere around the mid-aughts, it feels like Cruise decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life playing Ethan Hunt. The publicity tour for “Mission: Impossible III” went about as badly for him personally as possible — most people don’t remember now, but his infamous couch-jumping incident  was actually supposed to be in service of his sexy action hero comeback. And yet, Cruise didn't really care how much his reputation suffered or even how much critics like his movies — he was going to make more anyway. The dogged perseverance — rain, shine, or march of time be damned — is also partly why the films keep getting better, as Cruise and company figure out what works and what doesn't. And what works is Cruise-as-stuntman. While superhero films are full of stuntmen and CGI, Cruise’s old-fashioned commitment to doing his own stunts, with as little CGI as possible, lends a real superhero — or at least superhuman — feel to the films. Born in 1962, Cruise is 56 years old. He doesn’t look it, however, as his face seems eternally frozen at 39 ½. This phenomenon — impressive, if a little creepy— is made more obvious by the franchise’s only co-star to last all six movies, Ving Rhames. Rhames, who at 59 is three years Cruise’s senior, looks like a man who has grown too old for this stuff. Not Cruise. Whether running at top speed along rooftops, jumping out of windows, or flying flaming helicopters aimed at Henry Cavill’s face, Cruise’s endurance is extraordinary. But if Cruise is the greatest thing about “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” he’s also its greatest weakness. His character, Hunt, does not have the trading faces-and-actors timelessness of James Bond, because he’s only ever been played by one actor. So while the franchise may have finally hit its stride, its star seems determined to play the lead until he dies. And no matter how good his training regimen (and medical team), the idea that Cruise will be able to keep doing this at 59 or 62 seems like its own mission impossible. On the other hand, with box office estimates predicting Cruise will have the biggest opening weekend of his career — ever — I wouldn't be surprised if audiences and critics are marveling at his stamina once again in another three years.

"Jan 29, 2019",positive," Under the direction of Christopher McQuarrie, “Mission Impossible - Fallout” is the follow up to “Rogue Nation”. The sixth installment of the MI franchise continues to incorporate Tom Cruise as IMF agent and team leader Ethan Hunt. For the present adventure he teams up with his loyal friend Luther (Ving Rhames), IMF field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and CIA assassin, August Walker (Henry Cavill), hired to control all his moves.  They all engage on a suicide mission in an attempt to dismantle The Apostles, a terrorist group that emerged from the extint The Syndicate, after the capture of its anarchic leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The group is illegally dealing plutonium cores in Europe and Hunt is assigned to retrieve the hazardous material. However, the secret agents fail to accomplish the mission in Berlin when Ethan decides to put Luther’s life in first place, leaving the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), in a pile of nerves. With the agent’s double life featured through an encounter with his estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), the film advances at high speed, relying on the tension created by interminable and often overdone motorcycle/car chases that take us to inevitably packed crossroads and confined dead alleys. Besides this, we have supplementary manhunt mania in Kashmir, this time involving a plane and a helicopter; agile physical confrontations; advanced technology methods; and dangerous transactions with sudden ambushes. Co-produced by McQuarrie, Cruise, JJ Abrams (“Super 8”; “Star Trek”; “Star Wars: The Force awakens”), and Jake Myers (“Dunkirk”, “The Revenant”, “Interstellar”), this blockbuster satisfies in its purpose but doesn’t earn the title of ‘impossible to miss’."
"Jan 19, 2019",positive,"Such will be Cruise's monument, and to quote Watership Down, perhaps it would not have displeased him."
"Jan 19, 2019",positive," “Mission: Impossible” is a rare franchise that gets better with age. The trilogy reboot during this decade easily surpasses the previous three. The big, bold and breathtaking ‘Ghost Protocol‘ and impossibly thrilling ‘Rogue Nation‘ are now topped with ‘Fallout.’ While each “Mission Impossible” is typically a standalone movie, ‘Fallout’ is a fallout of ‘Rogue Nation.’ Villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) might have been captured and his Syndicate organization got dismantled, but his network isn’t totally obliterated. His associates have formed Apostles and proceeded with his mission of a new world order; disrupting government structures and creating anarchy through sabotage, strategic assassinations, and mass-annihilation. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise; “Edge of Tomorrow,” “Oblivion,” “Jack Reacher“) failed a mission in Belfast because he refused to sacrifice his team, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg).  Plutonium canisters are now in the hands of the bad guys, which will be used for nuclear bombs. The CIA now gets involved, to the dismay of the secretary of IMF, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Head Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett, “Black Panther”) assigns an agent, August Walker (Henry Cavill, “ Justice League,” “Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice“, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.“), to accompany the IMF team to recover the canisters. To say that things are not as straightforward is an understatement. There’s arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) tangled in the web and she may or may not be what she seems to be.  British operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, “The Greatest Showman”) shows up, and like in ‘Rogue Nation,’ her intention and allegiance are not always clear. Even the CIA itself is fractured and there may be an enemy within. Layers of twists and turns have always been the hallmark of the “Mission: Impossible” series and it’s something that distinguishes the series from generic action movies. This, and Cruise himself.  He may just be a superspy himself, defying age and limits of the human body.  He continually performs death-defying feats with incredible audacity, vitality, and velocity. After scaling the Burj Khalifa and clinging to the side of an airplane in past movies, he thrusts into a brutal brawl, skydives in a lightning storm, rides a motorcycle sans helmet against Paris traffic, sprints across London rooftops, leaps between buildings, climbs up a rope tied to flying helicopter and free falls onto its cargo, takes control of the cockpit and engages in a heli pursuit in Khasmir, barrels down inside the heli dangling from the mountaintop, and scales a rock face to get to a detonator. See it in 3-D if you can. Close-ups of Cruise doing daredevil acts and clear sweeping panorama make the scenes suspenseful and breathtaking to watch. Christopher McQuarrie (“The Tourist“), the only director invited back a second time in the series, films the scenes with deft direction and precise execution. ‘Fallout’ has multiple crosses, switcheroos, surprises, old-fashioned stunts, relentless pace and total momentum.  It also manages to touch into Ethan’s personal backstory and internal sacrifice he’s made. The personal sacrifice is what enables Ethan Hunt to continue to do what he does. At this point in his life, his relationship with his ghost of a wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan, “Source Code”) is in a good place and he may finally be ready to move on.

"Dec 31, 2018",positive,No movie [this year] delivered spectacle better or more consistently for its running time.
"Dec 31, 2018",positive," Fallout brings little that is new to the Mission: Impossible franchise. It also brings everything that is new. It’s not a contradiction as you would assume. To the first point, it follows similar currents that the other films established, such as death-defying missions with death-defying stunts, villains wanting to overturn the current world order, the reliable sidekicks (Pegg, Rhames), the beautiful love interests (Ferguson, Monaghan), and all sorts of psych-outs and last-minute reversals that will make you giddy like Lucille Bluth whenever she’s fooled by Gene Parmesan. Oh, you bet I threw that Arrested Development reference in there on purpose. Don’t knock me for it. As to the second point, well, I think we can all agree Tom Cruise has never flirted with death so closely before. This film makes all his prior stunts look like cakewalks. The HALO jump is, of course, a spectacular set piece in itself, but I was probably more nervous watching him zig and zag through Parisian traffic on that motorcycle. And then scaling that cliffside while nuclear bombs were seconds away from detonating. You know everything will turn out fine, as it always does, but that Ethan Hunt cuts it too close. Combined with Cruise’s unfulfilled death wish, and you’ve got excitement piled on excitement. How did audiences stay in their seats during this? Did they? I could barely stay in mine. While I really do like this (and I really do), the script’s bulk can be felt at certain times. The extended helicopter chase didn’t need to be extended, for instance. It’s the only set piece that I felt dragged on longer than it should have. I also wish they gave Vanessa Kirby’s character a better arc. She seems to be included here as more of a plot device, and considering how good she is whenever she’s onscreen, it’s a shame she’s dropped as soon as her impact is made. It would’ve been neat, for instance, had she taken over Ilsa Faust’s role and was the black-clad assassin on the motorcycle instead of Ferguson. As it is, I hope Kirby is allowed to return for the next one (assuming there will be a next one). Ultimately, my favourite thing about this entry is its heart. The performances from people like Rhames, Ferguson and Monaghan have a purity to them that makes you care about this high-octane extravaganza—and its death-cheating action hero. The thematic preoccupation with a single life being just as important as the lives of millions is also a nice bit of humanism. A touching attribute of Hunt’s that centers why we continually root for him. It’s easy to write it all off as Tom Cruise playing himself, but it’s not that simple. In many ways, Cruise is playing a version of himself that he would like to be. A version that can walk the tightrope of mortality and help those in the most danger. It’s a version that will never translate to the real world, but heck, who cares? Let the man escape death if he wants to. We’ll be watching for as long as he does."
"Dec 22, 2018",positive," When it comes to the Mission: Impossible film franchise, there’s the John Woo installment and then there’s all the rest. That is to say, there’s Mission: Impossible II, the sole bad entry in the series, and then there are the other chapters, all of which have been remarkably consistent in delivering high-caliber thrills. This designation includes the sixth and latest picture, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, and it’s hardly a knock to state that it’s not quite as compelling as all the other non-Woo endeavors. It may not ascend to any new heights, but it also won’t send viewers home disappointed. Tom Cruise has spent this series playing Superman rather than Everyman, but here he takes it a step further: His character of Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt is now basically God, lording over his domain, bestowing his blessings on the worshipful mortals around him, and remaining indestructible no matter how hard the Satanic emissaries in his midst try to bring him down. In this entry, Hunt has his hands full trying to retrieve three plutonium cores that were stolen from right under his nose (hey, even God makes mistakes). Negotiations to recover the cores involve releasing master anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, returning from Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation) from imprisonment, a proposition that leaves Hunt queasy. Also thrown into the mix is special agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), ordered by CIA head Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) to tag along with Hunt and his trusted accomplices Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Clearly, Walker has a hidden agenda, but Hunt is equally as preoccupied with the reemergence of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), returning to the espionage fold in order to take out Lane. Folks not familiar with the M:I series will need a scorecard to keep track of the various characters, but then again, would anybody be foolish enough to join an existing franchise for its sixth installation? Just know that Alec Baldwin returns as IMF Secretary Alan Hunley, Jeremy Renner does not return as IMF agent William Brandt (hey, remember when Renner was briefly being groomed as the new M:I face until Cruise apparently decided he wasn’t ready to put himself out to pasture?), and The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby joins the ensemble as an ebullient black marketer known as the White Widow. Even as far back as Brian De Palma’s original film from 1996, many of the muscular action set-pieces showcased in this series defy belief, and the ones featured in this latest picture dutifully follow suit. Yet the exhilaration they promote provides most of them with a free pass — the same can’t always be said for the vehicular chases, and this movie offers back-to-back dashes that eventually prove wearying. Then there’s the case of Cavill — his character of the mysterious August Walker is intriguing, but he remains such a stiff performer that some of the life is drained from the scenes in which he’s required to convey ambiguity. Ultimately, though, these are minor quibbles when compared to the energy and exuberance flowing through the majority of the picture. Don’t expect any crippling fallout to greet the release of Mission: Impossible — Fallout; on the contrary, it’s safe to assume that a seventh installment is already making its way to the drawing board. Now whether Cruise will remain in the Hunt remains to be seen."
"Dec 22, 2018",positive," There isn’t much left to say about “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” While overall it’s not quite as great of a film as you’ve heard, it rates an A+ when it comes to rousing action. The practical stunts are hair-raising, and it’s far and away the best film in the franchise. You likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster, but I will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible. It’s frantic and fun, setting the bar high for mainstream action films. Featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history, the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography. When the clock starts ticking, there’s a thrilling sense of real danger — especially when Tom Cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter. It’s a visual stunner that isn’t burdened with flashy CGI effects, which in itself is refreshing. Cruise, who famously does most of his own stunts, shows that he’s never too old to be a credible action hero. His Ethan Hunt is flawed, but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us. He’s one of America’s last true movie stars, and he outdoes himself here. The likable supporting players (Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames) are sadly still playing second fiddle, with the exception of Henry Cavill as a tagalong CIA suit. A perfect film it’s not, but it’s awfully easy to overlook the problems (a textbook story, the draggy length, some nonsensical plot holes, Alec Baldwin‘s distracting and shouty non-performance) because this movie is all about one thing: the thrilling action scenes. There are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite, although I could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work. And that’s what audiences will flock to see. The plot doesn’t really play a significant factor in the creative (if mostly unbelievable) story, and its twists grow from “wow, that’s cool” to ridiculous eye-rolling whoppers. No true lover of action films will care, because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words: “buckle up.” Not my type of film Louisa, but you’ve certainly done it justice with your review. I’m sorely tempted. I may send my son a text saying “take a look!” In fact it seems like the type of film I’d be prepared to see at Gold Class (luxury seating). spot on review.  it was predictable at times but I didn’t mind.  Action is an understatement.  Advise your readers that if they do go see this, don’t forget to breathe."
"Dec 21, 2018",positive," One thing you can expect in a Mission: Impossible movie is a yawning wide shot of some exotic cityscape, populated by a sole, tiny figure: producer-star Tom Cruise, whose construction of this monster franchise around himself is a corollary to the image itself. Cruise could never top the previous M:I installment, Rogue Nation (2015), in which he hangs off the side of an airplane (for real) at 5,000 feet, but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, returning from the last film, honors the series’ perfect formula of a user-friendly plot (anarchists have acquired plutonium; they must be stopped) and epic action sequences. Ironically, the most entertaining element of all may be the star’s advancing age; Cruise, well into his 50s, scores numerous laughs as the increasingly confused and harried CIA agent Ethan Hunt, leaping into one spectacular stunt after another and then wishing he hadn’t. With Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson."
"Dec 21, 2018",positive," “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” starts out strong and gets better and better. And then, just when you know it can’t get any better than it already is, it gets even better than that, until everybody staggers out of the theater exhausted and exhilarated. It’s what a summer movie used to be and should be. It’s just terrific. Before the credits are even flashed onto the screen, “Fallout” has already delivered more excitement, narrative interest and surprises than most action movies do in two hours. The thought crosses the mind: Where can it go from here? The answer is pretty much everywhere. It keeps on going and going, following one exciting sequence with another and then another. There are two things to marvel at, aside from the fact that Tom Cruise is 56  and only now has begun to look like he might be in his 40s. The first is how these action sequences are devised. Most action movies deal in cliches, and their only innovation is to make the cliches bigger — bigger explosions, bigger car crashes, bigger chases — and it never really works. But “Fallout” consistently demonstrates an astonishing creative invention in these sequences. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (“Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation”) comes up with new ways of doing things, and new ways within those ways. Every time you think you’ve outguessed him, you haven’t. The second marvel is yet more impressive, and that’s that the effectiveness of the action has to do with more than thrills and titillation. In “Fallout,” every leap, chase and tense moment is bound to the story and to the personal relationships within that story. Having Cruise at the center certainly helps — everybody likes Tom Cruise, including all the people who tell you they don’t, and so there’s a rooting interest. But this goes beyond Cruise. This is story construction, character creation and a directorial instinct for when to ease off the pedal and when to floor it. The stakes are high — of course  they are. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is given a choice assignment, to find three silver-colored balls of plutonium, a little bigger than a bocce ball, that have been stolen from the Russians and are being sold on the black market. He teams up with his crew, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), and goes to make the purchase, but ends up blowing the assignment. He screws up for some good reasons, but he screws up all the same, and the plutonium gets into the hands of a nihilistic terror group that thinks that the path to peace is through great suffering, or some nonsense like that. So now Ethan has to find the terrorists, and also the people working with the terrorists, and he has to assume a false identity for a time, and hang out in Paris and London and somewhere in Asia. ... He’s doing all sorts of things, while people are coming at him from every direction, and while one of his own men, played by Henry Cavill, is plotting to discredit him. Yet as complicated as “Fallout” is, and as difficult it would be to describe, with certainty, every turn of the story and what it means, the movie is always clear in terms of what’s going on in the moment. For example, there’s a scene in Paris, in which Ethan and his group are trying to steal a heavily guarded prisoner from the French police. But in order to do so, they have to double-cross the underworld characters they’re working with and manage, somehow, not to hurt a single Paris policeman. The sequence seems to go on for about a half hour, and every moment is specific and riveting. And that’s not even the best sequence in the movie. One of the least appreciated things about Cruise, in general, is that the women in his action movies are rarely appendages. They’re always in the thick of things, and they’re always interesting in their own right. Rebecca Ferguson is back as Ilsa, complicating everything by showing up on a motorcycle and shooting at people, for reasons that become clear only later. Michelle Monaghan has somewhat less fun as Ethan’s ex-wife, but Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret on Netflix’s “The Crown”) is full of insinuation and mischief as an international arms broker known as White Widow, smiling at Cruise like she’s about to devour him, and acting like a villainess  on the old “Batman” TV show. Of course, one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that so much of what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are tangible. With “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” Cruise and McQuarrie have made the best film in the franchise’s history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie  in several years.

"Dec 18, 2018",positive," If you go to a bachelorette party on an island and the other guests put a huge bloody fish head on your pillow, you are in a horror movie, not a rom-com. Maybe at this point in the history of capitalism there’s not much difference. Crazy Rich Asians looks more like a glossy tourist magazine produced for an international economics summit than a movie. While Henry Golding just misses the mark at being an actual Anglo-Asian Cary Grant (maybe next time), Constance Wu, playing an Asian American everywoman, comes off generic, a paper doll dressed first as a professor, then as a Disney princess. Among the too numerous cast, Ronny Chieng and Victoria Loke stand out as a sarcastic, mean-spirited young husband and wife who despise each other, unlike the unmemorable Gemma Chan and Pierre Png, who play a more prominent, unfunny version of the same thing. I would gladly watch an entire movie about Chieng and Loke’s shallow, disrespectful, well-dressed irritants wasting their fortune while struggling to maintain their status. The film is framed by a satirical lecture featuring Alec Baldwin as a John Birch Society racist and documentary footage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which Heather Heyer was killed by someone who could be this Baldwin character’s grandson. What comes in between is an action-comedy that supposedly takes place in Colorado and mixes together, in standard Spike Lee style, police investigations, black-history lessons, ruminations on genre cinema, and a dismantling of The Birth of a Nation. Complaints that BlacKkKlansman valorizes cops are moot, since this film could not exist without them any more than a Sidney Lumet film like Serpico or Prince of the City could. Just like in those films, the cops here are a rogues’ gallery of New York types, now transposed to Colorado. Their dialogue slips into a version of, “Eyyy, I’m John Turturro’s brother, are we gonna get these Klan scumbags or what?” Adding to this Brooklyn feeling, a triumphant scene takes place in Sunny’s waterfront bar in Red Hook. Lee establishes the scene with Sunny’s red-and-green anchor-and-dolphin neon sign, showing us that this is just one of those nautical-themed saloons you find a county over from the Rocky Mountains. Lee made the didactic BlacKkKlansman to move audiences, which he succeeds in doing despite the feeling that the film has been stitched together from everywhere. If the love scenes between John David Washington and Laura Harrier fall flat (unlike their period hairdos), it’s because they are the bland good people in this movie, which foregrounds actors like Ashlie Atkinson, who plays the self-deluded, racist wife of a Klan goon like she’s a transplant from the Bensonhurst of The Honeymooners. The film works well when Washington puts on his white voice to prank call Klansmen. He aspirates the word white with the precision Diane Keaton brought to the word wheat in Love and Death, without the crutch of being dubbed by a white comic as in Sorry to Bother You. His phone routines could have gone on longer, which would have added to the satiric intensity of the movie more than Alec Baldwin’s slideshow meltdown. Alec Baldwin is everywhere in 2018 as a bigheaded, squinty illustration of American authority’s collapse. In the latest Mission: Impossible movie he returns as Tom Cruise’s boss, the leader of a spy agency more rogue than the CIA. His confrontations with Angela Bassett, as the CIA’s head, are tepid. They distract from Cruise’s epic struggle to maintain his status as an action hero, a fight Cruise wins via grueling stunt work on the roofs of the world. Cruise is a live-action testament to his own ability to take punishment, a kind of human sacrifice. He is undiminished by both time and all the semi-comedy around him, which is the story of his career and his life. Mission: Impossible – Fallout begins with a harrowing dream sequence, like Vanilla Sky. Called into question at his wedding as a failure who puts his loved ones in jeopardy, Cruise spends the rest of the film trying to make up for it by putting random people in danger, up to and including everyone in China, India, and Pakistan — a third of the world’s population and a substantial market for films like this. Everyone who is not in Cruise’s squad is formidable: Vanessa Kirby as a British arms dealer more threatening and coolly appealing than any woman in a recent Bond film; Sean Harris as a Steve Bannonesque alleged mastermind strapped to a chair. Watching Cruise relentlessly pursue and destroy Henry Cavill’s double-crossing CIA hunk, whose dialogue seemed dubbed, was really satisfying. If anyone has earned the right to victory over a British superhero actor twenty years his junior with a porn mustache, it’s the movie star who has managed to avoid the trite universes of DC and Marvel, even if it took being in that mummy film to do it. In the first Equalizer, Denzel Washington played an ex–intelligence agent working at a Home Depot in East Boston, Massachusetts. What made that movie work was how real Washington and director Antoine Fuqua made employment at Home Depot feel, as if someone involved had done time in the PVC pipe and lumber aisles. They had the layout down. The new one starts with Washington disguised as an imam on a train in Turkey, with a big beard, a white skullcap, and black-frame eyeglasses, a look he pulls off better than anyone else in the past thousand years. While this is a change from working at Home Depot, The Equalizer 2 is not quite a Mission: Impossible movie. Soon he is back in Boston, where he now works as a Lyft driver and still lives alone in a small apartment. During one of his shifts, he breaks into the hotel room of a drunken misogynist fare, a finance bro, to teach him and his buddies a lesson. Between the train scene and the Lyft driving, The Equalizer 2 begins with a lot of momentum. It dissipates as attention shifts to Washington’s former spy colleagues. Confrontations with them in a suburban driveway and at a beach house in a deserted seaside town during a hurricane indicate movement away from the working class, toward the kind of real estate ex–intelligence agents are more likely to inhabit. Fuqua stages it all with a kind of Anthony Mann intensity and attention to space, but The Equalizer 2 will probably end up being the only action movie to ever leave me wanting more scenes of the protagonist working for a rideshare app, or at least the only one since Jamie Foxx invented Uber in Collateral. Will (Ben Foster), a veteran with PTSD, and his adolescent daughter, Tom (Thomasin McKenzie), live hard-core off the grid in a state forest in the Pacific Northwest. After yuppie hikers discover their lean-to and report them to the rangers, Will and Tom are relocated to a tree farm in an isolated community with a church and a school. There, Tom is exposed for the first time to people her own age. She makes contact with a dude who looks like a refugee from a Gus Van Sant film, or a guy from a grunge band like the Screaming Trees, a name that makes sense in this context. Tom wants to join 4-H with him so she can learn to take care of animals. Will, however, cannot abide the confinement of the small house he and his daughter have been assigned, nor can he tolerate the war-battle noise of the helicopters that haul away trees to be sold at Christmastime. “We can still think our own thoughts,” he tells Tom when they move in, but the conformity of the simple life blots out thought for him, a man for whom peace of mind is impossible in human society. Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace is the director’s belated return to feature filmmaking after Winter’s Bone in 2010. Like Captain Fantastic from a couple of years ago, but with much more art, grace, and a sense of actual danger — perhaps because it is set among the homeless, perhaps because it was made by a woman — Leave No Trace restates the male Gen-X narrative of protecting children from the outside world and their eventual reintegration into it. For Foster’s Will, there is no redemption, unlike Viggo Mortensen’s character in Captain Fantastic. Will is a permanent exile who turns his back on the world, too damaged to change despite the chances offered him. Foster plays him somber and unlikable, in a performance of confusion and quiet self-righteousness that leads him to expose his daughter to frostbite, rides from truckers, and housebreaking. When Tom finally abandons him, he slinks back into the woods, a hermit turning his back on the film he’s in. Granik pulls away to a God’s-eye view of this figure as he disappears. The enigmatic American filmmaker Rob Tregenza’s last feature film before Gavagai came out twenty years ago. As in Leave No Trace, in Gavagai a man (Andreas Lust) goes into the woods alone. Unfriendly and embittered, he arrives in a remote Norwegian town and hires a driver (Mikkel Gaup) to take him farther north for reasons he doesn’t explain. This is not a road film in which two men wax philosophical and overcome their differences on a journey through the European countryside, like in those Trip movies and TV shows with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, “from acclaimed director Michael Winterbottom.” Tregenza shoots quiet people in long takes with complicated camera moves. The two men barely speak and never quite bond. Tregenza is not sketching the wistful unhappiness of the moneyed creative class so much as staring into the divide between souls. The man’s journey comes to an end short of his destination. In the rain on a cliff overlooking an expanse of forest, he rips up his late wife’s translations of the Norwegian writer Tarjei Vesaas and flings them into the wind. His anger, destructive and futile, seems to compound his wife’s death by destroying what’s left of her work. Gavagai is a film about the impossibility of closure and the endlessness of grief. The title comes from the analytic philosopher W. V. Quine’s Word and Object, in which Quine invents the word gavagai to use as an example of that-which-is-untranslatable. Tregenza and his coscenarist Kirk Kjeldsen have translated, it seems, the poems of Vesaas into mood and atmosphere. The poems haunt Gavagai in this confrontation with the void. Sometimes they appear in the form of the man’s wife, a ghost who shows up as an awkward memory-in-translation. In the end, the man and the film are both wise to abandon this image and return to life around a fire at dusk. This Belgian genre film, a delirious, unpleasant mash-up of a poliziottesco and a spaghetti western, shot in Corsica, is as violent as it is arty. A heist-gone-wrong set in and around a villa and a cave, it features a cast of treacherous, criminal zeroes, bohemians, and cops, and it doesn’t let up on the violence or the artiness. While adapting Jean-Patrick Manchette novels for the screen is as inevitable as it is desirable, this one seems to exist only as a music video for Ennio Morricone’s score. As a music video, it’s a shocker but too long. As a feature film, it’s pointless and repetitive, especially the squeaking-leather-pants sound effect that recurs over and over again. Manchette’s novels are latter-day séries noires, fast-paced, destructive critiques of capitalism from the era of urban terrorism in Europe. Few of their characters survive. In Let the Corpses Tan none do, and the grimness is not ironic or critical, just maggoty. The film does give off that “I’m on drugs” feel (specifically of bad speed), but it’s so labor-intensive that, like many a trip, it should have ended a long time ago. Elina Löwensohn’s presence as a witchy bisexual and often-nude painter is almost as mysterious as Morricone’s contract must have been. I hope Löwensohn made money, because busy-bee deconstructionists with many-itemed shot lists like codirectors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani should pay their actors by the frame. The cinema is moving in all directions as endless new content crams itself into every available space. This is leading to new kinds of international cross-border weirdness, as films, more than ever, are shot wherever the money is. It’s not just Belgians in Corsica imitating Italians, or Brooklyn playing Colorado, or North Carolina as California, or Toronto and Vancouver as anywhere else. Now, in Mandy, we get Belgium as both the Pacific Northwest and the bowels of hell, starring Nicolas Cage. Emerging from the same cross-contaminated genre swamp as Let the Corpses Tan, Mandy achieves its goals with blunter and larger instruments, which is all the better, because where Corpses fails, Mandy succeeds. If Corpses was a music video, Mandy is a whole doom-metal opera in poisonous Technicolor, with an album cover depicting a landscape of magenta, indigo, and golden-yellow ruins. The film is like that Bell Witch album that only has one ninety-minute-long track. It opens with King Crimson’s “Starless” on the sound track, playing before a clip from a Ronald Reagan speech about “spiritual awakening.” It’s 1983 and Cage, a lumberjack, lives in the woods with his girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), a weird-fiction fan who works in a tiny country grocery store and speaks like Patti Smith reading the poem at the beginning of “The Revenge of Vera Gemini” — a British person’s version of unaffected Americanness. Riseborough’s slight New Jersey inflection points to where Mandy lets in real life. One of the film’s principle pleasures is that for all its splashy-morose color schemes and arty dissolves, its death cult maintains the feeling of unemployed oafs from Neptune, New Jersey, worshipping Satan in Ramapo Mountain State Forest. The film is pure acid trip with a macaroni-and-cheese commercial thrown in. (TV commercials are the worst thing to see on hallucinogenic drugs.) Cage howls in pain and screams in despair, breaking out in occasional intelligibility only to say things like, “Don’t be negative.” By the end, as a grimy, wounded Cage stands with a chain saw in front of a burning car and still hasn’t avenged his girlfriend or saved anyone else from the drug-addicted demons/private-press recording artists, it becomes obvious what director Panos Cosmatos has delivered here: a parody of “the hero’s journey” on par with Kanye West’s use of that phrase in the Oval Office while describing Donald Trump to himself. Panos Cosmatos knows a lot of things about making movies, including that you show the burning cars. And yet he’s no Lee Chang-dong, who fails to fully reveal a burning Porsche that’s an important plot point in his new film. Lee does show Donald Trump, however, on a TV in the protagonist’s apartment, using the original Cheddar Goblin to add to the sense of unease in this unique serial-killer mystery. And unlike Let the Corpses Tan, Burning raises actual questions about money and its effects on people’s lives. Burning, like Psycho and L’avventura, starts off as a film about a woman, Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo), who appears to be its subject and star. While working her job hawking cell phone accessories in a miniskirt, she reconnects with Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), a poverty-stricken aspiring writer she knew in high school. After they hook up, she leaves for a solo trip to Africa and returns with a new friend, Ben, played by the American actor Steven Yeun in a subtle, nuanced performance that shifts between friendly-classy and “I’m a secret arsonist.” Ben is a young member of Gangnam’s idle class, and neither Hae-mi nor Jong-su fit in there. After Hae-mi begins to date Ben, she disappears again. Jong-su quizzes Ben about her absence and slowly comes to realize something isn’t quite right with this slick, fashionable dude who starts reading Faulkner because Jong-su mentioned him, one of the film’s slyest condemnations of rich-person poaching. Burning refuses to reveal what actually happened to Hae-mi, or what kind of person Ben really is, if he is any type at all, which leaves Jong-su in a terrifying moral limbo. All three of the film’s main characters are dispensed with by Lee in this unsentimental movie that shows human connection as fragile and masked when the friends are unequal. Hae-mi, dismissed from the film the earliest and seemingly with ease, in a way gets off the easiest of these characters, because there’s no way to know what happened to her. She’s kooky and a searcher but also just an innocent victim. But of what? With the men it’s all too clear. Cinephiles in New York have noted the difference between how 2018 began and how it is ending. In January it was possible to see a movie a day in almost any theater for $9.99 a month using MoviePass. It was possible to stream thousands of classic and foreign films at home through FilmStruck for about $8 a month. Now, out of the blue and with little explanation, but as the result of its monopolistic deal with AT&T, Time Warner has shut down FilmStruck. MoviePass still exists, but barely. For a while it managed to do something that seemed impossible: it changed theatrical exhibition for the better. Now it has (more predictably than the shuttering of FilmStruck, it must be said) become some new kind of con in which only the most mediocre and longest-running movies are available to see, and only three a month. Suddenly we are plunged into a world of $16 movies at theaters in a city with no video stores. The cancellation of both services, at this point, seems like the end of the long tail. The blockbuster model has reasserted itself and as usual seeks to muscle everything else out of the way. At the height of corporate capitalism you pay full price for bad movies improperly projected in ugly theaters whose business is selling large sodas at a 1,000 percent markup. If you want to watch a movie at home, there’s Netflix, now mostly a streaming television service, or Amazon. It’s all an insult to cinephiles and to film history. Going mass means living in the moment and throwing away what came before. The moment is crap. To rub it in, the large theatrical chains have implemented reserved seating policies, which, by slowing down ticket buying at the box office, herd filmgoers into making electronic purchases for which they have to pay an additional fee. Reserved seats are antithetical to moviegoing, which traditionally and democratically has been first come, first served. You could move to a different seat if a weirdo (or anybody) was sitting too close. This new nonegalitarian system is fancy and inappropriate. It takes too long and it huddles people together. Let’s just go to the opera at this point, instead of seeing The Girl in the Spider’s Web pinned in place next to someone texting “wyd?” Meanwhile the ads shown before movies have gotten more aggressive about copping to how terrible and disgusting their products are. The one for Diet Coke with Netflix actress Gillian Jacobs is a masterpiece of the passive-aggressive come-on. “Look,” Jacobs begins, like a pundit on a TV news show, “here’s the thing about Diet Coke: life is short.” As well as nasty and brutish. Next she implores people who want to live in yurts to “yurt it up” and “just do you.” Yurt dwellers may not drink Diet Coke, but they still have rights. She concludes with a simple confession: “Diet Coke: because I can.” Has freedom of choice ever seemed less appealing? At least that particular ad wasn’t made by a film student. The worst, most dystopian Coke ads shown in theaters — each one a little nightmare from a society that has gone full Clockwork Orange — are now also promos for higher education. They are contests that inculcate their lucky film-student winners into a world of meta-shilling, where the theatrical experience is reconfigured as an excuse to slurp Coke under dim lights. Doing that is so satisfying that the actors on-screen envy the soda guzzlers in their cushy seats with cup holders and reach out to grab their giant sodas. This kind of audience flattery is a form of permission to use cell phones while the movie is on. If the actors are just dorks like you who need a Coke so bad, there isn’t any need to pay attention to them. When I went to see Crazy Rich Asians my date and I sat next to three other couples in a row with eight seats. The young women in the other couples texted throughout the movie (which was sold as an important cultural event) while their boyfriends, careful not to mess up a date, sat passively and stared at the screen as if their girlfriends were watching the movie with them instead of paying attention to other people who weren’t there. I saw an Ingmar Bergman film at the Museum of Modern Art recently, where I was seated one row over from a family of four. The father texted throughout the first half hour of the movie, impervious to the nearby MoMA regulars hissing at him to stop. When they began turning around, jabbing their fingers in his face, and threatening to take his phone, he stood up, grabbed his children’s hands, and marched out of the theater in a huff, his wife trailing behind. Somehow, he had been wronged. Similarly, at the New York Film Festival screening of Burning, a man seated a couple of rows ahead of me texted on and off for the first twenty minutes of the film until someone got an usher to shine a flashlight in his face and threaten to remove him. I understand why the texters went to see Crazy Rich Asians. I do not understand what they were doing at MoMA and the New York Film Festival. It’s true that excellent new theaters that show good movies have opened, and are opening, in New York City. They sell discount cards, and anyway, there are many different ways to see movies, some of them legal, without FilmStruck and MoviePass. But cash outlays for those discount cards are not small and the prices without them are steep. And when Venom came out last month to universal pans and no human being who liked it could be found anywhere, it still cleaned up at the box office. It’s still playing. I looked just now and it has passed $200 million in ticket sales. It must be a great movie for texting. A journey to the end of the night set in Los Angeles, like Faces, Wobble Palace is an anti-rom-com of debasement. Unlike Faces its characters are petulant, underemployed young whiners instead of confused, middle-class, middle-aged drunks. Times have changed in Los Angeles. No longer Cassavetes’s city of nice houses with big dining rooms, Wobble Palace reveals LA living as downscale and codependent, even in open relationships. Scrolling text messages take up part of the frame sometimes and add to Wobble Palace’s mood of smarmy irritation. One gets used to them on-screen, where they are better than in the audience, but not to the artificial click-click sound of the keys. Put your shit on silent. The Halloween night 2016 setting aids the film, as writer-director-star Eugene Kotlyarenko goes full Herzog’s Nosferatu as his costume choice for the scenes before the final breakup. It’s more flattering than the “fat Skrillex” look he is accused of sporting earlier. Costar and cowriter Dasha Nekrasova also gets to say things like “We’re gonna have our first female president soon” in her distinctive world-weary drone of postironic predisappointment. Like Viva’s bored drawl in the late 1960s Warhol films and in Varda’s LA-set Lions Love, Nekrasova’s voice is the voice of a generation — in tone at least. It is so distinctive I wish she would record the service interruption announcements on the subway so that the true sound of the stalled and waiting would come through the speakers. “No Drama” is posted as rule No. 1 for the servers at the Hootersesque restaurant in strip-mall Texas where Support the Girls takes place. Andrew Bujalski highlights his film’s commitment to that as a concept, even as star Regina Hall, as the restaurant’s manager, admits that banning drama is impossible with her half-dressed staff of twentysomething women. But when they get too provocative, she reminds them, “We are mainstream! We are mainstream!” Drama is mainstream, porn is not. Mumblecore isn’t either, so Bujalski, who is now one of the best directors of actors in American filmmaking, has designed this unique, low-key film as a vehicle for Hall, the excellent actress from the Think Like a Man and Scary Movie movies who was overshadowed by the discovery of Tiffany Haddish in Girls Trip. While the film descends into a bar-top riot and ends with women drinking and screaming in rage and frustration on a roof, it is men who are more likely to violate the “No Drama” rule. The restaurant owner (James Le Gros), for instance, subjects a captive Hall to his pointless fury as they speed in his truck, with boat attached, to pursue another driver who has annoyed him on the road. When Hall and her staff move over to a corporate chain restaurant called Man Cave, an HR manager, played with polished friendliness by Brooklyn Decker, reveals the true drama of our time. “We’ve built this super-well-thought-out culture of respect,” she explains, “and we have a whole team of attorneys who are paid a crazy amount to make sure we lay that out clearly.” Like the manager she plays, Hall is a team player to the end. I’m not sure the ensemble cast doesn’t overshadow her. Lea DeLaria as Bobo, a dyke regular at the bar, steals every scene she’s in. Shayna McHayle, a.k.a. the Brooklyn rapper Junglepussy, draws attention away from everybody else with nothing more than baleful stares and a self-contained sick-of-it-all attitude. If someone put McHayle and Dasha Nekrasova in a movie, they would become a bored, indie Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, at least for South by Southwest and Bushwick, if not the mainstream. Ron Rice’s last film, unfinished at the time of his too early death, is an essential document of bohemian New York City in 1963 as it was lived and thrashed in cheap apartments and on the streets. Taylor Mead, its star, the ultimate weird boho-hipster of the second half of the 20th century, finished a final cut of The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man in 1981 after having screened other versions around the world for almost two decades. Mead’s version has now been restored by Anthology Film Archives. The film’s black-and-white images demonstrate what the camp/avant-garde nexus meant in the Manhattan of Andy Warhol, Jill Johnston, and Frank O’Hara. The film was shot a year before Sontag’s “Notes on Camp” was published, but Rice’s movie is a living, breathing, leg-humping enactment more amusing, friendly, and connected to daily life than Jack Smith’s Flaming Creatures. Smith, one of Sontag’s inspirations, appears in the movie and almost takes over its second half from the coy, shier Mead and from Winifred Bryan, the implacable, overweight black woman who is the Queen of Sheba to Mead’s Atom Man. The film, having established the bizarre relationship between these two mismatched oddballs, can’t stray too far from them no matter who piles on. The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man should be projected twenty-four hours a day somewhere in Manhattan, so that before we’re all pushed into the sea off Rockaway Beach people can be reminded of the strange form of life that once lived here. It turns out that self-conscious cinematic camp was not exactly invented by Jack Smith in New York. In an unimposing suburban home in Pacific Palisades, California, Jerry Lewis, unbeknownst to the avant-garde, had begun in 1951 to shoot black-and-white movie parodies and pre-Warholian color screen tests during his nights and weekends off from Paramount Pictures, where he and Dean Martin were employed as the nation’s most popular comedy duo. Shown only once to friends at premiere parties at the same house where they were filmed, Lewis’s Gar-Ron productions (named for his sons) remained unseen by anyone else until this past October, when the Lewis estate and the Library of Congress debuted them at the Museum of Modern Art. These films, which combine borscht belt humor and Mad magazine–style parody with vulgar put-downs and gay panic, reveal Lewis as a comic auteur and “total filmmaker” almost ten years before his official directorial debut, The Bellboy. The Gar-Ron movies, like The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man, also document their time and place, which in this case is the sunny Southern California of Hollywood movie stars partying at home. If you had been waiting to hear Dean Martin, Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis, or Shelley Winters utter words like orgasm, cock, shit, and vomit, your wait was over if you made it to MoMA this past fall. The series combined featurettes, shorts, and home movies from this period in which Jerry Lewis and America were both on the rise. Lewis’s well-known neuroticism and aggressiveness are less hidden and more integrated in these productions than in the Freudian constructs Paramount put together for him and Dean, or in the later work for which he was solely responsible. In fact, these movies present a happy Jerry, not the lugubrious interviewee America got to know from his films in the 1960s, after he became an auteur and a philanthropist. One home movie, shot at a 1920s-themed jazz party in the Lewis rec room, is positively giddy, with Lewis and Patti, his wife, and Curtis and Leigh doing the Charleston in boaters, spats, and flapper outfits late into the night. The films themselves present popular movies of the day in “Jewish” versions. Sunset Boulevard becomes Fairfax Avenue, the story of a handsome young delivery boy (Curtis) from a kosher deli forced to write a screenplay for a washed-up star of the silent screen (Leigh, caked in face powder). In Come Back Little Shiksa, Martin is a doctor “struggling to avoid sobriety.” Each is like a Kuchar brothers film with big stars in it, too weird and offensive for TV sketch comedy, an emanation from a hip demimonde that only existed in Lewis’s house when Curtis and Leigh dropped by. The Milton Berle screen test, which poses Uncle Miltie against a bright-red backdrop as it scrutinizes his face so Lewis can pepper him with rude, absurd questions off-screen, is more out-there than any Warhol screen test. I’d say it’s one of the best films of the 1950s, and it clearly demonstrates Lewis’s way with color and his ability to capture stylized discomfort on-screen. In the MoMA lobby between Jerry Lewis screenings, a basketball-stomached older man wearing a large newsboy cap introduced himself to me as Slaps Donovan. He cornered me to tell me he used to be the film critic on Jackie Mason’s radio show. Now he had a Broadway play and a reality TV series he was developing. “Hal Prince,” said Slaps, “has my play on his desk, but he’s booked up for the next three years.” This play, a musical, takes place during the Woodstock rock music festival in 1969, but doesn’t use any of the songs. It’s all new, original music that Slaps has written. His TV show, Celebrity Séance, involves unsuspecting contestants speaking to famous dead people through the medium of Slaps’s voice impressions, which he will provide off-screen. At the very moment Slaps asked me, in the voice of Jerry Lewis, about getting some nookie, I got a text on my phone. A woman I know who works for Netflix was in town for the New York Film Festival. She was inviting me to meet her and two filmmakers for dinner at a fancy restaurant near Lincoln Center. While Slaps imitated Jerry Lewis and I looked at this text on my phone, a Brazilian artist named Romero Britto walked by dressed in a multicolored homemade suit and stopped to pose for photos fans of his wanted to take with him. The clowns had been sent in, and I was among them. I couldn’t go to dinner. There was another Jerry Lewis movie in half an hour that I planned to see, and besides I wasn’t dressed for that kind of thing. If I had gone to meet my friend and two glamorous strangers, I would have become the Slaps of the dinner, explaining how I was a film critic. That night, instead, I had committed myself to the bizarre and the asinine. Slaps exited onto 53rd Street, still doing his Jerry Lewis voice, and I went and sat down in the lobby to wait for the next show. A lady in a burgundy tracksuit sitting across from me pulled a container of macaroni salad out of a crinkly plastic shopping bag, pried off the clear plastic lid, and began eating it with a big metal soup spoon she had brought with her to the museum. At least I wasn’t wearing a funny hat. A truer séance of dubbed voices, forgotten faces, and witchy art, Orson Welles’s The Other Side of the Wind brings a lost work back to life. By the time of his death in 1985, Welles had been working on the film for fifteen years and hadn’t finished it. Now it arrives complete, fully formed, a masterpiece and a shock to the system, courtesy of Netflix and all the money they have to burn. It is not a fragment like Welles’s It’s All True or Don Quixote. It is done. Never has a movie been as overwhelmed by the history of its production as this one, “this circus of scattered souls . . . a desperate venture shared by desperate men.” That doesn’t matter anymore. The desperate men and the scattered souls are now on the screen. Near the beginning of the film, a busload of partygoers on the way to the desert house of the film director Jake Hannaford (John Huston) passes a drive-in theater where the huge marquee advertises two movies: i eat your skin and i drink your blood, fitting titles for this exposé of Hollywood vampirism. It’s filmed alternately like Zabriskie Point, random Eurotrash, Kenneth Anger–ian avant-gardism, 1970s porn, Cassavetes, and cinema verité. Like Faces it is another SoCal journey to the end of the night; like the Jerry Lewis home movies, it inhabits a vulgar-sophisticated world of homosexual panic, here partially masked by lots of naked hippie hetero sex in a steam bath, in a moving car, and on a back lot in Hollywood, abandoned and in ruins. In The Other Side of the Wind, Welles purposefully synthesized every film style that had come along since the late 1950s, in a bid for relevance the film mocks when Hannaford is accused of doing the same. Where Hannaford crashes and burns, Welles succeeds with brilliance, adding to the sense of tragedy surrounding the film. It should have come out in its time. The film swings wildly between tones and tempos, black-and-white and ultravivid color. Michel Legrand’s score and the other music in the film add to this. In the psychedelic film-within-a-film, Blue Cheer dominates the soundtrack like Can tried to at the beginning of Inherent Vice. In the party scenes, we hear the hip jazz pianist Jaki Byard, his music piped in as drunks spill booze on each other and sing “Glow Worm” in a haunting scene lit only by candles. The film was cowritten by Welles’s companion, Oja Kodar, who also costars. She is often nude and plays a mute Native American who is mocked as “Pocahontas” while an underage blonde girl (Cathy Lucas), a nonactor in an archie bunker for president T-shirt, is passed from Peter Bogdanovich, as a director in the flush of success, to Huston’s Hannaford, a director who can’t get his film made in the New Hollywood of the time. It’s a sick, glorious movie that ends at another drive-in, a graveyard of the cinema with a train running past it, where Kodar, projected on the screen, stabs with scissors at these men’s fantasies and dreams. n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year.

"Dec 7, 2018",neutral," Wow! I don’t even know where to start. For a series of films built pre-eminently on incredible action set pieces and a penchant for self-one-upmanship with Tom Cruise at the lead, you know that Mission: Impossible – Fallout was designed from day one to be a wild ride. How effective of one would it be? That was really the only question. It’s corny to say it, but the series already did a couple films ago, so I guess I have permission: “Mission Accomplished!” Defying all conventional Hollywood wisdom, the sixth installment of this series is very well the best one yet, and I say “yet” because, at this rate, I don’t doubt Cruise will muster up the fervor to continue these until he looks like Jim Phelps in his last installment. Why do I believe this? Let’s dig in. As this film functions as a complete extension of the last film (also directed by the series’ first repeat-director, Christopher McQuarrie), we open with an extension of Rogue Nation‘s interesting opening. Just as that film featured the mission briefing delivered to Ethan Hunt (Cruise, advancing the characterization beyond the action-hero cypher of film’s past) through an antiquated method (record player), this film delivers it with the churning and whirring of a gearbox, reminding us of the analog nature of why we love these films. Among the deluge of digital playgrounds that fill cinemas on a weekly basis, there is a respite in knowing that IMF agent Ethan Hunt can always find ways to thrill us with the oomph that can only come from practical stunt work. The Syndicate that has been slowly building and manipulating behind the scenes globally has morphed into a new form: the Apostles, and as the name implies, there is a religious fervor to usurping the world order. While gamers might connect the film’s title to the video game series of Fallout by name alone, that connection does actually work: recovery of plutonium cores that are set to power three nuclear explosives is what gets the incredibly powerful and efficient machine that is this film going. As trailers show, Solomon Lane (played again through chilling whispers by Sean Harris), the villainous mastermind of the Syndicate, is a part of the Apostles’ plans. Hunt and crew find themselves caught in the middle of incredible forces that could very easily destroy life globally and end theirs personally. Divulging much more will unlock the secrets that should only be revealed through viewing. There’s a hypnotic energy to this film’s pacing. The sheer number of impressive action set pieces is incredible, and while everyone will remember Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol, here, we may very well have one of the best choreographed and edited action films of all time. That film centered around that incredible sequence, but here, we have an almost beginning-to-end steam train of pure movie magic that hits hard and doesn’t stop. Dialogue and plot act as moments to catch our breath, but even in the midst of action sequences, the storytelling continues in creative ways. While I am a lover of Daniel Craig‘s series of James Bond films, Quantum of Solace, in particular, got lost in the editing room with some of its action sequences (thereby leaving audiences dazed and confused). Such things are never an issue here. Yes, the camera finds itself placed in ways that just shouldn’t be possible, but the shots it captures always reinforce the spatial layout of everyone and everything. Even as it was all thrilling, never was I lost in what was going on, and after years of critiques in action filmmaking, hopefully, this film will be a lesson to all other films to come. Punches land here with power, crashes are felt, and, all-in-all, the energy runs high. There are many reasons Henry Cavill was cast here as Agent August Walker, a tag-along assigned to work with Ethan, due to CIA oversight from their new director (Angela Bassett). The primary one being is that he is a beast on-screen. In the expertly crafted “bathroom fight scene” shown heavily in trailers, he seems to reload his arms, and I believed it. The effectiveness of this film as an action film can’t be overstated, and I haven’t even gotten to the twists and turns of the plot. While this film felt less “fun” or “funny” than the last two, it all happens out of necessity. The stakes have never felt higher, and with a larger team of people we genuinely care about, I was fully wrapped up in everything happening to everybody. The plot has always somehow seemed secondary in these series of films, but McQuarrie, in particular, has elevated it to a higher priority in Rogue Nation and now here. In my opinion, he crafts his two films to be a full realization of what the series always could be, even after its inconsistent start with earlier films. As the marketing stills show, colors seem muted here throughout, but I believe it makes the colorful moments in the film like the HALO jump and subsequent nightclub scene look even better as a result. I’ve yet to talk about Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), but she returns with an interesting plot thread. This film delves into the themes of the greater good and personal justice in a multitude of ways, and she is just one of the many ways that’s all unpacked. Ethan Hunt is given the opportunity to hone his moral code here by the situations that come, and as a result, he becomes a far better character overall. The danger dampens the opportunities for humor, as mentioned, but Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) get chuckles right when we need them. Also worth mentioning is how this film finds great ways to incorporate plot elements from the entire series here, a true first in a series that has felt so disjointed. Alongside that, I felt genuine emotion towards the end with character interactions rooted in long-running plot developments from earlier films. That kind of emotion only comes with films connected by plot, and I’m so glad that the series has embraced it. Content-wise, the violence hits hard, but there is nothing gratuitous to me or unnecessary. Everything feels real, and as a result, gore or death isn’t glorified. I was disappointed in the F-Bomb delivered here, and considering who gives it and his other well-known film role, it felt cheap and unnecessary to me. Sexual content is completely a non-factor here, which is interesting in a spy film. The terrorist group being named the Apostles and their planned attacks on the world’s Holy Cities ties the film to the Bible, but it doesn’t explicitly go any deeper than that. I am authoring a Geeks Under Grace Bible Study for the film, and I plan to go into the themes of providence and the sanctity of life; check it out once it is published. Overall, I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It’s satisfying on so many levels. In a summer of Thanos and dinosaurs, it’s quite a testament that of all those films, I think I had the strongest compulsion to re-watch this. If you have even had a passing interest in any of the preceding films in the series at all, you owe it to yourself to catch up to this one and experience the thrill ride it offers. It is a further perfecting of what the series can deliver, and kudos to Cruise to continuing to find new ways to put himself into the ire of insurance companies everywhere, doing things no sane person would attempt. The meticulous direction from McQuarrie has me hoping that he and Cruise work out a deal for him to continue directing this partnership until jumping or hanging from any high point is…well, impossible. With the series being this good this far into itself, long live Ethan Hunt!"
"Dec 7, 2018",positive," It is common knowledge that Tom Cruise broke his ankle while shooting a scene where he jumps from roof top to roof top during a foot chase. The consummate professional, and filled with astounding mental fortitude, Cruise manage to finish the scene as planned despite the injury. The broken ankle would have been the main story of the production for any other film, but Tom Cruise is no ordinary actor and Mission: Impossible – Fallout is no ordinary film. As one observes in the special features of the film’s Blu-ray, the broken ankle was the least of everyone’s concerns. Tom Cruise was literally one wrong move away from serious harm in every single one of the stunts he performed in the film. Making the sense of danger in the final product even more captivating. In this installment Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) find themselves battling the remnants of Solomon Lane’s (Sean Harris) Syndicate, now called the Apostles, as they search for three stolen plutonium cores. The cores are of particular interest to a mysterious individual known as John Lark who intends to use the plutonium to finish the work Lane started. Not trusting that Hunt’s team can complete their mission, the CIA sends one of their top agents, August Walker (Henry Cavill), to ensure that the items are retrieved by any means necessary. Complicating matters further is the fact Hunt needs Lane to find Lark and the plutonium, while former ally Isa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is tasked with ensuring that Lane is silenced once and for all. One of the year’s best films, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the films that came before it in the series. It is an edge of your seat thrill ride that manages to top itself with each action sequence without sacrificing the story in the process. Christopher McQuarrie’s direction feels especially assured this time around. Unlike most modern action filmmakers, McQuarrie places the practical stunts at the forefront, and uses special effects to enhance them rather than the other way around. This allows Cruise and the rest of the cast, Henry Cavill is a great addition as the rough around the edges Walker, to raise the stakes in a palpable way. The Blu-ray, which arrives in stores tomorrow as part of a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital combo pack, courtesy of Paramount Home Media Entertainment, is packed with special features that are just as riveting as the film itself. The standout is “Behind the Fallout” which consists of seven featurettes that breakdown how every action sequence was filmed. Take for example “Top of the World” that highlights just how grueling and dangerous it was to create and shoot the Halo jump; or “Rendezvous in Paris” in which the cast and crew discuss how Paris became a key component of several action sequences including the Arc de Triomphe motorcycle chase."
"Nov 25, 2018",positive," Mission Impossible: Fallout is the type of film that invites viewers into the action. From an epic skydiving scene to a helicopter chase, the camera focuses in on its main actors — especially Tom Cruise — as they complete incredible stunts right in front of us. Cruise performed many of his character’s stunts himself, proving himself to be an undeniably ambitious action star and showing audiences what great action sequences can look like. This is one of the many things that makes director Christopher McQuarrie’s new film stand out. Despite Fallout serving as the sixth entry in the long-running cinematic franchise, the film feels like a unique feat. For fans of the franchise, many of the key elements of those stories return here. There are plenty of deceptions here — the masks return in a big way —alongside a few smart twists and welcome surprises. But there’s also some great character arcs here as well that raise the emotional stakes. In this installment, a failed mission leads to a horrific predicament. A group of terrorists aligned with the imprisoned Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) steal a shipment of plutonium. Lane, who served as the head of the terrorist organization known as the Syndicate in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, returns to the forefront here as his allies take on Hunt’s team. In order to recover the plutonium, Hunt’s team must engineer a trade with an enigmatic broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). The storyline sets up intricate action sequences pitting Hunt and allies such as CIA operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) against Lane’s criminal network. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns too as an MI6 operative with her own agenda. McQuarrie, who directed and co-wrote Rogue Nation, returns to the helm in this new instalment and serves as the writer and director once again. As Oscar winner for penning the Usual Suspects screenplay, McQuarrie knows how to keep a complicated script tight and does so here. The dialogue is set up nicely, with short early scenes establishing the story quickly without losing the film’s energetic pace. When it comes to the action, McQuarrie keeps his camera focused on the action itself. Instead of pulling the camera back, he leans the camera in — keeping the intensity high while showing the action (and his actors) up close. The script itself offers plenty of strong dialogue with Simon Pegg offering up some great one-liners once again as Benji Dunn and Ving Rhames offering a more subtle turn as Luther Stickell. Beyond that, there’s an emotional importance to the proceedings with a delicate storyline featuring Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan) and Faust. Julia, Hunt’s wife, was absent in the last installment so it’s great to see her return as an important supporting figure here. The status of Hunt’s relationship with her and Hunt’s growing bond with Faust add a depth to these characters and to their overall arcs. It also ties this newest installment nicely together with some of the earlier films. This isn’t a franchise where each of the installments stands alone (unlike many of the James Bond pictures, for instance). The newer films here add layers to the existing characters and build them up in each installment and that’s undeniably the case here. Mission Impossible: Fallout builds on the past storylines but weaves its own unique narrative. It keeps this series going strong with a capable Tom Cruise leading the way — and showing off his incredible skills — and McQuarrie guiding this series forward. Featuring tremendous action sequences, smart dialogue and an emotional depth, this film is one of the best action movies of the year."
"Nov 16, 2018",positive," I love the rubber masks, ripped off to reveal someone else entirely underneath, though I was also secretly hoping they would keep ripping mask after mask off each other until all that was left was a collection of tiny pinhead people. The masks also added a Scooby Doo ambience, and faced with a perfectly innocent character at the end I was fully expecting someone to rip off the guy’s face and the revealed villain to declare he would’ve gotten away with it if it wasn’t for those pesky kids. I say kids, the team (Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Ving Rhames as Luther, Simon Pegg as Benji) are all getting on a bit. Cruise is, after all, 56 now. That other American trademark, the Giant Redwood, is only 3444 years older. It would be understandable if he occasionally felt a little creaky jumping out of a window, or let out an involuntary “aaahhh!” or “ooohhh!” as he manauvered his way into the pilot’s seat of an in-flight helicopter, after climbing up a long swinging rope mid-air. But he keeps going, driving the action forward. Mission Impossible: Fallout is relentless, its action scenes going on longer than you think possible while still being knuckle-chewingly exciting. Cruise is its beating heart – amiably taking the piss out of himself while throwing himself into literally death-defying stunts. Ethan Hunt is ageing, physically knackered, and emotionally weary. It’s actually a rather moving portrayal. Even the potential sort-of love triangle between Hunt, Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Hunt’s ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) doesn’t go beyond the odd intake of breath and sad glance as everyone’s so very nice, and probably a bit tired. Cruise has been around for so long that I’ve adored him, then gone off him, then adored him again about 15 times. I even remember him in Risky Business, the film that sent sales of tooth veneers and London Underground season tickets rocketing (I might as well also admit that to me, Alec Baldwin will always be the blue-eyed sexpot from Knots Landing). Not only is the action believably human (in a truly unbelievable way, obviously), and fallible – it’s also funny. There’s a terrific extended chase sequence with Hunt running across the London skyline – along the tops of buildings, through offices and sliding down tiled roofs – while Benji, directing him left right, left right, in his pursuit from the ground, doesn’t realise he’s up in the air. It’s only when Ethan pauses and Benji questions it – presumably he thought Ethan was waiting for a pelican crossing to turn green – and Ethan barks he’s waiting to jump out of a window, that he twigs. The plot, as far as I could understand before it got too muddy, centres on some missing containers of plutonium, which Hunt previously failed to rescue after choosing the lives of his team instead (and if that’s not on the next philosophy A’Level paper in a discussion of rule utilitarianism then it should be). This idea that Hunt feels himself forced to continue his work because he can is a big theme here and as near as it gets to real thoughtfulness; not so much arrogance as the belief that he’s personally letting down individuals and the world if chooses a quiet life. And despite its many threads, director Christopher McQuarrie has ensured you don’t have to have seen the series to enjoy this one. There’s quite a lot of explanation, even if I didn’t always understand it all. The unremitting action needs no prior knowledge; and the warm relationships among his team, while they may have been built up during previous films, are easy to appreciate and enjoy. The plutonium search takes in first the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) a fake philanthropist and genuine arms dealer; if Hunt can spring imprisoned American agent turned anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who is about to be transported across Paris in a prison van, he can then swap him for the plutonium via her contacts. (Or not swap him, as of course he and Lane have History; but get the plutonium back anyway.) Oh and Hunt is pretending to be John Lark, another terrorist, and later he’s framed to make the CIA think he really is Lark, gone rogue. Isla Faust is in Paris too, just to add to the merry reunions. Keeping an eye on Hunt for the CIA is August Walker (Henry Cavill, perfectly cast!). He spends the first half of the film always slightly behind Hunt and the second half slightly in front. He’s ruthless, and extremely snarky (I’ve just checked my cinema notes and I actually wrote “Walker is a cocky bugger” so you can rest assured that was my first impression). He’s funny and fit during that already-famous restroom fight scene between him, Hunt and He Who May Or May Not Be Lark (Liang Yang), as sparkly glass shatters, silver pipes are ripped from walls and the pristine shiny-white cubicles become drenched in blood. There’s a puppyish keenness too. “Hope is not a strategy” Walker says pompously, to which Ilsa replies dryly “you must be new”. (A feature of Fallout is how much of the action is not just seat-of-pants, but made-on-the-hoof, as planning goes out of the window and instinct and ever-reducing options take precedence.) I’m not going to lie, I rather liked Lane (until I discovered he’d gassed whole villages and shot down a passenger plane to kill one person), almost as much as I liked moustachioed Walker in “Victorian gentleman about to challenge one to a duel” mode. Even though the mad-eyed Lane has terrible things planned for us, because “the greater the suffering the greater the peace”. (I do love movie villains with Big Ideas and Big Speeches to match. I know I moan about long films, but don’t cut them if doing so means chopping their narcissistic, impassioned world annihilation-justifying gibberish. Eventually even the most megalomaniacal of them mentions the compromised nature of most governments and I start thinking “Hmm, a stopped clock is right twice a day!”). The terrible things include two nuclear weapons linked together which can only be deffused (wait for it…) once the countdown has started, and which are hidden in a medical outpost at the base of a huge and rocky glacier in Kashmir, by a water source which supplies some of the most populous nations on Earth. And someone has gone off in a helicopter with the detonator which needs to be switched off, but luckily there’s another helicopter just taking off too, and a black-clad hero in pursuit."

"Nov 3, 2018",positive," There’s a new installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise on the block, but by now these films might best be referred to by their birth name, Tom Cruise Hangs Off Of Things. You may be aware by now that there will be stunts and Tom Cruise will be risking his life for your enjoyment. Likely in the air somehow. Mission: Impossible - Fallout provides him with plentiful airborne opportunities. This time, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt deals with the immediate ramifications of Rogue Nation’s Syndicate, the global crime organization led by the now captured Solomon Lane. The dismantling has led to The Apostles, an offshoot terrorist organization that Hunt must prevent from stealing plutonium to be used for multiple nuclear weapons set for simultaneous explosion. Returning for the laughs are his cohorts played by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, and a new mustachioed face: Henry Cavill as a somewhat unwilling CIA agent assigned to their unit to also keep a close eye on Hunt. Rebecca Ferguson’s British agent Ilsa Faust returns with a mission of her own that may or may not stand in opposition to Hunt’s. What unfolds is a traditional actioner where our hero battles protecting loved ones versus acting towards the greater good. This mission is partly of Hunt’s own making, having bungled obtaining the plutonium in the opening moments in order to save Rhames’ Luther. But the age old “this time it’s personal” cliche plays out in delightfully exaggerated ways, as Fallout’s villains devise umpteen scenarios that constantly put Hunt in those crosshairs. Including revisiting the specter of Hunt’s now-in-hiding former wife played by Michelle Monaghan. As these films begin to blur together, this sequel does get some mileage by shaping its hero as one who cares as much for the individual as the many, who can hold the value of both in equal measure. In that regard, Ethan Hunt has finally begun to escape being defined solely by the aura of the star that plays him. It’s not just more personal, he has more personality - and it helps make this one of the franchise’s more distinct entries, further showing that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has the series' sharpest insights into what makes Hunt a compelling character. Fallout ultimately creates its own kind of neck-bruising extended whiplash by presenting many visceral, awe-inspiring acts of daring that aren’t shot or edited all that well despite their invigorating audacity. By comparison to earlier efforts, any digital tinkering is also far more obvious and slightly dampens the impact. Comparisons to roller coasters are commonplace in summer movie season, but this is a movie that actually beats the shit out of you like the creakiest ride in the amusement park. And yet the film is burdensomely overlong, further dulling its thrill. This sequel presents the very best and the worst about this franchise in one long dose, one that is laborous to take no matter how much fun it generates. Thankfully, Ethan Hunt has gone a little soft to balance the hard blows. Tom Cruise is a cult leader who poisoned his children against their mother and is complicit in crimes and abuse cover-ups. I find him repellent and can't stand the sight of him. I know people love this franchise, but I can't abide. He's so gross and I'd just hate the experience too much (like I was with Kevin Spacey who I hadn't watched anything of for a solid decade until BABY DRIVER, which I again couldn't stand him in). The film stays pretty grounded not just because most of these things were done practically, but also the films shooting style. It has a very unique look for a modern day Hollywood blockbuster with its glowing highlights, and pronounced film grain."
"Nov 1, 2018",positive," I have a confession to make. There’s this thing that happens to people who review movies on any kind of quasi-professional circuit. A kind of numbing of the enthusiasm gland by proxy of the inability to overlook a film’s shortcomings. The more movies one takes in, the more unavoidable it is to not diagnose lazy writing, poor story structure, bland acting, choppy VFX… The collection of pratfalls these XXL “turn your brain off” tentpole films tend to suffer. When you see 200 movies a year, the bar to dazzle becomes impossibly high. What works for general audiences who catch a movie every few months often feels flat and stale for the critic – just another coat of crisp digital paint lazily slathered on poorly recycled narrative – because we’ve already seen this exact story twice this year.  I’m not trying to be elitist. Quite the opposite in fact. In many ways, us obsessive movie watchers have inoculated ourselves to thrills. We’ve chased the dragon so adamantly that nothing short of cinematic heroin manages to finger the dial. Which is to say that when a movie does manage to dazzle, to amaze, to alarm, to make one’s palms sweat and one’s knuckles cocaine white, to conjure one to stab a fingernail marks into one’s own knees – that is a feat worth standing up and dancing for. Mission Impossible: Fallout is that rare elixir for the criminally underwhelmed. Watching it, I felt like Tuco Salamanca snorting the blue. It kicks like a mule. I expect I’ll be chasing that feeling like a salivating addict for the next few years at the cineplexes. The final guard of a dying age of superstar, Tom Cruise is the last action hero and never has his skill been in sharper focus. If the Mission Impossible franchise has long been a stage for Cruise to display his considerable athleticism and unwavering charisma, Fallout is the movie equivalent of a coup de grâce; the jaw-dangling muscle work of American Ninja Warrior crossbred with the raw magnetism of a Bachelorette contestant. At one point, Cruise snaps his foot like a carrot vaulting over rooftops and limps away to make sure his team gets the shot. That kind of commitment cannot be faked. You can’t digitally create actual pain. You can’t synthesize thrills on this scale. If Fallout is one long cinematic orgasm, it sure ain’t faked. Through single-shot HALO jumps to flipping and spinning in an actual helicopter (CGI be damned), Cruise gives his body and soul over to Ethan Hunt’s death-defying shenanigans, putting himself in the pilot seat on every incredibly dangerous stunt asked of him. And that work shows. Fallout is intensity purified by extension of Cruise’s unadulterated commitment. Like Hunt for his mission, Cruise is quite literally willing to die for these movies. The post-colon Fallout part of the title applies in two ways. On the one hand, this is the first proper sequel for the now 22-year old series, with events, characters, plot-lines and even the villain (the snake-tongued Sean Harris, now with a fiery scraggle of disheveled hair) directly entangled with 2015’s Rogue Nation. Mission Impossible has long been a series built on reinvention – the constant changing of the creative guard is part and parcel of why each entry feels so wildly diverse and born anew. The injection of fresh talent has proved critical lifeblood for the series – and allows for each installment to be so stylistically dissimilar – but in maintaining the same director (Christopher McQuarrie) – a move I was admittedly initially suspect of – Mission Impossible has never reached such impossible heights.  McQuarries takes the  notion of making a direct sequel to a long running franchise – a la 007’s not-so-successful Quantum of Solace –  and uses it to blow everything up to the nth degree. The set pieces are bigger, longer, more fulfilling and always tethered to a pertinent emotional stake. If Brad Bird’s unbelievably entertaining Ghost Protocol felt like a benchmark for high-flying action-circus antics  and MI:3 tied Ethan’s emotional cycles and life outside the job into the proceedings, Mission Impossible: Fallout harangues the whole kit and caboodle into one non-stop rollercoaster of in-your-face set pieces and genuine emotional payoff.  Tipping his hat to earlier franchise watermarks, McQuarrie homages by recreating and perfecting. There’s a bite of nostalgia cheese for every Mission Impossible fan in the audience, casual or hardcore alike, with a spread of sequences that mimic that whence came before. There’s a play on the duplicitous opening interrogation of the first Mission Impossible, a Benji-navigated parkour sprint from MI:3, the high-speed motorcycle races of MI:2 and Rogue Nation. A callback to Max. Even Hunt’s skill for cliff-face free climbing makes an appearance. Fallout plays like an updated greatest hits album whose remixing transcends the original tracks. It’s a goddamn action masterpiece.  On the other side of the spectrum, Fallout is about choice. Specifically, the choice to save one life at the expense of the many. The fallout of an early decision launches the plot of this sixth mission, forcing Hunt and his team to play catch up, always a step behind, relying on hope and chance and willing to risk everything to save not just the world but each other. Ethan Hunt grapples with the idea of sacrifice at many a critical junction and McQuarrie manages to further complicate a once-not-so-well-defined character by asking what he is willing to sacrifice for the greater good. This makes for a darker entry – one super-enhanced by Rob Hardy’s artful, picturesque cinematography and Lorne Balfe’s spectacularly riveting score – one that confidently puts character development and action spectacle on the same footing.  Here, Hunt is joined by IMF mainstays Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) to recover three plutonium cores. In imprisoned anarchist Solomon Lane’s (Harris) absence, the former Syndicate has collapsed and transmogrified into rogue operators calling themselves The Apostles. With the help of recent ally/platonic love interest Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, absolutely killing it again) and under the watchful eye of sinewy handler Walker (Henry Cavill and his sex mustache, both welcome additions), Hunt and his team are tasked with recovering these weapons of mass destruction before the new world order is aggressively dismantled.  As is often the case in these kinds of movies, the plot is secondary. Even Mad Max: Fury Road, rightfully hailed as one of the few great action movies of the generation, was essentially a story about a guy and a girl driving into the desert, and then driving back. What makes an action movie soar is the world-building, the characters, the sense of adventure. And, equally important, balls-to-the-walls practical effects. CGI may have made the impossible possible but stripping that back returns gravity to the proceedings. These punches connect. These falls have weight. The fallout is real. So too is Fallout one of the greatest action movies of the 21st century.

"Nov 1, 2018",positive," His latest film, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” cements Cruise as the last true Movie Star in capital letters, someone whose talent and charisma transcends box office success, critical acclaim and award season notoriety. Cruise is a generational talent that has defined true stardom, that collaboration between cinema and celebrity people only talk about in past tense terms referencing Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe or Humphrey Bogart. There’s nothing revolutionary about the plot, which follows the same basic format as the classic television show of the same name upon which it is based. Ethan Hunt and his team of Impossible Mission Force (IMF) agents must stop a psychopathic arms dealer from obtaining a Macguffin and causing international catastrophes. This time, the Macguffin is a case of three plutonium balls intended for trade to a vigilante dead-set on detonating nuclear weapons for maximum global conflict. There’s about 10 minutes at the outset of the film that orients the audience and establishes the most clear emotional stakes in the history of the franchise. Then writer/director Christopher McQuarrie cranks the dial to 100 and sets Cruise loose for the next two hours in the most dazzling thrill ride you’re likely to see this year. In a world where over-reliance on computer-generated images have made the outrageous seem matter-of-fact, what Cruise does in his sixth turn as Hunt feels almost too possible given how easy movie magicians at a desk could make it look. And yet, “Fallout” sees Tom Cruise, Movie Star, literally jump out of airplanes 25,000 feet in the air and choreograph a mid-air rescue that works like a stunning dance of fear and tension. Cruise spends months learning to fly — and then actually piloting — helicopters in dazzling dogfight sequences. Incredibly, this doesn’t feel authentic in the moment on a first viewing. The cinematic precision and practical stunt work at play in “Fallout” reveal itself in staggering fashion on a second, third or fourth trip to theaters. Because everything audiences see is really happening, the hesitations we see on Cruise’s face are genuine. We can find ourselves churning our minds alongside him during these moments of peril. It certainly doesn’t hurt to have a talented and diverse supporting cast including a stoically serious Ving Rhames, relatable and hilarious Simon Pegg and alluring Rebecca Ferguson to pair with Cruise while Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin provide sizable resistance and gravitas. McQuarrie helps carry the weight by stepping up considerably in the director’s chair, taking lessons learned from his last outing in “Rogue Nation”and pairing it with real stakes moment to moment you’d find in the more grounded Jason Bourne franchise or the recent James Bond films. The thing that truly sets “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” apart from your average action film is its unwavering commitment to relentless, dynamic fun. Cruise and McQuarrie rev the engines from moment one and take off on the cinematic Autobahn. Though a trip down memory lane watching the prior films of the franchise (especially the first, third and fifth) will help inform viewers, you don’t have to know a lot going in to enjoy the heck out of “Fallout.”"
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," The great thing about the Mission Impossible series is, well, there’s a lot of great things. The film’s are always pretty whacky and retain a rather glorious silliness that keeps it from ever feeling like a James Bond clone. Tom Cruise is its lead star, a versatile, charismatic, stupidly courageous actor who is willing to go that extra mile (or in Fallout‘s case, an extra three miles in the air for a real-life Halo jump). But its whole motto was that each film would have a different director so every entry felt unique. The very first was strengthened by the precision of Brian De Palma’s directing. John Woo helmed the second, weakest film, extending the running time from around 45 to 120 minutes in slo-mo shots alone. A relative feature film rookie by the name of J.J. Abrams took charge on MI: III, an exhilarating re-charge for the audience which also featured the franchise’s, still, best villain portrayed by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Master of Iron Giants and all things incredible, Brad Bird, was the lead on Ghost Protocol, which was praised immensely upon release. Then Christopher McQuarrie was brought in for the fifth entry, Rogue Nation, which again was given high praise for the quality of the script and inventiveness of the sequences. But for Fallout, there’s been a change of policy. McQuarrie was brought back, and working alongside Cruise very closely, they wanted to create a follow-up which still felt unique from the rest. What they have done is nothing short of extraordinary. This gloriously crafted sixquel is better pretty much in every way from its predecessors. After a mission gone wrong, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his reliable IMF allies must chase down missing plutonium before the world is destroyed. Hunt’s decisions put him in the warpath of CIA handyman Walker (Henry Cavill), and put him on a course back to an old nemesis, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The stakes are very high indeed here, but unlike the inevitability of success that ran through Rogue Nation, Fallout makes very clear early on that missions don’t always go the IMF’s way. Narratively overall, there’s not a lot of new ground being treaded on. It’s a classic ‘end of the world’ plot typical of the series, but McQuarrie, also returning as writer, infuses more deception, double crosses and twists into the several eventful moments, managing to make a familiar plot feel urgent. Cruise is on fantastically intense form, taking the light and charm you’d typically expect of Ethan Hunt but infusing it with a desperation quite unlike what we’re used to. The opening scene establishes the never-ending worry which possesses his day-to-day struggles, showing us precisely where our leading man is at and how it will affect his actions in the rest of the film. And it definitely shows – there’s a brutality in play here uncommon of the seemingly unbreathable morality of Hunt, killing people in an instant without hesitation or remorse, but with good reason at heart. It also has to be said; Cruise will go down in history as a movie legend, and this could be described as his opus. The bravery and creativity on show here is astonishing, with the Halo jump, a London pursuit and the much-talked about helicopter sequence showcasing his endless skillset.  The full ensemble give their absolute all too, with Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson returning with their full arsenal of skills, employing the heart where it’s required but working together as a magnetic force in the most suspenseful moments. Cavill makes for an intimidating, forceful brute of a villain, a figure who is mostly a match for Cruise’s Hunt. His intentions are a little predictable, removing some of the surprise later on. But the action and script is so well executed that these mild gripes can be forgiven. Sean Harris returns as the nefarious, ghoulish Lane from Rogue Nation, and build upon his creepy personality well in this entry, sensibly not forced upon the audience too much.  Particularly so in Lane’s entrance, the music will strike those goosebumps. Lorne Balfe’s score can be a little heavy on the big-chord indulgence, but there’s definite touches of Zimmer in there, tapping into the pulse-racing capabilities of the film and going that one step further, with much re-listening value.  The direction is simply sublime. McQuarrie’s impressively practical vision makes for some of the most mind-blowingly realised sequences since Mad Max: Fury Road. The afore-mentioned helicopter sequence is a feat of filmmaking to which there isn’t an appropriate word I could use that wouldn’t be classed as professional. The bar has now been set very, very high for practical set-pieces. The competency McQuarrie shows here is magnificent. This is one of the cleanest looking, most polished action movies around, with a slight grainy feel in some moments that give this a classic-in-the-making feel. The camera work is smoothly handled throughout and given a beautiful spark through the cinematography of Rob Hardy, who elevates this entry to a more technically brilliant level.  This is Cruise and McQuarrie’s masterpiece, a breathtaking spectacle and fluid thrill ride that doubles down on the espionage elements sometimes lost in the films, but retains the non-stop velocity required, and then some. The producing pair have aimed for something greater than a passable summer blockbuster here. Simply, it aims for greatness, and attains perfection, even through its imperfection. There’s too much of the old MI trope of “That’s exactly what he wants us to do!” or something along those lines. But the fact there’s still touches of that gleeful silliness present in an otherwise seriously produced blockbuster means the heart and soul of the franchise is very much beating."

"Oct 29, 2018",positive," We regret to inform you that James Bond has been official canceled until further notice. The iconic spy that dominated the action genre for 50 years as the height of espionage-inspired spectacle has been lapped by Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, the super-spy of the Mission: Impossible films. It’s been trending this way for a little while. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol brought the series to dazzling new heights only to ramp up further with Rogue Nation. All the while Bond flicks were stuck in a cycle of hit or miss movies. Now with Mission: Impossible – Fallout, it’s undeniable. The spy genre is now owned outright by Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, as Fallout delivers everything one could want from a globetrotting action-packed adventure. The stunts, the scenery, the escalating suspense swell into a stunning spectacle unmatched in modern cinema. Mission: Impossible has been angling to take the mantle of best action franchise and with the all-out insanity of Fallout, it takes that mantle, obliterating all of its competition along the way. Fallout is a rarity in the M:I series as it’s a direct sequel to the events of Rogue Nation. The nefarious Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has been captured but his army of rogue agents across the world carry on his work under the name of The Apostles. The Apostles want to secure plutonium to craft three atomic bombs that they plan to detonate in hopes of destroying the modern world order. Presented with the mission that he chose to accept, Ethan Hunt and his reliable team including Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) venture around the world in search of the highly in demand plutonium. However, one slip up has the CIA not trusting the IMF team, and CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) installs her agent August Walker (Henry Cavil) alongside Hunt on his covert mission in Paris. By the sixth film in the series, Ethan Hunt knows his way around the world of international espionage, meaning that he only truly trusts those who have been longtime members of his team. When the mission has him posing an international to infiltrate a deal brokered by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), Hunt can’t take anyone at their word which makes for some great moments of tension followed by unpredictable action. Thing get even more complicated when Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) joins the picture and her mission is seemingly at odds with Hunt’s. The larger picture of the plot is incredibly simple – bad guys want nukes; good guys want to stop them. It’s the smaller character details and interactions where the film gets more complex but it’s easy to retain a sense of where everyone stands since Ethan Hunt is the film and the series’ moral compass. And did I tell that this movie had action? I mean, Mission: Impossible – Fallout has so many jaw-dropping sequences of holy shit action. Cruise does the incredible HALO jump from upward of 20,000 feet. Then there’s a stunning motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris. McQuarrie presents a keen eye for capturing action and coherently tying the racing images together so that nothing is lost in the high-speed fray. A fight with Cruise and Cavil vs. Liang Yang in a bathroom is absolutely wild, masterfully highlighting the physicality of the actors engaged in battle and McQuarrie’s deft staging of the melee. Cruise employs his trademark sprint through the streets of London at high speed, jumping from rooftops and through windows in another thrilling sequence. All of which culminates in the spectacular finale, a thrilling helicopter chase through the Indian mountains with the fate of the world on the line. The scale is immense, the action insane, and all of it presented with astonishing precision. Cruise continues to go above and beyond the call of duty as an action hero, and his work in Fallout stands as some of his most daring works yet. Jackie Chan is sitting back and watching Tom Cruise’s stunt work and questioning his sanity. Say what you will about Cruise’s personal life choices, the man is immensely dedicated to his craft and takes his work to incredible levels, placing himself at risk to entertain you. That’s a fuckin’ movie star. One thing that makes Fallout so compelling for fans of the Mission: Impossible series is the villainous Solomon Lane, who is basically a funhouse mirror version of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. Sean Harris speaks in this chilling raspy whisper that oozes emotional detachment and moral nihilism. Lane wants to ruin the current world order and is willing to kill millions to achieve that goal. Hunt, on the other hand, is decidedly apolitical – he doesn’t oppose Lane’s plans because of any guiding ideological draw but simply that his plan would cause the death of untold millions. I really think that McQuarrie knows that making the film too overtly political would be dangerous territory and retaining a certain apolitical idealism around Hunt makes it better for the audience to embrace as a hero regardless of their standing on the political spectrum – this, mind you, is more a commentary on the current state of American politics than the work of Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie, or the entire Mission: Impossible series which has really avoided making any strong political stances in the past. Nearly 24 hours after seeing Mission: Impossible – Fallout, I’m still buzzing with a cinematic high thanks to the action-packed work McQuarrie and Cruise. If possible, I would’ve turned right around to watch it again. Many try to make movies on this scale that are so damned captivating but, my god, these Mission: Impossible movies continue to pull off the impossible. A dazzling high-wire act of a movie, Mission Impossible – Fallout is another winner for the series, with Tom Cruise performing some of his most amazing stunts in Christopher McQuarrie’s insanely entertaining sequel. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls."
"Oct 26, 2018",neutral," The Cruisemeister is back in full action and full sparkly teeth mode in Mission Impossible: Fallout, the latest instalment in the Ethan Hunt saga. Joining him once more is director Christopher McQuarrie – following on from Rogue Nation and past Tom efforts in Jack Reacher and The Edge of Tomorrow amongst other things. After five movies in a decent franchise, what could they do next? To stop a worldwide disaster, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and the IMF team – Luther (Rhames) and Benji (Pegg) – must team up with CIA assassin (Cavill) after an initial effort to reclaim stolen plutonium from terror group The Apostles is botched. With the weapons now missing and in real danger of falling into the wrong hands, Hunt and the gang must track the plutonium down in a race against time before it’s too late. McQuarrie, Cruise, and co. had a mission and, boy, did they choose to accept it. By the time any franchise reaches its sixth installment, there’s always the real fear that things could get a bit stale and/or monotonous. It’s as if McQuarrie realised this, used his loaf and decided to go the other way. By fully incorporating the previous movies into Ethan Hunt’s character and story, things really felt natural and the bigger story was helped by this fact. The story itself is very good, as is the writing, acting and, of course, the action – some of the set pieces and stunts are mind-blowingly good. Do yourselves a favour, see it on the biggest screen possible and be blown away by one of the best action movies in decades. Tom Cruise once more shows that he is a real action star – it’s well known that he performs his own stunts but it’s worth mentioning once more because some of the stunts in Fallout are exceptional. The man shows no signs of slowing down and he’s as good as ever here. Henry Cavill and moustache are big, beefy, handsome and imposing with Pegg, Rhames, Ferguson, and Baldwin all excellent as well. Having Maverick, Nicholas Angel, Superman, The Boss Baby and Diamond Dog on screen together was always going to be ace. Set piece-wise, this movie is sensational. The much-talked-about HALO jump over Paris is breathtaking – combined with stunning imagery – and an exhilarating motorbike chase later in the movie is a fine example of how a city chase should be done. The action is brutal (particularly a toilet battle early in the movie) and I wouldn’t fancy bumping into a pissed off Cavill either. DoP Rob Hardy does a fine job here as well with some beautiful imagery and scenes that further fuel the movie – not to mention Lorne Balfe’s majestic score. What I particularly took joy in was the fact that the movie never felt long or bloated with its 147-minute runtime, the pacing was just right and there’s something in every scene to keep you glued to what’s going on. Were some of the events contrived or maybe even overblown? Sure, but in a movie this good, it’s forgivable. Delivering the best movie in a franchise that’s already five efforts in a marvellous feat from McQuarrie, Cruise et al and Fallout is more than deserving of the acclaim. It’s big, exhilarating, breathtaking and simply just bloody good – accept the mission."
"Oct 18, 2018",positive," Directed by Christopher McQuarrieStarring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Simon PeggRunning time 2 hours 27 minutesMPAA rating: PG-13by Sandy DeVito, Rosalie Kicks, Dan ScullyThe Tommy C. Appreciation Club, or TCAC, solemnly swears to watch and appreciate all theatrical performances by Tom Cruise then recap them, round-table style. In this edition, the Moviejawn crew embarks on a bonkers adventure with our pal Tommy in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Sandy DeVito, The WitchQueen of Darkness: Okay, y'all. TOMMY CLUB REVIVAL NUMBER ONE. I still don't really understand how I missed Tommy C. Club the last time around, but I'm very pleased it’s been revived. I've been watching a lot of Tommy in the past two weeks because I marathon'd all the M:I movies in prep for Fallout (I'd only ever seen the de Palma one before this marathon) and let me tell you, they did NOT disappoint. Rogue Nation is definitely the best one, harnessing all the camp, drama and suspense scattered throughout the previous four. But I digress.Fallout is fucking great for one thing in particular: THE STUNTS ARE FUCKING BANANAS. Tommy jumps out of airplanes at hundreds of thousands of feet. Tommy uses a rope to scale a helicopter mid-flight only to careen it through the air trying to avoid a machine gun and crash it into another helicopter and then both helicopters CRASH DOWN A FUCKING MOUNTAIN and teeter on the precipice of a ravine. Tommy has a fucking incredibly choreographed fight in a bathroom that you frankly must see to believe. Tommy drag races cars down tiny London streets. There isn't one nuclear bomb in this narrative, THERE ARE TWO, and they can't be conventionally disarmed, and I bit my pinky nail off in suspense at that end sequence. And the best thing about all this bonkers action is Tommy did a bunch of his own stunts. Tommy is an animal. But I will say, I find it pretty ironic that McQuarrie switched out one problematic asshole with another. It's also not a great look to state disparaging shit about #MeToo when your next on-screen role is playing a (sort of a spoiler?) horrible villain? Movies like this are escapism, but that's a blending of reality and fantasy I could fucking do without. Dan Scully: Surprising nobody who has ever heard me speak of this series (or really any movie), I absolutely adored Fallout. It may take a second viewing to be sure, but this might be my new favorite M:I entry, a distinction which has always gone to Ghost Protocol. If I may introduce objectivity into a purely subjective matter, I believe this to be the best film in the franchise so far (“best” and “favorite” are distinctions I’m happy to make - fight me).While I know we’re here to shower love upon the smiling face of Tommy C., the person who emerges as the true winner of this production is writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. We often don’t think of him as an auteur so much as a screenwriter who made the jump to filmmaking, but Fallout has all but assured that he will go down as one of the great blockbuster storytellers. He’s certainly made one of the smartest and most exciting blockbusters of the modern era — heck, of all time. In an era where crisp action has been replaced with crispy action — where sequences are assembled in post-production as opposed to being built from the ground up — it’s exciting to see action serve as a narrative device, rather than just punctuation for the sake of adhering to genre form. It’s doubly exciting to see action that has clarity, a notion that has become foreign to so many action flicks. Here, the visuals have a soft edge and a fluidity not often seen at the multiplex, while still packing an unbelievable wallop. Add to that an exciting, game cast with Tommy “I will do literally anything so long as it’s crazy” Cruise at the forefront, and you simply can’t lose. In my humble opinion, Fallout is a masterpiece. Rosalie Kicks, Old Sport: I would not go as far to say it's a masterpiece, however Fallout is a damn fine action movie. Despite the run time being two hours and twenty-seven minutes, I found it to move swiftly. There were moments that I even found my heart racing. This wasn’t just due to Tommy C.'s captivating smile either. Don't fret, Tommy C. charms, but it is the incredibly bonkers action sequences that will leave you talking. Particularly, the motorcycle chase Tommy C has with Rebecca Ferguson. Rebecca, lady, you are freaking rad. Having stopped watching the franchise with the J.J. Abrams, Mission: Impossible III, I am pleased to find that my timing to return is impeccable, as I totally missed the Renner years. It was a pleasant surprise to see Ving Rhames still hanging in there and the Simon Pegg addition. Simon is always a pleasure to spend time with and should be in every major universe franchise thing. The nerdy Benji character he portrays won my heart. I'm still astonished by all the practical effects that were used to make this movie particularly THE MASKS! Thanks to Angela Bassett, I am now able to refer to this as a Halloween movie. Masks are great (unless we are talking the mask of Crispin), and I love that they are such an integral part of this series. A movie like this is the reason that you go to the theater. You need to see it big or not at all. In my eyes, Tommy C. has now completely redeemed himself after that unspeakable ""movie"" in which he attempted to dabble as a Universal Monster. In Fallout, Tommy C. doesn't let you down. His charisma oozes off the screen and it is easy to see that he cares about us and our viewing experience. Tommy C. gives it everything he has. I have never in my life seen him run faster, jump higher or deliver lines smoother. I'm back aboard the Cruise ship and am convinced that no matter what the mission is, with Tommy C. it is always possible. Cuz’ as he so confidently reminds us throughout the flick, ""I'll figure it out."" Sandy DeVito, The WitchQueen of Darkness: You know what I really love about Tommy C.? I love the fact that he clearly loves the audiences who come to see his movies. Some actors and filmmakers, you get the impression they're sick of people, or that they even enjoy mocking the audience or their fans or the press. But Tommy? Tommy loves the people. Tommy's movies are always for ordinary people. He makes movies because he loves to make movies. He loves his audience, and he wants to do whatever he can to make them happy. Tommy's zodiac sign is Cancer, and Cancer people love to make the people they love HAPPY. Every time I watch a Tommy movie (Fallout is no exception), I get a strong feeling he wants to make me happy with his performance. It's clear that Tommy isn't just an actor who loves his job, he's also a fan of movies. And that's everything when you're watching a film; you can feel that radiating out from the screen. He's doing all those crazy stunts for YOU. He's smiling for YOU. He's being intense and professing to be the storm for YOU, dear audience. Tommy is a true movie star. Oh, you know what I don't want though? I don't want Ethan (Tommy) and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) to be lovers. I don't even want them to be fuck buddies. I just want them to be close friends who really respect each other and would help each other out of any kind of jam, platonically. I just really don't want them to fuck, y'all. Why can't Ilsa just live? Does Ethan really need to be fucking someone on the regular? We've already figured out (via Michella Monaghan's Jules) that any kind of long-term relationship for him is gonna be super difficult due to his (fucking crazy) line of work. Can't he just have wildly romantic flings? Can't Ilsa? I'm glad they avoided making them kiss or some cliche shit like that, and don't get me wrong, I fucking love romance and sex and kissing in movies, but I just don't want that for them. And if he was gonna be with anyone long-term, it should have been Thandie Newton (M:I 2 is fucking great, y'all, fuck off). Also, I said this to Rosalie, but after this, I definitely need a break from the M:I franchise. I marathoned all of them and as enjoyable as they are (very), I need a break from the Batshit Stunt genre for a bit. I have a watchlist that's 900+ films long! I need variety in my life. Also, I would really, really love to see a woman direct the next M:I film. I think that would be fucking awesome. I think that would be totally rad. If anyone can find a way to up the ante after the absolutely insane stunts in Fallout, it's a woman. Dan Scully: In re-watching the entire series, the one thing I wanted to track was how much of a character Ethan Hunt really is. With accusations abound that Tommy C. is only playing himself, I thought it important to try and parse out just how much of Hunt is script and how much is Cruise. I’m pleased to report that Hunt is most definitely a character, but that this character, as evidenced by another repeated phrase in Fallout shares the same core values as the actor: “I won’t let you down.” No sir, you sure as shit have not let us down.  And that really is the magic of a Tommy C. as Sandy said, his goal is to entertain us at all costs, and short of a few poor role choices here and there, he never disappoints. Even in something dumb like The Mummy, he can never be accused of phoning it in, a distinction that few actors can say of their body of work. Tommy C. shows the hell up no matter what, and when paired with a director like McQuarrie, another artist who simply refuses to give less than his all, the results are magic. I must wholeheartedly agree that I wish for no type of sexual relationship to bud between Hunt and Ilsa. It just doesn’t work and is totally unneeded. I think Fallout put an ice cap on Hunt’s dalliance with suburban normalcy, and that’s where it should stay. Ilsa is like 20 years his junior and is way too strong of a character to be pinned down with something so passé and unnecessary. And if there’s one thing Tommy can’t really do, IMO, it’s heteronormative sexiness. I just don’t buy it. Cruise and Hunt read as distinctly asexual to me and that’s kinda how I like it. Something tells me that this will be the last M:I movie, and I think it serves well as a series capper, and really, how can we possibly escalate things further? Send Tommy C. to space? Sure, he’ll do it, but I think I’m good. But if we are to make another one, and we were to hire a woman to direct, I’ll throw my hat in the ring for Michelle MacLaren. And if we really want to continue the series without Tommy C. (which we don’t) I see no reason why Rebecca Ferguson couldn’t carry the series, snapping necks with her thighs through at least two more entries. If the mission was to create a stunning entry in a 22-year old franchise, with an eye toward upping every aspect of it to oblivion, well, mission accomplished. Rosalie Kicks, Old Sport: A Rebecca Ferguson Mission spin off, bring it! That lady is YES and needs to be in more flicks. However, I'd like to believe that this franchise will keep going as long as Tommy is breathing in and out. Seriously, Tommy C. ain't ever biting the dust.  (Ed. note: Thousands of Scientologists will tell you he won't). He has gotta have some kind of plan figured out. He's a prepper. Nothing can stop this guy. Not even a jazzy scooter. Tommy is going to keep running, jumping and donning rubber masks until it is coffin time. Picture it, scooter stunts. Scooter stunts in space! The possibilities are endless and truly nothing is impossible. The Tommy C. Report Card was completed by Sandy DeVito, Rosalie Kicks, Dan Scully and our friends at Cinedelphia, Jill Malcolm & Ryan Silberstein. The final score reflects an average of all report cards completed by TCAC and is taken extremely seriously...which is to be expected."
"Oct 17, 2018",positive,"Sure, it was an enjoyable time at the movies. But I bet if you ask me about it next week, I'll barely be able to remember watching it."
"Oct 16, 2018",positive," Over 20 years ago (!), Tom Cruise brought us the first chapter of a franchise nobody ever expected to last. After a bit of a misstep with the sequel (sorry, I know it has its supporters, but it’s an overbloated mess) and disappointing box office result from the third film, many assumed it may be the last we’d seen of Ethan Hunt. Thankfully, Paramount stuck with this franchise, and thank god they did. With Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the sixth film of this saga, they’ve delivered one of the greatest action films of all time and one of the best and most enjoyable movies of the year. Yep. It’s that good. It’s a genuine rarity to see a franchise improve with each chapter, let alone arrive at its high point with its sixth offering. But the Mission: Impossible franchise just gets better and more ridiculously entertaining with age. Just like Cruise, the series has become one of the most reliable properties in Hollywood. Each film has delivered more insane thrills and delicious action than its predecessor, yet never feels overdone or contrite. In bang for your buck terms, this may be the most solid return on your admission price all year. Can you tell I had an outrageously fun time with this film? Normally with action films, the plot is rather superfluous to the action. But one of this franchise’s brilliant calling cards has been its determination to spin a narrative so overloaded with complications and exposition, it makes your head spin. Carrying on from Rogue Nation (it’s not essential to have seen the fifth instalment but it sure helps), Fallout begins with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his trusty sidekick Benji Dunn (a fabulous Simon Pegg) attempting to gain possession of three missing plutonium orbs. The dangerous spheres are in the hands of rogue MI6 agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the former leader of the villainous group known as The Syndicate. After the events of the previous film left The Syndicate in ruins, Solomon now leads the remaining members the organisation, calling them his “Apostles,” who are hell-bent on causing mass-destruction around the globe so a new world order can rise up. During the botched operation, Ethan is forced to choose between saving his perennial wingman Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) or taking ownership of the nuclear material. As has always been his one fatal character flaw, Ethan chooses the life of the ones he loves over the lives of potentially millions. While this decision sits well with IMF boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), it incurs the wrath of new CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett). Seeing Ethan’s actions as wildly uncontrollable, Erica sends her “fixer” August Walker (a scene-stealing Henry Cavill) to accompany Ethan on the mission to locate Solomon alive and recover the stolen orbs. More importantly, August is strictly instructed to keep a close eye on Ethan’s every move, clouding his true intentions and allegiances. Complicating matters is the return of MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebeca Ferguson), who has been ordered to eliminate Solomon in order to restore her reputation with the British spy organisation, thus burying the secret of The Syndicate’s existence. Adding to the complicated mix is a mysterious deal-broker named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a wealthy femme fatale with a knack for black market arms dealing and a particular interest in Ethan, who is posing to her as an Apostle named John Lark. As the mission to locate Solomon takes Ethan and his crew around the globe, it becomes increasingly likely not everything is as it seems and someone is potentially playing both sides. But just who is playing who? And who can Ethan really trust when the fate of the world is at stake? If this plot sounds horrendously complex, you’re not wrong. It’s a dizzying maze filled with double-crosses, hidden agendas, and, of course, a swag of those infamous and franchise-staple uber-realistic masks. Sure, its stakes aren’t exactly the most original. The “uh oh, a terrorist group has a bunch of nukes” action movie trope has been done dozens and dozens of times before. But it’s a minor quibble in a film that gets everything else so perfectly right. The zig-zagging narrative continually keeps you guessing, leaving the audience superbly entertained. The misdirections are all perfectly and intelligently executed and they’re only elevated by the film’s utterly jaw-dropping action sequences. With a pace that barely ever stops to take a breath (or allow you to collect yours), Mission: Impossible – Fallout is genuinely one of the best action films there has ever been. Director Christopher McQuarrie’s decision to essentially make the film one giant whirlwind trip around the globe is utterly magic, managing to drop the action into the most dazzling of backdrops. We get a madcap dash across some London rooftops (featuring Cruise’s infamous ankle-breaking leap which is left untouched in the film and genuinely painful to watch), a heart-pounding Ronin-esque car chase through the streets of Paris, a spectacularly brutal hand-to-hand fight inside the pristine white bathroom of a Paris nightclub, a skydiving sequence where Ethan and August literally leap right into the middle of a lightning storm, and the Kasmir-based (well, it’s actually New Zealand) finale featuring a chaotic helicopter showdown and plenty of heart-racing cliff-climbing. McQuarrie proved himself a master of capturing these sensational sequences in the previous film, but he really ups the game here, delivering set pieces unlike any we’ve seen in 2018. This makes anything Marvel has dished up look tame by comparison, particularly with McQuarrie and Cruise’s insistence on using practical stunt work generally performed by the actor himself. Cruise is clearly having an absolute ball filming every single ridiculous scenario, creating moments which feel completely authentic and utterly terrifying. We know Ethan is going to make it through each calamity, but McQuarrie crafts each piece with such nail-biting tension, it’s somehow hard not to expect the worst. With every near-death experience, there were plenty of gasps in my cinema, including a few elicited from yours truly. Every moment in Mission: Impossible – Fallout is entirely earned. By mostly ignoring the use of green screens and digital wizardry, the astonishing physical effects feel entirely human with genuine risk and danger presented for the audience’s entertainment. It’s what made Mad Max: Fury Road such a sublime visceral experience and it’s the same masterstroke of genius on display here. You’ll hear this a lot, but you really do need to seek out the biggest screen possible on which to view this film. It’s an enveloping rollercoaster that you will not want to end, despite it’s rather mammoth running time. McQuarrie keeps the film moving at such a breakneck speed, you will barely notice you’ve been sitting in your chair for over two hours. Backed by an impeccable supporting cast, Cruise shines like always, managing to completely eliminate any trace of that period of time when he became somewhat of a Hollywood pariah. His enthusiasm and energy for this role have not diminished one iota and he’s so completely relaxed in Ethan’s skin. In a career of iconic performances, it’s highly likely this will be the one we remember most fondly. We’ve seen him hurl himself around like this six times now, yet it’s still thrilling to watch him take his intensity to an entirely new level. His camaraderie with Pegg and Rhames is once-again beautifully genuine. His rivalry with Cavill is absolutely delicious. And his chemistry with Ferguson is downright electric. It’s a terrific ensemble treat where every cast member is matching Cruise’s unrelenting commitment. If this is to be his swansong as Ethan Hunt, he’s going out on a high. At a time when sequel and tentpole exhaustion is at an all-time high, it’s decidedly refreshing to find a sequel hitting such an impressive home run. McQuarrie has crafted a follow-up that takes everything that’s great about this franchise and strives to push further. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is everything a giant summer blockbuster should be, and then some. It’s a non-stop thrill ride that entertains like nothing else has this year, thus far. It’s the perfect blend of action and narrative that makes for such joyful cinema. Accept this mission and have an absolute ball."
"Oct 11, 2018",positive," This far along the M:I track, we should, at least subconsciously, feel like Rogue Nation‘s Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, field status remains questionable): well-aware that the declared impossibility is a ruse. Sure, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, enjoyment apparent and series’ hair rule broken again) can react with the “Dude…” expression and struggle come action time, but we know how things will play out. Fool once, shame you, twice me, et cetera. It’s the sixth turn now. So why do we stay seated? Maybe it’s because, after 2, each installment accomplishes in being finer than the one before, like white-knuckled cheese and high-octane wine. J.J. Abrams’ gusto makes the agent’s domestic life one worth saving. Brad Bird’s realization of Pixar-tinged ingenuity brings glee into the usual doomsday plot. Christopher McQuarrie matures the whole supply with dives into intrigues and consequences. In other words, it’s the directors rather than the characters, the engineers instead of the passengers, who face the can-be-unwinnable trial of raising the bar. Fortunately, victory has never been out of stock, and Fallout turns what it nabs into a feet-off-ground, fireworks-all-around kind of actioner. ­Your mission, the only one, is to be onboard and avoid the bunker at all costs. It helps that McQuarrie is again the helmer and the scribe (franchise’s first!), rendering Fallout both a challenge and a possible upgrade. Or a greater challenge as it can become an upgrade. For those believing that Rogue Nation was sluggish, slightly or wholly, Fallout hears you, and in response it moves with the fast-forward button held down. See the effect right from the start: Only single-digit minutes (four?) have passed and then Ethan is given the briefer, which prior to self-destruction outlines two items — the rising of The Apostles, aka what’s left of in-custody MI6 turncoat Solomon Lane (Sean Harris)’s Syndicate, and their need to snatch three plutonium Poké Balls for an imminent “great suffering.” The usual suspects of close-calls, country-hopping, mask-making, infiltrations and stunts abound. Downright great callbacks to every previous Mission and satisfying payoffs for every department are also in the cargo hold. The latter is why Fallout is the same bullet-train on a different track, one where the only stopping point is at the end of the line. It’s a setting where a radioactive midnight is one minute away — why thanks, Ethan, for losing the bombs! — so such velocity is justified. We might feel like the Road Runner trying to keep up with the proceedings — an arms-dealing scioness (Vanessa Kirby, seductive through diction) knows where the WMDs are, Lane is returning, loyalty again forcing Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, fashionably chilly) to complicate the mission, a frustrated CIA assigning its own deadly angel (Henry Cavill, engaging) for support, and nightmares with Julia (Michelle Monaghan, kindness galore) — but McQuarrie always has us oriented and, amazingly, whiplash-free. With riveting concision in the penning, he guarantees that the prerequisite, adeptly built espionage-y webs won’t entangle us; once the details are communicated it’s all about perfecting the ensuing sensation. An M:I film with an emotional thread that bears as much impact as the explosions? It’s here, and that’s a mighty-fine bonus on top of the franchise’s bread-and-butter aspects that Fallout have either elevated or sharpened. Though everyone’s in a hurry, production designer Peter Wenham doesn’t use that as an excuse to take shortcuts; the conversion of Paris’ Grand Palais into a classy rave at the front and a jazz club in the back is a definite highlight. A new world is yet nigh, though composer Lorne Balfe’s hymnic-then-catastrophic orchestrations, editor Eddie Hamilton’s patient cutting and d.p. Rob Hardy’s steadfast framing suggest it has been the state of things after the production logos. “The impossibility is real,” the trio’s work, combined with McQuarrie’s direction, declared, and you’ll believe it, willingly, too, as Ethan HALO-jumped into Paris, burns rubber on a bike and later a car in something straight out of “Ronin 2.0,” and bends physics while piloting a heli to a cliffside boxing ring at the home stretch. Oof, the adrenaline just rises upon typing this. Still, we shouldn’t ignore that it is in the leading man that M:I finds its existence. There will come a point where Cruise has to refuse the mission, and most of us believed it arrived last August. Intentional or not, narrative purposes or otherwise, for Ethan or his vessel Cruise, the sense of an ending is suffocating in Fallout, allowing sweat beads to mingle with the electricity from big-screen thrills. “I won’t let you down,” IMF’s poster agent uttered at one point, and afterward it’d be wise to believe that you will hear the statement echoing for as long as the team stays in commission."
"Oct 11, 2018",positive,Without question the best blockbuster of the year. Mission accomplished!
"Oct 10, 2018",positive," The film franchise that doubles as Tom Cruise’s personal playground and workout center is BACK in Mission: Impossible – Fallout! A direct sequel to the last adventure, Rogue Nation, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt unwittingly facilitates the theft of three balls of plutonium, snatched up by a covert group (aren’t they always?) known only as “The Apostles”. Their mission: to distribute these as dirty bombs and trigger a catastrophic, global event which could reset life as we know it. Ethan’s mission, which he never fails to accept, is to retrieve the plutonium, identify the source known only as John Lark, and prevent untold destruction. The sixth film in a franchise over 20 years old, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is not breaking any new ground in terms of plot or action spectacle. You take your seat, and you know exactly what to expect: dire circumstances, insanely unbelievable rubber masks, flashy stunts, double agents, a handful of gadgets, and a 93% chance Tom Cruise runs like a gazelle at some point before the final credits scroll. Much like writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s script, this isn’t rocket science. Speaking of the story, it IS ludicrous and preposterous, and I honestly couldn’t care less. There are films where plot points and continuity errors can crash a movie like this to its knees, but Mission: Impossible is exempt for me in this regard. In fact, I would have a hard time reciting ANY of the M:I plots outside of the first – and still greatest – film in the series. As with James Bond, Ethan Hunt is a character I want to see either escape or pursue, that is his nature. So if the plot doesn’t matter, what does? Spectacle. Good, old-fashioned eye candy. No, I’m not talking about Henry Cavill and his humongous biceps as CIA assassin August Walker. It’s the visceral thrills contained within this 2-plus hours that will keep audiences on the edge of their seat for the duration. In this film alone, we have a heart-thumping HALO jump, a motorcycle chase through city traffic, the obligatory “RUN, TOM, RUNNNNN!” scene (where Cruise sprints further than that runway in Fast and Furious 6), and the electric finale with helicopters dueling mid-air while traversing a mountain range. Any one of these in another franchise would function as a centerpiece to build a story around. In Fallout, there simply isn’t enough time between set-pieces for a layered narrative, and that’s a perfectly acceptable reasoning. Casting wise, the IMF returns in full (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, and a pleasant throwback to a character from previous films), with the primary addition lying with the impressively massive shoulders that belong to Henry Cavill. August Walker is referred to as the “hammer” to Hunt’s “scalpel”, and this analogy simply boggles the mind. I’m exceptionally boggled. While Walker prefers the direct approach of using his lethality to confront issues, it’s not like Hunt is blowing kisses and hugging babies. They both take their problems to pound town, leaving gaggles of random terrorist red-shirts suffering severe musculature damage in their wake. Regardless, even though Cavill emotes as effectively as a random block of wood, his sheer stature posits him as a formidable conflict for Hunt to contend with. That brings me to Ethan Hunt. After 20 years, Tom Cruise has used the magic of his genetic lottery winnings to great advantage as he once again insists on performing most of his own stunts. A lot of media attention is paid to this whiter version of Jackie Chan and his preference to test the limits of insurance payouts by performing in this manner at his age. The truth is, it works. I don’t know about you, but even with the technology we currently have, I can ALWAYS tell when an actor has had a CGI touchup or a stunt man has taken up his slack. You can call Tom Cruise whatever you want, as long as you preface it with “this guy would sever his own pinkie toe to make a movie more stimulating for audiences”. Because he proves it’s true, every single time. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an exciting spy flick that thrives on that summer movie spirit. If you can look past a story you’ve seen countless times and the weird way McQuarrie chooses to shoot Cavill and Cruise at cockeyed angles so “one” of them doesn’t appear to be a hobbit compared to the other; then strap in for one of the most thrilling films of the summer! I’m still not sure what the hell, if anything, really happened. But I do know Tom Cruise looked damn good saving us all."
"Oct 10, 2018",positive," Tom Cruise has done it again. I don’t know how this dude always does this, but he seems like he is a non-stop machine for great action movies. The Mission: Impossible franchise has been a great series that survived through some crazy ups and downs. However, its center, Cruise, has always put out enough effort to make these movies feel special in ways other franchises can’t uphold. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is unique in the franchise for being one of the only direct sequels. Lots of characters and ideas from the 5th film, Rogue Nation come back to complete their arcs. Yet at the same time, you can enter the movie and still quickly get the stakes. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) cares about people and his team. They’ll always come before others, and he’ll go out of his way to ensure their safety. It’s a core value to the character that gets pushed to the limits here. The real star of this movie, beyond Cruise, has got to be Christopher McQuarrie. The Oscar-winning screenwriter for The Usual Suspects has now become a Cruise specialty director. In addition to both MI5 and MI6, McQuarrie directed the first Jack Reacher film and wrote Edge of Tomorrow. This guy just gets Cruise and allows him to jump headfirst into these death traps. Yet the way he shoots the action is simply unparalleled. The first hour of the movie is near perfection. You could strip away all the dialogue and easily tell the film through the visual imagery. It’s the closest a movie has come to perfect visual storytelling in the action genre since Mad Max: Fury Road. This is also a film that never really makes you feel it’s runtime, despite a two and half hour runtime. The pacing is extraordinary, and McQuarrie uses set piece after set piece to deliver amazing scenes. You can easily refer to several of those set pieces as instantly iconic. The bathroom. The club inside the museum. The race through Paris. The helicopter chase. Each of these scenes is awesome in its own right, but when tiled together they create a next level action film. The scenes in Paris stick out as some of the best scenes in the franchise. The cat and mouse game between Cruise and Vanessa Kirby is one for the ages. In these movies, it is rare for someone to actually go into a scene with Cruise and take it over. Kirby does it over and over again in limited screen time, which will make you wish she was in the movie a lot more. Henry Cavill does some okay work, but nothing outside of his normal range. He’s big and bulky, a physically formidable member of Hunt’s team. The arm reload has got to be one of the funniest, yet most badass things in an action movie in years. Angela Bassett makes the most of her screen time and continues to showcase why she should just get cast in everything. Sean Harris proves yet again that the Harris bloodline is simply born to act. The son of Jared Harris (Mad Men/ The Crown) and Richard Harris (Harry Potter) is someone who can invoke pure evil when he chooses to. It’s a skill that is very underrated and should serve him well in a long career. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are back again, helping to make a fun team to surround Cruise. You can easily argue that Rhames is overacting a bit here, but he’s serviceable through most of the film. Pegg is very fun again, making you wish they used him more. Rebecca Ferguson steals many scenes in the film and again can physically match up with anyone. It’s very similar to Evangeline Lilly’s ability to take over Ant-Man and the Wasp, but she’s not quite as dynamic. Overall, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is one of the best entries in the franchise. It is both emotionally and visually exciting to experience. While it won’t crack my Top 10 of the year, it’s clear why it will for some. It’s undeniably one of the best of the summer and should be seen on the biggest screen possible."
"Sep 28, 2018",positive,"""Mission: Impossible"" is the closest thing Hollywood has going next to a James Bond franchise, and going it is."
"Sep 27, 2018",positive," The sixth movie in producer-star Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series is a marvel of American engineering. This exciting, semi-adult cartoon of espionage could have been laid out in an intricate schematic instead of a screenplay. Its savvy amalgamation of gimmickry, glamour, and athletics, on the one hand, and spy games played like mind games, on the other, generates tension and release for a super-swift 147 minutes.  To maintain rooting interest, the film injects a shot of idealism every 20 minutes. Cruise’s Impossible Missions Force (IMF) agent, Ethan Hunt, refuses to sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good. He won’t leave any IMF agent behind. When he goes undercover with corrupt movers and shakers, he strategizes to avoid killing other law enforcers. He even apologizes to a Parisian parking cop wounded in the crossfire.  The writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie, has worked with Cruise for over a decade, writing and co-producing Valkyrie (2008) and writing and directing the previous Mission: Impossible movie, Rogue Nation (2015), as well as Jack Reacher (2012). He’s also done credited or uncredited work on the scripts for The Edge of Tomorrow (2014), The Mummy (2017), and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011). He cleverly uses Hunt’s moral integrity as a source of suspense. We wonder, “How can he keep his conscience clean and get the job done this time?” He also knows how to keep the drama in his star’s wheelhouse, mostly by keeping him moving. McQuarrie builds extreme action and “give” into each of the film’s acts, enabling Cruise’s Hunt to test his mettle and his metal, whether he’s operating a vintage BMW sedan or a cutting-edge Airbus helicopter. Like Richard Lester’s famous 1959 comedy short, this is a running, jumping, and standing-still film—although the closest Hunt comes to standing still is when stuntman/actor Liang Yang wraps a sink-pipe around Cruise’s neck.  The movie dips into bathetic hero-worship only when it describes the toll it has taken on Hunt to divorce his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) for her protection. (Quelle surprise!) It’s not enough for that brass-tacks agent Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) to rumble Hunt’s praises. We must hear Julia herself, a humanitarian nurse, give her ex-husband credit for pushing her to lead a purposeful life. We briefly fear that the movie will turn into a Trump cabinet meeting lovefest. Will IMF agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) proclaim Ethan “the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life?” Luckily, the filmmakers restrain themselves. The result is a spiffy, crowd-pleasing contraption. Getting a canny writer-director like McQuarrie to take the helm, twice in a row, ensures the continuity of melodrama and spectacle. His films lack the improbable lilt of Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol, the hyper-personal paranoia and voyeurism of Brian De Palma’s vision in the first film, or the romanticism of the John Woo–directed, Robert Towne–scripted M:I 2. But they’re a big step up from J.J. Abrams’s typically mechanical M:I 3. For the second time, McQuarrie’s resourcefulness and energy refresh the by-now familiar tale of Hunt beating the clock to foil yet another disillusioned agent turned nihilistic madman. This time the top villain is the mysterious “John Lark,” who aims to shock our decadent global civilization into starting over. He gathers the materials to nuke three holy cities: Rome, Mecca, and, of course, Jerusalem, close to Armageddon’s original location. Lark’s atheistic credo: “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.” The lunatic visionary of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), comes back into play, this time as a bargaining chip. A CIA agent named Walker, aka The Hammer (Henry Cavill), has crushed Solomon’s network of embittered ops (“the Syndicate”), making way for Lark’s apostles, who really are called “the Apostles.” Angela Bassett’s Erica Sloan, the new CIA director, orders that Walker be part of Ethan’s mission. Will Walker be competitor, friend, or foe?  The inspiration behind the big-screen M:I series has been to combine the luxurious and/or exotic surfaces of the James Bond movies with a spy vs. spy background as bleak as John le Carré’s. Secret and special services and police and security agencies compete for dominance within each country, and they work at cross-purposes on the global stage. McQuarrie puts these conflicts into sleek comic-strip form. Except for the IMF regulars, everyone’s allegiance is in doubt from the moment they show up on screen. That includes the returning British operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who was Hunt’s match in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.  One character who’s slippery to the end is the chic but lethal arms dealer known as “the White Widow,” who puts on an elegant gala as a British philanthropist in Paris when she isn’t striking dirty deals or wielding a mean butterfly knife. Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in The Crown’s first two seasons) plays her superbly and knowingly, as if in homage to another Vanessa, Redgrave. Indeed, Redgrave played the arms dealer “Max” in the first film, and, in a highly touted Easter egg, the White Widow refers to Max as her mother.  Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation) uses the giant screen to exploit the glittering nocturnal allure of Paris’s Grand Palais and the sun-kissed, sky-scraping grandeur of New Zealand’s Southern Alps (masquerading as Kashmir). He and the rest of McQuarrie’s team provide the wow factor while Cruise supplies the whoa factor, whether he’s performing aero-acrobatics during a HALO jump, hanging from tall buildings and cliff walls, or chasing a heartless enemy through perilous canyons as he tries to avert nuclear disaster. And of course we get the obligatory “See Tom run” scene, highlighting, under duress, his perfect form (tight core, efficient, air-chopping arms). Agee wrote that an ideal gag “would bring the victim up the ladder of laughs by cruelly controlled degrees to the top rung, and would then proceed to wobble, shake, wave and brandish the ladder until he groaned for mercy.” That’s what Mission: Impossible – Fallout does, too. I stayed to the final credit, in case there was a clever tag, but I didn’t feel cheated when there wasn’t one. I needed the time to catch my breath.

"Sep 13, 2018",positive,"This movie is so bomb. It has to be one of the best action films I've seen in a really long time. This had me jumping in my seat... Run, don't walk, to the theater."
"Sep 10, 2018",positive,"I think there's an interesting connection between Cruise and the character he plays...there's a detachment, a sadness around him, what he's had to sacrifice to carry the world's burden on his shoulders."
"Sep 8, 2018",positive," A triumph of action movie filmmaking, Mission: Impossible – Fallout builds  upon its well-established formula of first-class entertainment, to make for a  high stakes, high quality, and character rich, sure to be action classic. Since its inception in 1996, the Mission: Impossible film series has gone from strength to strength.  Fuelled by Tom Cruise’s star power and fearless approach to action performance,  this once faltering franchise found its groove and its popularity after the  excellent Mission: Impossible 3, and with it the addition of JJ Abrams (Star  Wars: The Force Awakens) to the fore. Now the sixth entry, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, has  taken that winning formula of high-grade, high-stakes action scenarios, and  Cruise’s all-in intensity, to breathtaking new heights. Exactly how Cruise and  company will follow up this one will be an impossible mission in itself.  Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (Jack  Reacher), Mission: Impossible –  Fallout finds IMF agent Etan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Luther (Ving  Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), on the hunt for missing nuclear weapons that  have fallen in the hands of mysterious terrorist group “The Apostles”, led by  Hunt’s arch-nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). To make things complicated,  also on the chase for Lane is Hunt’s one-time love interest, MI6 agent Ilsa  Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill.) An incredibly choreographed fight scene inside a  gentleman’s bathroom features Cavill at his fist swinging, bone-crunching best,  trading barbs and sharing action beats with Cruise, who no doubt relished  having Superman himself in his franchise. Great too is Rebecca Ferguson, who  continues to bring that scene-stealing mix of disarming beauty and action  performance smarts to a role that very much deserves its own spin-off. McQuarrie has delivered an action movie that is as  serious as a heart attack, yet which knows how to entertain as well. Where the  likes of The Dark Knight, Skyfall and Mad Max: Fury Road have  evolved the genre to new heights, McQuarrie has successfully taken …Fallout to the top of the action movie  food-chain. Its action scenes are crisp, clean and incredibly well  choreographed and executed. Motor bikes, helicopters, guns, firsts, nuclear  bombs…McQuarrie brings out all the action goodies for his actors to play with.  Where the whole “fate of the world” trump card has been played before, here  McQuarrie makes those sky-high stakes feel palpable. Having Cruise do his maverick, daredevil, action-man  shtick makes it all feel even more palpable. Outside of Jackie Chan, it’s hard  to think of a megastar actor who has placed life and limb on the line with the  same skill and intensity as Cruise. That he is also a fine actor brings more  dimensions to his Ethan Hunt, who since Mission:  Impossible III has been given an arch that’s evolved from one successive  film to another, and hits pay dirt here. Action films are great eye-candy, this is true. But they  can also emote with the same power as your average Oscar drama. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is  another prime example of that. Here is a film of spectacle and personality,  thrills and feeling, great technical skill and fine storytelling. It just also  may be film of the year. Now that is mission accomplished! "
