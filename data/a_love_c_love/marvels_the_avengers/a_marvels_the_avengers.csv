Feb 22 2024,positive,a great fun film that showcases the acting talents of all shown
Feb 17 2024,positive,groundbreaking for its time audiences now days may take team ups and crossovers for granted but ill never forget the first time i saw captain america face off against loki a villain from another franchise nor will i forget seeing characters stand united on screen together without any legal rights interfering and theres also the story which is also paced and balanced perfectly tom hiddleston works his evil magic on our hearts
Feb 16 2024,positive,outstanding storyline great action great actors  what a great comic book teamup should look like
Feb 13 2024,positive,the culmination of phase one arrives to much applause a cinematic first to show that a collection of a shared universe of movies is possible to which many other studios would attempt to formulate themselves with their respective ips   marvel proved that its possible to combine many different heroes together ensemble movies where you have to share screen time with many protagonists can be tough within itself giving each their own character arc all within a 2 12 hour timeframe yet they made it work granted having most characters already have at least one movie beforehand to set the groundwork up for their character helps  this movie is a fun movie all around
Feb 8 2024,positive,it didnt age well today in my opinion too goofy and i have a different view on its director after justice league

Dec 9 2023,positive,a wellmade blockbuster with amazing characters a focused storyline and great action sequences the only issue with this movie is that it drags a little
Dec 5 2023,positive,at a time when the idea of superheroes teaming up was still an idea that many people thought would never happen in live action this was a true event of a film it was a lot of fun and the characters played off of each other very well more lighthearted than some of the future avengers movies which both works for and against it

Nov 11 2023,positive,this is a great film every character gets their chance to shine and they all use their screen time well rdj tom hiddleston and scarlett johansson give the best performances but the rest of the cast is still solid the plot is great with plenty of action and comedy to keep you entertained its exciting seeing all the main heroes meet up for the first time i also love how frighteningintimidating they made the hulk out to be i miss this version of him overall this is a solid entry and definitely one of the mcus best

Nov 7 2023,positive,the beginning and it was at the time the best effing thing
Oct 30 2023,positive,this movie was a great start of a cinematic era
Oct 28 2023,positive,one of the best collabs ever
Oct 12 2023,positive,after a significant buildup consisting of several movies introducing various iconic characters marvel finally delivered the avengers their big superhero crossover and the most ambitious comicbook movie adaptation at that time  directed by joss whedon with an allstar cast portraying the likes of captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr and thor chris hemsworth plus a long hintedat plot that gets to the point right away the film quickly broke a billion dollars at the boxoffice and it remains one of the most popular movies of all time marvels bold expensive move paid off to say the least and comicbook movies are still just as big as they were back in 2012 some would say more so  seeing all these characters together in the same film was certainly a main draw for audiences but without such a talented and dedicated cast its arguably unlikely that the film would have spawned as many sequels and spinoffs as it did and led to the continuation of marvels and disneys comicbook movie domination the story sees loki tom hiddleston use the tesseract to open a space portal thereby allowing all sorts of villainous creatures into the world as nick fury samuel l jackson assembles his team of avengers to stop him  keeping the plot simple was certainly a good move as anything more convoluted than that could have gotten pretty messy on the other hand having the film just be about a onedimensional villain weve already seen in another movie use a macguffin for some vague megalomaniac endgame he doesnt even seem all that devoted to makes the avengers feel a little slight depthwise loki himself isnt quite as interesting as he was in thor but tom hiddleston keeps him charming and fun throughout most of the enemies the avengers face however are faceless noname aliens and are only there to be disposed of   one third of the film is dedicated to introducing characters old and new like bruce bannerthe hulk played by a perfectly cast mark ruffalo the middle part follows lokis escape and the avengers having to deal with that while the finale is just one big new york cityset battle the film is long but its paced well with key action beats and whenever the heroes are interacting with each other even if theyre just standing around discussing exposition its a joy  the avengers isnt a perfect film as i mentioned earlier it isnt exactly a challenging watch which is both good and notsogood but altogether understandable it has quite a few ropey moments especially near the beginning when loki shows up to brainwash hawkeye jeremy renner or whenever some alien thing we dont know is talking next to a glowing staircase somewhere on a space rock or when a joke doesnt quite hit the mark and its a shame that loki never gets a final fight against all the avengers or at least his brother thor  instead he just basically gives up about halfway through this is a slicklooking movie with some impressive cg effects hulk looks great mostly and its never dull but the cast really is the glue that holds the whole thing together robert downey jrs wit chris evans earnest heroism scarlett johanssons superspy antics all of that comes together beautifully and it effortlessly fleshes out characters you wouldnt necessarily expect to care this much about let alone at all  theres no denying what a huge achievement the avengers was the fact that marvel planned out such a ridiculous project so meticulously and it somehow all led to a genuinely solid entertaining blockbuster is worth celebrating the film itself is slightly uneven but its so full of charm and boasts enough cleverly puttogether setpieces that for any comicbook fan especially this is simply a treat  excelsior
Oct 10 2023,positive,yeah i like this movie a lot
Oct 7 2023,positive,for all the mcu newbies out there this is a must to watch this movie introduces all of the og avengers and you arent a marvel fan if you didnt love this movie the villain is well thought out the characters are spectacular and the action scenes are so well performed well done to the director and the entire cast and crew behind this movie

Sep 17 2023,positive,this is what kickstart the mcu and how he became great this was the first ever superhero crossover that weve seen any piece of very very well this film took c list characters in turned them into household names throughout the mcu loki as a villain was so entertaining into me probably the best performance in this movie iron man captain america thor black widow hulk and hawkeye were all interesting and had a character arc of reuniting as a team and they did that really good the only problem that i have with this movie is just a joke it was too many jokes but they balance out the jokes with the seriousness and made sure he didnt feel like a parity of itself this was a really good movie and where the mcu became a cultural phenomenon 910
Sep 10 2023,positive,this was a good first avengers movie i loved the acting and all of the action in this movie overall it was a good time

Aug 30 2023,positive,as someone who isnt a fan of the avengers i wasnt expecting this movie to this good thanks to a script that is emphasized on a characters weaker aspects the avengers came across as sympathetic  likable not to mention this movies way too engaging and entertaining definitely a great movie for hardcore avenger fans  a fantastic movie for casual fans
Aug 29 2023,positive,joss whedon although his recent controversy does an amazing job at uniting these heroes together into a realistic flawed team that must work together for the fate of the world
Aug 18 2023,positive,strong plot great characters plenty of action that is done right and overall one of the best mcu movies

Aug 7 2023,positive,marvels the avengers is a strong installment in the mcu movie franchise worth watching
Aug 7 2023,positive,the 5 stars says it all
Aug 7 2023,positive,peak superhero media the absolute best of the marvel movies the avengers is consistently entertaining and thrilling from start to finish it is brimming with quippy clever dialogue and an undeniable charm every bit that is hokey adds to the flavor of this film from the cheesy costumes and forced jokes to the tryhard nature of some of the action which has ridiculously memorable choreography and moments in every sequence i might add this is an absolute treat of a blockbuster it seems there will never be another movie quite like this one and thats a shame
Aug 5 2023,positive,fantastic movie loved the cross over a great way to end the 1st phase of the mcu
Aug 4 2023,positive,i was blown when all of them came together after gradually building them up throughout the years of phase 1 this movie is a total classic when they face a world ending threat together still definitely one of the best movies in the mcu loki being the villain and the post credits scene of thanos making his debut into the mcu were astonishing
Aug 3 2023,positive,doesnt age as well as you hope but still a classic
Jul 27 2023,positive,the original avengers movie is a classic it was such a cool movie at the time and still holds up pretty well to this day the action the characters the thrills they are just great
Jul 23 2023,positive,the avengers assembles earths mightiest heroes into an exhilarating and actionpacked spectacle showcasing joss whedons skilful direction and delivering a superhero teamup like never before

Jul 14 2023,positive,history in the making an instant classic
Jul 12 2023,positive,this movie is the perfect teamup film i wish i could go back to summer 2012 and experience this in theaters again for the first time
Jul 11 2023,positive,it was really fun to see all the characters interacting for the first time everyone gets a chance to shine at various times throughout a great way to wrap up marvels phase 1
Jul 11 2023,positive,im a marvel person and this started it all
Jul 9 2023,positive,serviceable direction great acting and its cool to see our characters come together however most of the best material for this movie is in the deleted scenes
Jul 4 2023,positive,simply awe inspiring  they said it could never be done but marvel bought together what many believed could not work as a movie  and they knocked it out of the park  not only dose every character get a chance to shine but the writing is so strong that when they all come together you get a feeling of such natural chemistry that at times you forget your watching a comic book movie  to see how far these kinds of movies have come is nothing short of a modern day film miracle as for the first time in a long time audience are given more then was promised to them and then some  but you have to wonder at this point how much more dan a cast grow in number without this fine original quality becoming lost  how many more times can the avengers unite before the genre starts to show ring rust
Jul 3 2023,positive,oh the good old avengers how i miss them
Jul 3 2023,positive,love the avengers and all star cast
Jul 2 2023,positive,as a putting the band together movie it does its job but honestly i know action is a big feature of superhero films but this has two enormously extended action scenes one at half way and one at the end and i think theyre both far too long the middle one is at least interesting enough but the final extended fight scene is just what feels like 45 minutes of cgi bashing and explosions it didnt need to be that long and they could have instead put more character and plot development into the film
Jun 30 2023,negative,overrated flick the action keeps disappointing the characters are strange nonsensical plots lame music just empty
Jun 28 2023,positive,the movie is an cinematic masterpiece that not only serves as a sequel to every other marvel frachise in existence but also finds ways to combine each character of different genres into one cohesive narrative
Jun 28 2023,positive,an awesome team up of the ages
Jun 25 2023,positive,a great movie that helped improve the mcu and start its amazing storyline
Jun 20 2023,positive,this was a good start i remember watching this on theatresturns out i watched all avengers movies in theatres amazing camera movement action packed scenes perfect introductions even nonmarvel fans would love this movie loki is a great villain too btw
Jun 19 2023,positive,the avengers was the very first marvel movie where the avengers assembled for the first time and it was awesome
Jun 16 2023,positive,the movie changes aspect ratios pretty often which can be distracting its a good movie that explores the meeting of the main heroes of the infinity saga but it was a bit jarring how they all went from hating each other to suddenly fighting together so quickly at the end
Jun 11 2023,positive,the first avengers is something special and i will always love it its the first mcu movie i ever saw in theaters and the entire movie is awesome
Jun 8 2023,positive,greatest team up movie ever the origin story of separate characters nicely merged and excellently directed final battle was massive
Jun 8 2023,positive,it was a good movie starring good actors
Jun 4 2023,positive,it is a decent team up film out all the avengers film though this is my least favorite it was awesome to see how the team worked together for the first time facing off against thors adopted brother loki who sets out to attempt to conquer earth for thanos
Jun 4 2023,positive,marvels the avengers is surely phase ones best movie and one of mcus overall with a good plot great characters and performances and stunning action sequences with great cgi
Jun 2 2023,positive,a cultclassic superhero movie of alltime 
May 28 2023,positive,while this film may not seem as special now it managed to bring together a group of characters from separate stories and unite them into one which had never been done before
May 24 2023,positive,its crazy how this movie did things that we only could have dreamed for bringing all heroes for a team up movie
May 21 2023,negative,great ensemble but im expecting for more
May 21 2023,positive,it all leads to this what can you say but well done
May 19 2023,positive,awsome movie my favorite one
May 18 2023,negative,this is a bad boring movie
May 16 2023,positive,the avengers was meticulously crafted and well thought out there was careful consideration taken in every element every plotline and every piece of dialogue which is can be positive but also negative because it was such a monumental cinematic moment it seemed as though the filmmakers were doing everything possible to not mess it up and therefore did not take many risks that being said the film itself is fantastic seeing earths mightiest heroes fight side by side give you goosebumps there are genuinely funny moments and the plot moves forward logically however compared to later films in the mcu the avengers just seems a little too safe
May 13 2023,positive,the crossover superhero epic which first showed how huge stories can marvel call into being and proved that the studio will be an elemental part of hollywood from then on
May 12 2023,positive,brings back good memories
May 10 2023,positive,one of the best mcu movies of all time the avengers are the best in this this has the 2nd best villain an incredible film
May 9 2023,positive,absolute classic nothing else to say
May 9 2023,positive,the avengers is one of the best action movies ive ever watched and i have to tell everybody who will listen that now that ive seen it its hard to express how excited i am i deliberately steer clear of building myself up for movies because i find that when i do nothing really seems to be able to live up to my expectations i typically steer clear of hype trains whenever i can having said that i was quite excited to watch this movie and was entirely on board with the buzz it was unavoidable i could have been severely disappointed if this movie had been bad im overjoyed to say that the exact opposite has occurred
May 8 2023,positive,it is such a classic 
May 6 2023,positive,its a great team up film ive enjoyed the film from first to last the character of loki is even more darker the film battle was iconic joss whedons team up movie was incredible
May 6 2023,positive,dated now but when released it was truly an experience to see all your comic book heroes together for the first time
May 5 2023,positive,this movie blew me away when i first saw it back in 2012 never in my right mind would i imagine that this many at the timecomic book characters would work so well together on the big screen well we have come a long way since then even though it keeps slipping down my ranking of best mcu movies it still is an enjoyable movie
May 5 2023,positive,too much science not enough action but still love rdj chris evens chris hemsworth and mark ruffalo playing these iconic heros and making them the characters i know and love
May 5 2023,positive,this movie has some cool scenes but is actually kinda boring
May 3 2023,positive,amazing film with awesome action and plot
May 1 2023,positive,one of the best mcu films to this date tons of action suspense  the first time i saw the hulk was very scary
Apr 30 2023,positive,avengers assembled and this movie kicks arse
Apr 12 2023,positive,this movie has great pacing great chemistry between its leads and has the perfect level of corniness for an mcu movie loki in this movie makes a great villain and the dynamics between all the heroes is so well thought out also there are some really creative combo attacks from the main characters the flaws for me are that the first few minutes are kinda lacking and some of the jokes are really cringe still a good movie
Apr 10 2023,positive,the 1st avengers movie is a thrilling and actionpacked adventure that brings together some of the most iconic superheroes from the marvel universe the films seamless blend of humor drama and highstakes action makes for a truly entertaining experience the chemistry between the cast is fantastic with each character bringing their unique personality and skills to the table the special effects are topnotch bringing the epic battles to life in stunning detail the only downside is that some of the character development feels a bit rushed but overall the avengers is a mustsee for any marvel fan or lover of superhero movies
Apr 8 2023,positive,while not perfect the og avengers film provides viewers with a simple yet effective story while combining our favourite marvel heroes in epic fashion  rating 89
Apr 8 2023,positive,the first teamup flick pulls it off well the characters have mostly been fleshed out before this and the ones that havent are supporting characters anyhow each character gets their own moments that feel earned
Apr 6 2023,positive,up until this point nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently the casting and chemistry between them is on point the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way and robert downey jrs humor all around is unforgettable and how can i not mention that glorifying theme song
Apr 2 2023,positive,a great story with some epic superheroes gives us the earths mightest hereos
Apr 2 2023,positive,great movie action and fun with just enough heart all the way through well done

Mar 26 2023,positive,the world loves it though i still think the original iron man thor and captain america were my favorites  at this point the avengers has made around 100 trillion dollars or soand so its obvious that people love the film my own daughter went to the premier in new york and then went to it on opening night in general releaseand was mad i didnt take her with me tonight to see it obviously she loved the film as well as for me i liked it but didnt quite share the overall exuberance for the film mind you i liked itbut i think i preferred the earlier films before the avengers team was formed there was a certain charm that i didnt quite see recaptured in the film now the film is goodits just that what i like in these other films i would have liked more of in the avengers specifically the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development when i read the imdb trivia it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutesall showing steve rogers captain america trying to adjust to his new life i would have loved seeing all thisand less of the huge battle at the end of the film for me it just felt numbing after a while and i would have liked more of the characters when they werent fighting again however i did like the filmbut the earlier marveldisney films i liked just a bit better just my two cents worth
Mar 17 2023,positive,was a good film to bad the future marvel filmstv is some pushed narrative now
Mar 11 2023,positive,kirk lazarus webbing thor and captain america was sound
Feb 28 2023,positive,a great movie to bring together the heroes in phase 1
Feb 24 2023,positive,perhaps the greatest superhero movie of all time each character gets their due screen time without having to compete for it this movie set the standard for every marvel film that came after it with enthralling heroes and one of the few truly bewitching antagonists
Feb 22 2023,positive,a comic book blast fun banter great acting great action great stakes great villain great fun nuff said
Feb 21 2023,positive,the best movie watching it is an exciting adventure
Feb 21 2023,positive,the avengers is a 2012 adventureaction film directed by joss whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america chris hemsworth as thor scarlett johansson as black widow mark ruffalo as the hulk and jeremy renner as hawkeye the movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous loki tom hiddleston  one of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast each actor brings their own unique take on their character and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging the films action scenes are also impressive with a mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces  the plot is wellcrafted and engaging with a good balance between action character development and humor the movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward  the direction by whedon is confident and assured with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing the cinematography by seamus mcgarvey is also impressive with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum  the musical score by alan silvestri is a standout with a memorable main theme and wellplaced motifs that help to elevate the films emotional moments  however the films villain loki can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times while tom hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role the characters motivations and backstory are not always clear making him a somewhat onedimensional antagonist  overall the avengers is an entertaining adventureaction movie that succeeds in bringing together some of marvels most beloved characters on the big screen with strong performances impressive action scenes and a wellcrafted plot it is a highlight of the marvel cinematic universe and a mustsee for fans of the franchise
Feb 20 2023,positive,this movie is soooooo fun
Feb 18 2023,positive,superpowered buddies in tights beat up a jokster and some aliens  at the time of its release it was probably the biggest movie out there it was a culmination of years of hard work and movies building up to this precise moment everyone was talking about it   looking back now its a bit corny im talking about captain americas suit  it has a nice balance of humor and action the hulk is the best part its a solid film
Feb 17 2023,positive,an excellent end to phase one this movie made iron man 2 thor and the incredible hulk worth watching
Feb 17 2023,positive,best movie of the franchise
Feb 17 2023,positive,for a first film together avengers is to be congratulated  actors chosen in their proper characters and their chemistry are notorious in the unfolding of the plot  this is just the beginning of a phase that i missed and ended in a spectacular way
Feb 15 2023,positive,the avengers is a amazing way to set up this team of heroes
Feb 14 2023,positive,avengers endgame is currently ranked as my forever favorite over the accumulated weight tying together 21 different movies into an interconnected franchises 22nd chapter this is certainly the fourth occasion that reflect past events during a required assembly when a threat too great overwhelms singular ability  while being more as a responsive effect to its penultimate preceding first parter being the cause snapping up worldchanging proportions the infinity gauntlet twoparter is an inspired continuation after the previous teamups consisting of the core members mostly given their own films and established arcs with their dynamics greatly tested and challenged positioned to evolve their placements of course none of this wouldnt be possible without the solo heroic outings or to an extent of pairings and exclusively involved teamup building up towards the ultimate play while connecting others along the way for familiar dynamics at least from another but the first time it happened was the independent studios first goal as a visionary promise that became cinematically groundbreaking as well truly define what the marvel cinematic universe is capable of through the interconnected strengths it was right then that the avengers became my favorite movie for opening pathways that led all the way to endgame and solidifying its shared universe concepts success  despite being stretched thin elsewhere  while superhero teams arent anything new as the ensemble already been witnessed theatrically mainly under marvel and other secondary or lesserknown comics for exploitive gimmicks what makes this special is the hype stemmed through the shared universe concept marvel adapted onto the screen it broke their descending reception in reaction to subpar qualities till they were financially capable of independent filmmaking this started when producer and president kevin fiege announced their goal in 2006 to bring the core teamup to life considering the main entertainment value for iron man providing general welcoming without prerequisite reading of the vast comic lore the ultimate crossover film mainly relies on the audience who stuck around across the connected films but the name itself is the comics peaks of characterization being respected and taken onto different arcs outside of their comforting knowledge the avengers is the pinnacle of both marvel and the cinema by storytelling combination at a perfect balance  theres a quote that defines the teams s reason to come together and assemble and there came a day a day unlike any other when earths mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat on that day thors evil brother loki obtains the energy cube called the tesseract tapping into its unlimited power in opening a portal to unleash his given army to enslave humanity nick fury director of shield must reactivate his recruiting initiative of bringing together a group of remarkable people that could fight the battle no one else could teaming up are nonteam player iron man an awakened soldier captain america a pursuing god thor a monstrously temperamental recluse hulk secretive assassin black widow and marksman hawkeye whose mind got controlled under lokis spell different backgrounds varying in humanity strengths and weaknesses as well as beliefs they all must work together with trust in order to defeat a common threat  the former four starred in their own films while the latter two were introduced as supporting players  it would be nine years later till they received their own starring projects but each of them evolved as part of the overall balance of finally tying them all together than just the simple assembly continuing from their established arcs they each carry the weight that push them on these heroic paths that they may began to truly accept as their responsive professions while working with different individuals they wouldnt normally work alongside unless the dire situation pressures otherwise before his true colors were exposed in another certain project whereas he practically made himself comfortable by recycling what he inserted inferiorly joss whedon showcased his skills at a peak with quite a capability of advancing pop culture from experience directed and written it which positions him as fullon storyteller with confident direction that matches the brands vision as he flawlessly fulfills it through impeccably scripted buildups of seamless dialogue referencing fresh hefts from polished arcs as slight transcendence he achieved a proudful reception over his treatment and meeting expectations that either hinted towards planned projects or ambiguously reveals unseen details he watched the other films carefully and perfectly mix them all into one to fuel excellent exchanges excitingly ranging timeless humor and captivating tensions  aside from the characterization being the elementally prominent focus this film outlines the list of essentials that whedon seems to mustve demonstrated under an assorted definition obviously proven successful with the set pieces amazing as supportive backdrops to the events the action sequences justifies and thrills awesomely specially when notes been taken from previous chapters ie hulk chasing black widow in the helicarrier like the horror setting in his film taken place in the factory of continuous obscurity all backed up by alan silvestris riveting music that switches some notes from his previous venture under retrospective focus and introduced one of the most iconic themes that eventually recurs upliftingly to the ears the visual effects help color the films own stance next to its preceding narrative carriages while remains constant without trimming any edges in addition prompted cinematography looks for unique ways to signify these dynamics as they move onto each other with nuanced contribution and also compliments with the written direction helped by welltimed editing in summary an event like this provides standardization underlining hardtobeat and the notion of synergistically saving the best for last or later in this case  adding on to both storytelling and technical efforts is the ensemble casts performing just brilliantly with most at their second rounds as their characters with opportune gravitas for further exploration and certain few embodies their characters effortlessly at their third and fourth rounds joining the mixture are cobie smulders as shield agent maria hill and mark ruffalo taking edward nortons place as bruce banner like the rest of the cast without questioning the casting choices even going as far to include the recasts perfection gets determined by the performances and so it did when smulders nicely adapted hill in live action after the character shined in animation  which is actually where a number of these characters gotten introduced priorly norton signed up as hulk for marvels potential horrific corner only for that to be occasionally glimpsed luckily felt and appreciatively grasped still but not enough for his satisfaction when ruffalo took over the characters captured mannerism slightly changed just to flex ruffalos own charismatic talent in managing to make the character his own with equally defined energy
Feb 9 2023,positive,it was a fun exciting thrill ride i highly enjoyed this movie and i got to see all of my characters come together at once which gave us the excitement of seeing that iconic six person shot on screen i feel like this movie gave everything it needed to give at this point in time and allowed us the opportunity to see these characters develop and partner up this is definitely one for the books that you could watch multiple times
Feb 6 2023,positive,my writing is about the avengers movie the first movie of the 21st century that was not cartoonish it is a movie that entertains people who usually like superheroes    loky the brother of evil thor is the leader of the chitauris and his objective is to steal the desert that the fury doctor has and dominate the world he will not get it because the fury doctor summons all the avengers to protect the world and win the battle    in my opinion these movies are always very entertaining especially those who love superheroes
Feb 6 2023,positive,excellent movie all the way around exceptional writing acting production value this easily could have been a mess theres a fine line between too much at once something awesome they walked that line perfectly with this one strongly recommend
Jan 31 2023,positive,this is fun timing is appropriate and i didnt feel that long i dont know if they are really cooperating but i liked seeing variety of fighting style from them succeeded to control too many characters and enjoyable as it it the amount of gag and parody is acceptable
Jan 27 2023,positive,the best film in the marvel cinematic universe the final battle the villain and the original avengers are the diamonds of the film
Jan 18 2023,positive,it was entertaining thought the villains was just ok
Jan 16 2023,positive,4 a awesome movie   fantastic movie buy now and enjoy
Jan 11 2023,positive,still one of the best avengers movie till this day sets up the scene perfectly great origin film awesome action scenes good comedy a thoroughly enjoyable film
Dec 31 2022,positive,from start to finish it was engaging beautiful soundtracks and each sequence flows really well one of the best marvel movies
Dec 30 2022,negative,it was a piece of sit
Dec 22 2022,positive,mcu shines in ensemble casts and this is the first big one hulk is the star michael bay dreams of making big dumb action movies this good
Dec 12 2022,positive,an achievement for sure in superhero film history it brought a bunch of larger than life personalities and had them come together and it delivered perfectly
Dec 12 2022,positive,awesome way to bring our heroes together great action and great story
Dec 7 2022,positive,one of the best films of the marvel cinematic universe before disney started ruining the movies solid film that the family can enjoy with great action and story great custom designs and cinematography
Dec 4 2022,positive,an all time classic the idea of taking multiple heroes from other films and putting them together in this way had been attempted going back to the universal monsters of the 30s but they couldnt really figure out how to make it work cohesively what started 9 decades ago was mastered with this film the actors all have incredible chemistry witty dialogue and excellent performances across the board the cinematography is very good with very well done special effects even the end battle which is very heavy with cgi is very clean and well done even though you can tell most of it is computers the battles between the avengers themselves are amazing to watch and super intense the only real downside to this film is the musical score is good but its not really memorable or catchy like superman 78 or the dark knights but its such a small point the editing and pacing are both fantastic in this the only serious downside is this is a film that requires you to watch 5 other films before this to understand how good it is but it is absolutely worth it and even without watching the others you still can tell how good it is everyone should give this a try this is a landmark film for being the first to nail how to do multiple characters from different franchises into one awesome unique experience
Nov 22 2022,positive,this film was a great way to unite earths mightiest heroes the film feels like it has a different tone from the other films in the mcu and that is part of what makes it feel like its own special thing joss whedon did a spectacular job in making this film unlike flops like justice league and it is a great way to close out phase one of the marvel cinematic universe
Nov 19 2022,positive,first avengers movie is very entertaining
Nov 18 2022,positive,great comic book movie fun for everyone  highly recommend
Nov 16 2022,positive,classic but also aged weirdly not great even though its not even old
Nov 15 2022,positive,up until this point nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently the casting and chemistry between them is on point the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way and robert downey jrs humor all around is unforgettable and how can i not mention that glorifying theme song
Nov 13 2022,positive,it was set up as a big team up of earths mightiest heroes and it worked well to build to that all the characters have their own place in the film and dont feel wasted it is never a dull moment with the action scenes being a constant in the film while still finding the time to advance the plot without either being compromised there are cheesy moments in the film that are only set for the fanfare and it does well to serve the audience along with the awesomely supportive score the only issue regarding the film is that most of the characters dont have much change in their story it focuses on the overall story of the mcu than having any real change in any one characters story for the most part this is not a big stain on the film though because the character relationships are worked on instead there was a lot that this film had to do and i believe it paid off
Nov 13 2022,positive,the avengers is a dream come true for all marvel comics fans rdj teaming up with evans and ruffalo is one of the best teamups in all of cinema feige makes magic happen and paves the way for the future phases of the mcu
Nov 11 2022,positive,love loki favourite marvel villain ever iron man and thor good too
Nov 10 2022,positive,what can i say simply spectacular
Nov 10 2022,positive,waited so many years to see these characters together what a spectacle
Nov 6 2022,positive,first and the best avengers movie
Nov 6 2022,positive,i really love the first avengers the five of them are making such a great team
Nov 3 2022,positive,an instant classic should be remembered in the annals of film history as the unifying factor that sparked the greatest anthology in the entirety of modern cinema
Nov 1 2022,positive,one of my most favorite movie of all time i love all the avengers movies but this one is one of my favorites it constantly has something going on whether its natasha being chased by the hulk the beginning of the movie where clint and erik were in lokis control black widow tricking loki loki going missing and everyone trying to figure out how to find him when iron man and cap first meet thor and have a fight and the climax at the end where they all gather in a circle ready to fight where iron man flies into the void with a nuke and black widow closes the portal this movie is awesome i dont know how people dont like it in my opinion it doesnt deserve any hate it gets and its a really good way to properly introduce the characters to each other as theyre desperately searching for the right people to stop loki
Oct 25 2022,negative,cringe movie terrible plots the story makes no sense not to mention the massive plot holes yikes
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing this is my childhood
Oct 21 2022,negative,the first major superhero crossover film may have been loud and shiny enough to placate most marvel consumers but this entry suffers from some of the worst dialogue of the entire mcu and a sterile soulless cgi battle that seems neverending its also worth noting that the actors hadnt grown into their roles yet and some of the cast especially hemsworth seem notably awkward in their portrayals
Oct 20 2022,positive,while the mcu phase one is arguably the worst of the three this an the first iron man are the exceptions to that this movie is corny and stupid but is also one of the most watchable mcu films period the movie is so fun and the last third is actually amazing it is basically just a giant final battle for over 30 minutes but it still works unlike man of steel which has a similar final battle it being that it lasts for like an hour this last act is actually fun and creative i dont have a lot to say about this one and besides basically everyone has seen it at least once 810
Oct 16 2022,positive,the movie that brought everything together what a treat it is to see 810
Oct 15 2022,positive,love it as a kidso goood
Oct 9 2022,positive,fantastic movie and probably one of the best created by marvel with everything you want from a superhero action movie
Oct 7 2022,positive,with all of marvels most iconic heroes on screen at the same time wonderful performances excellent soundtrack intense immersive and fantastic action spoton humor visually appealing status and total direction control by joss whedon marvels first teamup movie centering around the awesome avengers this movie remains one of the highest grossing films of all time as well as one of the finest films ever crafted
Oct 5 2022,positive,i liked this movie and i thought that loki and thor were pretty good in it
Oct 4 2022,positive,a huge hit with critics and viewers alike i was surprised and disappointed by how mediocre this movie was  sure the dialogue is snappy and the visuals stunning but it never adds up to much compelling and by the overlong and tedious cgi battle scene at the end i was ready to leave
Oct 4 2022,positive,this movie is the best movie in phase 1this movie is so awesome and seeing these characters built up from different movies in one is so coolalso loki is so cool but menacing at the same timemy one complaint is that hawkeye doesnt get a lot of love in this moviehe spends a lot of time as lokis minionbut besides that a great marvel movie 910
Oct 2 2022,positive,my favorite mcu movie great action heroes and story this movie cemented the mcu as a cinematic universe
Sep 28 2022,positive,the avengers is a very fun and lively action adventure the acting performance of literally anyone here is awesome this movie is a total vibe its a lot like guardians of the galaxy the direction isnt necessarily awesome but it goes along with the elements there are some cringeworthy moments it is not perfect but it wasnt meant to be solid movie with definite flaws but the good overshadows the bad
Sep 28 2022,positive,didnt see this one until way later than when it came out but i was hooked on marvel movies from here on out
Sep 27 2022,positive, ratings categories  characters 910  cinematography 910  plot 910  acting 810  pacing 9510  89
Sep 25 2022,positive,its a good blockbuster but the avengers must argue with each other for most of the movie if it wasnt for tom hiddlestons charizma and other actors it would bomb pretty bad but it worked well because the characters were introduced to us before
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 13 2022,positive,one of the best marvel movie of all time
Sep 11 2022,positive,still amazing unlike the joke movies and shows now
Sep 9 2022,positive,the avengers burst onto screen for a great blockbuster
Sep 6 2022,positive,its hard to make a teamup movie works and this movie did it in a great way
Sep 2 2022,positive,this is a relatively decent superhero marvel actionadventure film with plenty of visual effects and numerous fightsbattles to keep teens watching although there is also a fair amount of lengthy dialogue scenes too in between the more actionbased scenes which may put some off i dont claim to be especially knowledgeable ie much at all when it comes to the individual detailsbackgroundhistory of the various characters that come together to become the avengers not the 1960s british show starring diana rigg i hasten to add however i cant say its not entertaining in parts  it is and the cgi is fairly good perhaps not entirely as realistic as other films but then this is a superhero and perhaps part scifi based film compared to a disaster film or straight drama   i did feel that at times the script felt a bit too overly cheesy but then i dont suppose im the mainintended demographic a 37yearold lady i quite liked samuel l jackson as nick fury the director of shield who brings the various characters together to form the avengers  he plays cool and sassysuave characters with ease this is not the sort of film im likely to want to watch again or that will stay in my mind much but for what it is its not bad a little long and slightly lacking but overly its fairly good so id recommend it on that basis
Sep 1 2022,positive,one of the best fanfare comic book movies ever movie has a good story and started the ensemble phase for comic book movies
Aug 27 2022,positive,everything about this is perfect blockbuster spectacle cinema except captain americas outfit
Aug 21 2022,positive,with great care for each of the mainline characters hawkeye still isnt a mainline character a decade later the avengers showed the world something we had never seen before the culmination of a cinematic universe its bright its fun but its not without flaws
Aug 18 2022,positive,a film that shocked marvel fans where for the first time heroes of the same shared universe come together in a spectacular crossover excellent direction soundtrack characters plot a perfect conclusion to phase one of the mcu
Aug 18 2022,positive,when i was younger i was scared of the scene where hulk was chasing black widow but  looking at this movie i stared to really like it
Aug 15 2022,positive,while better then most movies in phase 1 of the mcu i do not think it ages well the 1st and 2cnd acts are boring to me the 3rd act is one of the best mcu scenes though i think it is overrated i love the 3rd act so much its truely s tier
Aug 12 2022,positive,the whole cave collapse was the worst part and that says not much because everything else is much better
Aug 10 2022,positive,the avengers movie was alright and definitely good for its time if a movie of this standard was released today it would still be a hit just not to the levels weve seen in the mcu still a good movie overall
Aug 8 2022,positive,absolutely crazy i really enjoyed the movie for me its 910
Aug 5 2022,positive,i live for this movie
Aug 3 2022,positive,the avengers is definitely the best film of phase 1 of the marvel cinematic universe all the characters we have seen in previous films meet here and after seeing the film you love them even more apart from captain america they made him more unpleasant here the movies villain loki gets better than the thor movie and becomes a more memorable villain the characters work and the most interesting character is definitely mark ruffalos hulk in this film we see the best hulk the aliens are introduced well and its just a taste of thanos threat film fully approved and i repeat the best film of phase 1
Aug 1 2022,positive,visuals were great comedic at times characters are entertaining to watch and more emotional than i remember but the end battle was a bit long
Jul 23 2022,positive,the film that made the mcu what it isthe avengers is everything a superhero fan could want incredible performances from all 6 avengers samuel l jacksons nick fury and tom hiddlestons loki stellar writing good pacing and an engaging plot this is what makes this movie so darn good its a formidable achievement in hollywooda classic for ages to come you cant miss it
Jul 22 2022,positive,the film just works in many ways that other ensemble films seem to be unable to i like it quite a bit
Jul 20 2022,positive,great movie fun to go watch after all the marvels movies that have come out seems so simple back then
Jul 16 2022,positive,what an event this was so good even in 2022
Jul 15 2022,positive,this movie is just so fun it definitely has some stereotypical superhero moments and stuff but a fantastic set of characters and a fantastic villain propel this movie upward it balances comedy action drama and adventure very well and packs a lot of plot and growth into a single movie
Jul 14 2022,positive,this film gives an end to phase 1 which built up to the moment where the avengers unite as a unit to fight a big bad which became loki the film is truly one of the best shot and acted of any marvel film giving each character a story and giving us a reason as to why they each were chosen bringing something different to the table to build a strong unit
Jul 12 2022,positive,absolutely classic tells a great story that formed the best batch of heroes love the ways the characters developed in this movie and it definitely setup the infinity saga greatly
Jul 10 2022,positive,perfect and aging like fine wine i really consider this iron man 3 tony gets so much character depth and thrusts him forward the future of his character 
Jul 9 2022,positive,the avengers brings together six superheroes from four franchises into one epic movie and the result is absolutely spectacular each character is given a chance to shine there is wellwritten humor and a compelling villain wellchoreographed action scenes complete a nearflawless movie ending with a final battle on a grand scale and an emotional resulting scene while i wish some plot points were explained more the avengers is a film that flies higher than a helicarrier
Jul 8 2022,positive,the last date me and my first wife beth went on was too see this motion picture and a delightful time was had by all
Jul 8 2022,positive,a superhero assemble first time in the history of movies
Jul 8 2022,positive,the avengers burst onto screen for a great blockbuster
Jun 26 2022,positive,a very good movie but the part that they need to fix the airport aircraft is so boring but the villain is good and the final battle is good too
Jun 23 2022,positive,keeping in the pace in nearly each criteria avengers assemble is a memorable blockbuster where it shows the essence of humanity and how the heroes of the mcu change the pace of the world
Jun 23 2022,positive,its just the usual jumble of marvel avengers action fight scenes weak plot too many characters this was first in the series and it set the script that all the sequels followed really its a total mess but fans of this type of thing will find plenty to amuse themselves here scarlet is the real upside here wow as usual
Jun 23 2022,positive,all of the avengers movies are great including this one fun to watch but isnt something i would re watch  a lot mainly because the others are better
Jun 22 2022,positive,such a good start to the avengers this movie was the perfect movie to get people hyped for the future of marvel 910 
Jun 15 2022,positive,still puts a smile on my face ten years later 
Jun 14 2022,positive,this is an absolutely fantastic good ol fashioned blockbuster spectacle fun slam bang action character moments this film has it all
Jun 14 2022,positive,very iconic movie still holds up 10 years later although not as good as the avengers movies we love so much later on this movie is an absolute classic and brings in our favorite superheroes together
Jun 10 2022,negative,this is the movie that started the mcu going bad a decade has made it clear that this movie is one big gimmick with little emphasis on plot and characters
Jun 9 2022,positive,this movie is better than all solo movies
Jun 5 2022,positive,good start with good work from all the usual suspects
Jun 2 2022,positive,to give a positive review to the avengers is basically a cliché when it first came out it was an absolute landmark practically defining what cinema would be for the next decade and a decade later it still holds up as one of the best blockbusters and superhero movies ever the chemistry between the cast is impeccable every character gets their fair share of screen time the action is imaginative and the score is awesome  the movie does have some issues i personally dont think loki is the best avengers level threat and sometimes the effects do get a bit dodgy towards the end but those are the only flaws i could possibly find with this film it is a miracle that this movie came out as incredible as it did and its an even bigger miracle that it still holds up to this day as a generation defining film
May 21 2022,positive,there is some part that i want to skip
May 21 2022,positive,this is a movie with great comedic timing great dialogue and believable cgi that makes you immersed in the world and it also sets a very good story about iron man and his eventual self sacrifice thankfully he lived tho
May 17 2022,positive,everything from the build up the music the camera work the tension was spectacular and felt like an amazing culminating finish having these particular characters group up for the first time every lead actoractress played their part perfectly personalities clashed and together they grew to overcome a threat bonus points go to the wardrobe department for their amazing attention to detail eg cap wearing clothing that represents the clothing people wore before he got frozen  i believe this film to be when the iron man suit looks most realistic and less cgi based   overall amazing movie that i believe will be timeless
May 13 2022,positive,the avengers is absolutely the biggest mcu of all time is really epic and entertaining film of 2012
May 11 2022,positive,lol funny and for ages 13 only
May 7 2022,positive,one of the few marvel movies that stands as a decent film in its own right watching this in theaters was one of a few moments in which i realized that the mcu could be something more than popcorn movies even if this is still largely a popcorn movie the action setpieces are top tier for modern movies
May 6 2022,positive,after years of doubt marvel finally cracked the code and delivered a crossover event that perfectly blended the wideranging solo films and their unique tones and characters an absolute mustwatch
May 4 2022,positive,it may be nostalgia talking but this movie has developed into everything i want to see in a superhero team up movie super satisfying watch
Apr 28 2022,positive,just amazing this movie is
Apr 28 2022,positive,looking forward to watching it for the 37th time
Apr 28 2022,positive,loki and thor are fightings in wanda visions and phi wan leno i fights a zeno morphs but arnold jumps in to stop the fighting just like in butchers crossing and leaving las vegas
Apr 28 2022,positive,this is pure comic book fun the characters along with their actors have perfect chemistry together even when they are bickering against one another the third act is incredible to say the least and every character no matter how small has a charming soul that just attaches the viewer to this universe
Apr 27 2022,positive,would watch again for the 34th time
Apr 25 2022,positive,1010 it was beautiful it is funny and serious at the same time love loki and tony
Apr 25 2022,positive,this movie set up everything for cinema crossovers this movie has a great cast great story villain is amazing they should have added the deleted stan lee cameo but its still a great film loki is amazing and its tough to count your entire movie on a guy that has been two indie movies before this  great movie recommend it
Apr 22 2022,positive,i cant give this a perfect 5 out of 5  besides the heavy lifting scenes of robert downeys iron man and before we get the best rendition of the incredible hulk ever put to film in that electric third act  pretty mundane and average to be honest  even if ultimately a memorable movie going experience  at times feels like a tv movie in terms of aesthetics and cinematography  rdj drags whedons material to a greater sum than its parts
Apr 21 2022,positive,the avengers perfectly brought together these characters everyone grew to love nuking nyc was a kinda outta pocket idea theres things there way worse than aliens
Apr 21 2022,positive,what a fun movie to see i have been waiting for decades to see these characters presented so well this honors the source material and i loved every second
Apr 18 2022,positive,a great film to start the avengers franchise in mcu
Apr 10 2022,positive,a thrill ride this was the superhero movie that unseated batman returns as my favorite comic book movie that same feeling i get from going on a rollercoaster i got from seeing this in theaters very fun from start to finish
Apr 6 2022,positive,great movie the mcu is awesome and it was great to see the avengers get together for the first time loki seemed a bit out of character but i guess they needed to do that in order to make him the actual villain of this movie i suppose it also helps to have the excuse that the mind stone was manipulating him like it did to the avengers in that one scene
Apr 3 2022,positive,an awesome team up movie
Apr 2 2022,positive,the first time they unite the avengers beats down everything with great performance and solid story development therefore creating something to watch
Apr 1 2022,positive,great movie that brings the avengers together on the big screen for the first time
Mar 31 2022,positive,as a smaller kid the best movie of my youth
Mar 18 2022,positive,definitely one of the more cinematic mcu films the way this film changed the landscape for blockbusters is incredible this was truly the film that showed what marvel studios is capable of cgi script and performances are all tremendously high in quality standouts include ruffalo hiddleston johansonn and jackson
Mar 11 2022,negative,so boring bad cgi terrible plot
Mar 7 2022,positive,instant classic still my favorite comic book movie of all time love this movie
Mar 7 2022,positive,this movie still stands out as an amazing film it is actionpacked hilarious and entertaining throughout the first fifteen or so minutes do feel like they are of much lower quality  almost tv quality  than the rest of the film and some of the actors  im looking at your christ hemsworth  had not fully found their character yet that is why it loses half a star for me  rating  great
Mar 4 2022,negative,the movie was ultimately a cliché rolled directly out of a rushed cinematic universe the magic and creativity of marvel was gimped into a notsofunny lackluster movie that eventually led to this though the historical impact this movie had in teamup superhero movies is ultimately the longest lasting legacy i am happy this movie paved the way for
Mar 3 2022,positive,b  at the time of release this movie an experience since it was the first time superheroes each with their own solo film came together in one giant film rewatching this though some of the goofier elements get in the way of the storytelling at times it feels like every character is a clown and the quips never stop still have to give this movie respect for what it achieved and for what it paved the way for
Mar 3 2022,positive,this movie is not as good as everyone thinks yes it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring the performances are bad especially for tony and steve
Feb 24 2022,positive,superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldnt be totally enamoured with itas seen in a lot of the negative comments a lot of them being condescending though enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already and some not even worthy of being called reviews avengers assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right true the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting in fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didnt quite work personally and that was jeremy renner who was rather on the dull side as hawkeye whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten that hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly however the rest of the performances were great a big shout out going to tom hiddleston who is serpentine personified as loki though robert downey jnrs charismatic iron man samuel l jacksons nononsense nick fury mark ruffalos very confident hulkhe doesnt make you miss eric bana or ed norton chris hemsworths dynamic and not wimpy thorif he was i put it down to his hidden demons character development and chris evans modest heartfelt captain america were equally great scarlett johansson convinces mostly too black widows back story is intriguing and johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for black widow for a film with as many characters as seen here avengers assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interestingonly hawkeye really disappointed in character and not onesided and all of them have their turn to shine it didnt feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it the film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stuntwork alan silvestris score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting the story may be formulaic and standard goodandevil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour pathos and action with not one component overshadowing the others what was really enjoyable especially was the toetotoe with thor and iron man and hulk what was really remarkable was the script filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to the avengers while also with joss whedons own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work overall avengers assemble may not be 100 perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it 910 bethany cox
Feb 23 2022,positive,this movie did something that had never really been done before had a nice but comparatively small buildup to what we have now seen and was a great kick off to the subsequent mcu phases
Feb 22 2022,positive,this may be my favourite standalone mcu film from its interesting characters threatening villain hardhitting action element of espionage and of course heart captain america the winter soldier serves as a more than worth sequel to and for the first avenger and a memorable entry into the mcu
Feb 16 2022,positive,a really good start to the mcu
Jan 30 2022,positive,really sets up the whole team up thing that these movies do one flaw though is the use of hawkeye he is such a great character the family man should have used him more but still a great movie
Jan 28 2022,positive,just perfect and gorgeous
Jan 27 2022,positive,my rating for the film is a 8710
Jan 27 2022,positive,an entertaining spectacle of superhero teamup flick with character drama and quaint quips  director joss whedons superhero actionthriller the avengers 2012 is sure to please all viewers seeking enthralling action but disappoint the marvel fans wanting stronger character arcs like the individual hero movies i loved the thrill of watching all of marvels greatest superheroes team up together in one movie the avengers surely is a great accomplishment and a thoroughly entertaining one from iron man fighting thor to black widow evading the hulk the avengers is nearly all action among the cute character interactions iron man captain america and thor are all better made movies with stronger character development stories writing and direction   whedon brings marvels comic book superheroes to life all for a massive brawl in new york against loki and some goofy aliens the action sequences are exciting and well thought out with several memorable moments i just found whedons overall direction messy and lacking real depth for each character he turns each nuanced superhero from the previous films and turns them into whedon quip quoting machines everything is a punchline or pop culture reference suddenly  writers joss whedon and zak penn focus too much on the comedy and action and forget to give these characters detail motivation and nuance its all about the oneliner jokes and i think that severely detracted from these otherwise interesting characters i appreciate that producers stan lee and kevin feige planned this all out to get the avengers to assemble in a way that makes sense but i thought lokis alien attack narrative is really boring and just an excuse to give the avengers a horde of faceless enemies to destroy  robert downey jr is very funny and charming as iron man as he gets to show off his quick thinking and scientific skills chris evans remains a bastion of american patriotism and earnest heroism mark ruffalo takes over for edward norton as the inner turmoil of rage that is bruce banner his hulk is really fearsome with cool action sequences and fun moments like hulk punching the space whale chris hemsworths thor loses his serious god personality and turns more into a joke spouting character but his hammer and thunder powers are still killer   scarlett johansson is amazingly nuanced as black widow as she outwits every man she encounters and looks drop dead gorgeous as the redhead natasha romanoff scarlett johanssons black widow is super cool and shines in the avengers with her clever spy skills and combat prowess she always feels genuine as natasha romanoff i really do appreciate scarlett still delivering excellence in dramatic acting as black widow who may be my favorite aspect of the avengers upon revisiting this beloved blockbuster  jeremy renner gets taken over as hawkeye so we dont really get to know him yet tom hiddlestons loki is both scary and entertaining with his hateful smirks and cruel jests samuel l jackson is actually tough and commanding as shield director nick fury cobie smulders just appears as agent maria hill but shes fairly engaging clark gregg gets quite the emotional farewell as agent phil coulson stellan skarsgård is wasted as lokis science plot device gwyneth paltrow is charming alongside robert downey jr i wish we got more time with her endearing pepper potts   editors jeffrey ford and lisa lassek cut neatly around the fights but it can all get lost in how chaotic the action sequences get seamus mcgarvey has some inspired medium and closeup shots of each hero and them fighting alongside one another but his wide shots are often really dull to look at compared to the more intimate spaces the cgi is fine but has moments that look pretty ugly especially with all the washed out colors in every scene composer alan silvestri created an instantly iconic theme song for the avengers i really love soundgardens end credits song live to rise also  in all the avengers is a very fun movie that could have been much better honestly
Jan 24 2022,neutral,loud tedious mindnumbing cartoony each superhero had their moment and i liked the giant flying spiney machine dragon things in the final act but overall i found the avengers difficult to follow and the characters unrelatable not bad but overrated
Jan 19 2022,positive,a great movie that does the modern superhero movie justice staying true to its comic material with well written characters and story whilst providing extremely well done action scenes that feel grand in scale much like the stories created by jack kirby and stan lee
Jan 15 2022,positive,the avengers was a great way to combine all of the hard work that marvel studios have done the character development is such a driving factor for this movie 
Jan 14 2022,positive,you have no idea how insane it was seeing all of the movies and stories that came before it in the mcu tie together there were definitely better movies but still really good
Jan 11 2022,positive,epic full of action and chatacters that everyone love
Jan 10 2022,positive,a bit messy at times but still an enjoyable marvel movie
Jan 6 2022,positive,a classic and still holds up so well to this day
Jan 6 2022,positive,there is not a single superheroe movie with more epic moments than this one of course there have been bigger blockbusters but the avengers makes us connect with the human side of our favorite heroes in such a compelling way that is easy to see why the movie was and continue to be so acclamed
Jan 2 2022,positive,somehow a group of lessthanstellar films were then funneled chronologically into a teamup superhero film that broke records and our minds besides that with a clever script and exciting action scenes what seems like a short ride of a story ends up being fairly impressive at its lowest avengers is still fairly decent
Jan 1 2022,positive,a fancy way to start a series of films
Dec 30 2021,positive,it was a very enjoyable series
Dec 29 2021,positive,1 of the best movies
Dec 28 2021,positive,one of my favourite mcu movies was so awesome to see all the heros at the time come together even tho some dont even like each other but come together for the greater good the score and story was really well done it couldve been really bad and is easy to mess up with so many characters but i felt everything felt fluent and natural tom hiddleston really shines as does robert downey jr 
Dec 23 2021,positive,brilliant set up for a brilliant franchise directed fantastically
Dec 22 2021,positive,amazing   with this allstar cast theres nothing that can go wrong  avengers assemble
Dec 22 2021,positive,the best of the avengers movies it has everything and more has a much more of an impact on everything after than some of us realize really love that wish some of the movies were at least half good as is this movie
Dec 20 2021,positive,a dream come true for fans now it is a part of cinematic history
Dec 16 2021,positive,marvels the avengers was a movie most comic book fans never thought would occur and not only did it occur but it lived up to all the expectations it had on its shoulders this is a movie that needs to be watched it is easily still one of my top favorite marvel movies and it holds up to this day as a great film while the plot itself is simple the characters and actions scenes within this movie hold it together and make it a fun movie to watch even with its dialogue heavy middle this is a must watch again with avengers endgame coming up as it is the first time these characters were brought together on the big screen with its importance there and endgame being the final send off for infinity saga i would be very surprised if this movie isnt heavily referenced at some point within the film go back and watch this film you wont be disappointed
Dec 14 2021,positive,first time watching this one in years and its still a lot of fun  it was particularly fun seeing all these characters meet each other for the first time and seeing loki back when he was a straight villain  probably third in the running for avengers movie behind infinity war and endgame while miles ahead of avengers 2
Dec 11 2021,positive,fucking awesome a fantastic conclusion to phase 1 55
Dec 3 2021,positive,the script emphasizes its heroes humanity this lived up to its hype and in my opinion took the entire franchise to a new height  the character development and dialogue were much appreciated
Dec 2 2021,positive,having been one of the biggest success films ever is its gift and its curse its a grandiose and unforgettable visual spectacle it has the most creative shots in the mcu the action scenes are shocking and some characters have their best roles in this film all mentioned is the gift of the movie and the curse is that it has our full attention only in that aspects because the film has a great script round complete and with great value but they almost force you to ignore the story as such and just enjoy the fights i have watch it again and my experience was totally different now that i was paying attention to the script
Nov 29 2021,positive,great movie and still remains one of the best mcu movies to date
Nov 22 2021,positive,best superhero movie ever
Nov 20 2021,positive,best marvel movie of all time
Nov 15 2021,positive,one of the better installments of the mcu the avengers was a groundbreaking film that changed cinema forever by bringing together these different heroes for the first time the entire film from start to finish is a blast and an enjoyment to watch with very memorable lines and a strong performance from its entire cast the comedy and banter in this movie lands and the action especially in the finale in done very well
Nov 13 2021,positive,i think we all know how much this movie meant for all the marvel fans and it was truly a new experience it was great watching the line up between these superheros and how they work together as a team the only thing that is bad about this movie are the too many jokes every 5 minutes comes a joke and it really takes it off a bit
Nov 11 2021,positive,in my top 3 mcu movies the avengers is witty tightlypaced sharp and gripping from start to finish balances multiple headliner superheroes deftly in a single movie all of the heroes being likable unlike in justice league could not commend any higher
Nov 11 2021,positive,its the first trial of teamup by the studio and it turned out to be a classic one really like this film
Nov 7 2021,positive,joss whedon i do not condone his behavior did a masterful job at bringing all the superheroes together in these wellbalanced superhero masher this is what phase 1 was building up to and it excelled on almost every single level the action was great the acting was done brilliantly the new direction in which they are taking the hulk was absolutely magnificent minor nitpicks or that the film tended to drag in the the middle from time to time but those moments were easily overshadowed by the flawless nest and wish this movie unfolded
Oct 29 2021,negative,the pacing is incredibly dull but the third act is worth the watch arguably one of the weakest films in the mcu
Oct 19 2021,positive,arguably the best mcu movie but by far not as good as raimis spiderman  trilogy and nolans batman trilogy
Oct 14 2021,neutral,of the ten that i have seen so far the avengers is one of the poorer marvel movies it requires a viewing of all previous marvel films and even at that falls short of the other ones its characters arent as likeable the humour isnt memorable and it is by far the most confusing at least of the ones ive seen id say it is forgettable if it didnt appear to be so prominent in the marvel timeline
Oct 11 2021,negative,justno none of these marvel movies are any good
Oct 5 2021,positive,this was a groundbreaking movie when it first came out and still its one of the best
Oct 1 2021,positive,even with whedons taint on the film it still results a fantastic experience
Sep 28 2021,positive,a fantastic movie and one of the best marvel movies ever made 
Sep 21 2021,positive,josh whedon may not understand how to make a justice league movie but he knows how to make a marvel movie the movie have an overall great plot the cast is as always perfect in their roles the give us moments and oneliners that are iconic till this day the action scenes are amazing all the charectors feel useful and needed right from brute strengh to a tactical overwiew of the situations the heroes are in  its just a must see movie
Sep 19 2021,positive,the 2nd best mcu film filled with likable characters joss whedon really directed a great movie here i wish i could say the same for josstice league and the best of phase 1 highly rewatchable and great performances really elevate this movie 1010
Sep 17 2021,positive,avengers is an absolute blast exhilarating action great characters and a witty script makes the avengers pure fun from start to finish rdj as iron man as usual he owns this role sam jackson as nick fury kills it here as well and all of the cast bring their a game the direction from whedon is stellar and he really does a great job in bringing together this whole cast and the action sequences are filmed really well too overall this is my favorite out of phase 1 mcu the avengers is a really fun time from start to finish and makes it a must watch for comic book fans grade a
Sep 13 2021,positive,where it all began marvels the avengers did what no other movie dared to do having a large ensemble of heroes a lovable villain and having an at the time original arc of having the team learn to work together its your average run of the mill blockbuster but a hell of a one at that without a doubt this movies greatest achievement is its all star cast and the chemistry they share from the charismatic robert downey jr to the stoic and comedic samuel l jackson every cast member is perfect in their respective roles and the way they bounce off of each other is just remarkable the vfx are also outstanding most of them have aged rather well this movie does have one glaring problem however and that is the middle act its nowhere near as enjoyable as the other two its incredibly slowly paced and doesnt impact the plot is almost any way all in all marvels the avengers is just phenomenal in every way all you can do is marvel at this work of art
Sep 8 2021,positive,this movie was seriously something else some awesome scenes i  love how you get a taste of evryone vs everyone for a brief moment awesome movie 1010
Aug 31 2021,neutral,entertaining but theres absolutely nothing about these marvel movies that puts them above and beyond they are all over budgeted over acted over produced and just worn out marvel is nothing but clichés in cash grabs anymore get original i wonder who wins in the end robert downey jr please come back to real movies youre so much better than this crap
Aug 30 2021,positive,overrated the gathering of everyone and action are breathtaking for the time but the plot is too mainstream loki is definitely not as wellexecuted as in thor the pacing is unbelievably off with both the slow parts and the battle taking way too long
Aug 29 2021,positive,very good movie but also very corny
Aug 25 2021,positive,in this epic culmination to the five films prior you get everything from thrilling action to interesting character development easily one of the greatest marvel films of all time
Aug 25 2021,positive,that was fun i enjoy marvels ensemble stuff the most
Aug 25 2021,positive,625 best moment the novelty of meeting each other
Aug 24 2021,positive,great action and a strong story about a team coming together and tom hiddleston coming into his own as loki making this one the best films in the mcu
Aug 23 2021,positive,avengers theme intensifies
Aug 9 2021,positive,80100 good movie a classic
Jul 26 2021,positive,an incredible film that has all aspects it needs to create a fantastic superhero team that compels you right from the beginning and till the end of the film it has a basic yet smart plot with surprising scenes and ideas along with one of the best soundtracks character connections and breathtaking sequences that seem hard to bring all in 2 hours but this film does an incredible job in entertaining you from the story comedy and action for the entire runtime
Jul 26 2021,positive,it was great to see marvel bring back the original avengers  the movie was extra good in special effects especially the flying aircraft carrier the only characters i never cared for was hawkeye from marvel and green arrow from dc the reason why no matter how many times they both shoot arrows it appears as if the arrows on their backs are always full
Jul 23 2021,positive,smiled the entire time in the theatre  launched the mcu into a level it never came down from
Jul 19 2021,positive,the avengers is a movie that couldve easily been a mess and turned out to be a masterpiece thanks to joss whedon the movie nicely culminates the five ones that came before it in the mcu and gives all of the avengers moments to shine the action is fantastic the visuals raise the bar for future mcu films and the movie ends on a high and satisfying note that leaves plenty of room for future character development and storytelling the script gives each of the avengers moments to show us who they are and how they fit into this broader universe loki is a great villain for this film due to him being a familiar face and having a direct connection to one of the avengers and tom hiddleston again gives a strong performance as the character which is all bolstered by the script giving him a few moments to shine and oneliners as well the acting in general is good with both new and familiar faces doing the best they can with their roles renner is done a bit dirty in the film but the big battle redeems that slightly and renner makes the best of the screen time he has unlike some previous mcu movies this one has lots of rewatch value and will still be entertaining to many on multiple viewings overall the avengers was a fantastic first culmination for the mcu and set the bar very high for future movies like it
Jul 18 2021,positive,one absolute amazing feature film thrill  action intensity  wit tech and an evil character that youll love to hate
Jul 17 2021,positive,the movie changes aspect ratios pretty often which can be distracting its a good movie that explores the meeting of the main heroes of the infinity saga but ill never understand why they all went from hating each other to suddenly fighting together so quickly
Jul 17 2021,positive,so a lightening god who takes orders from a man who is  extra strong and a man in a soup can suithow about the indestructible green guy oh wait there is a guy with arrows and a girlwomen with a me too hard on
Jul 16 2021,positive,electric and also rapidly nostalgic it doesnt happen that often these days where youre finding yourself wanting more sequels usually are the demise of a very good original this saga gave a lot  and could of done possibly more before its end
Jul 16 2021,positive,this movie came out with a big bang  fans loved it and what really can i say about it that hadnt already been said  great movie check it out
Jul 15 2021,positive,such a fun movie maybe not as good as later films but the characters werent as developed yet the one that brought the group together and started it all though classic
Jul 10 2021,positive,awesome movie love the action surprisingly i never once felt bored throughout the entire thing even though the final battle is a good half hour or so and the entire movie is pushing 25 hours other superhero franchises if there are any left besides the dceu really have something to learn from this movie
Jul 7 2021,positive,while a fairly easy to follow and pretty good special effects i couldnt find anything special about this movie the cinematography is nothing great and just wasnt my thing but great addition if you follow this series and part of me thinks i could have appreciated it more if it was more my thing
Jul 6 2021,positive,it is a pretty good movie loki is a good villain and the first meetings of the avengers are fun to watch
Jul 5 2021,positive,straight from the comics in many ways absolutely brilliant this movie was a well oiled machine
Jul 1 2021,negative,this was good at the time cause no one saw anything as big as this before but its lost its touch
Jun 27 2021,positive,the original avengers movie was very popular and still is highly requested after you watch all the movies titled after the original 6 before 2012 compared to other mcu movies this isnt as good as a couple of them since the mcu barely miss and they definitely didnt miss with this one this brung one of the most popular marvel characters to this day 
Jun 22 2021,positive,marvel kevin feige did a great job at doing and setting up this movie they didnt rush into it like warner brothers did they took their time and waited for the perfect opportunity to make and put this movie out i stand by every decision that was made in this movie except anything to do with josh whedon marvel will always hold a dear spot in my heart and this is one of the movies that i will always think about when i hear marvel
Jun 9 2021,positive,a coming together of individual unique people with mind blowing capabilities and a good story to tell while not getting too distracted by the eye candy makes this a spectacular thrill ride youll want to take again and again excelsior
Jun 4 2021,neutral,i used to love this as a kid but oh my god this is not good its not exactly bad either tho its just empty
Jun 3 2021,positive,great movie that brought the avengers and their incredible actors together in a movie with one of marvels top villains loki
May 26 2021,positive,the avengers was one of the best movies ive ever seen the plot was good and interesting loki was the perfect villain for this movie the avengers were put together perfectly the score of this movie is good the acting is perfect there wasnt a single second that i didnt enjoy all in all i give this movie a 55 stars
May 26 2021,positive,hulk was the best part of the whole movie 
May 22 2021,positive,one of the best superhero movies in existance
May 14 2021,positive,best super hero movie ever at the time of its release just my opinion
May 13 2021,neutral,this movie is not as good as everyone thinks sure it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring its not just because there is a lack of action because thats not true at all in fact within the first hour or so there are four fightaction scenes but the way they are brought about are almost laughable   the movie gets good once the hulk transforms on the helicarrier scenes arent lit very well and it almost looks like a episode of firefly but its not its a huge action blockbuster with a budget in access of 200 million dollars  you can say whatever you want about joss weadon whether you love him or hate him i just dont think hes cut out for these kinds of movies  the characters have fine chemistry but they arent given enough time to shine either on their own or as a team some of the action is fine i guess but there are certain scenes where i cannot tell whats happening at all to prove my point watch the thor and loki fight scene on the top of stark tower   overall avengers is painful for about an hour and then slightly bolster for the remainder of the run time would have to wait at least three years to watch this again
May 7 2021,positive,this film was really fun this was a start of something that no one really knew that it was even possible just seeing all of these guys teaming up together for the first time there are some vfx that really hold up and there are some that dont any way or another the characters of this movie are just fun to watch and really are good throughout the films loki was really the most fun marvel villain that they had until they reached phase 3 and there were finally some good challengers this movie was the start of something that really couldve not work but the fact that it does really goes to show how much taking your time and plan things out really help you and could do you really good favors this was actually the first marvel movie that i watch and im pretty sure this was everyone else first time too i dont remember it specifically but i do remember watching it at home when it came out on dvd and i think it caught my interest i of course didnt know who any of the characters are at the time but i remember being at the very least interested but any way this movie was great 1010
May 7 2021,positive,love it top 5 marvel movie ensemble that worked and didnt leave me wanting more of specific characters
Apr 30 2021,positive,unlike dc the marvel filmmakers know how to make a team movie and cast the characters accordingly the nice balance of so many lead characters mixed with a ton of information and actioncomedyscifi is something to admire starting with the writers with epic camera shots and outstanding vfx this film is one hell of a start to the avengers franchise
Apr 29 2021,positive,amazing action packed movie this is exactly what i am looking for a must see 95100
Apr 29 2021,positive,the film the avengers manages to present us with a good script although with one or two holes it has a good costume for the time of its release it has a good original song the films cgi is competent with only a few lapses on the part of the chitauri army and in the end what saves the film is the final fight which entertains the audience very well
Apr 29 2021,positive,im not a 12 year old child so wont fully appreciate this movie but it passed the time adequately enough
Apr 28 2021,positive,the avengers was the first movie in the marvel cinematic universe that i learnt about everyone was going crazy meanwhile i who didnt know the basics of comic book superheroes was wondering why are superman batman and spiderman not on the cover of this movie just a few years ago i watched all the movies from the franchise when infinity war came out just to know what the fuss was all about and now that i see it i understand why it was such a huge deal  after the events of thor loki comes on earth to steal the tesseract from shield and he does manage to do that meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy all the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies although what they are doing is not very interesting it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are and then they all come together beat loki and save the day a pretty straightforward story moved by character development  there are a number of things i like about this movie the scene where their airships propeller stops working so iron man spins it so fast that it stabilises it showed how strong and fast iron man is there was also the scene where iron man goes through the portal and throws the missile away it completely contradicts what captain america considered him to be showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie i also like how tony goes to have a word with loki and tells him that the avengers have a hulk against his entire army i mean i could literally go on about what a badass iron man was throughout the movie  then there were thor and hulk i really liked thor ever since i first heard of him he literally looks like a norse god capable of highly destructive powers hulk on the other hand i didnt like him very much when i heard about him even in the incredible hulk he wasnt really entertaining but here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of bruce banner he gets angry every time someone calls him bruce instead of hulk which shows how much he is struggling for his identity thor is just as awesome as i thought him to be i always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape  the visual effects were done really nicely though the impact of their powers wasnt very hard but its a campy movie what can we possibly expect its from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight be it gimli from lord of the rings jar jar binks from star wars or hound from transformers but the destruction was surely visible most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander that is something i really like its literally the reason why i like monsterverse it is seen especially in the scene where hulk rides the giant snake robot  though there are a lot of things that i didnt like about this movie first of all the campiness obviously in todays time its quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadnt been utilised properly but the very same year the dark knight rises came and the next year man of steel came both of them had the mature touch to it even the mcu movies before and after this one like thor and captain america the winter soldier looked more mature than this baby thing the other criticism i have towards this is black widow and hawkeye i hate botht he characters and even more i hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them  the jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying every fight scene especially the ones which have black widow in them have like a dozen scene cuts just to show that natasha did a cartwheel got on the bad guys shoulders and snapped his neck the same goes for captain america and hawkeye also not even once has hawkeye shot anything in one take its something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double  obviously this doesnt look special anymore since i watched it after infinity war had released so there wasnt much of a surprise other than the fact that its a team up movie it has a good place in my memory so i wouldnt want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation its good in its place its a product of its time it should stay that way its a one time watch in case you havent seen it
Apr 22 2021,positive,the avengers has one dope team of superheros while the sequences are epic as well the sequences with thor ca and the hulk are especially kick a and rd jr is pretty good as iron man although ive only seen parts of iron man and not all the movies but i could tell he is good and is a bit humorous
Apr 19 2021,positive,excellencethe only improvement would be to recast mark ruffalo with any other person on the planet
Apr 12 2021,positive,nonstop entertainment but not much in terms of highbrow stuff
Apr 10 2021,positive,great climax to the first phase with the culmination of all the previous films yet without feeling like an ending to the saga loki is a much improved character feeling more like a villain than a whiny little kid im pretty sure everyone got goosebumps when watching them stand together to the amazing theme by alan silvestri the near death of tony stark feels touching and is done well my only real quarrel is how it leads onto thanos too much even though marvel had already made plans for the next avengers film to be ultron this is the main reason that avengers age of ultron had such disappointing reviews however that aside this is a great movie that finally delivered what all marvel comic fans wanted to see
Apr 9 2021,positive,top 3 superhero movie of all time 
Apr 8 2021,positive,the avengers stars amazing characters iron mancaptain americathorhulkblack widowhawkeye and nick fury and they must come together to defeat thors evil brother lokimarvel managed to put so many characters into one movie and it worked perfectly well i love this movie with its visual effects the action and it was great
Apr 8 2021,positive,the first meetup of our favorite heroes  the conflicts between the personality and interests of the characters is interesting throughout and when they finally team up its amazing  a classic superhero movie for the ages
Apr 6 2021,positive,the patience it took to set this movie up through the individual films really pays off the character interactions are really what sets this movie apart from the previous ones  the conflicts at play are very well written loki as a villain is also a big reason for this the action scenes are great especially in the end and alan silvestris score really elevates the movie an unprecedented cinematic triumph
Apr 2 2021,positive,joss did a good job balancing out the characters with each other the story was above average but the awesome character moments make up for that the vfx are top notch howe ever this film lacks cinematography or any good action choreography also captain americas suit went from cool in his solo outing to really lame in this one
Apr 1 2021,positive,the movie that kickstarted an entire sequence of events of universes team ups and inspired many creators to the idea that a team up live action comic book movie isnt just a great comic book movie but a great movie overall
Apr 1 2021,positive,the only thing i can rate as a negative is the fact that thor is a god  should be treated as such the fact that they think he would not finish stark in a fight is laughable that just tells me they are doing it for the fans  the fact that we liked rdj
Mar 31 2021,positive,saying this is a great movie is an understatement bringing together a great cast from wildly different movies and making it work under one cohesive narrative is a feat not many movies can pull off but the avengers does the acting narrative and action are outstanding this is the greatest comic book movie of all time its a must see
Mar 30 2021,negative,if not for the overly saturated and at times unnecessary moments that took away from the seriousness of this film perhaps i would be more at odds against the villain however i found myself rooting for the bad guys to win avengers by joss whedon is an overhyped film made great only by the unity of several iconic characters its a shame that this movie couldnt even take itself seriously
Mar 29 2021,positive,amazing  i recommend to you 
Mar 26 2021,positive,avengers is exactly what everyone was hoping for and more its the perfect conclusion to phase 1 of this epic franchise
Mar 24 2021,positive,still one of my favorite superhero movies by marvel or even by overall this was an amazing introduction to the avengers franchise and i loved every second of it
Mar 22 2021,positive,the avengers is a movie that on paper should not have worked but in the end it manages to not only juggle its multiple characters effortlessly but it is also one of the most entertaining superhero blockbusters ever made  a comic book movie that isnt afraid or embarrassed to be a comic book movie the avengers is a delight from start to finish
Mar 20 2021,positive,very good superhero movie i mark a before and after of this lovable and very well developed characters loki as a villain is the best there is in the ucm the longterm work brought very good results for marvel
Mar 19 2021,positive,an overrated blob of shit that i fucking love
Mar 19 2021,positive,despite the avengers looking like a bunch of people doing cosplay in the most hilarious way this movie did a pretty good job bringing this team together although we didnt get back stories for 2 of the avengers the movie found an amazing way to cover up its errors and make it a pretty enjoyable film comedy and cool battle scenes the film really delivers to the audience so i would recommend this film i wouldnt call it a masterpiece because the shots were plain and simple
Mar 16 2021,negative,what a shitty movie this is
Mar 16 2021,positive,yes iron man started it all and we cant be thankful enough to jon favreau for fighting tooth and nail for rdj but before the avengers there were five movies interconnected its true but they were still separate nonetheless the average box office gross of those was 460 million not bad but nothing compared to present day mcu standards and crossovers were at most ideas and desires but then this movie came out and the film industry was never the same again it was a game changer a milestone and arguably the most important film not the best just the most important since the original star wars now everybody wants to be like marvel joss whedon hit the mother of all jackpots with this one and he proved that it is indeed possible to do something like this
Mar 16 2021,positive,the avengers 2012 is the first time we ever saw all these classic marvel heroes assemble for the first time and it pays off in a great way this is an instant modern classic for the superhero genre
Mar 15 2021,negative,did not like this movie at all  way to boring
Mar 13 2021,negative,great to see what it built up to but very boring movie that does not hold up
Mar 8 2021,positive,an undeniably overrated film it is a fantastic first ensemble superhero film
Mar 8 2021,positive,only marvel can make me cry of awesomeness marvels the avengers is one of my favorite movies that 360 shot of the team is and always will be one of the greatest scenes in history
Mar 1 2021,positive,one of the best superhero movies of all time it has it all emotion strong story action comedy the team up of all these characters is epic and so well done very close to a near perfect movie 
Feb 28 2021,positive,omg i love this film its goofy amazing comic book fun that im down to watch any time everyone in this movie is a memorable likable character with individual traits who i would watch all day minus hawkeye and a few side characters the interactions these people have are just the most amazing thing loki is the perfect villain for this movie he is intimidating and cheesy at the same time but the best part is the action i can only describe the action as the inner 12 year old inside you jumping up and down screaming excitedly the story is goofy and doesnt make a whole lot of scene but the avengers is still a great time that perfectly sets up whats to come
Feb 21 2021,positive,outside of whedons stigma which does linger in this movie in its own ways the avengers is a blast of a polarizing superhero movie it sets up iron man as a true hero while also introducing what causes his ultimate struggle the tension in the team is palpable and the fantastic cast make it work loki is such a cool villain and the special effects and jokes hold up well a fantastic movie that is still a blast with at least one subtle oh s connection to a later movie that i just noticed
Feb 18 2021,positive,the first outing of the marvel cinematic universe ensemble of super heros sees hawk  black widow  iron man  hulk thor and captain america work together to fight against an alien invasion led by loki  thors adopted  brother  who is intent on ruling earth the well shot action scenes as well as quick fire wit make for a joyous viewing experience
Feb 12 2021,positive,solid fun film the best cbm ever i wouldnt go that far but its ambitious
Feb 10 2021,positive,although i think it has some defects i consider it a very cool film the film has a very active rhythm that makes it easy for you to enjoy watching it several times all the characters are developed and has a charismatic villain and of course we have to talk that the battle in new york and the soundtrack are really cool
Feb 10 2021,positive,the avengers at first when i did watch this movie i thought it was an alright movie i did not like a lot of things that happened in it but i just rewatched it and i enjoyed a lot of it u dont get bored when u watch it pretty much all the character are great but not loki also loki is one of my least characters i like that nick fury recruited the avengers in different ways that was cool also i am not a fan of bruce banner in this movie i wish we had bruce banner from the incredible hulk also two negatives and i think there it is a little bit too long but after that this is one of the best mcu movies made i am not  big on the mcu but this is a good movie what they brought us in 2012 the ending is the best part of the movie so all round the villain could of been better and wish that they brought back the other bruce banner after that this movie is great so i give the avengers a b
Feb 8 2021,positive,solid first adventures movie great acting and script 
Feb 6 2021,positive,ossum film i really love it must watch this film in this film all superheroes are joined and loki just blow their minds 3rd best marvel film
Feb 3 2021,positive,the avengers is an entertaining well acted and strongly written marvel movie that successfully manages to bring the avengers together as a team
Jan 30 2021,positive,ive been a fan of the superhero genre since i was a child superheroes fascinate me because they have superhuman abilities and they can accomplish amazing feats that a regular human cant and what i like more than a movie with a superhero is a movie with multiple superheroes i love teamups when i first saw this movie back in 2012 it blew my goddamned mind the scale of it the number of superheros the cgi i honestly believed this movie was the peak of superhero movies and that nothing will ever beat it in retrospective i was of course wrong fortunately  not only is this movie very good on its own but the fact that there was a buildup to it from the previous movies that also established our main characters makes it even better i watched all the other movies that lead up to the avengers i absolutely love the cohesion of the marvel cinematic universe
Jan 23 2021,positive,alot of great battles thru out the film only downfall is it wasnt filmed with a 3d camera so the effects are not very polish
Jan 23 2021,positive,7 years later and this movie is still so much fun its a little slow at first but it involves a lot of the characters meeting one another but over time the movie just gets better
Jan 22 2021,positive,a really good actionpacked movie feels really good seeing the marvel heroes crossover in the big screen fun and very entertaining superb
Jan 19 2021,positive,an awesome fun movie with great action
Jan 16 2021,positive,the avengers is a masterful culmination of phase one of the marvel cinematic universe
Jan 14 2021,positive,my first ever experience watching a marvel film and although not my cup of tea i was pleasantly surprised thought the film was a lot slower than i was expecting but had some impressive battle scenes for me mark ruffalo was the stand out performer
Jan 4 2021,positive,a great first movie for the avengers
Jan 2 2021,positive,a pretty good movie that starts off slow but gets better and better
Jan 1 2021,positive,the avengers has very little story yet i dont think that is what it needs to make it a good film since it is the pinnacle of phase one of the mcu being their first big crossover event the character interactions action scenes and humor make up for the weak premise
Dec 31 2020,positive,the avengers is a good movie but with this film it got slow and boring in the first act  the second act was bit wasteful until shield helicarrier  fight but the third act was good this movie would have been the best if disney never bought marvel and we would have gotten wolverine and spiderman in the first film and the story would have been more action packed and more serious
Dec 22 2020,positive,every character interaction is amazing with a smart and compelling villain as well feels threatening helps set up for an third act that really gives every hero a moment to shine with amazing performances from everyone
Dec 15 2020,positive,now this is how to make a good crossover film make one solo movie and another solo movie and you make a good crossover movie
Dec 7 2020,positive,the perfect blend of action and comedy establishing the characters while finding a great way to introduce them to each other hiddlestons loki is fully developed and devious the cast chemistry was on point and hard to think how the movie couldve been better
Dec 1 2020,positive,a classic in the mcu marvels the avengers is a perfect end to phase 1 every actor hits in this movie and it did not feel like any time was wasted a perfect blend between the screen time of everyone also the recasting of bruce banner sparked a new era for the character mark ruffalo is the hulk a beautiful ending and a postcredit scene that sets up the rest of the mcu as we know it the cgi of thanos in the postcredit scene was laughable but thats ok grade 98 a
Nov 28 2020,positive,very good and funny
Nov 19 2020,positive,brilliant film to bring all the characters together the hulk mark ruffalo being my personal favourite
Nov 18 2020,positive,the avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience one of the rare mcu films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character taking many characters and making an emotional arc and action packed expierience on paper seems like an impossible task but what is done here is proof for the future of the mcu that the impossible can be done
Nov 5 2020,positive,when it was released it was the first big crossover in marvel studios mcu gifting us a movie filled with our favorite characters amazing action secuences and some moments that were so epic that we still remember them now many years later we see a threat that will demand the worlds mightiest heroes to get reunited and fight with all their strenght to protect us
Nov 2 2020,positive,easily the best phase 1 mcu film and one of the best in the franchise with awesome action and is generally just awesome to see all these beloved characters team up to kick ass
Nov 2 2020,positive,the action scenes are well thought out yet the plot seemed to familiar to most movies
Oct 28 2020,positive,marvels the avengers pays off the first build up in the mcu with a fulfilling superhero film
Oct 27 2020,positive,the origin films built up to this extremely well this is a fantastic teamup movie in every way its super funny emotional actionfilled exhilarating every minute of it is worth watching spoton performances from everybody involved
Oct 25 2020,positive,a huge movie at the time the start of a great franchise completely epic movie and good humor
Oct 16 2020,positive,this is for sure one of the best superhero movies of all time along with superman 1978 the dark knight batman begins spiderman 2 iron man logan guardians of the galaxy infinity war and the winter solider this is a must see film for marvel fans
Sep 3 2020,positive,joss whedon can go a little too far with his own self at times but the avengers successfully gave all of this madness a point and a path
Sep 3 2020,positive,friendship  teamwork only one word amazing
Aug 31 2020,negative,the half star that i gave this movie is honestly very generous i dont take pleasure in negatively reviewing movies but i have to be honest here i really dont like this movie i watched it in a full theater in 2012 and thought it was good mainly because thats what everyone was saying about it but ive come to recognize that i really think its quite bad i find it to be corny boring goofy poorly directed and poorly written on the positive side they have a cool theme song 055
Aug 31 2020,positive,this movie is one of the best comic book adaptations around as it follows its source material perfectly without becoming cheesy great special effects and awesome cgi are the definite highlights not to take away from the allstar cast and the characters they play combine all of this with a gripping story and youve got one solid film
Aug 29 2020,positive,i thought this was an awesome film i really liked this film a lot my 2nd favorite film of 2012 1st being skyfall
Aug 27 2020,positive,top notch action and adventure with great special effects exactly what you expect 
Aug 22 2020,positive,the great start of the avengers francise this movie is just awesome
Aug 17 2020,positive,if this doesnt fill you with joy nothing else will
Aug 11 2020,positive,what a great movie and lots of action its blown my mind
Aug 10 2020,positive,compared to the early phase 3 films i can see why this could now feel unspectacular and like a dud to some still gr8 though10
Aug 9 2020,positive,96 despite its impressive work on problematic results the avengers lives up to its name
Jul 24 2020,positive,we didnt get to see the movie it messed up
Jul 22 2020,positive,perhaps a near perfect film that reinvent hollywood action movies forever with style charm exciting sequence and a smart script for the talented cast to take hold ofthis first avengers blasts off and doesnt fall out of the sky
Jul 18 2020,positive,an incredibly clever superhero movie that has a great mix of comedy action and character development   final grade a
Jul 13 2020,positive,overrated but still has its moments good kickoff movie for the avengers team
Jul 12 2020,positive,without a doubt the best mcu film thats been made this is the making of film history while avengers endgame had more characters and films like frankenstein meets the wolfman or frankenstein vs dracula started the shared universe concept this is the biggest its ever been the action is amazing the actors are great the stakes are there the villain is great and the characters are great its a must watch if you love the genere
Jul 11 2020,positive,this movie is just so much fun it has one of two villains in the cinematic universe that has personality at the forefront
Jul 2 2020,positive,first movie you see with all these major superheros together on one screen
Jul 2 2020,positive,fantastic thrill ride of a movie
Jun 30 2020,positive,quality marvel story flawed heroes cool villain crazy technology and mega battles all in a seem less cinematic envelope
Jun 29 2020,positive,awesome movie remember when it came out to theater that hype and ideas to see comics heros coming to the big screen has been amazing
Jun 27 2020,positive,awesome film i really liked this film a lot my 2nd favorite film of 2012
Jun 23 2020,positive,they landed it perfectly feiges integrate planning of doing this crossover film with all characters having backstories set up in the last 4 years choosing joss whedon who crafted a balanced film for all characters to shine everybody thought it was a big gamble and would fail as story will be all over the place feige ended up inspiring all studios to create their own shareduniverse  the movie is slow at start but it builds effective foundation for character to bond relationships  tonysteve relation was played so greatly that looking back it feels like nostalgic ride of their past flaws  everything special about you came from a bottle you are not the type of guy for the sacrifice play lay down on a wire let the other guy crawl over you  loki returns his set up from thor was perfect he did play a good villain but could have been better thinking now that he has become kind of good his movitations of jealousy was mere for new york destruction head canon of mind stone damaging his attitude could work loki using tricks to pit the avengers against with banner hulking out was great  mark ruffalo did banner perfectly his cgi is one of the best banner  hulk relation was explored a bit him getting recruited to study tessaractinfinity stone as it gave of gamma radiation was perfectly tied for future blip snap  at first natasha didnt feel that much but she kicked a tonne of ass her relation with barton as friends was set up good she did not feel any less dangerous than thor at the end  i liked thor the least yeah he was brother to main but he didnt add that much to the table taika  russu did him much better cuz hemsworth got to be himself  the hour long action is great for fan service and assemble scene gives me goosebumbs time to time for action fans this is great but i am more a fan of dialogue between actions actions make this movie highly rewatchable as it has comedy spinkled away  samual l jackson nailed nick fury coulsons death was good for movitations acting wise all got the job done nothing special  comedy is much less in these movies than future but they do crack me up time to time puny god we have a hulk shawarma tony is god of giving nicknames  tonys character arc was good but future has much more for his character to evolve to thanos at the post credit scene was a great set up   a great entertainment some people for me these are more than blockbuster movies these have heart great characters with storylines spending much more then 1 movie inherently rewatchable cuz i am a nerrrd
Jun 19 2020,positive,the big one they have been building up to the visuals are great the villains are good all the performances are great the cap gives a better performance here then he does in his first film the emotion is there with the death of shield agent colston and the music is good some fantastic one liners and its fairly memeable this is pure marvel through and through   now would be a good time to get angry   banner  thats my secret cap im always angry
Jun 17 2020,positive,marvels the avengers directed by joss whedon started a revolution for the superhero genre being one of the most influential superhero films of all time this is the first time we were able to see all of our favorite heroes in one film fighting for the same goal and it paid off tremendously making 15 billion dollars at the box office whedon is one of the best directors the mcu has on the payroll due to his understanding of what the mcu is about while using his knowledge and the films before to his advantage  the plot is pretty straight forward while allowing for many notable character moments the film doesnt take itself too seriously which works because there is quite a bit of cheese riddled through some of these scenes and pieces of dialogue but whedon still managed to create a fun and cohesive narrative the avengers broke some barriers that the mcu has set in the past by adding a few dark and grittier moments but still managed to keep a steady tone with a pace thats all gas and no brakes the only thing that whedon couldve done is give the team some type of vulnerability so the stakes are higher but other than that this was a great showing of what the mcu is all about  this is probably one of my favorite character based films there is just so much talent on screen at all times while equally sharing the spotlight every one of these top notch actors came to set ready to play ball each character was fleshed  balanced out nicely while everyones emotional connection was well understood while having great chemistry amongst one another robert downey jr was of course great in this film even though hes transforming into a team player instead of a lone wolf he still possessed that snarky witty and humorous charisma that everyone has come to love his banter with captain america is surprisingly a good twist because of how genuine the dialogue and emotions feel as they deliver their lines you cant help but admire chris evans as captain america if his performance in the first avenger wasnt enough he absolutely puts all of his doubters to rest with his performance here cap steps in as the leader of the group while the writers added such a likable style to his character by making him oblivious to the new age and his subtle humor at times chris hemsworth returns as thor and he is so much more likable this time around he adds this sense of dominance in every scene hes in while also having tremendous chemistry with everyone on set we have to talk about the biggest stand out of this film and that is the new comer mark ruffalo as bruce banner and the incredible hulk ruffalos take on the characters was a true breath of fresh air undoubtedly being the best portrayal yet he brings this charm and wit to the character while also giving him some vulnerabilities that the other hulks never had ruffalo is such a talented actor with great depth and range making a massive statement as to why he belongs in the mcu with not knowing much about black widow i wasnt too sure on how she was going to size up with the rest of the avengers but scarlett johansson puts on a great performance as natasha romanoff having more to do than usual she isnt afraid to get her hands dirty when it comes to the action while also having a great mind for the team we finally get more on jeremy renner as hawkeye and its safe to say that he isnt really the most interesting out of the bunch he has a few good individual character moments and a few good scenes with johansson but he just doesnt fulfill that avenger feel sam jackson thrives as usual having more to do while having a bigger impact on the outcome tom hiddleston as loki returns as our main antagonist and he absolutely steals every scene that hes in bringing this mischievous persona mixed with some deep emotions and sophistication loki poses a real threat with a true motive unlike every other villain weve seen already the chitari is fine for what they are but theyre nothing that memorable  the screenplay by joss whedon not zak penn was the best yet it had its silly moments but it was mainly filled with consistent humor and wit with deep emotional dialogues that helped build all of our characters tremendously whedon added this amazing banter between all of the characters that felt as genuine as can be  the action through phase one was fine but it wasnt really anything spectacular but the avengers wanted to go out with an absolute bang from the middle of the second act and on everything was so high octane having memorable action sequences backed up with one of the most well know scores by alan silvestri   overall marvels the avengers is one of my favorite movies of all time let alone of the mcu with all of these characters being fleshed out more with great writting and story telling the avengers made a huge impact on whats to come for the saga and super hero films in general
Jun 14 2020,positive,rewatching this movie i discovered foreshadowed heart and humor i had never noticed before this was a turning point in the mcu for a reason izzy meth
Jun 10 2020,positive,one of the best movies marvel has ever done
Jun 8 2020,positive,the avengers is one of the best mcu films managing to give protagonism to all the characters of the team and have epic scenes throughout the film that could not compare to annithing seen so far in this universe with a soundtrack that makes the film even better it manages to give importance even to secondary characters such as erik selvig stellan skarsgård nick fury samuel l jackson maria hill cobie smulders and agent phil coulson clark gregg not to mencion that it has one of the best villains that the mcu has ever scene
Jun 7 2020,positive,funny good action sequences 
Jun 4 2020,positive,i love it the first avengers movie is also one of the best loki was the perfect villain for this movie it is so fun to see the avengers meet each other the dynamic works their chemistry works really well too nick fury was really good in this movie too what a great start to superhero team up film
Jun 2 2020,positive,this movie is a masterpiece this is marvel fulfilling their vision of a shared universe joss whedon brings all these heroes together in the most satisfying way possible whedon is an amazing director and this movie alone proves it this was no easy task many other studios have tried to copy this like the dark universe or the dceu even though this is a movie combining superheroes from 4 different franchises how many movies do you really have to watch before watching the avengers the answer is 0 the avengers does such a great job on its own establishing these characters it is also one of the most enjoyable movies the witty banter between the avengers works so well whedon does a great job of presenting the theme of how people are stronger together this movie perfectly demonstrates how being a team is more than just a bunch of people that are always giving each other nonsense its about willing to put your differences aside to work together loki is one of the best villains in the mcu the final battle is amazing with so many cool moments especially when the avengers assemble for the first time to fight against the chitauri this is a blast to watch and never fails to entertain the avengers is truly a classic
Jun 2 2020,positive,the anticipation for this film was huge and it toatally lived up to the hype the action is intense and no character is forgotten or left out each gets their own moment to shine and loki returning as the villan is even better and menacing than he was in the first thor film and delving deeper in to infinity stone storyline with iconic shots and tons of eye candy the avengers welcomes the next phase to the mcu giving phase 1 the ending it truly deserved
Jun 2 2020,positive,better than captain america winter soldier a
May 30 2020,positive,this was an amazing culmination to the anticipation of this amazing idea that started with the bombastic iron man movie  this was everything i could have hoped for as a kid growing up reading comics  josh whedon is on fire here not only meshing the heroes together but infusing great comedic moments to add levity to the action  and the action moments created seemed to be ripped from the pages of those comics i grew up reading  a fun movie our family has watched multiple times since sitting in that theater as a 43 year old but grinning and laughing like i was 12
May 27 2020,positive,a great expansion the visual effects on the final battle are incredible they never leave to surprise me
May 25 2020,positive,visually great of course and some great acting and charactersnot my favourite avengers movie for the simple fact that for me loki is the worst villain in the franchisedont get me wrong he is played well in the filmi just dont like him lol
May 24 2020,positive,this is a fun superhero film it has great acting dialogue and effects all of which are essentials for a superhero blockbuster robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson mark ruffalo jeremy renner samuel l jackson tom hiddleston and others all have great performances as various heroes and villains hiddlestons loki is a great villain who doesnt overpower his opposition with brute strength but with his wit the script humanizes these characters and makes them all the more relatable to the viewers the added moments of humor are a welcomed addition to an otherwise serious story the set designs whether cgi or practical look great and help transport us into the heroes world this movies action and spectacle are amazing the fighting is well choreographed and often enhanced by context this is not just a superhero film focused on big action it has a lot of substance to it as well director joss whedon was able to craft a great comic book adaptation overall i give this film an 8510
May 24 2020,positive,a nerds dream come true
May 19 2020,positive,this film really structuring the mcu does it extremely well imo because of this film being the first ensemble film besides x men is so much fun 9410
May 18 2020,positive,assemble putting together the complete might of the current characters and one of the best villains hemsworth weadon shows us just how powerful these movies were going to become
May 18 2020,positive,an amazing way to bring all of these heroes together it is a really risky idea that in my opinion totally works
May 17 2020,positive,the avengers defined the true beginnings of what we now call the mcu this was the first film in this juggernaut universe that launched the nerd comicbook understanding genre and successfully applied and propelled that philosophy and transversed upon and thereby assemalated the rest of most all of the normal moviegoing audiences going forward in this age we are now all nerds joss whedon did an unprecedented job and the chemistry among the characters is some of the finest there is and set the tone and standard for what the mcu would be moving forward it isnt a perfect movie it has its issues but it ultimately worked and broke boundaries in its wake
May 7 2020,positive,pretty good but not great movie cool to see all the big name actors on screen with each other for the first time took a while for the movie to get going 
May 7 2020,positive,i still love watching this one to this day it may not be as flashy as some of the other mcu movies but it was unreal to see these six on the big screen for the first time no one knew if this could be possible having this many superheroes in one film loki is at his best in this one i kind of miss the old avenger days
May 6 2020,positive,the visual effects aged horribly that being said still a textbook example of how to do crossovers right
May 5 2020,positive,it was very interesting watching this movie again after seeing the conclusion to the mcu compared to the concluding films of the franchise avengers feels like it is cobbled together a lot of the dialogue felt stilted this time around and very unnatural i still really love this movie and it brought back a lot of nostalgia but it isnt as good as i remember it being
May 1 2020,positive,a excellent start to the mcu the movie is an action packed movie that makes people love these movies
Apr 29 2020,positive,lived up to the hype
Apr 24 2020,positive,a big overthetop heroes uniting with explosions made realistic with characters with their unique but understandable individual struggles and reluctances
Apr 24 2020,positive,this is the first liveaction movie where weve seen a group of super heroes band together to save the world i saw it in theaters and knew this movie was revolutionary we hadnt seen anything like it looking back on it now the plot just kind of revolves around the heroes getting together but regardless its a fun time sure it doesnt hold up as well as many people remember but its still a good movie not to mention it was just the end of phase 1 and the beginning of phase 2
Apr 24 2020,positive,this is undoubtedly the best first team up movie in superhero movies only one of its sequels was better than it it is amazingly well done with the action and comedy and breathtaking suspense if i had to review this movie in five words it would be i absolutely loved this movie
Apr 24 2020,positive,solid with a capital s  definitely not my favorite of the mcu films but its up there
Apr 23 2020,positive,this movie is one of the best superhero  movie ever  it was such an amazing movie that got people excited to go see marvel films because of the first avenger film  it is action packed  amazing and fun this movie was  but sometimes this film can feel a little bit slow and boring sometimes but over wall just a great movie it is
Apr 20 2020,positive,one of the best movies ive ever watched it had a great storyline and i just love how marvel brought captain america iron man the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye together id give it 100
Apr 16 2020,positive,the mcu really starts with a compelling narrative stunning action sequences character development and anticipation for future mcu movies
Apr 15 2020,positive,one of the top superhero movies with some good acting
Apr 15 2020,positive,everythings great except caps suit
Apr 15 2020,positive,great a super hero series for the ages

Apr 8 2020,positive,yeah it is good but i belive endgame is better
Apr 8 2020,positive,it is a film in which the shield agency decided to recruit a team to save the world from an enemy capable of destroy everything   marta 3º ar
Apr 5 2020,positive,one of my favorite movies it has launched one of the greatest franchises of all time i find myself watching it every so often
Apr 2 2020,positive,this movie perfectly puts 4 franchisesiron man hulk thor and captain america into 1 black widow is awesome in this movie the best thing about this movie is the action scenes that will blow you away
Mar 27 2020,positive,while sometimes the dialogue can get a bet corny this film is incredible
Mar 25 2020,negative,can marvel make anything original marvel cant even come up with their own name stop riding dcs dick and make your own characters utter garbage captain america is wonder woman spiderman is superman ironman is batman hawkeye and blackwidow is green arrow and black canary etc
Mar 22 2020,positive,now what makes this movie the best film of the 2010s heres my list good acting josh whedons direction amazing screenplay good oneliners and some unique humor i have nothing but awesome things to say about this movie in fact this movie helped expand the marvel cinematic universe by the introduction of the aliens to thanos himself overall marvels the avengers is one of the best movies of all time
Mar 19 2020,positive,the avengers is one of the greatest superhero films ever made the way it handled having all these different superheroes banding together against one villain was honestly perfect
Mar 18 2020,neutral,memorable first assemble of the marvel superheroes is powered by enthralling setpieces but drags a little in the third act
Mar 16 2020,positive,finally saw this movie this one i definitely love the fighting scenes first one captain america and iron man fighting with loki second thor fighting with iron man and then captain america third hulk fighting with thor since bruce couldnt control his power and lastly my favorite scene of all avengers fighting with the chitauris not sure if they were called that my favorite scene that made me laugh was when hulk grabbed loki and smashed him and called him puny god really recommend watching this this is just awesome and funny
Mar 13 2020,positive,the base for the future glory
Mar 10 2020,negative,i didnt like how almost all the characters just argued until the last third and then suddenly got along it also bored me through most of it and the costumes werent the best
Mar 8 2020,positive,the thing that i hate about this movie is captain america suit it sucks
Mar 5 2020,positive,the avengers is the culmination of everything the mcu has been leading up to its full of the action humour and just about anything that fans will certainly enjoy
Mar 3 2020,positive,i still think this is a better movie than avengers endgame
Mar 1 2020,positive,this is how you make a superhero team up movie there is action and there is humor too with wonderful oneliners and there is a villain the audience knows and there are characters the audience cares about and each of them has an important part in the storyline the final battle is visually great and the aftercredits shawarma scene is pure joy 
Feb 27 2020,positive,the first avengers movie has steadily hold down the 3 spot on my mcu rank and after watching it again for the first time in a long time that remains unchanged
Feb 21 2020,positive,this is an amazing movie and was truly the first of its kind live action

Feb 10 2020,positive,a very great movie the team moments are the best
Feb 10 2020,positive,this is the best superhero film ever put together the way they tied all the characters in this film up to this point is excellent from start to finish just awesome
Feb 8 2020,positive,when this came out in 2012 i thought my expectations were so high that they could not be met but they ended up being surpassed forever a top 3 mcu movie 
Feb 7 2020,positive,avengers is just a great fun and amazing movie
Feb 7 2020,neutral,history will remember avengers but not because its a good movie itll remember it because it was an incredibly ambitious one succesfully managing to serialize cinema make standalone flicks connect and form bigger stories thats something worth applauding whats not worth applauding is the movies plot for sure which could be summarized in one sentence a bunch of heroes team up to defeat a bunch of cgi aliens trying to take over the world
Feb 7 2020,negative,by making this you take away from the individuality values of each super hero as beloved as this movie is i put it in the fail colomn i must prefer the stand alone films to the avenger films
Feb 7 2020,positive,really liked a lot of great story buliding
Feb 6 2020,positive,this doesnt feel as rushed or cgi filled as the more current marvel cinematic universe titles
Feb 6 2020,positive, for better and worse looks like a saturday morning cartoon some really nice overall cinematography even small scenes or fx heavy scenes look good even if it sets the series on a path of a fairly plain visual tone  also for better and worse has the plot of a saturday morning cartoon which means its convoluted and painfully simple at the same time  effects still hold up particularly iron man  the way the title card comes in is a stroke of genius  ruffalo plays a pleasant to watch snarky smarmy smart guy whos so angry that hes a dick to everyone its a good choice even if hes a bit wrong for the role  powers booth  effortless and pleasurable connective tissue in the opening recruitment scenes  cool desuiting at stark towers  stark with potts is a good combination great chemistry and i want to see more coulson nerding out is funny still  there is a plethora of excellent dialogue and refreshing takes on the tropes  all the super fights are excellently choreographed slices of comic book action no battle fatigue inventive etc even in the third act  hes adopted  science bros  dialogue really flows well feels organic important and full of character layers the repartee particularly between tony and cap feels tense and equal and riveting at times  good use of aspect ratio appropriate  having to explain the nerd stuff to someone who enjoys it anyway means it hits both ways  much better than i remember it has aged well  good closing shot    gift and curse of whedons dialogue is that sometimes its brilliant and sometimes its awfully cringeworthy  some wonky or hacky directing  sort of lame opening chunks before the team assembling  i just dont like sam jackson unless hes playing sam jackson here hes not hes playing sneaky grumpy mace windu in an eyepatch  faceless generic blueblooded fodder enemies  quintessential skybeam blockbuster third act   early postcredits sequence review 25 thanos reveal christ i remember not knowing anything about this guy at the time he looks ropey and doesnt say anything hard to love hard not to appreciate how much it changed things   actual postcredits sequence review 55 shawarma now thats funny everones so knackered accomplished a great mission together weve all been there a good callback nonsense but charming and i love it   stan lee as old man that doesnt believe superheroes are in new york 55 another perfect cameo slotted in there well amongst newsreel and although it breaks the fourth wall a lot its a cheeky one delivered at the right time the calm after the storm
Feb 6 2020,positive,another great film in the mcu
Jan 28 2020,positive,nothing anyone hasnt said already just watch it you wont regret it

Jan 22 2020,positive,this superhero movie is one of my all time favorites its full of action comedy and drama the entire cast and crew did a fantastic job in making this movie everyone that starred in this movie were the right people for the characters they played the story was well laid out and was very interesting whether youre a superhero fan or not you will love this movie itll blow you away and make you laugh this is a definite mustsee
Jan 20 2020,positive,avengers 1 is an overrated theme park theme park is a phrase which means the filmmakers focused more on special effects rather than story and it made the movie boring and bad the opening scenes were horrible and were weird you couldnt understand anything going on it just happened and it was confusing only people who read the comics would understand what happened thats not very good if you are trying to get non comic book readers into the superhero genre the acting was bad except for iron man thor and loki chris evans showed no emotion mark ruffalo played bruce banner like an arrogant stressed out idiot scarlett johannson didnt have emotion and jeremy renner played hawkeye where hawkeye is very lame however robert downey jr did so good with iron man and i can say the same with hemsworth and hiddleston with their roles the movie was boring the acting was mediocre and it was an overrated theme park of a movie
Jan 17 2020,positive,another great marvel movie just amazing really good to see all the avengers together
Jan 11 2020,positive,when it came out it was awesome now compared with the new movies it feels a bit too linear and trivial still its a very important movie for the franchise and a really ambitious and well crafted project that comes to a first end if you enjoyed the first phase movies sure you will enjoy this one more
Jan 9 2020,positive,though a bit corny and flashy the character interactions action and plot all make it incredibly enjoyable

Jan 1 2020,negative,if most people were honest with their friends and family and themselves when discussing this movie they would have to admit the movie overrated and it was
Dec 31 2019,positive,its a great conclusion to phase 1 by having 4 popular superheroes in a crossover marvel movie
Dec 30 2019,positive,this is one of the bestmade mcu films it took 4 characters who all had introductory movies before and 2 relatively unknown characters and put them all together in this epic teamup action movie and joss whedon executed this to perfection i am seriously surprised by how good this movie ended up being it is funny the action is amazing the characters get great development and the script was perfect this 6 superstar hollywood actors work so well together and play off of each other as best as they possibly could have the chemistry is real and you can feel that through the magnificent performances mark ruffalo was amazing as the hulk and he brought the quiet and shy supergenius persona that compliments the hulk he was a very good casting for this film robert downey jr is just as good as ever you really feel the struggle within him starting to pull the team apart and he feels like something should be done and he takes charge of reuniting the superheroes i was very pleased with his character in this movie chris evans is very quiet until the third act when he organizes the team and kicks some butt with them he is so very good in the serious roles that he takes and i loved him in this film as well jeremy renner was underutilized way too much he is mindcontrolled for the first two acts and he doesnt get to do much until the epic final battle but he gave a decent performance and his relationship with black widow was very intriguing i think that they have a great history that is worth exploring speaking of which scarlett johansson really made had her breakout role in this film she is perfect as black widow and is a very strong female role model i enjoyed her contributions to this film even if though both hawkeye and she were both not used as much as they could have been chris hemsworth is a very good actor and he never gets enough credit for what he does but starting with this film his character starts to get really uninteresting and unbearably dull his character does things that really dont matter and theyre boring to watch but this film was only the start of his downfall he is still pretty good samuel l jackson was surprisingly very good his character actually did things that he just talked about before it was great to see how respected and talented he really is and nick fury has many layers that are discovered quite a bit i loved his character development in this film tom hiddleston is incredible he is truly evil and wants to see the world burn you get to see him setting up and executing his evil plan and you get to see how mad and delusional he really is but he also can toy with peoples emotions like nobody business which was really investing to watch agent coulsen is a great character and his sacrifice was exactly what the avengers need as motivation to fight it was perfect and clark gregg was very good i loved seeing stellan skarsgard back from thor he is a great actor who i would like to see again in the mcu all of the action is amazing to watch and it is all very entertaining i loved seeing thor and hulk kick ass together almost a premonition of their relationship in ragnarok this movie never drags it is constantly throwing new problems at you and it is fun to watch these superheroes learn to work together and save the day the script was excellent really gave every character depth i sincerely love what this film did for these characters and how this battle of new york would be a crucial building block for all of these characters futures i love this film and watch it a lot it doesnt get boring and the script and character development were close to flawless this is truly the peak of teamup movies and makes me excited about the future of the mcu
Dec 30 2019,positive,phenomenal film 1010 that is how you do a teamup movie i love the chemistry with all the characters it was slow at first to build up the team up but it was amazing the action scenes are epic very fun to watch

Dec 19 2019,positive,the film that launched the mcu into the stratosphere with fantastic balancing and equal story beats for previously built open well rounded characters this spectacle is tightly balanced with moments of levity intwined with awesome battle sequences amazing performances and a perfectly balanced story made this film revolutionary
Dec 18 2019,negative,in my opinion after their friend and ally is murdered by the villian heroes simply do not go on to deliver extendeddddd playful beat em up scenes for the big baddie and his army of nerdowells who are in the midst of committing genocide   it is not how storytelling works unless youre going for that deadpoolesc style take    this film was essentially just close ups of every hero as they crack the lamest one liners since batman and robin and smirk into the camera  between these close ups we are treated to slapstick comedy faceplants or bro on bro punches between the rage filled monster companionthe most embarrassing take on the hulk to date and the god of thunder lame  for the finale the alien army is just straight up insta killed in a single explosion for some reason  the directorwriters never bother to explain how this is even possible or to show the heroes working out a way it could be achieved in fact they had no idea themselves  there is no established link between the aliens and some sort of hive mind or central control hub or entity who is connected to them all delivering commands  no just stark grabs a missle the government shot at new yorkdespite the portal being in the sky above it and happens to fly it through the portal and it by sheer luck manages to hit a ship we havent even seen before and bam planetary scale invasion immediately ended   coolcoolcoolcoolcool lets hope no one questions it  i guess who needs narrative when thor can faceplant a window right xd   next the mass murderer who stabbed their mate to death in the previous scene is comically interrupted mid temper tantrumafter all his entire motivations for being a villian in the first place is a temper tantrum with his adopted daddy who gave him a better life than he could ever of had otherwise by the funny rage monster who leaves him in a ditch and cracks a lame one liner as he strolls off screenpwunnnwy gwd    the camera then zooms in for a close up of the big baddie who in turn comically sighs with a bemused expression on his face and the heroes grab a quick bite to eat in a nearby half destroyed restaurant   if this wasnt the most angstyedgy villian i have ever seen i dont know what is   the franchise completely lacks the understanding of how to balance comedy with tragedy and shows no sign of improvement as it continues  storytelling takes a back seat to flashy action scenes and poorly timed one liners  romance andor family relationships are barely more than an afterthought if they are mentioned at all   it all cumulates in a lack luster movie with 0 emotional developments or story points disappointing narrative plot holes and an anticlimactic finale  the characters have to be the most gimmicky collection of 2 dimensional heroes on the big screen in decades  if it wasnt for their hammer or robot suit or fancy shield you wouldnt be able to tell one character from the other  overrated doesnt cut it for this movie how it crossed a billion dollars is i dont know the lamest miracle ever hah

Oct 23 2019,positive,avengers with the best of em all ironman tonystark what more needs to be said the dopest fliest mfr there is  the rest of marvel avengers
Oct 22 2019,positive,the avengers had changed the way that superhero ensemble films are made with a great script from joss whedon including his famous quips and also his direction he knew how he wanted to make the characters stand out of course the stand out performance is robert downey jr as he is in all mcu films the only main issue i have with this film is that is does start of slow which might turn people away however if your stick with it towards the end then you get a epic 3rd act which  at the time was the greatest on screen so with it being full of action humour great superhero set pieces the avenegrs is a must see for all superhero fans you will be converted when you see the greatest group shot along with the music still remains the best ever one of the best superhero films ever made off course

Oct 8 2019,positive,everyone is saying that and game is the better movie but its like not even that good  i mean its a good sequel but not a good movie there so many reasons why end game is not good 1st of all why didnt  tony just use the eather or reality stone to just cut all the chitari and thanos in half  and why dont they just use the time stone to go back before black widow died and just save her  but with this movie its  pure and everything is important they didnt and they couldnt add nothing could of been cut out also robert downey jr is way better in this movie than he isnt endgame loki is also a really good villain he all like shakespearean and of like he talks in metaphors like  when nick fury is like trying to steal the  tesseract and he and loki have a conversation and when loki says  i will make a world free then nick says  free from what  free of freedom freedom is the one lie we tell ourselves and once we accept that then you will truly be free that i the nicks likewe have no quarrel with your people he says an ant has no quarrel with a boot   do you plan on stepping on us and the part where iron man thor and captain america are fighting is just so cool and thor strikes caps sheild and the forest basiclly explodes just go watch the scene its amazing snd also watch the movie
Oct 7 2019,positive,this film definitely lives up to the hype the writing shows improvement since previous marvel studios films making the dialogue purposeful and the oneliners are actually funny and not overly cheesy the choreography in the fight scenes is perfect with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers the cgi and visual effects are incredible speaking of which the hulks character model is improved as well making him more realistic looking and actually resembling mark ruffalo who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of bruce banner thor and captain america seem to fit better as side characters in this film and the interactions between them and iron man are full of chemistry robert downey jr is on point as usual black widows character is improved with scarlett johansson showing some emotional depth tom hiddleston shines as loki delivering a theatrical performance that comes off cunning and sinister this film raised the bar for what marvel studios is capable of

Aug 6 2019,positive,this movie does character better than almost any other joss whedon accomplished the almost insurmountable task of combining the six main characters and several side characters in a way that lets each of them shine unimpeded by the others the brilliance of the oneonone confrontations each main character gets with the villain that highlight the unique strengths they bring to the team cannot be overstated it also contains one of the most dynamic and multifaceted arguments ever put to film it combined three existing characterbased film franchises reinvented a fourth and added in two main characters to boot and it did it so well that it became the gold standard by which all action films and all teamup films are measured  closest comparison its the super hero team up movie that started them all  setting super hero plot war spy tone  action adventure

Jul 18 2019,positive,this is the best one out of the mculoved the villainthe storyand the whole thingjust all of it was the great
Jul 17 2019,positive,a film that exceeds expectations the avengers opened our eyes to the possiblities of the shared universe by giving us one of the best if not the best superhero film ever made by putting emphasis on characters action visuals and great interactions
Jul 15 2019,positive,every actor is amazing and it feels fresh
Jul 13 2019,positive,such a memorable and impactfull moment for not just the mcu but all movies in general
Jul 11 2019,positive,the avengers is spectacular in several senses of the word it is literally a spectacle with people flying up into the sky monsters plummeting out of it airships flying through it and so on however the real dynamism here is in the character interactions not something one expects of even a regular superhero movie let alone one where a bunch of different storylines have to intersect meaningfully  followers of marvel comics characters in the movies have already seen robert downey jr star in two iron man films chris evans as captain america and chris hemsworth as thor the alien mistaken by the ancient vikings as a god although mark ruffalo is new to the role there have been two previous hulk movies in the last decade there have also been spiderman fantastic four and xmen movies but those dont come into play here scarlett johansson as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye clark gregg as agent coulson and the essential samuel l jackson as shield director nick fury have all turned up in one or more of the aforementioned features so the avengers comes into frame lugging a trainload of back story  however the avengers hits the ground running more or less literally and finds deft ways to bring us up to speed on the various histories should we have missed or forgotten anything without boring those who know directorwriter joss whedon working from a screen story cocrafted with zak penn finds enormous amounts of fun in putting together people who are accustomed to being viewed as odd with new folks they cant help finding even odder  the short version of the setup here is that something is stolen from shield and fury reaches out to his operatives  some less enthusiastic than others  when it turns out that the earth is imperiled by the object itself the entity who has stolen it and the allies he summons  we know that ultimately all of the main characters are going to figure out how to work together to save the planet  they are after all super heroes not supershirkers  but see how they variously overcome their differences or revel in their similarities is much of the fun most films in this genre  the xmen series being the notable exception  have to focus on one awesome figure and make every other good guy a bit less awesome in comparison avengers cant shouldnt and doesnt do that here everyone has a tactical function but more each one of the avengers fills the screen in a way that none of the others can  whedon directs the action kinetically and makes sure to give each characters unique abilities a proper showcase without having to slow down to underscore thats what hes doing there does seem to be a particular sense of joy when it comes to the hulk as well as some glorious physical stunt work by johanssons black widow and cobie smulders agent maria hill  we get the sense that downeys stark is first among equals here perhaps because of the main characters he not only has the biggest arc but is the most mercurial his philosophical clashes with evans straightarrow steve rogers aka captain america are wonderful to watch because of their differences but even more memorable are his scenes of surprised affinity with ruffalos bruce bannerhulk theres something genuinely affecting in seeing these two men used to being misunderstood or not understood at all finding kindred spirits in the midst of thundering havoc all around  a note of special appreciation about the hulk here  not only does ruffalo give us a man who is in a state of minor exasperation at all times the better to defuse his rage and major selfimposed loneliness but the visual effects department gives us the best iteration of the hulk since lou ferrigno went green we can still see ruffalos performance within the hulk rather than having cgi trying to impose a version of an actors face on something that looks like a badlyproportioned videogame avatar which has been the case with at least one previous iteration of the hulk  hemsworth remains a delight as the slightly befuddled but utterly game thor and tom hiddleston is elegantly wounded as thors spiteful stepbrother loki one caveat  lokis horned helmet doesnt look any less silly than it did in thor this bit of costume design does not survive translation to live action well but hiddleston bears up under it nobly johansson is coolly capable and of course looks fantastic as natasha romanovblack widow and renner targets some emotional moments with understated precision the entire cast is terrific  the 3d doesnt distract from the film although it seems unnecessary  the effects all look like they are satisfyingly dimensional enough without the extra process and it would have been nice to see the kind of colors those dark glasses inevitably tamp down  in summation the avengers will appeal to fans of comic books fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue its a pretty awesome assembly  by the way sit through the closing credits just sayin
Jul 10 2019,positive,this film is one of the greatest crossovers in cinema history the action is amazing the characters are likable and all have great chemistry and the story is clever and well written this movie will certainly be remembered for many things 1010
Jul 8 2019,positive,some assembly required avengers initiative the big superhero team up four lead actors two previous cameo appearances formed by nick fury and shield agents phil coulson and maria hill  avengers is a celebration of the superhero movie genre past present and future a dreamful imaginative innovative fulfillment of what a franchise or modern serial could become officiating the term marvel cinematic universe  picking up from the end of thor with diverse backgroundsabilities  of the core team to battle loki and the others chitauri  best superhero team movie of the time arguably any the spectacle made up for the weakest points of what you previously invested in for lower tier mcu films  
Jul 8 2019,positive,with 6 superheroes introduced on the big screen they finally come together in this nonstop action packed adventure
Jul 7 2019,positive,somehow marvel was able to do the impossible giving screen time to all its major actors to pull of well rounded movie that is tightly shot and unbelievable performances by all
Jul 7 2019,positive,marvels first really big movie still amazing i absolutely love this masterpiece 
Jul 7 2019,positive,a combined avenger film directed and written by joss whedon has a lot of expectations and it lives up to every one whedon brings his classic humour and humanising to the dysfunctional family of avengers its such fun to watch them clash but inevitably come together epic visual effects continually upping the game in the marvel universe also has some great easter eggs 
Jul 7 2019,positive,a great payoff that guarantees a fun time
Jul 6 2019,positive,looking back at this now it isnt the perfect movie i always made it out to be  the humor is fine but cuts into some of the more serious stuff though not as bad as ultron did but even so it still brings together these heroes perfectly  you get great scenes for each avenger and it pushes them to the limits as a team  its not the perfect movie but it was the start of something greater  it kicked off the rest of the mcu and set up the rest of their team up movies to come  
Jul 5 2019,positive,i couldnt stop laughing i theaters this movie is just to good
Jul 3 2019,positive,what can i say this movie is pretty great it was the birthmovie of the avengers and it brought them together beautifully in a way no movie had ever done before the differing personalities of every hero as well as their similarities were shown excellently and the tensions among them were developed well then the final act did all of the characters justice ive never been a fan of action honestly but it was pretty cool to see the newly found avengers kick ass 
Jul 2 2019,positive,a film with lots of superheroes and action
Jun 25 2019,positive,the superhero team up you wont shut up about
Jun 22 2019,positive,this is one of my favorite movies it manages to give us wellrounded characters quippy dialogue and awesome action scenes five stars
Jun 22 2019,positive,what a great start to my favourite part of the mcu universe ill give marvels the avengers an a
Jun 17 2019,neutral,worst avengers film of them all felt like it ended in the middle of the film
Jun 15 2019,positive,the movie is really good but im disappointed in that fact that the government send an atom rocket to kill all people who were still there now my trust level to the government is really low they are violent people 
Jun 12 2019,neutral,so generic and predictable 
Jun 7 2019,positive,the best thing about the movie is the characters in it with the amazing character development including one of the best villains loki and fueled with mighty action it was one of the grand entry in the superhero genre
Jun 4 2019,positive,the plot is great the action is fantastic the bad guy is interesting the movie is just great
Jun 4 2019,positive,one of the best classic superhero movies avengers assemble
Jun 3 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies and arguably the best of the series avengers finds away to set egos aside and let these heros fight amongst one another and save earth from a great villain
Jun 3 2019,positive,this movie was really good this action packed movie was amazing but the combo attacks were even more awesome to watch tom was outstanding in the role of loki 
Jun 2 2019,positive,a movie which can be enjoyed by previous viewers and newcomers to the franchise simply amazing
Jun 2 2019,positive,great script thrilling action a ton of fun a huge achievement to make this work and made everything that followed possible
Jun 1 2019,positive,comic book movie fun
May 29 2019,positive,best avengers movie out of all of them 
May 29 2019,positive,couldnt of asked for and more of this movie  it was great 
May 29 2019,positive,this movie is one of my favourite mcu movies this movie its awesome 
May 28 2019,positive,loved it this is the movie that sparked my love of the mcu and ive been watching every movie since all the actors were great but i particularly loved scarlett johansson as black widow she is a bad a  
May 25 2019,positive,this is a great movie that is a great way to start off with the original six avengers and also nick fury is a vital role in this movie and you get to see the struggles that the avengers face that will come back to haunt them in captain america civil war also there is an important scene in avengersendgame that you must see this movie to understand
May 22 2019,positive,the team is finally together   i will admit that going into this film i wasnt sure that loki was the correct choice for an antagonist but he astoundingly does an amazing job i mean he was the bad guy in the first thor and for him to be the carryover villain in the avengers seemed like it would be stale but he does a fantastic job i will admit that i felt like the crew sort of come together with a little more ease than i thought they would im not sure that the death of someone would have been enough to have them all come together in this way but clearly im wrongbecause thats exactly what happened  a fantastic movie will definitely watch again
May 20 2019,positive,the movie is avengers the genre is aventure and action the actors act good its an intense film   there are 6 people iron man captain america hulk thor black widow and arrow the rating is 12 it has a little suspense the sinopsis is very nice
May 20 2019,positive,yeah heroes the story is shaping the world to their needs and were in for a lot of action
May 14 2019,positive,the very first mcu movie i ever saw nd it is great this is one of the best mcu film for me the villain is one of the best    it has some problems but it is great
May 11 2019,positive,this movie was amazing had the right balance between comedy and action
May 11 2019,positive,from the beginning its amazing showing an interesting plot in a pretty epic way if you come following the previous films of the mcu you will love how they bring together several things but in any case they present you with each character with wellwritten dialogues with which you can perfectly understand who they are and their motivations without becoming overexpressive or boring there is a very good development of the team which when they have problems that are arranged in a very natural way the final battle is very good and seeing the heroes meet for the first time is epic
May 9 2019,positive,a geeks dream come true full of amazing action and great interactions from out favourite heroes   loki while questioned by many is one of the best villians of the mcu and definitely a good addition to this movie although sometimes they play down his character for the sake of jokes a little too much
May 9 2019,positive,not the biggest fan of the mcu but for me this is the best film i have seen from them undeniably entertaining adn amusing
May 4 2019,positive,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the avengers is still pretty fun it really was a risk trying to make this movie happen and it really payed off  i still preferred the dark knight rises and the amazing spiderman when it comes to superhero movies of 2012 but i still really enjoyed this film
May 3 2019,positive,my favorite scene in the avengers movie is hulk knocking loki down before he said puny god 
May 2 2019,positive,good opening to the avengers movies
May 2 2019,positive,with all of marvels most iconic heroes on screen at the same time wonderful performances excellent soundtrack intense immersive and fantastic action spoton humor visually appealing status and total direction control by joss whedon marvels first teamup movie centering around the awesome avengers this movie remains one of the highest grossing films of all time as well as one of the finest films ever crafted
May 2 2019,negative,expected much better never thought id say this except maybe first two thor movies but wish i could get my money back 
Apr 29 2019,positive,cool movie but its more like an iron man 3 than an avengers film
Apr 28 2019,positive,this movie is one of the greatest things in the mcu to this day i think that the assembling of the team in the first bit is a little slow but it is completely worth it for the third act this third act is one of if not the best to date i think loki is an extremely great villain who someone we can understand their motives i think that the casting of mark ruffalo is interesting because it makes the hulk less serious but at least he still hulks out in the battle this is one of the best movies in the entire mcu and i think every movie fan should watch this 9510
Apr 28 2019,positive,avengers endgame was a terrific ending to a beautiful a 11 years 22 movies saga the final battle was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen it felt just like a comic book
Apr 28 2019,positive,thank you for making all my babies in one movie and it is that good thank you
Apr 27 2019,positive,one of my top 10 movies of all time  an instant classic
Apr 27 2019,positive,this is one of the greatest superhero movies ever it combines a great cast of characters that get a long very well the actors also played their roles perfectly and the plot of this movie is great
Apr 26 2019,positive,the culmination of multiple solo movies and tieins the avengers showcases great actors in relatable roles discussing real world problems and human emotion and at the same time is a story about superheroes fighting giant aliens 
Apr 26 2019,positive,without the memory of the mcu and infinity war end game might be remembered as a great science fiction epic with the last decade of films in mind end game suffers for clinging to plots that already defined previous mcu films and delivering duds for some of the biggest cliffhangers at the end of infinity war to be fair the film had its share of novelties and character developments but a certain lack of creativity plagued the second half of the film
Apr 26 2019,negative,bang pow splat boom  the brink of disaster spanning the globe  hyperbole much
Apr 26 2019,positive,i remember not studying for my world history ap test in high school and failing it as a result to go see this movie but it was well worth it because the avengers is still one of the most satisfying payoffs to anything ever somehow every character gets their due with whipsmart dialogue and fantastic action that culminates into a phenomenal third act of pure superhero spectacle you really couldnt ask for more
Apr 26 2019,positive,the movie was good but the hulk that is used in the movie with ed norton is much better looking then this one
Apr 26 2019,positive,this movie is what got me into marvel movies its hilarious action packed and just a really fun time
Apr 25 2019,positive,the epic start of one of the greatest eras of film in modern history i will always be thankful to everyone involved in the infinity saga for keeping me here 11 years and not only providing life to these characters ive grown to adore but give me laughter and heartbreak and determination with a quick binge i saw this film in theaters twice and fully enjoyed i hope to the same for endgame
Apr 25 2019,positive,action packed and fast paced mcu as its best
Apr 24 2019,positive,3rd best marvel movie next to infinity war and endgame
Apr 24 2019,positive,if you forget about some of the cheesy themes and insensible plot the avengers is a solid teamup movie that combines past superheroes creating an event that has raised the bar for superhero films
Apr 21 2019,positive,fun entertaining exciting interesting and extraordinary is what makes the avengers the solidification of the mcu
Apr 21 2019,positive,the marvel movie was fantastic it had awesome battles and a awesome story all the characters from the previous movies formed a team to stop thors brother loki loki is a cool guy awesome
Apr 19 2019,positive,memorable first assemble of everyones favourite marvel superheroes is powered by enthralling setpieces but drags a little in the third act
Apr 17 2019,positive,i dont have words to describe how good this movie was and the way they set it up to be a 21 son 22 movie franchise was incredible
Apr 16 2019,positive,excellent movie but im afraid loki was just not good villain for it
Apr 14 2019,positive,um holy crap this is a fantastic movie it lived up to double what everyone was hoping for or at least i thought everyone was hoping for it to be good i guess i was wrong though because some people didnt like it and the only way you possibly couldnt like this movie is if you didnt care or didnt want to be good in the first place
Apr 13 2019,positive,one of the most iconic movies ever made the amount of times ive rewatched this marvel of a movie is uncountable however the only thing that restricts it from the five star rating for me is the amount of corny out of place jokes along with the overexaggeration of the unique quirks of our core characters eg tonys sarcasm thors shakespeareanesque and caps 1940s attitude
Apr 9 2019,positive,joss whedon brought all of our favorite superheroes together beautifully in this fantastic film
Apr 9 2019,positive,joss whedon strikes the door hard and whats visible is kevin feiges dream team  the avengers  whedon is much better a writer than he is a director on a scale of mcquarrie disappointingly joss whedon the director wouldnt even qualify as one for when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans he takes things lightly a lot whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen too much cheese and too much sweet his selfearned jaw dropping moments are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom fortunately these battles are here as the starters the main course is the buildup to that battle  whether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awegasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen there lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old whedon playing with his toys in his room creating banal engaging scenarios between captain and tony this crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybeexpected uplift from this chapter as it managed to bring out every adored content from humor to drama to juicy visual effects the dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screen  among all the triumphs of whedon his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh his performance isnt interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots which it seems like it did to others if aligned the priorities of the makers the characteristics of the characters that evolves into an essential element in the storytelling is their way in for this safe formula wasnt inscrutable enough to convince us that these guys the avengers can avenge
Apr 7 2019,positive,probably the best film ever made
Apr 5 2019,positive,what a blast everyone was talking about it for weeks
Apr 3 2019,positive,now these are the heroes we needed ill take the avengers over the justice league any day of the week
Apr 2 2019,positive,a basic superhero plot is welcomed and while it is understandably clunky in some parts its more than helped by the terrific cast and satisfactory action
Mar 29 2019,positive,a little goofy and meh til the end but the alien army seems it could have been taken out by our military elitesso why do we need superheroes not bad but boring at times as it took awhile to see the characters truly work together
Mar 26 2019,positive,almost two and a half hours of iron man batmaning his way through everyone around him trying to figure out things oh and loki is apparently a big enough threat to bring the strongest forces on the governments super hero contact list together on an airplanelike china shop just so the hulk can hulk  overall marvels the avengers is a great addition to the mcu with a bunch of fantastic one liners from a crew that if all else fails will at least avenge
Mar 25 2019,positive,very good movie loved it
Mar 24 2019,positive,marvels the avengers proves you can have blockbuster smash hit of multiple heroes on the big screen with defining character moments action packed plot and a well rounded cast 
Mar 22 2019,positive,this is still the best marvel movie in my opinion
Mar 22 2019,positive,a well deserve score for the best movie of all times
Mar 21 2019,positive,the best 4k avengers series transfer i have seen so far455
Mar 19 2019,positive,loookii  oh plus his bro  plus the capt plus tony plus everybody including the arrow  yeah im not sure he is too strong  more like an optional avenger but whos combing the back of flies  he did his part good too loved it  utterly utterly irresistible
Mar 18 2019,positive,this movie was really something when i watched it seven years ago and plus i really loved the action first of all some of scenes at the beginning were a bit dramatic but it then gets to the good parts after that so the cinema is mostly normal but there are some parts in it where its cg and thats what really gets me going as for the directing i have to say that joss wheldon did a pretty good job at the acting and the actors did very well too finally lets just say the overall saying of this movie is that it is pretty sad because one character dies in one scene and in the end it is mostly action scenes and i liked that part
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of the best entertaining marvel movies      
Mar 12 2019,positive,awesome to see all these characters in the same movie avengers is funny and action packed and worth seeing just remember loki is a puny god
Mar 11 2019,positive,i posted a review of this film on my review blog i am currently going through every single mcu movie leading up to the release of endgame please give it a read if you have time thank you 
Mar 11 2019,positive,beet crossover ever
Mar 10 2019,neutral,there was almost no story most of the time it was only battles and fight felt like they wasted a lot of time on dumb fight even between the main characters i expected more
Mar 10 2019,positive,this movie really brought the marvel franchise to the forefront of pop culture when my generation becomes old we will always remember this film this movie had good acting great action sequences and impressive cgi for its time props to joss whedon for being able to bring all of these talented actors together brilliantly for a wonderful film timeless classic
Mar 10 2019,positive,2018 october i watch this movie first and boy i like it reason why i wanna see this because everyone hyped infity war so i do not have no choise
Mar 10 2019,positive,amazing combination of an established universe combining all characters together for the first time does feel that some of the hero vs hero fight scenes are forced for the film however
Mar 10 2019,positive,one the best movies of all time
Mar 10 2019,positive,this movie is awesome
Mar 9 2019,positive,so exciting ambitious and bombastic that its myriad flaws are hard to see at first glance the avengers still stands as a strong kickoff point for the series and a cinematic game changer for blockbuster films at large
Mar 9 2019,neutral,the start of the enterprisethe only thing is why havent we had a movie about hawkeye  black widow yet the storyline is silly and the villains droves of aliens just dont convince me the avengers are that mighty nor fearsome
Mar 9 2019,positive,the first big team up in the mcu and still the best avengers film
Mar 9 2019,positive,who doesnt love to see earths mightiest heroes team up it was great as you would expect from marvel
Mar 9 2019,positive,an excellent film that brings together many different heroes for the first time and makes it work strongly recommended a
Mar 9 2019,positive,great movie i cant post how shitty captain marvel is on her movie so id like to give my 2 star review of captain marvel here its boring and it sucks
Mar 9 2019,positive,this was fun will be good to revisit in endgame
Mar 9 2019,negative,horrible crappy discussed
Mar 9 2019,positive,hell yes  great fun movie every single character has their role and is given the limelight at some point the hulk going nuts in new york was probably one of the most exhilarating scenes in a movie in recent history  this movie was worthy of multiple viewings for sure
Mar 9 2019,positive,this movie is almost perfect extremely entertaining and left a deep impression for me when i entered the cinema to watch this show i was just expecting 2 hours of fighting and fireworks i was so wrong about it the characters are so well potrayed and given a good balance of screen time beautiful masterpiece
Mar 9 2019,positive,such a great film i am so worried that brie larson is going to give it all a downer ending by being a deus ex machina and stealing everything these characters have earned
Mar 9 2019,positive,though not all of phase one was perfect  im looking at you hulk  this movie makes up for it id say 95 was a better critical rating but 92 seems deserving the marvel cinematic universe stays true to the books while being easy to follow
Mar 9 2019,positive,amazing  absolutely fantastic
Mar 8 2019,positive,i remember the trepidation of going to see marvelâtms the avengers could they really pull a teamup like this off could the whole really be a sum of some awesome parts i wasnâtmt sure that trepidation turned into utter lack of interest xmen the last stand left a bad taste in my mouth but the avengers crew was regaining my interest in the superhero world movie by movie good thing i gave the movie a chance because i ended up having the time of my life  in marvelâtms the avengers earthâtms mightiest heroes take on the evil loki who is hellbent on world domination  acting 10  beginning 7  characters 10 the gangâtms all here and what a gang i appreciate that each of these superheroes are battling their own inner demons which affects how their characters interact with the other heroes itâtms what makes them a good team they come to understand each otherâtms dysfunctions and deal with it this is the first movie where you start to see the team use their strengths in tandem and work together as a team their initial lack of chemistry is hilarious to watch as they are forced into a unit  cinematographyvisuals 10  conflict 9  genre 10 bringing all these characters on the big screen at once was a monumental accomplishment it was a risk that paid off a damn good movie was made here and deserves a ton of credit for setting a standard in the way superhero movies should be done  memorability 8  pace 8  plot 10 the story weaves together the backstories of the other characters in seamless fashion while there arenâtmt many twists and turns to throw you off or keep you guessing i would also argue that twists werenâtmt necessary for a film like this tell the story you need to tell and if we can see some awesome superpowered battles along the way great job well done here  resolution 10 solid ending capped off with some fun endcredit scenes that pave the way for films to come the entire movie is meant to entertain and i was happy that they finished strong itâtms a capper that leaves you wanting to see these guys team up again  overall 92 seven years later and the marvel cinematic universe is still going as strong as ever iâtmm going to see captain marvel tomorrow a film that wouldnâtmt even be possible without the success of the avengers and other lesserknown properties like guardians of the galaxy seven years later and this movie still never ceases to excite me and make me laugh at the same time
Mar 8 2019,positive,one of the best movies in the last 10 years  the way it brought all these actors together the story that was told the humour and the fight scenes were top notch  great to see these hit the theaters

Jan 25 2019,positive,the best superhero film ever made in my opinion
Jan 24 2019,neutral,the movie as whole is not bad but at the end of the day its pretty much the generic superherocomic book movie  lots of explosions with some semifunny oneliners the action sequences were nothing outstanding they were actually less impressive than the first scenes in thor on top of that the movie is a bit slow until the halfway point some characters felt out of place like scarlett johanssons character and that phil dude hulks reason for being on the team was very blurry as well overall an entertaining popcorn flick watched with boxxy software app but nothing more
Jan 23 2019,positive,amazing  it is one of the best films i have ever seen
Jan 16 2019,positive,this is the best movie ever you need to watch it out of all the avengers watch this one cause it is the best make sure you watch the marvel movies in order
Jan 13 2019,positive,great start to the avengers series just enough funny parts for a movie good mix of action and comedy best phase 1 marvel movie animation on hulk is way better than the hulk movie 95
Jan 13 2019,positive,the essence of the avengers is not against all odds in the accumulation of elements but in the resulting dynamic of uniting them all  qualification fresh  original score 354
Jan 12 2019,negative,never has so much money been spent to make a movie look so cheap  clearly the entire budget went on the cgi in the last act because most of the first half of the movie looks like a tv series seriously look at how some of the shots are constructed this is tv studio level direction  credit to marvel for having the direction and commitment to bringing the mcu into existence and linking everything together into a payoff but unless you have a massive investment in the characters this is not really anything special with a by the numbers plot involving massive egos learning to get over their individual dick sizes and work together to defeat a common threat plus explosions  i actually got bored and needed two sittings to actually finish watching this  also justice league wishes it was this movie
Jan 9 2019,positive,surprisingly this movie doesnt hold up for me the first half is just boring which is weird having all of these interesting charactersbut the fact that its one of a kind in that it combined different movie franchises sucessfully makes this movie a triumph in that sense but just as a standalone movie nah
Jan 8 2019,positive,the best one of them all
Jan 6 2019,positive,a movie that any marvel fan will love
Jan 5 2019,positive,still the best movie in the series totally badass 93
Jan 5 2019,positive,evil supervillain trying to conquer the world for some vapid reason and predictably betrays people at every possible chance and superhero avengers ganging up to stop him i loved seeing my favorite characters and lots of action kept the movie going but it lacked substance in plot
Jan 3 2019,positive,this was an absoloute masterpiece
Jan 2 2019,positive,one of the ultimate comic book movies
Dec 30 2018,positive,as one of the first films i ever saw in cinema this film is just great it unified all whats good about all the previous films all in one film cultivating into what is one of the best films of all time
Dec 29 2018,positive,my first review in inglish  avengers is an awesome movie uniting the great avengers of the comicsthe movie works the villain is incredible although sometimes it decays and makes it tedious but then we have a few minutes of pure confrontations of the avengers iron man thor black widow captain america fighting in new york then when the hulk arrives and if they all join it is a work of art and even better the villain is very acceptable and his needs are noted and why he is fighting  1010
Dec 29 2018,positive,this is the reason multiple superheros can be in one movie this is what made marvel popular this is action packed and the cast is great
Dec 28 2018,positive,in one of the most anticipated blockbusters in recent memory joss whedon succeeds at combining this diverse and mighty heroes and faces them off against a compelling foe in loki resulting in a wholly pleasing and overthetop action entry that binds together the separate storylines of the marvel cinematic universe that raises the bar of its genre
Dec 27 2018,positive,what an achievement one of the best theater experiences in my entire life to see all of these badass characters in the same movie was a monumental surprise to this day avengers never bores me and is still one of the best superhero movies in history 
Dec 27 2018,positive,wonderful action and strong performances
Dec 24 2018,positive,great movie and loved how all the superheroes came together 
Dec 21 2018,positive,pure fun and entertainment from start to finish marvels the avengers is in my opinion the best film in phase one of the marvel cinematic universe
Dec 20 2018,positive,theatre moment in this movie  every character shines in their own way and shares screen time evenly definelty among the top of superhero movies  90
Dec 19 2018,positive,this is an epic adventure and marvel does not disappoint this was the true first of its kind bringing together so many characters in one great franchise and finally a great movie with the hulk the action cgi comedy and all other aspects mix together perfectly if robert downey jr is smart he will continue making movies as tony starkiron man for the rest of his life
Dec 14 2018,positive,this was defining moment for comic book fans and it was good a solid entry for the mcu
Dec 9 2018,positive,this is the marvel film that shows what true teamwork is all about
Dec 8 2018,positive,it was very epic to see the heroes united in a movie and the truth was something unexpected to see but they focused on the comedy and loki promised too much but he was humiliated and this if i dislike him a bit
Dec 6 2018,positive,a real game changer for comic book movies
Dec 3 2018,positive,i really loved the movie due to its action characters especially the avengers humor and soundtrack but i can concern that it is too soon to add characters that were barely introduced to such as hawkeye
Nov 29 2018,positive,marvels the avengers throws it all together in a slapstick chuckleworthy and clever action mishmash the direction isnt wound too tight for too long and the characters weave together like finely meshed fabric
Nov 27 2018,positive,joss whedon has brought us the movie that comic book geeks have been waiting for marvels the avengers robert downey jr plays iron man chris evans plays captain america chris hemsworth plays the mighty thor scarlett johansson plays black widow jeremy renner plays hawkeye mark ruffalo plays the incredible hulk tom hiddleston plays the baddie loki and samuel ljackson plays nick fury the change between mark ruffalo and edward norton was actually the right choice to make because mark ruffalo plays bruce banner and lot better than edward norton did this movie was a real game changer because this was the first ever comic book movie when a group of heroes team up which made this film very unique and the best movie that the marvel cinematic universe has produced   loki the adopted brother of thor teamsup with the chitauri army and uses the tesseracts power to travel from asgard to midgard to plot the invasion of earth and become a king the director of the agency shield nick fury sets in motion project avengers joining tony stark aka the iron man steve rogers aka captain america bruce banner aka the hulk thor natasha romanoff aka black widow and clint barton aka hawkeye to save the world from the powerful loki and the alien invasion   this film have amazing sfx and the entire new york fight scene was cgi and it look so real this film has an engaging plot which is brilliantly acted and i would highly recommend that you watch it rated pg for mild language and moderate violence grade a
Nov 26 2018,positive,instant classic i sat down and watched this movie and couldnt take my eyes off it the actors are all amazing and the effects are good too highly recommend
Nov 24 2018,positive,a remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations ive been waiting for this movie since sam jacksons character uttered those famous words after the first iron man film out of the 3 of the avengers films this one is the best this film shared flashbacks with past films which was fine mark ruffalo made his first appearance playing the hulk as a recast and im glad to say hes much better than the last actor who played him edward norton mark ruffalo brought more mystery to the bruce banner character all that norton brand was put a random homeless character on the big screen i didnt know this but apparently all of new york was cgi in the movie   it was great and not just the setting the hulk was as well the hulk scary chase scene was so horrifying jeremy renner character was very creative and we didnt get much of hawkeye in thor all we got is him drawing his bow and thats it he didnt even shoot loki shouldnt of fake death at the end of thor terrible twist the relationship between thor and hulk was hilarious the shield aircraft was an incredible visual effect this will boost the team based comic book movies a lot thanks to the films success  this film was definitely my favorite out of the marvel cinematic universe the aliens were quite interesting  and seeing captain america fight again was exciting robert downey jr was charming in his role i love this film
Nov 24 2018,positive,awesome movie very well written action pack
Nov 22 2018,positive,a very epic crossover that made hollywood what it is today even after all these years it still feels epic to see these characters come together for the first time while the story may not be as strong as other marvel movies it still as amazing now as it was then to see them come together work off each other
Nov 19 2018,positive,this movie has everything that i want from a great superhero movie great characters action and villain even tho the plot is a little bit thin its still definitely holds up but it feels a little bit slow in the beginning perhaps
Nov 19 2018,positive,the superhero film everyone dreamt to see and it really does please people joss whedon made a perfect film with robert downey jr adding his cool
Nov 17 2018,positive,brilliant just brilliant first outing for the avengers thrilling and exciting and everything we had hoped and prayed that it would bebut what an openera and so hard to live up to for future movies
Nov 16 2018,positive,a great poignant superhero film funny and very enjoyable all the way through uniting its heroes in a spectacular way

Nov 6 2018,positive,this film was great
Nov 5 2018,positive,marvels the avengers is the ultimate payoff for waiting to see marvels characters interact onscreen this film provides genuine laughs a fantastic villain and astonishing action sequences
Nov 4 2018,positive,wow its an amazing movie 93 certified fresh
Nov 4 2018,positive,no words just a great movie
Nov 4 2018,positive,this movie starts a little slow but do not be fooled once all the pieces are in place the avengers becomes the fun innovative summer movie it was always meant to be
Nov 1 2018,positive,best comic book movie of all time 
Oct 24 2018,positive,entertaining but not much in it that id want to see again you get lots of action and bits of humor
Oct 21 2018,positive,didnt enjoy the movie itself that much but it unites the heroes perfectly
Oct 15 2018,positive,loved every minute of it must watch one of my favourites
Oct 15 2018,positive,a realseeming superhero film that makes you nerd out as soon as you see iron man and captain america meet
Oct 13 2018,positive,a modern classic that takes advantage of its entertaining character dynamics among the character loki is definitely helps alleviate marvels bland antagonist problem the action certainly matches the expectations built up from across several films
Oct 13 2018,positive,stuff blows up people argue more stuff blows up
Oct 12 2018,positive,i was hyped for this movie and it delivered
Oct 11 2018,positive,before i saw this movie i saw all the reviews of it and those reviews gave me huge expectations for the movie and after i saw it it was even better than the reviews said it would it had a really good storyline and also did a great job at developing the characters throughout the film and my favourite part was the third act it was the best one i had ever seen it had lots of amazing action and loads of scenes with the team together and most importantly it was memorable this movie was not just good but a perfect way to conclude the first phase of the mcu
Oct 7 2018,positive,one of the best movies in the entire series the characters even though their personalities felt kinda overexaggerated were all very fun and enjoyable to add loki is definitely one of the best villains in the entire mcu
Oct 6 2018,positive,this is when how the heroes began an assemble and teamed up to work together as the avengers bold fearless smart and above all miss those days when they were serious and not joking around every minute or two and focused more on saving the world 2012 was the best year for movies back then awesome marvel movie that had an interesting plot suspense and excitement
Oct 3 2018,positive,with wit charm humor and action combined along with the thrill of seeing all our beloved marvel superheroes come together for the first time on film this film fulfilled all expectations and a lot more
Oct 2 2018,positive,the avengers is the first teamup film in the mcu and follows the crew as they argue for a while before teaming up to fight some aliens that are invading earth thanks to loki opening up a portal  even when i watched the avengers for the first time back in 2012 i didnt think that the story was all that special this is a long film and for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk there are a few action set pieces throughout the film such as when thor loki and iron man and captain america have a pretty awesome scuffle but besides that its a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else and it doesnt help that these conversations arent particularly interesting the final battle in the city is cool but theres nothing particularly jawdropping about it either the story here is justokay  i will say that having watched the first captain america film it was cool to see steve interact with the son of a man that he considered a friend and slowly realize that hes a bit of a douche steve and tonys dynamic is by far the most entertaining in the film and possibly the mcu which makes sense given the future these two have  as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great of course this is also the film where we get the iconic shot of the avengers as they assemble on the battlefield which was cool to see  in the end though while everything in this film is solid i dont find it to be particularly mindblowing and really a big part of the reason why i dont like to watch this one very often is because of the long runtime theres nothing in this film that makes me want to sit down for 25 hours and watch it unless im doing an mcu marathon
Sep 25 2018,positive,the avengers is the first teamup film in the mcu and follows the crew as they argue for a while before teaming up to fight some aliens that are invading earth thanks to loki opening up a portal  even when i watched the avengers for the first time back in 2012 i didnt think that the story was all that special this is a long film and for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk there are a few action set pieces throughout the film such as when thor loki and iron man and captain america have a pretty awesome scuffle but besides that its a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else and it doesnt help that these conversations arent particularly interesting the final battle in the city is cool but theres nothing particularly jawdropping about it either the story here is justokay  i will say that having watched the first captain america film it was cool to see steve interact with the son of a man that he considered a friend and slowly realize that hes a bit of a douche steve and tonys dynamic is by far the most entertaining in the film and possibly the mcu which makes sense given the future these two have  as to be expected by this point with mcu films the cinematography is great of course this is also the film where we get the iconic shot of the avengers as they assemble on the battlefield which was cool to see  in the end though while everything in this film is solid i dont find it to be particularly mindblowing and really a big part of the reason why i dont like to watch this one very often is because of the long runtime theres nothing in this film that makes me want to sit down for 25 hours and watch it unless im doing an mcu marathon
Sep 23 2018,negative,multiple superheroes in big set pieces and smartass dialogue dont make a good film yes its certainly cleaner than most blockbusters but its still fan service and portraying multiple protagonists is confusing
Sep 10 2018,positive,the avengers lives up to all expectations and gives us the ultimate fight weve been waiting for since phase one began and loki surprisingly carries the film on his own
Sep 6 2018,positive,how was this so successful was it the films building up to this cast chemistry who knows and who cares this is what comic book fans have wanted since the first time up happened on paper this is what summer blockbusters should be fun smart soul and character development this this right here is the gold standard for team up movies
Sep 3 2018,negative,jusy a forgotable marvel movie
Aug 29 2018,positive,a great action movie the avengers brings to the big screen one of the greatest teams of superheroes of all time
Aug 29 2018,positive,one of the greatest if not the greatest crossover film of all time no other movie company has come close
Aug 16 2018,positive,great culmination of the marvel films to this point
Aug 10 2018,positive,this is my favorite superhero movie and it is such a fun ride
Aug 8 2018,positive,actionpacked complex heroes and villains and highquality cgi
Aug 6 2018,negative,too bright and not funny
Aug 5 2018,positive,a phenomenal film that is a testament to 10 years worth of build up and demonstrates a new trend in movie franchises the characters writing and delivery was great and everything youd expect from these actors all of whom are amazing in their respective roles the only downside to the movie was the music although the main theme was very good and is very memorable
Aug 1 2018,positive,the first avengers movie brings all of the heroes we have seen in their stand alone films except for black widow and hawkeye and brings them all together to fight in the battle of new york the actors in this film appear to have great chemistry together and do great together on screen the action sequences mainly the end one are amazing and show off what these marvel movies can do a
Jul 28 2018,positive,the best movie ever 
Jul 25 2018,positive,amazing movie definitely one of the best superhero movies and best movies in general of all time
Jul 24 2018,positive,the avengers has done what any superhero fan has hoped for in the past few decades bringin them all together and it does with great action a script that focuses on the flaws of all of the characters and also having a great villain and a great larger villain that wont be named but his name starts with a t ends with and s and is focusing on trying to make a gem covered gauntlet and wipe out half of all life 810
Jul 23 2018,positive,since it was released this movie can be considered one of the best movie of the marvel cinematographic universe
Jul 18 2018,positive,this is my favorite marvel movie i think its really cool how you can get all these characters from different franchises and put it all in one it changed how we do franchises nowadays its just a lot of fun  and really funny loki is my favorite mcu villain besides thanos  i think mark ruffalo is better as  hulk  and bruce banner then edward  norton was
Jul 15 2018,positive,marvels the avengers 2012 was truly a build up of anticipation after each of our heros solo outings we see the characters and personalities come together in such a way that feels realistic and grounded despite the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the sky introduction and motivation to characters drives the movie but beyond that we see that of course these individuals dont all get along at first why would they the idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward  director joss whedon takes hes experience from buffy angel and firefly and seamlessly builds the narrative with these already interesting characters the action is nothing short of mind blowing and the cgi is seem less particularly the work put into the hulk whos never looked better  loki our villain from the film returns after the events of thor 2011 is the one we all love to hate what we as the audience can take away from hes character is that we understand hes motivations through real and understandable emotion truly the best villain marvel had done thus far  in conclusion this movie has something to love for everyone the pieces really did fall into place perfectly with this film  in the words of nick fury once there was an idea  and boy did the idea work as close to perfect as can be
Jul 6 2018,positive,more fun than expected and also one of the best 3rd acts ever
Jul 2 2018,positive,marvels the avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of the best superheroes to form the avengers team from the comics marvels the avengers is my favorite movie of 2012 one of my top 10 favorite marvel and superhero movies and one of my favorite movies of all time the visual effects and the action and fighting scenes were spectacular and awesome especially hulk and the battle at the end of the movie the acting was stupendous especially from robert downey jr chris hemsworth tom hiddleston scarlett johansson mark ruffalo chris evans jeremy renner clark gregg samuel l jackson and cobie smulders the costume designs were fantastic the production design was terrific the writing and screenplay were excellent the story was really cool and interesting a
Jun 26 2018,positive,id rate it higher but jeremy renner bugs the crap out of me  i think i liked one scene he was in
Jun 26 2018,positive,the avengers is a fun entertaining and beautiful movie and it was a pleasure seeing all these heroes come together for the first time in a movie
Jun 25 2018,positive,definitely my favorite marvel movie ever released  i remember walking out of the theater mid blown i saw it again later that day also it still holds up great and a must buy 
Jun 18 2018,positive,at the core of a great film is an even greater story at the core of every great story are even greater characters chemistry and a strong foundation of source material the avengers have been around since the early 60s and the characters even far beyond that personally in the midst of my parents divorcing i decided to take a second chance on comic books after dipping my toe into captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew in march 1982 while living in broken arrow ok during one of my many many trips to quiktrip to either buy ice cream donuts or penny candy while playing ms pacman it wasnt a wonder why i became fat around this time fast forward 2 years to may 1984 when i purchased avengers vol 1 number 243 mostly due to my being intrigued with captain america i instantly fell in love with comics and needed them to help me cope with the massive changes going on around me at the time   for the next 34 years i was obsessed with comic books which centered completely around the avengers like captain america iron man thor secret wars etc i read everything i could and became immersed into the years and years of avengers history even as girls and music became more interesting to me than comics i still always had an affinity for the avengers at one point after beginning to earn a good living about 15 years ago i tried collecting every issue ever made i got about 95 there when comics started being graded by cgc and guaranteeing condition i then sold most of my mediocre conditioned books and wanted to collect 9210 near mintmint copies of every issue only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day i only have a few   my heart has always been with the avengers though my heart was broken when the first avengers cartoon series in 19992000 was an embarrassment just a pathetic series however when the xmen movies did well and other titles like daredevil elektra and fantastic four started to be released i was excited to eventually see at least captain america iron man etc on the big screen never did i think a studio would be ambitious enough to attempt the avengers as a whole  then came iron mana b character at best perfectly cast robert downey jr as a spoton tony stark and it was huge then came the news that marvel had owned the properties again and had a strategy to deliver individual movies leading up to an allencompassing avengers movie no way i thought oh this was bound to get screwed up and frankly there was probably no way to please me a diehard avengers fan on the big screen just no way especially after ang lees atrocious hulk movie surely hulk would be left out of the mix   then came edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right buttons continued the iron man storyline eluded to the super soldier serum tying it all together with shield the final scene in the incredible hulk showed us a meditating bruce banner with an evil grin seemingly embracing and enjoying the monster within which told us diehard fans that he must be in the control of loki norse god of mischief as was the case in the classic avengers 1 issue from the early 60s could they be setting up loki and the hulk as the villains of the avengers movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book  then came iron man 2 a poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more nick fury black widow and avengers talk way too rushed and thus what caused favreaus exit as director my interest was still high but i became cautious as the humor of iron man began leaning this whole thing in a direction i had hoped wouldnt come to pass then at the end of iron man 2 thors hammer in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again  then came thor i was really worried about this one a norse god among all these hightech very human heroes given the extremely strong representation of batman by the nolan films this movie had the ability to throw the whole thing into fullblown camp however i was pleasantly surprised introducing hawkeye helped a lot as well then at the end with loki seeing through the eyes of erik gave us fans another glimpse of loki controlling humans which sparked the interest of the hulk again   finally captain america perfectly cast chris evans and developed a nearperfect story around the red skull and the cosmic cube the foundation was almost full strength and the avengers movie was on the horizon could it meet the expectations of the film fans better yet could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the decades of comic book fans  over the past few months ive seen some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers i have been so worried thinking that the movie ive waited 28 years for was going to be an absolute disaster trailer after trailer it didnt look any better did joss royally screw this thing up  well i saw it opening night tonight the trailers show the tiniest fraction of what happens in this absolute masterpiece sure its actionpacked its expected to be sure its got funny moments its expected to especially with robert downey jr as a leading man what joss whedon did was take the greatest care of characters since nolans batman series the interaction between the characters the way they deal with their own personal concerns and flaws and how they come together as a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes   to most people it might be looked at as an enjoyable popcorn film a great kickoff to the summer movie season to me a diehard multidecade fanatic of this comic these films these characters and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and honestly impossible to achieve in my eyes joss proved me ohsowrong when i began seeing the very nigh praise the 93 on rottentomatoes etc my low expectations became super high expectations how often are expectations like that ever met well i can at least say they werent met they were left in the dust exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured bless marvel whedon and these actors for treating multiple generations of fans to a perfect example of how it can be done right sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do it too   my only regret is that edward norton couldnt reprise his role as bruce banner of the 3 bruces he was the best mark ruffalo was the worst i like him as an actor and he had some of the mannerisms but edward captured the intellectual frightened and loner aspect of bruce banner perfectly hulk however stole the show without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will just say that joss inclusion of hulk in the manner in which he was was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae   while i cant imagine them topping this one ive been so strongly surprised i would never say never the setup at the end of the avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to go i even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie but that was a product of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who wrote the film bring it on marvel excelsior nuff said
Jun 16 2018,positive,my favourite marvel movie what an experience this was in the cinema brilliant
Jun 11 2018,positive,just the experience and hype alone give it 5 stars and the rest is infinite
May 31 2018,positive,if this film did not accomplish what it did then there would have been no sequel no civil war no spider man outside of sony no infinity war
May 28 2018,positive,wow the avengers movie is amazing one to be remembered it brought characters that have had their own solo movies and brought them together with good humor witty lines and a hell ton of actionpacked scenes
May 27 2018,positive,a very good movie a fantastic main villain a great cast and just very enjoyable moments that make this a very good movie one of my complaints is that the chutari dont really stand out to me they just seem like an alien race that was added so the avengers wouldnt be killing tons of people but overall a very good movie
May 25 2018,positive,my favorite avenger is ironman but i like the second avengers more 
May 25 2018,positive,avengers is an awesome superhero film and every adjective loud brash kickass applies all the actors gathered do a good job either against one another or against a blue screen the action is top notch and you might get a bit woozy even with all the stuff that happens on the screen this is a movie event and it should not be missed under any circumstances must watch superhero extravaganza
May 21 2018,positive,surprisingly lithe for all its heavyweights and the enormity of its universe and narrative scope the jokes are just clever enough without becoming themselves overwhelming the action remains in service of the story and the plot keeps things relatively simple perhaps not as good as you remember but better still than you might expect  rewatch placed in the context of the overall marvel arc with the first phase of films still fresh in the memory the movie though still formulaic feels somehow more spontaneous and full of lifeonce again explicitly even what matters is not the overwhelming spectacle of different superpowers but the common humanity of these characters joining forces discovering who they can become and what they can overcome when put together
May 16 2018,positive,the first avengers is an excellent composition of characters that essentially launched the ensemble craze we see today
May 16 2018,positive,everything built to thisall the movies before thisand this movie justifies ita great experience
May 13 2018,positive,the avengers combines great action while achieving a great superhero team up film
May 12 2018,positive,following four years worth of movies building up for this moment the avengers is the big crossover that finishes the first phase of the marvel cinematic universe by bringing together some of earths mightiest heroes when the asgardian prince loki makes a deal with the leader of the chituari army to subjugate earth shield director nick fury has to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this alien threat that includes iron man captain america the hulk black widow thor and hawkeye all teaming up to save the world as hard as it might be interacting with each other due to their different personalities but this teamup works the ensemble cast is perfect especially robert downey jr which reprises his role as playboygeniusbillionaire tony stark joss whedon manages to make everyone in this group of heroes shine the characters are as complex as it gets the humor is on point the action is otherworldly and the most impressive at the time this film came out the stakes are high and it just delivers on every level living up to the expectations and the promises its predecessors created in the minds of the fans all in all its pretty much the perfect comic booksuperhero movie and the epitome of how all blockbusters should be made filled with a little bit of everything to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for decades to come
May 10 2018,positive,i just went back and watched the original avengers film and it is still excellent  i forgot a lot of the story and im very happy that i watched it again  it also marks the first appearance of thanos in the end credits  plus i forgot the avengers didnt form until the movie and there are some good fights between the heroes
May 9 2018,positive,omg movie of a lifetime seriously people this movie has the exact amount of action character development moments interesting plot smooth direction and pumped up music the only minor flaw is the technical errors in plot and 2 too much humor at uneccisary moments
May 6 2018,positive,best superhero team ever
May 5 2018,positive,still the greatest marvel movie of all time
May 4 2018,positive,without any doubt the first best superhero movie
May 1 2018,positive,as ive said for years comicbook films struggle once theyve told the origin story this one is goodless of a  batman story but thats what some are looking forthe deeper more serious tale batman for adults which is fine but its not what were getting from marvel films nolan has knows his ancient westerns civilization with his allusions to ancient rome i give it a solid b
Apr 29 2018,positive,still great after all these years to see them unite for the first time 
Apr 29 2018,positive,the first avengers movie brings the classic heroes together a little better than the sequel
Apr 29 2018,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies
Apr 28 2018,positive,it is difficult to underscore how special  epic funny and well executed  this movie was especially for mcu fans a compelling story and humour made this movie highly enjoyable to behold and for anyone in love with this universe it was all our childish dreams made real epic thank you marvel
Apr 27 2018,negative,do not take children to this movie i grew up with marvel and have usually enjoyed their moviesunitl now this movie is dark and full of death there is no happy ending and no heroes that come to the rescue i cant imagine the impact it has on children who watch as spiderman becomes fearful of his impending death and i plan rthe greed of the producers who simply want to have a sequel and make more money as for me marvel is dead in my book
Apr 26 2018,positive,a first in superhero movies a teamup story that triumphs and makes you feel like a kid again when you watch
Apr 26 2018,positive,great movie full of great characters and an amazing script 
Apr 25 2018,positive,yeh how can you not love this movie the one and only thing bad about it was captain americas outfit and even that looked decent when he wasnt wearing the helmet the way weadon made these characters react with one enother was briliant the action scences were spot on cool and loki is still the best mcu villian and he just made this movie awsome the way the story played out so that the heroes didnt originaly come together as a teem but in end knew that the only way to stop the threat on earth was for the group of reemarcible people to come together this movie was smassing
Apr 25 2018,positive,an all around awesome movie
Apr 25 2018,positive,people actually cried in the theater i was quite good indeed
Apr 24 2018,positive,this will always have a special place in my heart loved this movie
Apr 23 2018,positive,a powerhouse film that brings superheroes to life in a way that could only be imagined in the pages of comic books before it
Apr 23 2018,positive,the very first big team up superheroes in a movie like this and they nailed it and it still holds up really well 6 years later the characters have great chemistry and really feel like an actual team the acting is perfect in every sense of the word the action is great and yeah theres really not much else i can say while its almost guaranteed to be surpased by infinity war which the reason i decided to watch this again is because infinity war is literally right around the corner at the time im typing this its still a great superhero that is absolutely worth watching if you somehow havent already
Apr 23 2018,positive,strengths it was always a crazy ambitious plan but marvel made the avengers work in ways nobody couldve imagined joss whedon was the perfect person to write and direct this as he seemed to fully understand what needed to be done the movie juggles so many vital characters and none ever feel like an afterthought robert downy jr tony starkiron man chris evans steve rogerscaptain america and chris hemsworth thor are as great as they always are mark ruffalo bruce bannerhulk steps in and provides an upgrade over edward norton speaking of the hulk this was the first movie to truly feel like it understood what the hulk is supposed to be he gets to absolutely wreck stuff scarlett johansson natasha romanoffblack widow is honestly kind of a show stealer while every scene she shares with jeremy renner clint bartonhawkeye is great its the kind of thing that was only put into the mcu during this film yet worked very well tom hiddleston loki is also a great villain choice as he and the character have the charisma to line up next to his costars the story has just the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys the conflict is not only against loki and his army but among the avengers themselves two of the best scenes involve the members arguing on the ship as well as fighting in the woods as noted each character is given ample opportunity to strut their stuff but the film also makes sure to give the fans what they want battles between capiron man thorhulk thors hammer and caps shield etc were all given attention the writing is sharp the dialogue is witty and there are several laugh out loud moments making it one of the funniest marvel films ever of course theres also the action which is tremendous there are several huge action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie the final battle against the aliens in new york is grand breathtaking and features incredible team ups   weaknesses im sure it sounds weird to say but i couldnt find any this is the epitome of what the big blockbuster superhero movie should be   overall an incredible achievement they handled so many moving parts with grace and the end result was the greatest superhero movie in history the action writing performances and way they respected the source material and characters were all done perfectly
Apr 23 2018,positive,this is everything that a superhero movie should be they really struck gold with this one then just copied the formula for all the marvel movies after it
Apr 17 2018,positive,best superhero crossover movie ever
Apr 14 2018,positive,this movie was greatbut overrated

way a long time 27 million years oongratulations on your victory what will you demand as a settlement first well demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with every last drop we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy smelly badbreath stink machine were all aware of what they do in the woods wait for my signal take him out hell have nauseous for a few hours then hell be fine and we will no longer tolerate beenegative nicknames but its just a pranceabout stage name unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and ladeeda human teatime snack garnishments oant breathe bring it in boys hold it right there good tap it mr buzzwell we just passed three cups and theres gallons more coming  i think we need to shut down  shut down weve never shut down shut down honey production stop making honey turn your key sir what do we do now oannonball were shutting honey production mission abort aborting pollination and nectar detail returning to base adam you wouldnt believe how much honey was out there oh yeah whats going on where is everybody  are they out celebrating  theyre home they dont know what to do laying out sleeping in i heard your uncle oarl was on his way to san antonio with a cricket at least we got our honey back sometimes i think so what if humans liked our honey who wouldnt its the greatest thing in the world i was excited to be part of making it this was my new desk this was my new job i wanted to do it really well and now now i cant i dont understand why theyre not happy i thought their lives would be better theyre doing nothing its amazing honey really changes people you dont have any idea whats going on do you  what did you want to show me  this what happened here that is not the half of it oh no oh my theyre all wilting doesnt look very good does it no and whose fault do you think that is you know im gonna guess bees bees specifically me i didnt think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things its notjust flowers fruits vegetables they all need bees thats our whole sat test right there take away produce that affects the entire animal kingdom and then of course the human species so if theres no more pollination it could all just go south here couldnt it i know this is also partly my fault how about a suicide pact how do we do it  ill sting you you step on me  thatjust kills you twice right right listen barry sorry but i gotta get going i had to open my mouth and talk vanessa vanessa why are you leaving where are

Apr 4 2018,positive,this was everything weve been waiting to see plus more since they rolled out the first iron man in 08 they have been building towards this movie this moment and in my opinion it was better then anyone could ever imagine  that it would be this is the best  comic book movie that is out right nowwith the age of ultron super close to being betterthe storyline was great the look of the film cant be touch even though it was most of it was cgi the action was just outta of hand greatinfinity wars is less then a month away and from the trailer its looks to be good but i will say that the first avenger set the bar very high
Apr 3 2018,positive,this is where we knew that we were just begieing our inrcidable mcu adventure
Apr 2 2018,positive,what a fantastic movie from start to finish what a thrill 
Mar 31 2018,negative,this seemed like a tv movie i lost all love for marvel movies because of this i cant wait for a reboot
Mar 31 2018,positive,92100 finally after five movies it is here the avengers the way this is set up over a period of five movies is amazing and the movie really builds on these previous movies providing some great character interactions and character moments the dialogue scenes were so well executed and directed joss whedon really knows his stuff the action scenes were also fun and engaging without lacking stakes the cgi was a bit noticeable in some areas but it stayed pretty consistent throughout the movie alan silvestris score for this movie is just phenomenal not only the theme but the little motifs really give the score a distinct feel that goes along with the movie the two cannot be separated i really like that the movie continues the characters stories and fleshes them out even more especially bruce banner and natasha we get a real insight into their characters this is what the marvel cinematic universe is all about character and they do it very well loki was a pretty onenote villain conquer the earth it is my destiny blah blah blah but he did give the avengers a difficult villain to fight he was almost always one step ahead of the avengers overall the avengers is a great entry in the mcu and definitely in my top 5 mcu movies for now i would also consider it the best of phase one
Mar 31 2018,positive,excellent great action great graphics great acting
Mar 25 2018,positive,overall i loved this film when i first saw it nearly 4 years ago and love it possibly even more now it is a brilliant film and really fives us all a taste of whats next to come in the marvel cinematic universe because of this i am giving the film a 8510
Mar 24 2018,positive,a movie with almost no flaws from the great chemistry between all the leads the story the villain while also being lighthearted all at the same time flawless 100100
Mar 24 2018,positive,very interesting and classic actionmovie by marvel loved it

Mar 20 2018,positive,great mix of comedy and action that can really make anyone happy
Mar 19 2018,positive,great way to finish phase 1 
Mar 17 2018,neutral,cookie cutter film making at its most mediocre  same old same old heroes versus villains who want to take over the world story thats been done over and over again to death  i guess the dull masses dont mind seeing the same tired story again because this time omg its the avengers  aliens attack earth en masse but are repelled by a group of 6 exclusively white people 2 of whom dont even have super powers or a super suit  lol
Mar 16 2018,positive,an epic and well constructed crossover event
Mar 13 2018,positive,reigns supreme as the best marvel movie
Mar 12 2018,positive,great superhero film
Mar 11 2018,positive,i have a soft spot for teamup movies and this one had a lot of good teamwork action scenes the hulk and thor fiasco is fun cap is a boy scout tony is a dick hawkeye and black widow are dead weight team members but still cool at times loki was an okay villain posing a big threat it was fun
Mar 10 2018,positive,i absolutely love this movie my favorite mcu movie to date and tbh i dont think any other movie can pass it it has a great storyline combined with awesome heroes and loki need i say more 
Mar 10 2018,positive,the most unexpected move by marvel it is so well made and synchronized and the the timing of the movies release was definitely right  movie itself can feel overwhelming with the number of characters
Mar 7 2018,positive,to me the best movie in the world period
Mar 4 2018,positive,the avengers is amazing groundbreaking mighty marvel entertainment and is one of the best superhero films to date
Mar 2 2018,positive,the avengers is awesome funny action packed and filled with good humor the avengers is awesome
Mar 2 2018,positive,i loved it its one of the best superheroes movies marvel has made
Mar 2 2018,positive,by far the best movie ive ever watched
Feb 26 2018,positive,my favorite marvel movie ever everything about this movie is spectacular except cgi hulk coulsons fake death and nick fury being black not racist just not like comics loki is a great villain but i definitely think they should have found a way to make him super powerful cause on his own he cant beat thor let alone the avengers even with a random alien race on his side and a mine controlled scientist who has very little impact on this movie as opposed to the first two thor movies
Feb 24 2018,positive,always will remember the first time i saw it in theaters will always find a place in my heart
Feb 21 2018,positive,an impressive screenplay allows the audience to become completely invested with characters that are given the right amount of time to be developed however despite the blisteringly entertaining action and impressive effects i dont understand why people believe loki is such a great villain hes good for sure but not the best the mcu has to offer doesnt change that this film is about as good as the mcu gets  a
Feb 19 2018,positive,do i even need to say anything besides pure fun
Feb 17 2018,positive,bringing together earths mightiest heroes into one movie was almost guaranteed to be a smash success and the avengers manages to succeed on every level imaginable  ill give it            93
Feb 16 2018,positive,this seriously is one of the greatest superhero films ever made
Feb 15 2018,positive,one of marvels best flims amazing script amazing cast and its superheros set pieces this is a amazing unite avengers flim
Feb 14 2018,positive,considered a modern classic by many the avengers might be the most important comic book movie to date and its surely gained the love its been receiving since its release date back in 2012 the cast is perfect the plot is exciting and the overall feeling of the movie couldnt be more satisfying it is marvels biggest piece of art amazing
Feb 14 2018,positive,the best superhero film i have ever seen delivers without fail on all fronts 
Feb 12 2018,positive,all time best superhero movie
Feb 12 2018,positive,despite some arbitrary plot points and a slow start the avengers is a creative exciting fun film that was definitely worth the wait
Feb 12 2018,positive,a revolutionary film that set the standard for superhero films after it its excellent story only adds more to these predeveloped characters and entertains nerds and nonnerds alike it aslo has one of the best villains proving that marvel can have good villains if they try
Feb 11 2018,positive,the team up of all the marvel heroes that we have been waiting for in a move that i didnt think would work actually did all these characters and egos working together seamlessly sure there are flaws and plot holes but they still work out to make an enjoyable movie going experience with the iron man leading up a team of reluctant heroes in order to save the world from loki and his band of mindless minions the three main heroes iron man captain america and thor all shine through the real surprise though is hulk mark ruffalo calls in a memorable performance to bring a smile to any comic book fan his one liners and erratic behavior makes to an enjoyable performance the one that is held back by the crowded lineup is hawkeye set to be a mindless drone that does lokis bidding for a majority of the film this is a real waste of the talent of jeremy renner the man can act with the best of them and he is assigned to a role that is forgettable the directing style of joss whedon is felt for sure his mannerisms and comedy is felt throughout this film it feels like firefly mixed with buffy whitty dialogue mixed with great action set pieces a must see 
Feb 10 2018,positive,one of the greatest superhero movies ever made this film is undeniably beautiful from the intriguing villain to the iconic assembly of the avengers the music is great with on point acting and a fantastic story one of the strongest mcu movies a well deserved 94
Feb 6 2018,positive,the best thing i have ever seen

Feb 4 2018,positive,nice cast nice plot and overall kind of a funny version of the classic superhero team
Feb 3 2018,positive,one of my favorite mcu movies
Feb 3 2018,positive,this is the best of the avengers movies  the story is excellent joss whedon and the acting is toptier from everyone in the movie
Feb 3 2018,positive,simply one of the best super hero films of all time  must watch action adventure no one does it better then marvel avengers
Feb 2 2018,negative,rubbish who cares fight with gods
Feb 2 2018,positive,this is the film that sold me to mcu forever everything was just perfect acting performances dialogue and especially the visuals not a single badly done cgi scene loki was a good villain they still crack some silly jokes at serious moments but i guess i can live with that since it has always been the marvel formula
Feb 1 2018,positive,a great beginning story for a team of characters with a great story and amazing actors
Jan 26 2018,positive,love love love great story awesome characters and actors and loki need i say more 
Jan 26 2018,positive,after some of marvels previous movie attempts were big set ups for this movie marvel defies all expectations of people saying no way a superhero teamup movie could be successful and become the fifth highest grossing movie of all time well they proved the haters wrong and this movie is what turned marvel into one of the most recognisable studios today marvels the avengers is a movie that succeeds in all ways
Jan 24 2018,positive,probably the best superhero movie ive seen to this day i still get goosebumps from the new york fight scene
Jan 21 2018,negative,maybe i gotta watch this again but i literally couldnt keep my attention on this movie  cast seemed good then i dont know what happened
Jan 20 2018,positive,this was the movie to either make the mcu or destroy it if this was bad the mcu would be finished but if it was good we would be provided movie after movie thankfully it was the latter this was a great movie the movies before it were not the best in fact the only truly great one was iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 and thor just kind of failed captain america first avenger was good but not great the avengers was even better than iron man thankfully it seemed that kevin feige finally understood not to overstuff the movie in this movie there are many different superheroes on the screen at a time but it never feels overstuffed with plot like iron man 2 sure everyone is dealing with something but it never makes the main plot feel insignificant also unlike most of the mcu movies before it this movie has a good villain it brings back loki also this movie is directed by joss whedon who previously directed firefly and buffy the vampire slayer he did a great job the plot of the movie is kind of stupid basically there is a giant beam in the sky and the avengers need to stop it but the movie also is filled with great little moments that make it all better robert downey jr as  iron man is great again chris evans is good fortunately edward norton as the hulk was replaced by mark ruffalo the mcu has done a very good job with replacing actors with even better ones mark ruffalo does a great job chris hemsworth is again alright tom hiddleston as loki is a great villain who is funny but also psychotic scarlett johansson as black widow is a lot better in this movie than in iron man 2 jeremy renner as hawkeye actually has more than five lines now unlike thor so i guess he is better but he is still everyones least favourite avenger samuel l jackson is great as nick fury clark gregg as coulson makes for an emotional thrill ride the whole movie is just amazing the first act is not great but it gets better very fast overall it is a great movie thumbs up
Jan 14 2018,positive,the avengers are getting ready to work as a team to stop loki can they do that and save people find out just a ok movie 
Jan 5 2018,positive,as beginning of the end the avengers is a powerful start less fun than others  maybe but action packed and amazingly well crafted
Dec 31 2017,positive,a movie that soars one of the best marvel movies and thats saying something
Dec 29 2017,positive,this is an amazing film with a future that will strive and never get old plus its incredible cast makes this movie 5 stars
Dec 29 2017,positive,every mcu film raises the bar both in terms of action and special effects and in terms of the probing of what it means to be a human hero  i like that my grandsons enjoy this especially because it gives us shared entertainment and occasionally shared topics about what a hero is
Dec 28 2017,positive,this is how you make a successful movie franchise an all star cast of marvel characters hit the screen in the avengers and pulls it off brilliantly this film offers an action packed yet light on its feet engaging plot with lots of laughs and a great ending  avengers is one of the best of the marvel movies and shows how to do superhero actions films the right way
Dec 28 2017,positive,there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more  the avengers takes an ambitious concept that beautifully pays off bringing together some of marvels most iconic heroes incredible fun and humor throughout in my opinion the greatest comic book movie to date
Dec 25 2017,positive,first and best assemble up to this point no civil war doesnt exceed this not even close a summer flick done right i will rave and defend this one forever
Dec 24 2017,positive,the 2012 avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever with the possible exception of the dark knight  really depends on what you want from your superhero movies  a concept like this shouldnt work but it does and is so satisfying  the interplay between these characters coming together for the first time starts out with them grating against each other but eventually coming together to work well  i dont think you could have gotten a better director to pull this behemoth off than joss whedon who is very accustomed to large ensemble casts of very disparate characters  this was a love letter to the fans a selfcongratulating showcase of an experiment that shouldnt have worked but worked so well that every other studio is trying to find their own franchise universe and a flag planted that nerd culture is on top and is planning to stay there for the forseeable future
Dec 24 2017,positive,lokis plan was terrible the movie was hella fun to watch though marvel has this thing with facelessrobot armies be more creative please
Dec 22 2017,negative,as an adult i cant say this was very enjoyable but if youre a parent this might be a great one for the kids there does seem to be a bit of violence though that may not be suitable depending on strict your guidelines are  couldnt take this film seriously with grown men flying around in capes and costumes and it seems a bit much for a kids film so i have to give this a low rating
Dec 22 2017,positive,a very entertaining popcorn flick for everyone to enjoy funny exciting and plenty of action to keep people coming back for more
Dec 21 2017,positive,for bringing in such big name characters from other movies and putting them together it was pretty well done there were some odd lines of humour that fell flat not crazy about the recasting of mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk but a great cast otherwise pretty cool actions scenes especially at the climax of the film
Dec 21 2017,positive,a great culmination that really pays off
Dec 20 2017,positive,this is the movie that proved that the mcu worked from beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre
Dec 20 2017,positive,i like this movie just fine but i love the second half of it with a passion after the first hour of pretty interesting setup this movie takes off and never lets up for a minute making it incredibly entertaining
Dec 19 2017,positive,after five standalone movies the marvel cinematic universe finally adjoins to have six world war ii norse mythology and modernera superheroes band together to fight alienlooking monsters with an iconic score blaring in the background in other words the first superhero crossover movie is finally here after many movies behind its back this movie is set to make five times the money for too many years now the concept of them banding together was nonexistent there is no question why that scene of them standing in a circle loaded up in the heart of new york ready to fight for humanity was ever so important if you are not sure why that is so meaningful to the audience of the movie you may have not seen the postcredit scenes to every film beforehand particularly iron man and thor as samuel l jackson recruits members to his team  beforehand it would have been clear not to anticipate the film but now we can only thank director joss whedon for creating such a funfilled thriller of a summer blockbuster whedon had previously been known for creating tvs buffy the vampire slayer and can now claim his right to balance largescale projects as a coherent piece having been trusted by such a project though he seems to have forgotten the millions of joker fans counting on him to make this entire film work together and instead saves space for wizard of oz playing cards and asgardian family jokes but the fact this still works makes you only love the film even more  the amount of millions hollywood has spent reintroducing these characters in movies may seem unnecessary it is robert downey jrs character iron man is basically a billionaire techgeek who owns an iron suit chris hemsworths thor and chris evanss captain america are both supersoldiers from nonmodern times who have received the spotlight recently so they dont need standalone movies in fact the central avenger who steals the show in this film has actually not been introduced before at least not with this actor is bruce banner who has rage issues and turns into a green monster known as the hulk  these team members assemble with scarlett johanssons black widow an agent for nick fury and hawkeye an archer for shield portrayed by jeremy renner who just came off of the smashing success of the hurt locker in order to defeat an asgardian known as loki who has come down to invade earth loki is played by tom hiddleston and spends much of the movie demanding humans kneel before him without very dark intentions it is almost a shame that this is the threat the avengers are facing against  as this cast and crew are set into action against this script and threat a macguffintype power cube which tends to always show up in any scifi action movie the avengers begins to follow its earlier themes and genres a buddycop comedy the fighting amongst the members of the avengers in this film actually turns out to be rather refreshing turning twodimensional comic book characters into threedimensional bigscreen superheroes while the script seems to be weak at times it wins itself back through these conversational exchanges  it is the action sequences that truly make this film what it was meant to be while being easy to follow in the process in a beautiful scene shields helicarrier takes off into the air and in a similarly breathtaking action sequence it gets destroyed by lokis forces they then return in the third act as manhattan gets wrecked to pieces in an effort for the world to be saved  the battles won seem reminiscent to our fantasies of superheroes saving us from external threats and avenging our world in outstanding action scenes the films title certainly displays avenging while this is probably not the case the film gives us a breath of fresh air by choosing to go the oldschool light way the nostalgic route the film chooses gives more heart rather than fear and plays well just at that granting comic book fans their dreams even hulk is granted heart as well as anger the audience will feel the same way
Dec 18 2017,positive,marvel studios has managed to do the unthinkable and delivered a kickass movie experience this movie is definitely one of the best works done by marvel full of extraordinary action welltimed humor fleshed out characters with differing ideologies and an actually compelling villain mark ruffalo is fantastic as bruce banner and does a better job of bringing the character to life compared to edward nortons portrayal this is how you do a teamup superhero film
Dec 16 2017,positive,a simple story but a stunning movie
Dec 12 2017,positive,its the avengers its amazeballs appearantly i hadnt rated this now i have
Dec 5 2017,positive,one of the most original superhero films ever made marvel puts all these characters into one movie and delivers great action scenes and a plot that doesnt fail to recruit the members in a logical way great movie and very watchable
Dec 3 2017,positive,great superhero movie just great even tho its got iron man in it clearly the worst avenger but apart from that it was funny great action
Dec 3 2017,positive,the avengers is an amazing movie seeing all these heroes come together after their 5 solo films seeing them interact with each other for the first time is great i loved joss whedons direction here this movie is fun and action packed would recommend to anybody even if they arent a comic book movie fan
Dec 2 2017,positive,the apex of what a superhero story should look and feel like this ensemble film is undeniably entertaining and fun while still exploring themes of loss collaboration and ego
Nov 25 2017,positive,this is a good movie with overall good story characters and relationship building
Nov 24 2017,positive,not taking itself to seriously and therefore allowing for a self aware fun time avengers is about as good as superhero movies should be
Nov 23 2017,positive,this movie has grown on me a lot but theres still something about it that just bores me to death and keeps me from loving it
Nov 22 2017,positive,amazing one of marvels best films
Nov 21 2017,positive,a fun team up movie that for some reason feels very shallow to me i am one of the few who may have liked age of ultron just as much if not more it is still a fun superhero romp and loved downeys performance as well as evans ruffalos toosome classic super hero movie scenes like the puny god and the superhero showdown near first 3rdmiddle of film
Nov 20 2017,positive,the avengers creates a great story combining marvels greatest characters
Nov 19 2017,positive,in a spectacular feat the avengers pulls its iconic franchises together for one of the most grounded funnest and allaround best superhero films ever made
Nov 19 2017,positive,i have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of the best adventure movies ive ever seen its almost impossible to convey how pumped i am now that ive seen it i purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high nothing seems to be able to reach them i usually avoid the hype train whenever possible that said i was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train it couldnt be helped so i was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good im so happy to report just the opposite has happened  the only word i can think of to describe this movie is awesome its amazing work and everything i had hoped for and more its exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure it has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see one of the many things i loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members its not a two dimensional team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho most dont like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played that is great because so many of these characters are larger than life they have egos and the big guns arent used to working with other people or even playing by the rules stark thor and banner all work the other side of the fence so to speak then theres the widow hawkeye and captain america who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure they are all thrown together in a wonderful and best of all believable fashion again more than i ever dreamed possible  the entire cast really delivered you needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts the pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances look i was missing ed norton as much as anyone on that hype train i talked about but im so happy to say that mark ruffalo won me over i hope hes locked up for the long haul because we dont need any more changes three was the lucky number for movie banners every other actor in avnegers that weve seen before is better than their previous incarnation every single one with the possible exception of rdj as stark hes great but its hard to top his take on the character from the original iron man in an ensemble movie i also have to fully disclose that im insanely attracted to scarlett johansson i thought her widow character was amazing but im definitely judging that through rose colored glasses the character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a transformers type popcorn scarfdown  i honestly dont want to give away any of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled its how i saw the movie apart from what the trailers showed and even though youre obviously reading this review read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever experience the awesomeness for yourself avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force im just going to say hulk  thor combination equals awesome and leave it at that this movie defines must see
Nov 19 2017,positive,this movie was fun entertaining but not as good as they say marvel is overhyped 
Nov 18 2017,positive,great movie haha everytime i watch this i laugh my ass off because cap looks ridiculous in his spangley outfit wtf joss haha
Nov 18 2017,positive,the avengers is the culmination of all the past efforts of the mcu and it pays off each actor captivates their character perfectly and have brilliant chemistry with one another the movie also features the triumphant return of the franchises greatest villain which then leads to nearly an entire third act of action special effects and witty humor the avengers is by far the start of an ever growing world that shows no sign of stopping
Nov 11 2017,positive,probably the best marvel movie to date and a great ensemble cast adds a lot to this movie
Nov 9 2017,positive,the avengers is a marvel movie done right
Nov 8 2017,positive,all around great movie
Nov 6 2017,positive,this one takes the cake and i really like this flavor probably the greatest marvel film to ever reach the screen
Nov 4 2017,positive,painfully overrated still fun3amfilmreviews on youtubecom
Nov 4 2017,positive,action packed from start to finish full of laughs and wonderful to finally see everyone come together as a team also mark ruffalo is the perfect banner
Nov 2 2017,positive,marvels the avengers have assembled for people to see      based on marvel comics the avengers has finally hit the theatres with great quality and a excellent plot to keep you on the edge of your seat  the director for this movie is joss whedon with actors robert downey jr tony stark chris evans steve rogers mark ruffalo bruce banner and many other actors        messing with a source of unlimited power the tesseract nick fury samuel l jackson brings forth thors evil bother loki tom hiddleston  now stealing the tesseract he threatens to bring war and destruction unlike the world has ever seen  with no choice fury calls upon a group of heroes to stop loki for completing his plan and save the world from mass destruction       what really drew me into watching this film was the drama that went with this plot also the action that made me wonder what would happen next  them bringing to life the comic that we loved so much to the main screen made me want to see if it would be like the comics we grew up reading or just garbage that people made to boost their rating  as the movie began i was already put into suspense with its beginning dialog and partial clips of an army getting ready for war  trying to bring together a group of superpowered individuals that have never met each other and never worked together can cause turmoil between them and start a fight between them         i think the actors really played their parts well with some slide remarks and being serious when the time came being able to become emotional if something happened and made it look like that they really cared not fake tears that you know they are faking it and dont care  i really felt their struggle through the movie that they had to go through trying to work together as a team and being able to save the world from loki it made me feel like that if one of those characters died i would have become sad because i felt connected to them and i would have felt their pain the special effects in this movie were very excellent with the designs of the helicarrier and with the effects of every power that everyone had  even though that they were effects the actors played though all the stunts and made it look like all the special effects were there and apart of them in any case that they needed to  i feel that even if i didnt know the story beforehand or didnt read the comics the story itself was a thriller in my eyes and pulled me in regardless if i didnt know anything about it       the movie i think was way beyond its time and made a huge excess in all aspects of it i would recommend this movie to anyone that asked me it gave me a thrill of excitement with the action and drama all in one movie it made me never want to look away for a second because of being afraid of missing out on something therefore i think that the movie the avengers have assembled for everyone to see and to be excited for
Oct 31 2017,positive,joss whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up pahse one of the mcu brining all the heroes from previous instalments into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time and he pulled it off flawlessly
Oct 29 2017,positive,the avengers marvel skillfully builds from thier preveious predeccesors to an action packed hollywood piece one that keeps the idenity from their characters and is full of storytelling
Oct 24 2017,positive,the avengers a maniacal marvel ensemble pinata party skip the obvious funness of a solid lineup of charismatic heroes of wellmade solo franchises this is a good flick and not a great movie i hate harping on believeability especially pertaining to scifi movies but there are massive blazing plausibility issues within this story is a meager squadron of slow unstealthy poorly armed aliens flying chariots through a single 100 ft bottleneck over nyc which is located in the united states the largest and most dangerous arsenal in the world really an existential threat to the world security council shield the avengers planet earth thanos  loki must have been high when they cooked up this plan the avengers were equally misguided in showing up for this fight considering the whole problem couldve been solved by a single surfacetoair guided missile battery especially when the enemy can apparently be put down with punches arrows and pistol caliber rounds it wouldnt take stonewall jackson to stop this silly raid
Oct 23 2017,positive,this movie is a great movie and is the best movie i have ever seen
Oct 15 2017,positive,yes yes yes perfection
Oct 13 2017,positive,the best loved how well they handled the characters and their personalities clashing against each other the final battle in new york is breathtaking only surpassed in my opinion by the final battle in its sequel
Oct 13 2017,positive,one of the best superhero movies of all time the avengers lives up to the hype and succeeds is almost every way the acting action and special and practical effects are all superb along with everything else
Oct 7 2017,positive,the perfect superhero movie everything came together in this amazing comic book movie masterpiece
Sep 30 2017,negative,yes its entertaining at first but its ultimately forgetful and a movie for a low iq audience with no thought or meaning
Sep 27 2017,positive,mindblown
Sep 25 2017,neutral,lots of great action and acting but the story had a lot of illogic  kept driving me crazy
Sep 20 2017,positive,this movie is a lot of fun and kicks off what we had been building towards in phase 1 great movie
Sep 16 2017,positive,even as a nearly lifelong comic book fan when marvel studios first announced that they would be producing an avengers film i was skeptical on how it would turn out granted they had just scored a hit with the wonderful first iron man film however since superhero movies until that point had mainly focused on a single character how would marvel flesh out six different heroes within one film flashforward nearly four years later and marvel and joss whedon managed to construct not only one of my favorite installments in the marvel cinematic universe but also one of my top theatergoing experiences of all time i cannot add anything new to all of the praise that has been given to the performances of the leads as they each give it their all however i would like to single out mark ruffalo in his first goaround as dr bruce banner though edward norton gave a capable performance in 2008s the incredible hulk he wasnt necessarily overly memorable in my opinion here though ruffalo truly conveys the pains and struggles experienced by banner in his comingtogrips with being the hulk another positive that somewhat flies under the radar in this effectsdriven film is its action scenes despite such a fantastical concept the action appears believable and is tons of fun to just watch it was the best action in the mcu to date having only been rivaled by 2016s captain america civil war in my book the only weakness here is the invading chitauri army that arrives in the films third act as they are largely an uncharacterizedfaceless opposition however they utilization as an almost endless and unbeatable threat forgives this as they help illustrate the residence of our heroes allinall the avengers not to be missed by any fan as it was the culmination of what the mcu was becoming and the springboard for everything else that was to come
Sep 11 2017,positive,for what it is it is perfect
Sep 10 2017,positive,marvel at there bloody best
Sep 8 2017,negative,audiences and critics loved that the avengers are all white  thank god there are no minorities in the avengers  all sarcasm aside this was such a mediocre movie  a bunch of good guys get together to fight the bad guys and save the world  never seen that before  predictably the good guys dont get along at first but they eventually come together to defend earth from some seriously bland and generic aliens who arent intimidating at all   coulsons death was supposed to be a pivotal moment in the film but absolutely no one cared about him so that just totally fell flat  tom hiddleston gave a very limpwristed performance as loki  apparently he reasoned that loki sounds like lowkey so why not play the character that way  the action sequences were all lackluster  like all the other pg13 comic book movies the fights are all sanitized of blood gore and anything that would be too violent  therefore the fight scenes all suck  but hey at least the avengers are all white am i right
Sep 7 2017,positive,to this day i still enjoy watching this movie all of the heroes have good pieces for each of them
Sep 6 2017,positive,ill give the avengers an a a 1010 five stars  evertthing im not a marvel fanboy i like marvel very much much more than dc but theres just something about this incredible franchise and universe joss whedon knew what he was doing the avengers might be the best marvel movie ever at least from the walt disney era i mean couldnt we get better than this this movie shows us how a blockbuster should be how a superhero movie should be done the action and the cgi are fundamental of course but while we have these amazing characters dialogues music choices and conflicts well be satisfied
Sep 5 2017,positive,the avengers is one example of how to make a perfect crossover movie not too all references and easter eggs were merged into this film they are tied up every connection interconnection even the little detail they show it and display it into one movie each of the shot the visual effect and the performance are quite brilliant except the script that doesnt kick too much the avengers is like an orgasm of each of the nerdiness everyone who watched this film both marvels loyal fans the comic books fans the moviegoers or even those who watched it from iron man would experience an orgasm of a nerd what a great job by joss whedon
Sep 2 2017,positive,marvel finally mad a movie with all of the avengers where they meet each other they must face loki that would be thors brother now its time for captain to give orders to the avengers if they want to win see this movie remember they made avengers 2
Aug 30 2017,positive,i thought avengers was a good one the action and adventure is good it is a good one in the avengers franchise
Aug 28 2017,positive,most likely the greatest superhero movie of all time
Aug 15 2017,positive,despite arriving at a very early start for the mcu the avengers mark a point and separate for the modern era of cinema the effects performances and the excitement of seeing the most important heroes of marvel make us enjoy more than 2 hours of footage as if to read a comic is about
Aug 12 2017,positive,this is a really great movie
Aug 8 2017,positive,standard formulaic superhero movie it delivered on its promise for action comic relief and heroics
Aug 7 2017,positive,great story action cgi and fantastic villian this is my favorite comic book genre film all time
Aug 6 2017,positive,the action was great even though there was some down time  long but didnt seem too long
Aug 5 2017,positive,do you know the saying know your audience joss weadon really gave the fans everything theyve ever wanted in the first marvel team up
Aug 2 2017,positive,first off where the heck did loki come from i really enjoyed the opening title music i like the scene where they recruit captain america to the avengers i liked how they cut from hero to hero in the recruiting process in the beginning giving us a glimpse at what each hero was up to during their break i like how cap stays old fashioned captain america and iron man coming together and meeting for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at civil war the writers did a good job showing how they have to have altercations before they come together and they finally come together after a well needed push phil coulsons death one of the best scenes in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the avengers as they come together before war also i really enjoyed when it cut seamlessly from avenger to avenger each fighting their individual battles in the war great ending to the end of mcu phase 1 i love marvel because it combines the world we all know with that of a fictional universe to aid our imaginations in creating fantasies about a combination of these universes where anything is possible  in the midcredits scene the other speaks to his master undoubtedly thanos about the failed attack on earth in the end credit scene the avenger are eating shawarma  stan lee makes his appearance in a short news interviews saying superheroes in new york give me a break  stone tracker the tesseract is used by loki in this film and now is in the hands of the asgardians it is known as the space stone
Aug 1 2017,positive,if i had to describe it with one word it would be masterpiece
Jul 26 2017,positive,its just that the best super hero movie to date
Jul 20 2017,positive,pretty much all of it is good or amazing nothing bad or horrible the one down side is captain americas outfit looks ugly which is a shame since he is my favorite hero
Jul 20 2017,positive,the avengers is the movie that all the marvel movies have been leading up to and it lives up to the hype i would give it a 93 because there is almost nothing wrong with it only a couple of minor details is there to complain about each of the characters are done so well and the story is just as interesting if you have been living up to the hype in the past movies you have to see this movie
Jul 20 2017,positive,the best marvel cinematic universe movie ever it has everything to make a comic book die hard fan love it has a good storygreat character interactiongood direction and a great soundtrack thank you josh whedon
Jul 20 2017,positive,a brilliant film just seeing all the characters interact with each other is well written the action scenes are incredible and loki is a great motivational villain
Jul 16 2017,positive,i really enjoyed it a satisfying end to the beginning
Jul 14 2017,positive,the avengers is packed to the gills with action  to the gills
Jul 13 2017,positive,a childhood dream becoming true
Jul 13 2017,positive,probably still the best comic book movie of all time  thanks joss
Jul 12 2017,positive,top 3 or 4 marvel movies
Jul 11 2017,negative,bad film like the rest of the marvel universe
Jul 9 2017,positive,the best superhero movie of all time
Jul 9 2017,positive,oh yes phase one of the mcu goes out with one of the greatest movies of all time
Jul 9 2017,positive,its great fun  a star studded cast thats clearly having a blast making this movie  but i do think its a bit overhyped  you know exactly how the movie will play out before you see it and i didnt find the exploration of the characters to be as satisfying as i would have liked
Jul 8 2017,negative,this is their best its still childish comic book nonsense even though i admit ive enjoyed the ironman movies
Jul 8 2017,positive,loved it lots of amazing and intense action
Jul 1 2017,positive,a marvelous and outstanding movie  the avengers stands to be one of marvels greatest achievements
Jul 1 2017,positive,amazing chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo  jeremy renner scarlett johansson and robert downey jr were amazing
Jul 1 2017,positive,for marvel it is probably its best effort in superhero films if you like what familyoriented standardized blockbusters are all about
Jun 30 2017,negative,i didnt think the avengers movies can get any worse than the first one but it succeeded in that whoever writes these movies needs to pick up a freaking comic book and read it all it is is special effects and with bad writing with bad acting hollywood you need to stop making bad comic book movies and start making some decent ones therefore i give this movie a f
Jun 25 2017,positive,9510  ambitious well acted and exciting the avengers is a breakthrough in blockbuster filmmaking
Jun 24 2017,positive,its funny thoughtful but also colorfully chaotic the avengers is that perfect supersized teamup feature that benefits from years of buildup
Jun 17 2017,positive,the avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for marvel at the movies
Jun 14 2017,positive,loved the moviegood job marvel
Jun 11 2017,positive,seeing all these characters come together for the first time is great and the cast works really well together loki and the villain was great as well i had a lot of fun watching this film it is one of the best superhero films  9210
Jun 7 2017,positive,this movie lived up to the hype
May 31 2017,positive,this film definitely lives up to the hype the writing shows improvement since previous marvel studios films making the dialogue purposeful and the oneliners are actually funny and not overly cheesy the choreography in the fight scenes is perfect with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers the cgi and visual effects are incredible speaking of which the hulks character model is improved as well making him more realistic looking and actually resembling mark ruffalo who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of bruce banner thor and captain america seem to fit better as side characters in this film and the interactions between them and iron man are full of chemistry robert downey jr is on point as usual black widows character is improved with scarlett johansson showing some emotional depth tom hiddleston shines as loki delivering a theatrical performance that comes off cunning and sinister this film raised the bar for what marvel studios is capable of
May 31 2017,positive,in the avengers marvel pulls off what noone thought they could they assembled the avengers on the big screen all five movies leadup movies culminate in this groundbreaking film that actually works on nearly every level and leaves you wanting more
May 30 2017,positive,the avengers is an almost perfect film that gives every single character their time to shine a
May 27 2017,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen i cant say more
May 24 2017,positive,the avengers is an amazing movie that has almost everything it has action good acting good cinematography and good wit overall it is a definite recommendation of mine
May 23 2017,positive,the avengers was directed by joss whedon and stars roberty downey jr chris evans and tom hiddlestickshiddleston if it actually bothers you its the end result of 5 previous movies combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the marvel cinematic universe when a charming likable british villain tries to attack earth with his giant disposable cgi space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one and thus we have a cinematic universe thanks feige your brilliance had doomed us all  the avengers is one of the most likable enjoyable fun actionsuperhero movies thats ever been released and redefined a genre without this movie all the cinematic universes we have today wouldnt existthe debate on whether thats good or not is still open and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted dont watch this movie expecting the dark knight or xmen because this movie centres fun as its 1 goal and excels at it all the cast is likable the action is fun and it is overall just a great big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life  as much as i praise this movie it does have some flaws the main flaw is the dull generic and cliché ridden story which is just really poorly written it follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have no stakes in marvel movies i will also say the ending should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so i would definitely say it should have been handled better the end credits sequences are gold though  robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and is easily the best part of the mcu on the flip side of this i will say that i was very disappointed in chris evans captain america and i think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch i understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human hiddlesticks was phenomenal as loki and remains as easily the best mcu villain hes smart hes charming and most importantly hes british that must be a requirement on entry to the super villain squad because every villain in the universe is britishor at least the good ones are scarlett johanson was good as black widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye she may not be a critical member of the team but shes a female and yay for diversity mark ruffallo was great as bruce banner and i adore how he refers to his alter ego as the other guy jeremy renner was fine as hawkeye and remains the most useful avenger with his sick archery skills seriously though he doesnt need to exist chris hemsworth was good as thor but not particularly memorable samuel jackson is great as nick fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold  the cinematography for this movie is great and i adore the tracking shots whedon uses in the action and i think it benefits the action so much whedon can do action supremely well the effects are amazing and are a delight to look at the costume design was great and the set design was also really good  this movie needed to provide some fun action sequences be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans i can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them as for the third one i cant comment but i will assume they were happy  in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch if you havent seen this movie i highly recommend you do because it is pure adrenaline filled enjoyment  910
May 19 2017,positive,i love this movie the characters are awesome the action scenes are well done and the visuals are breathtaking
May 18 2017,positive,perhaps the best superhero movie as a whole  i cannot think of any problems with this movie  everyone makes decent appearance and 220 movie duration is great and it is never boring
May 18 2017,positive,one of the greatest super hero movies of all time
May 14 2017,positive,thrilling actionpacked and with the synergy of a well balanced cast the avengers is an excellent film that exceeded all expectations and paves the way for a new wave of hopefully marvel excellence
May 14 2017,positive,despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie the avengers is still a ton of fun it really was a risk trying to make this movie happen and it really payed off  i still preferred the dark knight rises and the amazing spiderman when it comes to superhero movies of 2012 but i still think this film kicks ass   910
May 3 2017,positive,another amazing marvel movie
Apr 28 2017,positive,this film is a spectacle that leaves us dazzled the first time and entertained atmost with repeated viewings the cast most notably johansson hiddleston and newcomer mark ruffalo are the highlights of this film and are accompanied by great humour and entertaining action sequences however there is littletono plot to the film and is really only a bunch of action sequences and quippy dialogue strung together to make an entertaining popcorn flick
Apr 19 2017,positive,best comics book movie period a
Apr 14 2017,positive,funny thrilling smart actionpacked and very cool to see great performances and marvel smashing action even a few funny moments too
Apr 1 2017,positive,a bit too crazy and didnt live up to my expectations as much it was great but could have been better
Mar 28 2017,positive,greatest super hero movie ever dont fight me on this
Mar 25 2017,positive,grand giant and perfectly connected movie instead of age of ultron whereby there is a lack of connection just second to iron man 1 not easy to top
Mar 24 2017,positive,watching this movie multiple times may have dented my appreciation for how good it actually is the characters all feel like they get their own part of the film and not overshadowed by the others some genuine laugh out loud moments and good relationships established between these characters maybe this was the time when a big swirling thing in the sky was a good way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale
Mar 23 2017,negative,i kind of remember this movie but none of it was any good long and boring
Mar 20 2017,positive,although not the first super hero team up  but still this movie was better than xmen 1 and this also had great sense of humor and great performances by the actors
Mar 18 2017,positive,incomparable with other blockbuster hits such as the dark knight or spiderman 2 due to its join up of other mcu characters therefore comparing to the other join up of hero movies the avengers is down as the greatest of all time in my book this is what marvel was building up in the mcu and they showed up  my score 99
Mar 8 2017,positive,although at the time it was nice seeing a number of superheroes in a single film for the very first time the enjoyment wears off rather quick and the avengers isnt all that entertaining
Mar 7 2017,positive,one of my favourite movies of all time marvel pulled off what many thought couldnt be done  just a fantastic film through and through  though this isnt the longest review i have done it is just i could go on for a very long time about how awesome this film is acting action everything is very very good  95
Mar 6 2017,positive,a fun romp but dont expect anything more
Mar 4 2017,negative,fabulous production of a mishmash of heroes where the villain has to be top otherwise why call all of them superman spiderman batman are missing probably because they work for another government or franchise i thought that was a bit much in comic book form and i agree with myself in film form its already a stretch to live in one superhero world mixing them make it so preposterous its like drinking wine and milk at the same time and that is for two add cognac cranberry juice and tea and i feel like puking a marvel of special effects though much too much

Mar 2 2017,positive,this was a good movie
Feb 26 2017,positive,the avengers makes the best of whats come before and presents us with an epic comic book movie with welldeveloped characters glorious combat and a worthy villain the little character moments in between give this film a lighthearted tone
Feb 23 2017,positive,doesnt hold up and is somewhat a struggle to get through
Feb 21 2017,positive,a vast cheesy pizza very loud very long making little sense and with some very earnest and stiff acting if only writerdirector joss whedon had been less indulgent the whole thing would have been twice as much fun having said which its fine and exactly what any teenager would expect
Feb 14 2017,positive,fun lighthearted creative wellthought and overall a great superhero film they have been setting up for this since 2008 with the release of iron man and the final product of the set up turns out to be a great film this is going to be a classic in the near future great example that you can make a comicbook accurate movie with great storytelling and designs
Feb 3 2017,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time its one of those movies where you dont have to know a lot about the characters history to understand the movie the actors do a good job with the characters especially mark ruffalo as the hulk with its gripping plot and talented cast the first avengers movie definitely set the tone for mcu
Feb 1 2017,negative,superb acting costume design sets etc unfortunately for me my eyes could not stay open
Jan 28 2017,positive,fun hilarious and action filled film paced to perfection and story that has you engaged from beginning to end
Jan 25 2017,positive,very enjoyable the avengers are not my favorite but this was awesome
Jan 23 2017,positive,a little too corny for me too many lame jokes but solid movie
Jan 18 2017,positive,this movie just doesnt hold up to repeat viewing lot of noisy action a few jokes that work the first time a character death that is later reversed and worst of all a silly argument that somehow leaves the high tech shield base undefended the three stars is for the fun of the first viewing
Jan 7 2017,positive,this is a great movie it has a great storyline and great action scenes loved it
Jan 6 2017,positive,easily one of the best superhero movies of all time
Jan 1 2017,positive,did the avengers deliver yes but it also gave us a fun ramped up experience with much to love about these character portrayals who we have seenmark ruffalo as hulk is the only changed choice who is still great tom hiddleston delivers his signature move as loki the action is guys tossing each otherin a good way and we also got funny moments the plot holes may have sometimes bothered mebut not totally we still havent gotten to my favorite mcu moviecan you guess but this is possibly 3 or 4i hope you love this blockbuster
Dec 21 2016,positive,so amazing im not huge on super hero films but i really enjoyed this also hulk is the best
Dec 15 2016,positive,avengers is a cinematic block busters experince  aggregating all the previous marvel movies and turning it into a massive grandious movie making both fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material
Dec 14 2016,positive,the first assemble of the avengers is groundbreaking but has its faults
Dec 7 2016,positive,amazing that joss got this to work and it rocks lol
Dec 4 2016,positive,fun but lets be honest it doesnt make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action
Dec 2 2016,positive,the avengers was my favorite superhero movie at the time it came out but at that time i havent seen the dark knight the film was new at the time but  now that weve gotten the same thing over and over again its not a masterpiece anymore the actually battle at the end is great but the rest of the buildup is boring and takes way too long to set up each character instead having the audience watch the previous marvel films instead of being an asshole to the fans   owens grade b
Nov 30 2016,positive,entertaining a total crowdpleaser and everybody is clearly having a good time but the whole affair is directed like a television show and whedons ideas can never overcome the framework the studio has placed the story in
Nov 30 2016,positive,still my favorite marvel movie the action plot acting and set pieces are just magnificent and welldone highly recommend if you havent seen it yet
Nov 23 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies
Nov 22 2016,negative,i h8 how batmman is not here 
Nov 12 2016,positive,i suppose when youre juggling so many good guys the bad guys become an afterthought outside of loki this was very much cannonfodder bad guys again but the balance between the avengers was so well done you almost dont notice
Nov 12 2016,positive,what an incredible movie an amazing cast who all give great performances wonderful special effects a good score and a truly amazing story the avengers set the bar for super hero films while doing something never really done before a multi character crossoverthat worked bringing together 5 films of mythos this movie accomplished the impossible bringing the heroes from each film together and making them work in an action packed suspenseful terrific film
Nov 8 2016,positive,greatest superhero film of all time nuff said

Oct 5 2016,positive,this movie is great its funny its action packed and when it needs to be serious it handles being serious very well
Sep 26 2016,positive,the avengers is so amazing its everything i wanted it to be and more avengers is a really great movie this is the best marvel movie the avengers is a masterpiece the storywritingdirectingscript are great the charactersacting and dialogue are great the action is amazing the visual effects are amazing the soundtrack is great its just perfect this is the best summer movie its so fun but there are problems the first 5 minutes arent that good but were alright the action scene saved it and the last problem with the movie is that its not the movie that you could rewatch but it works fine but besides that the movie is great its very entertaining very fun and everyone who has seen the movie loves it even i love it
Sep 24 2016,positive,the payoff after years of waiting for iron man cap thor hulk widow and hawkeye to join forces if you didnt like it the 5 seconds of hulk smash puny god makes this a unique movie that no other character or director could have pulled off highly enjoyable
Sep 21 2016,positive,fun and actionpacked
Sep 17 2016,positive,this movie was not only great on first watching but it keeps bringing me back to view my favorite clips and sections the characterization is what really drives the movie yes the cgi work is very good and the musical score is excellent but its the little details that make the characters feel real and involved that bring you along for the ride one of my favorite tiny moments is the i donti dont see how thats a party line from black widow in that one line were given a brief reminder that this is a very skilled human used to fighting very skilled human spies whos now fighting aliens and monsters of epic proportions without the benefit of the near invulnerability of the superpowered individuals around her other brief favorites the moped hulksmash puny god  im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that so many great moments that tie things together
Sep 8 2016,positive,as a big marvel fan this will probably be a bit biased but i absolutely loved this movie this was the movie that really got me into the marvel franchise with its great special effects and even greater performances from some of the best thespians in the business the fact that it was also the first multisuperhero movie was the cherry on the cake for me i also appreciated the humor scattered throughout that lightened the mood just enough
Sep 8 2016,positive,how nostalgic can it get
Sep 5 2016,positive,the movie event of our generation has some flaws but is some of the most fun youll have at the movies
Sep 4 2016,positive,the ultimate comic book movie better than dark knight in my eyes it was funny the villain is great and its the definition of fun
Sep 4 2016,positive,tested the limits of how many superheros can be in one film without combusting and it passed with flying colors
Sep 3 2016,positive,the avengers is considerably overrated when it is claimed as the greatest superhero movie ever its praised for being smartly thought out and having verve and precision with its execution but in reality its not all that clever or even that great it is asserted to be the avengers is a key example of style over substance it possesses idealistic action sequence that are stunning to behold but its overall writing interpretation  which is the most important aspect  feels wooden and dull however it created a pleasurable experience for me at the movie theater as its level of enjoyability was at the peak of the mountain
Aug 31 2016,positive,i think the ratings should be higher than 92 but thats my opinion you have to remember that this movie came out with so much hype and it definitely delivered in my book not quite 5 stars but 45 stars is about right
Aug 28 2016,positive,tracking shot everyone who worked on this movie needs a tshirt that says i piss excellence
Aug 27 2016,positive,not what i was expecting at all i honestly wasnt expecting such immense troubles forming the avengers but after they were formed after overcoming their differences they were simply e p i c the ending fightaction scene was amazing and i enjoyed it very much the powerful team that they formed was terrific and the way they demolished the opposition and style of writing and witty humour made this film worthwhile to watch after all this was a very anticipated film when it came out 7 years ago in 2012 
Aug 26 2016,positive,really good with they had hulk from 2008
Aug 21 2016,positive,visually dazzling actionpacked and even packed with humour to lighten the mood a little the avengers is not only an amazing conclusion to phase one of the mcu but it is also one of the best marvel films to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun in the highestgrossing film of 2012
Aug 17 2016,positive,spectacular special effects to go along with an amazing cast the avengers delivers on essentially every level to provide an engaging story with likable distinguishable characters
Aug 13 2016,positive,marvels the avengers will be forever known for raising the bar of superhero films to unprecedented levels its also one of the most fun times youll have watching a movie
Aug 10 2016,positive,tom hiddleston and robert downey jr simply carry this movie that do not have much to hold it down the special effects are flawless the script is ingenious and the performances fit the whole perfectly
Aug 10 2016,positive,the generic wipeout ending for the chitauri perhaps should of had the technologicalbiological spaceheadquarters merely render there weapons and gadgets useless rather than the default death they received
Aug 9 2016,positive,its literally a comic book come to life and by that i mean one of the great all time comic stories it has everything you want and much much more whedon shows not only his writing genius but his genuine love for the genre bringing comic fans and civilians alike into his cinematic masterpiece quite literally the star wars of superhero movies
Aug 8 2016,positive,there may never be another film moment like the avengers together defending new york city and its wrapped inside an intricate story with complexity and heart
Aug 8 2016,positive,an epicmarvelloushumorousmeaningfulspectacular movie this is the movie we deservethis is the best in the mcu and bringing out the avengers together was done in an outstanding way
Aug 7 2016,positive,if you like iron man youll like this movie if you like thor youll like this movie if you like hulk you will like this movie overall you will love this film
Aug 7 2016,positive,one of the best superhero films to date with great chemistry between the casts worth a watch for any superhero fan
Aug 5 2016,positive,not as good as the critics said  but a good action movie  4 stars
Aug 4 2016,positive,superhero team movie done right whedon makes even the most fantastical conversation sound real and natural and weaves it organically into an action blockbuster
Aug 4 2016,positive,best movie of all time
Aug 3 2016,negative,overrated first half is dragging and boring some action scenes are recycled from buffy the vampire slayer and superman returns marvels 2nd choice actress scarlett as black widow is pathetic she lacks the athetlicism and physique to pull off black widow marvel shouldve made it work with emily blunt
Aug 3 2016,negative,cookie cutter story recycled themes and characters from previous marvel films weak new characters annoying old characters all with a climatic fight against generic forgettable alien robots do yourself a favor and never see this waste of film
Aug 3 2016,positive,marvels the avengers is that one awesome superhero movie that gives a lot of action and storytelling to characters that have been building up for the past 5 movies
Aug 2 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen sure it might be ever so slightly dated at this point but the reason its so iconic is because it revolutionized hollywood for better or worse the avengers and films like the dark knight segmented their place in comic book movie history
Jul 31 2016,positive,i liked it a lot there was lots of awesome action and comedy
Jul 26 2016,positive,this movie brings the most famous avengers of the marvel comics to on screen which lives up to the hype of the movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes
Jul 25 2016,positive,avengers is an unbelievable action film
Jul 25 2016,positive,avengers assemble this is an instant classic and it sure does deliver
Jul 17 2016,positive,not bad at all there hollywood
Jul 14 2016,positive,fantastically fun way to launch the superhero ensemble idea i loved the way starks ego centric nature just runs away with it as the others find their ground around him best thing in the whole thing is loki ofcourse still marvels best vilian such a fun character and hiddleston clearly is having a ball set the bar and showed if you approach it right a multi character super hero film can work
Jul 13 2016,positive,in the summer of 2012 i saw this movie 5 times in the cinema with my friends
Jul 10 2016,positive,55  even better that i could have hoped for
Jul 10 2016,positive,the avengers is a fun action packed movie with great characters and a good story all of the heroes must come together to fight off the destruction of earth loki is a great villain again despite the fact this film must find a way to balance so many larger than life characters it still manages to be a great film
Jul 10 2016,positive,with the mcu becoming more and more seasoned with its films i feel that none of it can compare to the very zenith of the franchise the avengers this film was a masterpiece of action that saw one of the alltime great movie villains impressive set pieces tied  together by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what it means to be a true hero
Jul 10 2016,positive,a decent enough film to hold the attention and entertain much more enjoyable having seen the preceding marvel films
Jul 3 2016,positive,the best movie ever
Jul 1 2016,positive,marvels the avengers is actionpacked and entertaining marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in one great battle this movie couldnt be more perfect i would very much suggest this movie
Jun 30 2016,positive,an enjoyable film you wont want to miss
Jun 28 2016,positive,the humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most entertaining parts giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a giant hole in the sky provided targets for the superheroes display of fire power and muscle team work is good but in the end only ironman must take the prize to save the day
Jun 25 2016,positive,i was left expecting more from an ensemble cast of characters that mostly had their own movies  i mean shouldnt they have had ample time to practice and prepare  the pacing was also a little janky
Jun 23 2016,positive,redefined modern cinema in such a great way amazing movie nothing more can be said
Jun 23 2016,positive,the avengers is basically everything youd want it to be dazzling special effects supercharged action delicious dialogues an excellent sense of humour that borders on witty selfparody and at the heart of all this a bunch of individually interesting superheroes who despite their personality clashes eventually manage to pull off some tremendously glorious team work whedon and co go for it from the first second up until the last and set a prime example for grand superhero flicks
Jun 22 2016,negative,mismatched abilities
Jun 20 2016,positive,one of the best avengers movie better than age of ultron
Jun 12 2016,positive,this  movie is what youd think itd be like awesome and kick ass the movie is filled to the brim with action clever humor and one liners that in the end each play beautifully of eachother the only problem i have with the movie however is its plot isnt really the best nor memorable but its way overshadowed by everything else in this movie that thankfully makes it one hell of a ride that you can watch ovar and over and over again
Jun 11 2016,positive,big battles lots of heros enough said
Jun 9 2016,positive,possibly the very definition of a comic book movie the avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that pays off in every way probably the best decision they made in this movie was to recast edward norton as hulk ruffalo blows him out of the water and then some as the green giant
Jun 8 2016,positive,my 3rd favorite mcu movie this casteffectsits so much to handle this movie got mcu on the the map
Jun 7 2016,positive,good story liked when the avengers formed
Jun 7 2016,positive,the thirdbest mcu movie the avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that all pays off we got seriously lucky that this film was as good as it was when i first saw this in theaters my immediate thought was lets see that again its only gotten better with each viewing
Jun 6 2016,positive,i love this movie but black widow could have been better
Jun 5 2016,positive,marvel studios i love u best movie studio in hollywood if people didnt love this something is wrong with them this has to be one of the greatest movies of all time
May 28 2016,positive,this movie is great the avengers are assembled
May 27 2016,positive,94     the avengers is more proof that marvel always delivers and this movie set a new standard for superhero films it is as fun to watch as are the characters and is action packed at times funny and united the team of asskickers with brilliant results
May 25 2016,positive,a film with every chance to fail on every step in bringing earths mightest heroes together on screen surprisingly shows nice balance and dinamics
May 25 2016,positive,one word awesome my 2nd best marvel movie i admit it is a little overrated but the positives are stronger than the negatives for this movie its actionpacked funny and convincing it didnt feel overstuffed at all definitely worth the wait and hype i watched it maybe like 4 times now and still aint bored of it  overall score 910 amazing as a fan of superhero movies id probably rate this a 1010 but from a filmmaking  casual movie goers perspective meaning realistic ill stick with a 910 highly recommended for everyone to watch
May 24 2016,negative,visually it is a marvel pardon the pun but it feels generic and flimsy
May 22 2016,positive,before civil war came out his was my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done
May 18 2016,positive,the avengers is no doubt the best avengers movie and is very close to the best marvel movie and the best comic book movie has all the elements required for a box office success and a movie to make the mainstream audience happy the comic book fans and the mcu fans
May 17 2016,positive,perfect in every way
May 17 2016,positive,marvel set up years of crafting the avengers and building a unique and vastly more dangerous universe than ours and joss whedon helms this behemoth of a film to continually stun and amaze audiences around the globe that something based on comic books can be dealt upon and you can make modern masterpieces from them albeit the film is not perfect but so are our heroes who actually do care for people and they think and work together to keep the world safe once again with solid performances a deceptively amusing villain groupsized action against a seemingly unstoppable horde of baddies and morethe avengers is pure definition of marvelous
May 16 2016,positive,an amazing film that changed comic book films forever
May 14 2016,positive,marvelous in every way marvels avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the if not the greatest superhero movies of all time
May 14 2016,positive,witty and brilliant the avengers has been built up by marvel since the marvel cinematic universe began in 2008 and will continue to amaze viewers for decades to come this is a movie any comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see
May 12 2016,positive,it was so cool cant wait for the next movie
May 11 2016,positive,finally its here this film was absolutely everything i wanted the superhero chemistry was spot on terrific perfect plot and end to phase one the avengers are now assembled and cant wait for phase two
May 10 2016,positive,pat kiernan along with many other reporters discussed the avengers and the battle of new york and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared
May 9 2016,negative,it was dumb no real plot except for iorn man having bad days
May 9 2016,positive,have you ever felt like solo films like superman and batman solo films are getting old if so marvels the avengers is the movie for you director joss whedon unlocks the future of superhero team ups like batman vs superman
May 8 2016,positive,fun film but loki doesnt make that great of a villain for this super hero squad
May 8 2016,positive,theres no arguing that this was the best marvel movie up until this point  and up until captain america civil war happened with surprisingly decent acting from the entire cast it may not be the revolution in superhero film which was the dark knight but nonetheless tries its best and still produces a very good movie for everyone to enjoy verdict a
May 6 2016,positive,the avengers is very exhilarating in action and definitely amazement from the solo movies of iron man captain america hulk and thor the avengers plays a huge part in the mcu 95
May 5 2016,positive,i still get goosebumps when it does a circle shot of all the avengers
May 5 2016,positive,an almost perfect superhero movie
May 3 2016,positive,marvels the avengers is a great movie that will statisfy comic book movie fans it has great action and outstanding acting from an ensemble cast though there are many characters the film does a good job at juggling each role  rating 95
May 3 2016,positive,well balanced action and character development starks sarcifice emotionally worth it decent amount of each character plot as well as pure entertainment time
May 1 2016,positive,you can say that this is the best crossover in the history of super hero movies aaaaand youre god damn right  ecit 07052016  civil war just beat it sooo its the second best croosover
May 1 2016,positive,when it comes to movies the avengers is the best one out there its funny dark fun and still an epic action movie i dont know how avengers age of ultron will top this but if it does im going to cry with tears of joy so if your looking for a good action movie comedy or superhero movie the avengers will do all that and more
Apr 30 2016,positive,excellent good writing and  strong story lines just workwould have been good even without the fx
Apr 30 2016,positive,overall grade a 96 notes the response team is finally here and marvel studios is finally making marvels again
Apr 29 2016,positive,fantasticly fun way to launch the superhero ensemble idea i loved the way starks ego centric nature just runs away with it as the others find their ground around him best thing in the whole thing is loki such a fun character and hiddleston clearly is having a ball
Apr 28 2016,positive,the avengers was so much fun and marvel absolutely nailed it let me explain what i loved  positives 1 the characters this is a no brainer without these awesome characters this film would be nothing they honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome there are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film  2 the villain loki in my opinion is the best villain of the mcu he has motivation you understand and his rivalry with thor is mesmerizing tom hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie  3 the action all of the action is done well there is quite a lot of cgi but it doesnt get in the way of the film and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them if these characters hadnt been characterized properly and it didnt have a well made story then this film wouldve probably turned out like a transformers movie thankfully that was not the case and all the action was awesome  overall i have no cons with this film that i can think of the avengers is one of the best comic book films ive ever seen it is by far one of the best things marvel has ever done and it was one of the most fun ive had watching a movie even if you arent a comic book fan i guarantee you will enjoy this film dont go into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like transformers this film is a lot more deep than that
Apr 28 2016,positive,joss whedon did an amazing job bringing iron man thor the hulk and captain america together the final battle does a masterful job bringing the team together a phenomenal end to phase 1
Apr 26 2016,negative,ah the avengers how i hate this movie it is overrated and overpopular beyond words and has nothing which makes a film great the only things it has are good special effects and a nice soundtrack  factors which are only superficial in nature and cannot make anything good its story is filled with plotholes and characterization and character development is below subpar the story doesnt even try to explore any themes and the whole thing is just one huge galore of special effects  on the other hand there are good films of the same genre such as the dark knight and the incredibles which do not receive the same fame and popularity such as this one despite the fact that they are far better in terms of storytelling characterization theme exploration and have far more innovation the avengers on the other hand has zero innovation and its story is full of plot holes  the visual section deserves a perfect score as that is the only thing about the movie which is good the explosions spaceships villains weapons iron mans suit everything looks realistic and wonderful of course that is to be expected with the technology of today the sound section is also nothing to complain about the sound amplifies the action and makes one excited about it other than that i found it quite forgettable the acting is decent robert downey jr as always speaks as fast as a cheetah runs which is why people who are not so great at english may need subtitles not that the things he is saying is deep or meaningful  now that ive finished with the good parts of the movie i can now explain why the story and characters are st i have already said that the story has zero innovation and is totally formulaic the story is about the trademark superheroes fighting a villain bent on conquering the world with the power of a magical object so original right the heroes find the villain who separates them but they come back together almost immediately and fight the villain and his huge army in a large metropolitan city   even if you have not seen the movie you should be able to tell how the movie is going to end of course our heroes are going to win and our villains are going to lose as mentioned earlier there are a large number of plot holes and plot conveniences those who havent seen the movie may skip this although i dont know why you would want to after all the movie was released four years ago  ill begin with the most obvious why was banner able to transform into hulk if he is always angry as he says he is why isnt he constantly in the hulk form also he got angry earlier in the movie due to which he turned into hulk totally not a plot convenience  why do the avengers start fighting just because shield is making weapons using the tesseract in fact seeing all the extraterrestrial things in this world that is the only logical thing to do thats no reason to fight they should instead be looking for it and helping shield create the weapons why didnt loki run away when thor and iron man were fighting each other scrap that why didnt he fight iron man and captain america together dont tell me it was his plan to get captured first of all thats directly taken out of the dark knight and secondly the plan was flawed dont tell me he made that sty plan in ten seconds          where are spiderman fantastic four deadpool daredevil and most of all the xmen at least they couldve given a one line explanation on this why didnt they bring the xmen they were fighting an extraterrestrial war for gods sake you dont send six soldiers into a war not even when one of them is a god even magneto would probably help them if loki really wanted to take over the world why didnt he just hypnotize all the important people eg the president of america as well as all the avengers to do his bidding he couldve taken over the world in an instant after the invasion in a post credits scene the avengers  are seen together in a shawarma stall eating wtf an extraterrestrial invasion just happened and a shawarma stall is still open and serving its customers i know that was just for comedy but seriously wtf the villains are defeated the invasion is over and nick fury gives the tesseract and the villainloki to thor to take to asgard for imprisonment its a very strange thing that there are no protestors on the road protesting to kill loki in earth itself nobody has done anything to the avengers to make them compensate for the losses done to new york city because of them how is that possible there should be a mob below the stark building demanding the death of iron man   and this movie was nominated for best writing in a particular award ceremony in fact one whole hour was spent in pointless battles and the destruction of a major city where only the ending mattered the ending was a total cop out which saw the death of an entire army due the destruction of a single spaceship why because the movie has to end sometime thats why   now that ive established how bad the story is i will talk about the characters it may seem that the movie has no need of character introduction and development as each character has a movie of its own this is partly true however the characters are still not developed the avengers include  a billionaire who fights in iron suit a god a soldier from the times of world war ii and a scientist which can go super saiyan an becoming angry how relatable  in each of their respective movies they have to fight a villain having similar powers as them yes they have similar powers while building their romance with girl x they do not face any other problem such as getting divorced going bankrupt etc any such problem will only be a backdrop the end of the movie will see the villain defeated  the hero victorious and the hero and the girl in a strong relationship the hero will not be seen in any other problem such as failureexcept if they are fighting the villain for the first time loss changeetc all problems mostly revolve the external forceiethe villain this makes them completely unrelatable  in case you tell me that this is natural for a superhero movie the incredibles had its main character fired from his job and the dark knight saw bruce waynes ideals being challenged no such thing is     seen in the marvel cinematic universe  ill admit that iron man and thor had development however they were the only ones the characters then developed into very similar archetypes as individual movies that was very good but they were a part of a larger universe thus characters being fully developed there was a bad thing because it finally made the characters in the avengers quite boring as they were all good and had absolutely no bad qualities the heroes were just good guys and that is the only way one can define their personality in this movie        the villains are mostly faceless mooks who are only there to cause destruction and be defeated by the heroes it is not even known who they were loki on the other hand is the best marvel movie villain thats a great thing right no no it isnt hes just the best looking thrash in the garbage bin having more backdrop and personality makes him better than the rest of those idiots who were just there to be defeated by the hero  and the st still doesnt end there i can go on about how everyones powers are broken yes they are broken and how loki was an idiot for keeping the main energy source on top of stark tower and how the heroes grieved over the death of a secondary character saying he never showed you his captain america vintage card collection that character too was bland beyond words and received no fleshing out or development except maybe in the tv series  verdict so as youve come to know from my review avengers is the greatest masterpiece of the 21st century not its st and doesnt deserve any of the popularity it gets the applause it deserves is for its visual effects which is the only thing for which it has gotten awards other than that it is bad and i would not recommend it to anybody  visual score1010 sound score810 story210 characters410      overall310  i dont take the average of the above
Apr 24 2016,positive,besides being an immensely fun roller coaster ride the avengers is a fantastic translation of the silver age of comics to the big screen
Apr 24 2016,neutral,fun movie with fun action scenes but is a meh movie
Apr 24 2016,positive,with an excelent balance between the whole cast and characters respectin every detail stablished in the prior movies and overall respecting the comic escence from everyone ecxelent action sequences humor special fx score acting etc  avengers became the best superheroe movie ever delivering what we were expecting since iron man in 2008 joss whedon made history here avengers assemble
Apr 23 2016,positive,the one thing that no comic movie has ever done has finally happened and holy crap it did not disappoint saw this movie more than once and it was well deserved it did not disappoint and made me look forward to see whats coming up next
Apr 21 2016,positive,eat your heart out michael bay
Apr 19 2016,positive,one of my favorite movies period the avengers couldnt have been brought to the screen any better pulling this off was a small miracle
Apr 17 2016,positive,this was cinematic gold finally bringing multiple heroes on screen together for the first time
Apr 16 2016,positive,great actors its genius how a superhero doesnt overshadow another superhero and also a superhero movie is nothing without an impressive performance from its antagonist tom hiddleston once again delivered a perfect performance on this category
Apr 14 2016,positive,the perfect end to phase one
Apr 12 2016,positive,an entertaining movie with lots of actions and jokes with 5 movies length of trailer marvel had delivered a fantastic blockbuster that live up to its hype be it the quarrel between the superheros or joking at each other or the action scene this movie keeps our eyes on the screen all the time
Apr 12 2016,positive,every comic books fans dreams come true in this movie
Apr 10 2016,positive,this is my all time favorite movie combining all marvels top heroes its spectacular
Apr 9 2016,positive,one of the greatest comic book movies of all time hands down
Apr 8 2016,positive,marvels the avengers is one of the most overrated films in the history of cinema  preceded by the critically acclaimed iron man the disappointing iron man 2 the acceptable captain america the first avenger  the odd thor and the intense the incredible hulk  loki is back in all of his 1980s hairstyle glory as the most overrated supervillain in the marvel cinematic universe  i mean honestly what is so amazing about tom hiddlestons character  mullet check  creepy demeanor check  total pansy check  english accent check  loki is literally laughable in the epic superhero roundup  the budget was clearly spent on the cast for the film rather than the actual film itself and the storyline is hardly thoughtprovoking  this film is socially acceptable because it was the first time we had multiple major superheroes in one film and we pitted themselves against each other which caused the comic ultrafanboys to go stircrazy  captain america looked so stinking ridiculous that he could have been a power ranger  after iron man takes the nuke into space how does fall back through the wormhole  you cant fall in space  but my biggest complaint was bruce banners line im always angry  angry  hulk hello  the entire equation for the presence of the hulk monstrosity is now entirely in question people  that literally make zero sense  okay my rant is over  despite its flaws it was a fun movie  if you overlook its major defects as most people have it can exciting to see
Apr 6 2016,positive,one of my favorite superhero films and just an all around terrific film that brought the team together in excellent fashion this is one of the highest standards set by marvel
Apr 3 2016,positive,of all of the massive financial hits in history the avengers is one of the few i would not classify as overrated the film is honestly so much fun and deserved all its success
Apr 2 2016,negative,this is bull shot movie i have ever seen
Apr 2 2016,positive,there wasnt much to avengers iron man couslon loki and fury seemed like the only characters with distinct personality luckily i believe this was fixed in future installments i was disappointed that marvel got rid of edward norton as i believed he was very strong generally i think this film was entertaining for a couple of watches due to the mere fact of seeing the avengers on the big screen
Apr 2 2016,positive,this movie has a great cast great action and a great villan it would be five stars if it wasnt for the fact that the first hour is boring
Apr 2 2016,positive,scenes of action look spectacular which really adds to the great action in the film some parts of the storyline lacked however
Apr 1 2016,positive,a good movie but a bit overrated
Apr 1 2016,positive,this movie and the dark knight are the two best superhero movies ever made bar none at one point i liked man of steel better but after watching that movie a couple of times i saw the flaws though i still liked it this movie is still a great one to watch
Mar 31 2016,positive,one of the best comic book movies of all time a lot of magic and chemistry the hulk steals the show
Mar 31 2016,positive,the avengers was the definite momentum for the marvel series bringing all of the heroes together for one movie was hyped up for a while and the movie delivered action packed full of emotion as you watch your favorite heroes learn to work together to defeat the evil loki and his armie of gitari this film showed sinister and powerful loki really is after a not so well done performance in thor all in all this film is one of the best marvel movies ever made
Mar 29 2016,positive,this is without a doubt the most wellmade movie in the marvel cinematic universe so far with the great visionary known as joss whedon at the helm and with a lot of rich characters already set up previously in their own solo films with the exception of black widow and hawkeye who appeared as secondary characters or cameos in the previous films it is one of those movies that is always worth watching again and its definitely deserves the title of one of the highestgrossing films of all time
Mar 29 2016,positive,loved this film mark ruffalo did an amazing job as hulk hawkeye and hulk were my favs in this film
Mar 29 2016,positive,a movie filled with cgi and action set pieces this film manages to fulfil the hopes and dreams of marvel fans by assembling the avengers onscreen for the first time ever
Mar 28 2016,positive,very long but had more good moments than bad
Mar 28 2016,negative,jingoistic mishmash of cgi mediocrity
Mar 27 2016,positive,one the most epic movie of all time i love all the action and the script was great too fantastic movie its a must see
Mar 27 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies of all time
Mar 26 2016,positive,thanks to joss whedons brilliant scripting and directing the avengers succeeds as both a stand alone picture and a great ensemble crossover for the fans the action is nonstop yes but after 5 movies of build up i think its warranted and accepted
Mar 26 2016,positive,certainly great movie
Mar 26 2016,negative,good movie but had some flaws
Mar 26 2016,positive,its a good marvel movies i atcually i like it finnaly got to see the moment where heroes united
Mar 25 2016,negative,just a piece of crap popcorn flick with little to no redeeming value
Mar 25 2016,positive,boring as hell it was 2 hours and 22 min of my life wasted id rather go to church than watching this just teasing it was ok 
Mar 25 2016,positive,this is a superhero movie we never thought we would ever see but thanks to marvel we did the avengers is a very good film and one we would not forget for a very long time
Mar 23 2016,positive,whedon made it work
Mar 22 2016,neutral,i find it funny that critics claimed that man of steel strayed into generic blockbuster territory and then praise the avengers when it has the most generic action movie plot and layout in all of hollywood
Mar 22 2016,positive,so after re watching this movie it wasnt nearly as epic as i remembered it  however there were moments i genuinely laugh out loud and enjoyed myself from beginning to end
Mar 22 2016,negative,whilst undoubtedly entertaining to the eyes the avengers offers little the film takes pride hiding in its comfort zone and doesnt have the balls to leave and offer anything challenging
Mar 21 2016,negative,so so story line is expected
Mar 15 2016,positive,marvel the avengers is one of the best marvel entry its unique blend of action story driven  very good character development and humour makes thias definitely one of top 10 best  marvel films 
Mar 12 2016,positive,a great adaptation of this iconic superhero team great humor acting and storyline make this one of the best marvel movies
Mar 12 2016,positive,the movie that marvel will try to top but fail because of the thrill of seeing these heroes together for the first time and the great dialogue and exhilarating action
Mar 10 2016,positive,the movie did not disappoint between the action and the character interaction the avengers is definitely a movie you have to put on top of your mustwatch movie list
Mar 10 2016,positive,being a film that could have ended up being a mess marvels the avengers balances all of its huge personalities out wonderfully and has a great action packed story also finally seeing these characters on screen together is just an allout nerdgasm
Mar 10 2016,positive,although its plot isnt really that well thoughtout everything else about this movie is great i have watched it 5 times and im still not tired of it the action is awesome some of the best in any movie of recent memory the characters are all unique and amazing in their own ways and of course the directing by joss whedon is really his best up to today
Mar 10 2016,positive,in the post credits scene of iron man 2008 nick fury samuel l jackson arrives and says i am iron man you think youre the only superhero in the world mr stark youve become part of a bigger universe you just dont know it yet of course fury is alluding to the avengers initiative it is a key moment for the marvel cinematic universe since it reveals marvels plans for the first avengers film naturally comic book fans rejoiced everywhere at the news i was one of them iron man is also the first film in marvels phase 1 that culminates in marvels the avengers iron man is followed by the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger as each of the movies are released my doubt grows in regards to whether an avengers movie can be good how will all these great characters and strong personalities come together in a film is it too many characters will it be a complete mess like sam raimis spiderman 3 ironically my fear becomes the strength of the movie the avengers works because these heroes really do not gel well together in respect to being a team they are dysfunctional at best in the words of mark ruffalos bruce banner i mean what are we a team no no no were a chemical mixture that makes chaos were were a timebomb however the conflict among the group is the primary reason the film is entertaining to watch and compelling the clash of egos is epic it is great theater to watch these heroes bicker and quarrel before overcoming their differences to become a phenomenal team director joss whedon does a marvelous job with the film he manages the superstar cast very well the story is paced well and the flow of the movie is fluid in addition he has an excellent sense of humor the dialogue is awesome and i really enjoy how jokes are set up with clever lines delivered earlier in the film the avengers is a very difficult film to direct and whedon totally comes through  despite a large cast of commanding characters the film does not become a mess because tony starkiron man and natasha romanoff black widow are the dominant personalities that drive the plot of course iron man is the natural center of attention he is the most popular avenger his cocky wise cracking personality keeps the tone of the film fun robert downey jrs portrayal of stark is perfect in many ways he and the first iron man film set the tone for the entire marvel cinematic universe natasha romanoff enters the universe in iron man 2 while she is a strong supporting character in that movie i love her extended role in the avengers it is great seeing a strong female badass as an equal to a group of alpha men and key driver of the story moreover scarlett johansson is my favorite actress and does an excellent job as the character another plus aspect of this film is a great villain tom hiddleston delivers an intriguing performance as the power hungry psychopathic loki as the god of mischief he is the perfect instigator to exploit the problems the avengers struggle with as they try to come together as a team in addition he is a tremendous trash talker really knows how to rile up the heroes similar to iron man he is an entertaining character who helps keep the movie fun  for my full review please go to 
Mar 9 2016,positive,epic that is the only word to say about the avengers seeing all 6 superheros in one movie fighting against the badass villian loki and his army in a war like situation in new york city this blew everyone expectations it was a movie that had so much hype for at least 4 years the moment when they showed the post credits in iron man everyone was waiting on when were getting the movie and when the movie was released the hype was real
Mar 8 2016,positive,this summer blockbuster finally cemented the now iconic marvel cinematic universe the first ensemble superhero film set a new standard and shattered records

Feb 3 2016,positive,i absolutely love this movie so much starks humour mixed with everyone elses seriousness makes me laugh so hard i recommend this movie to anyone who likes super heros and action great family movie
Feb 1 2016,positive,whoever in marvel said lets take all the best superheroes and throw them into one movie and have them fight marvels equivalent to the joker was the smartest man on earth i love this movie im sorry this is in all caps but it has to be clark gregg robert downey jr chris evens scarlet johansson and jeremy renner how couldnt it be good
Jan 27 2016,positive,the avengers was good but i was hoping for more fighting but that did not happen till the middle of the movie and then towards the end of the movie there was more fighting iron man was pretty cocky i thought to make it funny it was a good movie but i like the avengers age of ultron better
Jan 25 2016,negative,kill the two useless ppl please
Jan 21 2016,positive,an epic introduction to what would become a massive universe almost perfect
Jan 21 2016,positive,great movie packed with action and humour just what you would expect from any other marvel film it has lots of references to other upcoming marvel movies aswell
Jan 19 2016,positive,one of the best superhero movies of all time finally these characters are coming together to stop loki and to save the day over all its freakin awesome
Jan 17 2016,positive,one thing to stay about this movie one of the best superhero movies of all time
Jan 9 2016,positive,the 4 film buildup was great but looking back the avengers is kind of bland good but bland filled with mindless action and a generic and forgettable score personally i believe it to be the 5th worst marvel film as of antmans release
Jan 8 2016,positive,one of the best marvel movies out there and bringing the comics of the avengers to life loved it a mix of the classic avengers and the ultimate line
Jan 8 2016,positive,one of the best superhero films of all time everyone works so well together the action is the kind which makes you holler and cheer and for the sugar on top the humor works extremely well too  one little flaw and its not too big here is the villian loki after coming off of the movie thor i have a hard time trying to understand what his quest for power is all about dont get me wrong he works really well here but he didnt have enough time to develop into a character who you can sympathize with marvel always struggled to make a good villian but tom hiddleston gave this his all in order to be a threat not only to our band of heroes but to the rest of the planet so ill give him some props for that
Jan 7 2016,positive,the avengers is one of the best superhero movies its awesome funny and has a memorable cast of characters
Jan 6 2016,positive,when marvel made the tobey maguire spidey movies i was happy well atleast until the 3rd one and then i figured thats all thanks marvel you did decent then marvel studios had a bigger vision and that was a marvel cinematic universe that started with iron man and evolved into avengers  i was a late bloomer with marvel and comics batman begins happened and threw the shade on marvel anything then 2008 came and iron man changes everything setting the foundation for something i even being novice i was couldnt see a live action avengers move this is my favorite movie of all time
Jan 2 2016,positive,this movie really shows you how far cgi has come even robert downey jrs emotions are computer animated
Jan 1 2016,positive,a really well made movie that has good acting throughout the whole film lots of good humor and a great cast
Dec 30 2015,positive,the avengers is a brilliant movie with an all star cast a spectacular villain and action the avengers made supehero movie history for teaming up these heroes together at once
Dec 25 2015,positive,the best movie of 2012
Dec 22 2015,positive,after years of world building movie setting and blood stains from trying to stand out in the cinematographic scene marvel finally achieves to make an epic superhero tale that pleases audiences fans and critics with a film thatll stand as a classic superhero film for the years to come
Dec 22 2015,positive,well what can i say are the avengers  i love this movie thats it  i  love how loki is involved in all this invasion thing the postcredits scene reveals thanos its a great movie
Dec 20 2015,positive,good story menacing villain fun movie
Dec 20 2015,positive,very entertaining and boasting a timely and playful sense of humor as well as excellent action pieces and chemistry between the cast
Dec 17 2015,positive,the avengers has its moments however the great action scenes cant completely overshadow the dialogue which is at times plodding
Dec 16 2015,negative,it was everything id come to expect from bad action movies with overblown special effects that dont blow the mind id seen this movie before even though i hadnt watched it i usually expect better from joss whedon but anyone can produce a clunker every now and then i may be in the minority but i wasnt impressed
Dec 5 2015,positive,12615 3   11322 35  i didnt jump into the mcu until late 2015 and cant imagine what this first avengers film would have been like in a theater this is only my second time watching many of these marvel movies and since i was never a comic book fan i am definitely enjoying picking up on so many more references in addition to the foreshadowing that went over my head the first time through even the mid credits scene that just played would have meant nothing to me in 2015 as i had no idea who that character even was at that point  it would be hard for me to pick a favorite avenger in this one but i have always loved team up movies where diverse groups of agents criminals or in this case heroes are all introduced as individuals and then have to bring their unique skills together to achieve a goal while there are definitely some i have liked better there is no denying this is the ultimate team up movie solidifying itself as one of the most popular franchises the world may ever see  i love the way this film ended too introducing some of the nuance that make these films so much more interesting by adding dimensions not normally explored in the standard straight forward superhero plots 7510  samuel l jackson binge nick fury was in the drivers seat for much of this film quarterbacking most of the action after greenlighting the plan to assemble his super team i am not sure if jackson will ever have a more important role in the context of film history and that says a lot considering he was also a member of the jedi council  slj janurary 23
Dec 5 2015,positive,5 stars just isnt enough for this movie  one of the best superhero movies ever  totally lives up to the hype
Dec 2 2015,positive,good film great performances and great directing with a good climax and conclusion and the picture is just great a great movie
Nov 28 2015,positive,the dream became reality
Nov 26 2015,positive,truly an amazing beginning for the franchise and an perfect setup for an awesome team to unite and defeat evil another superior film just like iron man
Nov 23 2015,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever with joss whedon successfully bringing all of these marvel heavyhitters together
Nov 16 2015,positive,so ive seen the avengers about 4 or 5 times now but have never given my thoughts on it yet considering ive never been in love with the marvel movies ive really liked them but not enough to let the mistakes pass i feel the need to address that this movie does have its issues but is still awesome   just seeing all these characters that we know and love on the big screen in phenomenal all of them are great actors and joss whedon manages to deliver a witty and comical script considering most of these characters have had their stand alone movies we are already attached to them and we have a pretty good sense of their background   phase one of the marvel movies definitely had some rough patches the incredible hulk thor iron man 2 but it came with some pretty solid films overall robert downey jr is definitely the most quickwitted character while having a lovable smartass attitude chris evans does a great job as captain america and he might be my favorite character his strong personality and his leadership are admirable and he always wants to do the right thing chris hemsworth as thor is also great and although i really didnt like the first thor movie i still admire his character mark ruffalo is amazing as the hulk and even though edward norton was good ruffalo is the new face of the hulk i also thought that even though these were more minor characters black widow and hawkeye were outstanding here   as for loki i thought he was a great villain but he honestly wasnt that memorable yes he was menacing and evil but when you really watch the movie the avengers never actually fight him they have a quick 2 minute scuffle with him near the beginning but they never actually fight him in the end they fight an army but he ultimately gets taken out in a few minutes i thought that that was pretty lame and a waste of a villain i felt like his intentions were more menacing than what he personally did although its nice that he was the brains and commander of this whole operation it wouldve been cooler to see him in the front lines   the story overall is absurd but still highly entertaining you do feel like theres a lot at stake and these guys have a lot to fight for when im digging deeper into every scene there were definitely things that didnt make sense or were just too unrealistic example realistically no aircraft carrier of that size would be able to entirely cloak that is saying that they are taking the environment around them and mask everyone there in order to blend with their surroundings honestly multiple planes would probably crash into them also when bruce banner suddenly turns into the hulk near the end that was the most convenient plot point i have ever seen in my life theres no explanation as to how he can suddenly control his anger when he had no such ability 2 hours ago theres a lot of small things in the movie that were so off that it detracted from the film a bit   even for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie it felt really short i feel like this movie was compressed ultron felt that way too and that they probably couldve extended it by about 20 or so minutes the cgi at times also looks a bit spotty for such a high budget movie sometimes the backgrounds and aliens looked pretty bad and it just didnt look real at times but thats not saying all the cgi was bad probably about 80 was doing great but the other 20 lacked compared to the rest   this movie also does a great job with building tension between characters i liked how all of these powers couldnt stand each other until the very end because by building that tension it felt like it paid off by the time the finale hit this movie is a pretty light tone and nothing really dark happens when emotional moments occur they always have to throw in some comedic line or some comedic relief i wish they didnt do that as much but for the most part the movie had a great sense of comedy to it   in the end the action was pretty entertaining and it was just great seeing all these beloved characters all on the big screen at the same time its not my favorite marvel film ever and it never will be but it is still a fantastic film the comedy and action are riveting but there are too many little mistakes and plot conveniences that prevent me from giving it 5 stars i dont love this movie but if it did a few things differently i probably would in the end its still an awesome marvel movie and a great ending to phase 1
Nov 15 2015,positive,how does one stuff simple one movie with six superheroes and make it work this movie shows you how the heroes have to rub each other the wrong way and then put aside their petty problems to save the world from an alien army simple effective engaging  robert downey jrs performance is the heart and soul of the movie and perhaps the entire marvel franchise and you can understand this movie without having seen any of the other superhero movies though they provide a richer context
Nov 6 2015,positive,this movie was a dream for me  being a mega comic fan i loved having all the earths mightiest heroes come together for an actionpacked and hilarious movie  the cast was also couldnt be better for every avenger                                                             4 stars
Nov 2 2015,positive,outstanding just everything works
Nov 1 2015,positive,bigger piece of wank
Nov 1 2015,positive,best comic book movie
Nov 1 2015,negative,worst one out of the two horrible villain and just felt way to rushed to me stunts was great but script was awful
Oct 26 2015,positive,its obvious that this is the best mcu movie and the 2nd best superhero movie im not going to go in depth because you all know why this movie rocks im just going to list it i loved the cast the action the plot the villain the cgi the pacing the characters and the end credit scenes need i say more the avengers is a brilliant scifi masterpiece
Oct 24 2015,positive,just marvel can do something like this
Oct 24 2015,positive,definitely one of the best and also funniest super hero movies ive ever gotten to see along with guardians of the galaxy and the sequel age of the ultron is not too far behind
Oct 18 2015,positive,the avengers successfully brings together our favorite superheroes in a fun and awesome movie as they fight a great villain loki
Oct 17 2015,positive,first time they ever assemble is a fun action blockbuster that i think will please the fans
Oct 14 2015,positive,my 2nd favorite mcu film this movie blends these superheroes perfectly and make an incredible show out of it 495
Oct 14 2015,positive,i love this movie
Oct 13 2015,positive,really interesting funny too brilliant film wasnt bored at any part
Oct 12 2015,negative,boring redundant predictable and juvenile great production values cannot make up for poor direction and lack luster screen play tired performances and cliche catch phrases  even my eight year old boy wasnt impressed
Oct 10 2015,positive,joss whedon does a wonderful job of bringing all these heroes together for one blockbuster film
Oct 6 2015,positive,this movie is outstanding seeing all of everyones favorite marvel superheroes come together is amazing  loki is the best bad guy for this movie i can think of robert downy jr was at his best if you love action and superheroes you need to see this its a modern day classic
Oct 5 2015,positive,spectacular one of the superhero movies ever
Oct 3 2015,positive,this movie is one of my favorite this movie is going to be better still than all the new avenger movies the next avengers is going to be part 1 and 2 spoil alert oif u havent watched yet thanos  the most powerful person in the universe with the gems beside one is going to go after the avengers to take them down captain america is going to die and bucky is going to be the new captain america instead of winter solider like in the comics for ages 12
Oct 2 2015,positive,a terrific outing in the mcu
Sep 30 2015,neutral,why does this movie have such a high rating  its a fun comedy but beyond that its forgettable
Sep 29 2015,positive,in my opinion the most fun superhero movie next to guardians of the galaxy 485
Sep 20 2015,positive,absolutely the best comic book ever
Sep 19 2015,positive,very funny love the action scenes
Sep 14 2015,positive,seeing the incredible hulks strength in clear daylight is seeing the difference between a lump of green dough with no shadows to something realistic where mother natures elements are added for ultrarealism  maybe my wild imagination on advanced visual effects may be a little too technical to understand then again a simple moving object such as a flapping sun umbrella on a sunny beach should give you an idea on wind movement and shadows affected by the sun this movie is definitely an improvement despite the mindless alien creatures with no future outcome expected intelligence to outwit the avengers 
Sep 14 2015,positive,good starting movie left areas to grow
Sep 14 2015,positive,i love it its the gathering of our favorite marvel heroes positives every single one of those perfect not so perfect heroes negatives none
Sep 12 2015,positive,this film was great fun definitely in the top 3 of the mcu series so far it was awesome to see all of the avengers in one film i want one of those shield sky bases so bad i wonder where they will take the mcu after this epic adventure
Sep 9 2015,positive,amazing movie u should watch it
Sep 9 2015,positive,believe the hype marvels the avengers skillfully manages to combine the elements of what made its predecessors so good before and interwoves them into one film
Sep 8 2015,negative,couldnt hold a candle to martin campbells green lantern not even if it tried
Sep 5 2015,positive,a magnificently exellent movie very well made
Aug 27 2015,positive,awesome one of the best superhero movies today
Aug 25 2015,positive,full of action sequences  epic cgi which makes the film great a lot of characters need reintroducing in a short period of time obviously for first time watchers therefore it does feel a little squeezed in spaces but joss whedon does well dont let this stop you from enjoying this quality addition to the mcu with an avengeful bang
Aug 24 2015,neutral,tom lho fatto per te
Aug 21 2015,positive,this is the modern equivalent of star wars a new hope and it deserves every praise that it gets
Aug 20 2015,positive,iron man steals the show and the movies is a lot of fun
Aug 20 2015,positive,great action scenes and the one liners are killers  loved it
Aug 19 2015,positive,this movie finally does what we always wanted action tons and tons of great action instead of losing more than an hour talking about the heroes and how they and their enemies came to be this movie could just skip all of that and give us 25 hours of nonstop fun and thrill and good acting as well
Aug 18 2015,positive,65 stars rarely does a movie just blow me away like this one the action never lets up for a second
Aug 14 2015,positive,solid plot characters and visuals long action sequences
Aug 14 2015,neutral,the first time i saw it i thought it was awesome the more i watched it the more i realized it didnt do anything much different from the previous films the only difference is all the characters in it turns out it is just an average comic film
Aug 12 2015,positive,amazing movie enough said
Aug 12 2015,positive,this movie was really good first off the super heros everyone really played their part really good the villain loki was also really good at playing his part
Aug 9 2015,positive,great assemble team up movie its awesome
Aug 9 2015,positive,doing a wonderful job at combining a handful of superheroes into one movie the avengers shows that you can have too many characters in one movie and still be excellent
Aug 8 2015,positive,the greatest superhero film of all time nothing else to say a
Aug 8 2015,neutral,the movie had terrible dialogue full of bad jokes the tone was bad it had plot holes badunthreatening villain boring action scenesand the plot is just unoriginal and overused cant see any reason you should see this the only reason i didnt give it a lower score is because the characters had a good chemistry and it had good visuals overall i didnt like and found it overrated
Aug 8 2015,positive,an amazing movie based on marvel comics a movie that brings the marvel heroes together
Aug 7 2015,positive,after five films that help set up this one the avengers is a masterpiece filled with topnotch acting action humor and chemistry between the ensemble cast while the plot was pretty predictable that doesnt make it bad this is a mustseen comic book movie
Aug 6 2015,neutral,i really wish people would stop praising this movie its not that good yes it has some good and memorable scenes but thats it honestly if this movie didnt have marvels name and characters on it then people would criticise everything from the story to villain its alright but this is nowhere near the best marvels ever done let alone one of the greatest superhero movies of all time
Aug 3 2015,positive,although there couldve been more action the avengers is one of the most fun movies you will see for a long time by joining together some of the coolest superheroes around without it being cheesy and boring
Aug 1 2015,positive,lots and lots of action explosions fights and the whole mess the heroes are initially shown to be men  and for a time feels good but one cant help feeling that given these movies rely on cg and explosions this would only be a minor blip on the whole franchise but yeah robert downey jr is brilliant at his worst ok to watch
Jul 31 2015,positive,high paced pure superhero fun with enough kickbutt action to keep it genuinely hilarious but still mindbogglingly detailed without having it explained as a lot of superhero films fail to do today
Jul 30 2015,positive,love this film  one of my all time faves
Jul 28 2015,positive,most fun in theaters i have ever had
Jul 27 2015,positive,awesomely awesome amazingly amazing get the point
Jul 27 2015,positive,the awsomes movie ever
Jul 26 2015,positive,it is amazing various directors or filmmakers in general were collaborating to bring together a cinematic universe that would eventually lead to this movie never have we seen a good live action movie with this many superheroes the only superhero movie better than this one before its release was definitely the dark knight but this is a film that is much more fun and exciting  in the very first few scenes with black widow we understand the film will have a very comedic tone to it while staying true to the actionadventure formula ive only seen this film a few times but every time i do i find myself smiling a lot especially in scenes with my favorite avenger  iron man robert downey jr pulls the role off perfectly for every film involving iron man  even in the notso good iron man 3 if all this great comedy wasnt in the movie it would be a fest of eyecandy at the end and thats about it which is not what i look for in a movie  in the scene where all of the avengers are arguing with fury i feel like stark and banner could have accessed the information earlier and asked about it and in that way they could have avoided the feud all together but i guess this movie needed tension of some sort it is also a little unclear if loki manipulated their thoughts since his intention was supposedly to have the avengers tear each other apart from the inside  if people are going to complain about this movie being cliché guess what  its based on comic books these types of films are meant to be fun and exciting even if that means reusing formulas for action films if the movie serves its purpose it is a good film and the avengers purpose was to entertain
Jul 26 2015,positive,quite fun basically a kids film with lots of explosions  iron man steals the show which make you wonder why they dont just keep to stand alone super hero movies
Jul 23 2015,positive,overrated because it brought together the avengers this film is well written but sacrifices all the action it could have had for witty yet slow going dialogue
Jul 23 2015,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time this blockbuster is like my star wars dont worry i still love star wars more not only did this film make me interested in the mcu it made me interested in films period filled with amazing action scenes wonderful visuals great direction and a superb cast this will hands down be one of my alltime favorites no matter what
Jul 22 2015,positive,i watch this one about every month hard to say enough good about it
Jul 22 2015,positive,great movie with great character development
Jul 21 2015,positive,amazing very fun movie to watch especially in the 3rd act
Jul 20 2015,positive,after 4 years of buildup the avengers finally assemble and the result is the most breathtaking genuinely funny and exciting chapter in the mcu thus far it even made me like captain america
Jul 20 2015,positive,its marvel and its the avengers enough said
Jul 20 2015,positive,what i like the avengers defines the comic book movie its explosive fun action packed popcorn entertainment taken to the next level the confrontations the jokes the teamwork it all feels so real and so brilliant but it could have easily been a failure why wasnt it well the acting is class a stuff but what really makes it is whedons expert direction that is nothing short of amazing he makes a film of this scale feel human and personal thanks to a mix of character interactions and action that blend seamlessly together what i didnt like some bits are a teeny bit cringeworthy if im honest like the goofy costumes cheesy lines and the odd bit of bad cgi but it arguably adds to its ballsy comic book charm verdict it might not be flawless but i havent felt this way since star wars its monumental in how it makes you feel  proud thrilled and downright happy
Jul 19 2015,positive,probably one of the best movies ive ever seen great blend of action and comedy then again i am a comic book fan so i might be biased
Jul 19 2015,positive,phase 1 puzzle was perfect cant believe how it came together
Jul 19 2015,positive,perfect in every way
Jul 18 2015,positive,marvels the avengers is packed with incredible cgi exhilarating action and an exciting performance from the lead cast as well as the right amount of humanity in each of the characters to make this a perfectly enjoyable movie  rating 100
Jul 17 2015,positive,easily one of the best superhero movies ever made whedons witty dialogue and the awe inspiring action sequences make for about as much fun as you can have in a movie
Jul 15 2015,positive,ill probably be in the minority but i really didnt think that the avengers was that great of a movie it did have some nice points but after a while i thought maybe they could break up the violence with some dialogue  okay they did that at times and james spader as the villain had some good quotes that sort of sounded like his character red from the blacklist  i actually find all the avengers interesting but when they all get together sometimes it gets convoluted  great cast of actors too bad we cant let them catch a bit of breath to show their craft a bit more  my theme for this movie as often in many action flicks of today sometimes less would be more
Jul 9 2015,positive,the climax of nerd culture was reached with the avengers and i dont think anything will be quite like it again
Jul 9 2015,positive,i dont think you can watch the avengers and not have a huge smile on your face the entire time the film succeeds on every front and delivers a great fun time loved it
Jul 8 2015,positive,the avengers is by far the best crossover film marvel has to offer at a runtime of 143 minutes the movie delivers actionpack performances by mark ruffalo overwhelming action and of course great fighting  sequences
Jul 5 2015,positive,this movie changed the cinematic universe
Jul 1 2015,positive,the ultimate superhero movie  marvel has set the standard for superhero movies
Jun 30 2015,positive,enjoyed but too long
Jun 29 2015,positive,amazing film just such a good movie it amazes me how  many characters we see on screen  the chemistry between actors are great action is amazing sgi is great too my only problem is first 20 minutes they are just boring as heel but the overall movie is great
Jun 29 2015,positive,personally i actually didnt like this movie it had a few parts that i really enjoyed but sometimes when a film asks you to suspense your disbelief with a story like this it gets too farfetched for even a marvel movie
Jun 22 2015,positive,amazing collaboration of the mcu where everyone gets their equal share of screen time just absolutely brilliant all the way around
Jun 21 2015,positive,the avengers has very effect
Jun 21 2015,positive,really fun to see all of these character together on the the big screenthe scene near the end where you get to see the avengers showcase all there powers  abilities really is some thing to seeit was the first time some thing like this was done  really well though i did like second movie a little more  it drags a little in the middle it still was a great film  really open up the doors for bigger  better things
Jun 21 2015,positive,great movie overall marvel movies have been killing it stan lees stories always unveil in such a creative and unique way no matter what movie it might be about spidermans newer ones along with the new xmen first class and days of future past  and even going to new heights with something like guardians of the galaxy which turned out to be one of the greatest films on top of that all the movies leading up to this originally were iron man thor captain america  hulk i guess was just thrown in their with tiffani who kills it along with scarlet who plays the black widow in captain america and from thor you have jeremy rennet who does a great job playing the character he should play putting them all together hit the trifecta the movie isnt the greatest by any means of any marcel film but for what its worth it definitely is
Jun 19 2015,negative,i am worn out from the cgi superhero formula
Jun 18 2015,positive,it lives up to high expectations i wonder if i would like this more if id seen it before the winter soldier i loved all the fight scenes and seeing everyones role in the battles nobody is useless
Jun 17 2015,positive,one of the most original storys and great action sequences with amazing actors superheros and great directing by joss wheadon
Jun 15 2015,positive,marvels the avengers is fantastic  originally written july 2 2012 wow what can i say ive seen this movie four times now i went opening night saw it a couple more times over the next two weeks and then again the day it crossed the 600 million barrier joss whedon has created a masterpiece i honestly cant say who my most favorite character in the film is nor who utters the best line because the entire thing is just awesome i felt like a kid again watching saturday morning cartoons as iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner widow scarlett johansson the incredible hulk mark ruffalo and nick fury samuel l jackson team up to defeat loki tom hiddleston and the chitauri army from invading earth the idea of taking all of these superheroes and putting them together in one movie was not only a brilliant one but a timely one as well honestly marvel studios took a huge risk but it has paid off big time what an incredible movie and judging by the amount of money it has made thus far im not the only who feels this way well done marvel
Jun 15 2015,neutral,1 poorly edited there are several times where the film cuts away from a character  does something else for 1520 minutes then cuts back to the character who apparently has done nothing but wait patiently for the camera to return 2 the old knock to the head undoes mind control trick twice 3 whats the point of having a centrally controlled invading army if each individual entity is going to act without a central plan oh the old kill all the bad guys with one hit to the unimind trick 4 sir enemies are pouring through a portal into the city should we attack the portal sir nah just nuke the city and we can all be home by dinner
Jun 15 2015,positive,the avengers are epic they need more chicks though huge sausagefest
Jun 14 2015,positive,best super hero movie
Jun 13 2015,positive,a little bit overhyped  action and comedy was pretty good
Jun 13 2015,positive,a fast paced action superhero slam dunk its great
Jun 12 2015,negative,this movie sucks its so boring and dissapointing ugh
Jun 11 2015,positive,really good movie this movie brought 6 superheroes together and made it work which i give the movie credit for
Jun 10 2015,positive,6310  okaydecentwatchable  seen on 3521
Jun 6 2015,neutral,many people may disagree with me but i think this movie is extremely overrated and that avengers age of ultranationalist is better because i think the avengers is slow i the beginning and the last 20 minutes is actually the best part in fact this movie may have been 1 stared if not for the fight scene being as good as it was
Jun 6 2015,positive,the only weaknesses i see are that hawkeye has too little development and the aliens are too easily disposable
Jun 4 2015,positive,if only anyone could see my review in this flood of positive comments on this movie never been done before its just wonderful everyone coming together into one film just a mess of greatness so glad it will continue marvel is too good for my comments though it will continue to flaw but it will not stop way to go above and beyond marvel
Jun 3 2015,negative,standard predictable superhero sass
Jun 2 2015,positive,chock full of some of superhero film historys most iconic fight scenes and lush graphics the avengers adds another worthy entry in the roster of hero flicks
Jun 1 2015,positive,710 joss whedon is great at writing characters and their interactions with each other the scenes of just these characters talking to one another are full of entertainment however i still find the action pretty generic and the story to be a little jumbled still a fun movie
Jun 1 2015,positive,avengers assemble is a monsterous blockbuster of a movie i was precarious going into this that having all the characters together wasnt going to work but they have played it brilliantly its still not perfect as loki seemed detached and lonely when it came to his army a little forced i feel yet its full of action humour and cinematics i enjoyed the clash between egos captain america taking the lead and the hulks edge its a superb action movie which cannot be missed
May 31 2015,positive,superheroes together in glorious action and shawarma
May 31 2015,positive,a action film full of character in comic book style
May 30 2015,positive,avengers past all of our expectations josh sweden does an amazing job directing and the cast look like they are having an amazing time shooting this this movie is definitely the best marvel movie so far
May 25 2015,positive,ugh what can i say i finally watched the avengers and it kind of matched my expectations its big its epic and the action is just really cool but it has the same problem that pretty much every marvel movie has its bright and clean that may sound like a weird criticism but my personal taste is a lot darker thats probably why i like batman or watchmen better
May 24 2015,negative,when i went to the theater i had to park a mile away as it was on the release night when i started the first 30 minutes i was wondering how anyone could sit thru this terrible terrible movie seriously ive only walked out of 2 movies in my life out of maybe about 1000 after 1 and a half hours of this rubbish i walked out seriously the cheesiest boringestlamest worst utter dispicably bad movie ive ever seen in my life cant believethe tomatometer gave 92 good on this one and so bad on vanilla sky which i actually really lovedthis is the last time i trust critics reviewsthere was nothing to say that was good about this movie terrible acting cheesy as heck lines boring going nowhere fast plotbunch of senseless action that had no intrigue or suspense rated 0 out of 10 worst movie of my life seen far better bad kung fu movies from the 70s  ahahahaha after seeing this i lost all respect for marvel movies tho one of my fav all time movies is iron man 1  not to mention the later x men movies as wellim hoping the avengers 2 will be far better it cant possibly be any worse one thing is for sure i wont be seeing it the moviesrental hahaha
May 24 2015,positive,a great superhero movie love the cast and the plot lots of action and special effects as well
May 24 2015,positive,this is far one of the best superhero movies created a great joyride that balances every character a great story line character development fight scenes combined into one beautiful rampaging movie
May 21 2015,positive,marvel make an almost perfect film with humor action and thrills
May 19 2015,positive,that my friends is a whole new level of greatness i thought the marvel movies were incredible but the avengers is somthing else entirely enjoyed every bit
May 18 2015,positive,a film great very funny and entertaining with great fight scenes and special effects a good story just thought a negative point is the imbalance of the importance of the characters in the movie i thought the iron man and the hulk stood out far more than captain america thor and the black widow and has the hawkeye that was one of the main characters less important but ultimately the film is very good
May 17 2015,positive,positives   beautiful action scenes   amazing pacing  great characters   great villain  great dialogue   perfect run time  negatives   hawkeye didnt have a purpose   first 40 mins was good but was weaker then the rest of the film
May 16 2015,positive,a breath of fresh air in the superheroes movies overall great movie
May 16 2015,positive,smashing explosion fights fire and bulletsi cant stand how most guys enjoy watching this kinda movie tom hiddleston is so prettyshakespeare in the park hahaha there are some hilarious moments
May 15 2015,positive,one of the best superhero films ever bringing a fantastic cast together and a epic score also just the avengers so cool
May 15 2015,positive,arguably one of the most fun movies ever produced mark ruffalo is a revelation
May 15 2015,positive,the film shines when it comes to the interactions between the characters and their development as a team it is unfortunately let down by a cartoonish and absurd final battle sequence
May 14 2015,positive,still one of the best and most entertaining movies ive seen packed with top actors special effects fun storyline and excellent directing the avengers still does what most entertainment cant
May 13 2015,positive,this movie finally gives what we fanboys always wantedmarvels main superheroes all in one film and they do it so perfectly scripted and directed by joss whedon god of the nerds where could you possibly go wrong
May 13 2015,positive,a good movie that you could watch over and over again without getting annoyed
May 13 2015,positive,action packed from the getgo  3d and special effects are excellent  we really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it
May 13 2015,positive,great cant wait for the second
May 13 2015,negative,i dont know i didnt really enjoy it maybe because i watched it on bootleg maybe i need to rematch it again this film got a lot of praise but i just wasnt feeling it it has some great action and special effects in addition some of the best superheroes are packed into this movie but i didnt like it
May 12 2015,positive,five stars when you first see you at 4 12 third time you see you in three when it comes out on bluray this film creases its value as time goes on
May 12 2015,positive,avengers scifi premiss and war movie feel had me walking away giving it four stars but as i have since rewatched avengers many times i must now admit that it deserves five  although i was a comic book collector as a teen i have not been a fan of the superhero genre as an adult  i saw this one because joss whedon was involved  if it was not for this film the entirety of the marvel cinematic universe would have passed me by  i realized that kevin feiges corner of marvels multiverse was rooted in a reality closer to our own and have since watched everything in the mcu  because of avengers after twenty years i am once again a fan of the superhero genre
May 12 2015,positive,one of the best films i had ever watched
May 11 2015,positive,clever funny and action packed the avengers is great fun for movie goers and comic fans alike
May 10 2015,positive,its has all of the textbook material for a good film but i honestly did not enjoy it nearly as much as i hoped to
May 9 2015,positive,marvel sets out to do what no one has dared or even thought to do before and not only do they do so but they ace the s this film is absolute grade a superhero actioncomedy as best as it can be the huge lead up from the supporting films does not disappoint in any way and only sets up a bigger and brighter future for whats in store without a doubt one of the best superhero films in history amongst the dark knight and iron man 92
May 7 2015,positive,it was ok funny in places which made it worth watching
May 6 2015,positive,joss whedon handles the big setpieces deftly but the script really shines when the characters are bickering amongst themselves a fun comic book movie that rightly doesnt take itself too seriously
May 6 2015,positive,great acton packed film
May 5 2015,positive,the best film of 2012 its a fun energetic and action packed roller coaster ride from start to finish   a
May 5 2015,positive,whedon was able to do what has never been done before and turn it into one of the best action movies superhero or otherwise that has ever been made the chemistry between the cast is great and the story line is laced with explosions and funny one liners a must watch whether you are into the whole superhero verse or not
May 4 2015,positive,fun movie not especially compelling
May 4 2015,positive,great movie definitely recommend to friends
May 4 2015,positive,this film is fantastic after little bits showing that the avengers are coming we finally get to see them on the big screen the film shows them coming together and having to stop loki from conquering earth everyone is perfect for their roles and joss whedon did a great job the only flaw i have with this movie is that the avengers coming together takes a little bit longer than i wanted it to my review for marvels the avengers would be an a
May 4 2015,neutral,independance day with superheroes lots of noise some fun stuff some good bits 1 hour too long
May 4 2015,positive,rewatch loved all the marvel flicks leading up to this so it was great to see them all together and no make a balls of it loki is a right nasty piece of work ruffalo was great in his debut as the hulk would really like to see a solo flick with him as banner the action is top notch and was delighted to have caught this at the cinema on its original release a serious twitch off black widow
May 4 2015,positive,the avengers is truly one of marvels greatest achievements on film bringing together this group of extraordinary people that have been so well built up the past few years and they did it with style joss whedon directs and writes a fantastic eyepopping script and dynamite performances from the entire cast all the way around make the avengers eligible to watch over and over downey evans and hemsworth are all great in their roles and mark ruffalo steps in for edward norton as bruce banner and does a phenomenal job the avengers shows that patience is a virtue and that development of characters instead of rushing them is the way to go
May 4 2015,positive,outstandingly directed and written by joss whedon with magnificent performances and dazzling special effects all over its 142minute running time and full of superpowers humanity emotion and sense marvels the avengers is the mcu best film to date one of the best superhero films ever released and one of the best motion pictures ever made
May 4 2015,positive,avengers was directed by josh whedon it was a fantastic film robbert downer was ironman chris evan in captain america and mark ruffalo in hulk to recap loki and the other was ally the other was the leasder of the chitauris they are extraterrestrial the other want too keep a tesserack cosmic cube with the help of chitauris loki will arrive to controle the planet earth
May 4 2015,positive,whedons witty script keeps this undeniably overflowing sugarrush afloat although i had a headache afterwards i very much enjoyed it at the time
May 3 2015,positive,an intensely fun upbeat superpowered thrill ride that has a lot of replay value the movie does a fantastic job of bringing these characters together and pinning them against their greatest threat yet
May 3 2015,positive,the best true superhero movie of all time i exclude the dark knight trilogy as i dont see those as true superhero movies this movie is the realization of the dreams of so many comic lovers the fact that the movie manages to effectively bring together so many characters makes it a success in itself however its wellpaced plot great action scenes and a villain that steals the show at times make this film a force to be reckoned with very entertaining movie that sets the bar high for things to come at marvel
May 3 2015,neutral,entertaining yet flawed joss whedon did a great job with the characters and developing them here so that it wasnt just a batch of onedimensional characters the problems i have with the film though is the annoying comedy used here the oneliners get stale rather quickly and arent as charming or funny as they were in the original iron man also the army and fighting near the end were kind of boring dont get me wrong loki was awesome but his army felt pointless since they werent developed the avengers is a fun enough movie and i can see why people love it but for me its just alright
May 3 2015,positive,only thing i didnt like about it was that age of ultron did not come out tue next week from this one
May 3 2015,positive,reuniting the most epic superheroes of the 21st century created a striking powerful and exciting movie thanks to marvels the avengers 2012 the mcu suddenly seems to make a lot more sense and the strong fictional team is well supported by its incredible actors  the beginning the final fight scene and the ending of the story simply have everything to please the marvel diehards its a genius marvellous motion picture and the inauguration of an outstanding actionpacked franchise  avengers assemble
May 2 2015,positive,ive waited for this movie for a long time this is the best summer movie this is one of those movies that has to be seen in theaters the avengers is very good the mixture of action and comedy both blend in very well together i liked this movie a lot but i do have some problems the movie is boring as hell for the first hour the avengers are no where to be seen i actually forgot i was watching a movie about badass superheroes during the first act the second act is fun but couldve been better if there was more of the hulk the third act is amazing it pays off the action is filmed so well everyone in this movie gets a chance to show what a badass they can be note stay till the end credits the only reason im giving this a 45 stars is because the first and second act couldve been a lot better but other than that i think loki is an awesome villain and the avengers are badasses   the avengers 45 stars
May 2 2015,positive,its very actionpacked and a fun movie story  not really  it was really predictable and any potential for character development was quickly thrown out for very contrived reasons  but you know what thats ok  i enjoyed seeing my comics come to life on the big screen  if there was anything real complaints its the total underusage of hawkeye thor  iron man fighting for no reason the fact that thor seemingly tried to kill captain america for breaking up the fight and the complete contrivance of banner suddenly being able to hulk  joss whedon was the perfect guy to bring this to fruition i cannot wait to see if it gets better the second time around
May 2 2015,positive,it will certainly be a classic not only marvel but also the genre of superheroes truth joss whedon manager did an excellent job in this film
May 2 2015,positive,funny fast paced exciting and well directed what more could u want from an avengers movie
May 2 2015,positive,a must see and marvels best film way better than the sequel
May 2 2015,positive,it may be better as a piece of scifi action than actual storytelling but it still delivers what fans had hoped
May 1 2015,positive,it is the avengers the avengers when i saw this movie for the first time three years ago i was shaking in my seat and had such high expectations i thought it would be impossible for me to walk away happy oh boy oh boy i not only walked away happy but i walked away speechless this movie is the definition of a comic book movie trust me i love me some dark knight however this movie is more fun and entertaining to watch for that reason alone it wins the spot of best comic book movie ever made on my list what joss whedon did seems almost impossible it is rare to see an action movie where the scenes when the superheroes are fighting are just as enjoyable as the ones when they are just conversing with each other and whedons clever and witty dialogue makes for just that   these heroes are so drastically different this movie is really about how the avengers form besides a character arc that occurs with iron man there is not much more development with the other characters this is not a big problem because this film focuses on the team aspect and what it takes to have these individuals work as one the true arc is in the team rather than in the characters almost as if whedon treated the team as a character itself   from beginning to end this movie holds the audience in close and never lets them go one of my favorite aspects of this film is the epic feel right from the title card this does not feel like any ordinary film every scene is shot with such a grand appearance that adds immensely to the overall feature   as you most likely know hulk stole the show mark ruffalo played bruce banner with perfect finesse capturing the geeky scientist better than any other incarnation of the character once raging into the hulk it is a whole other story that takes over the screen with every punch he really is the spotlight with later in the film delivering one of the best wow moments ive ever seen on the big screen  to get into minor negatives captain america was not as badass as he should be and becomes in future films this is understanding of course since he only recently awakens from an icicle that he has been immersed in for decades however i still would have liked to see him show more value to the team once he starts making the orders most is forgiven but until that point he just falls slightly hawkeye as well is not given the greatest role once he actually becomes hawkeye in the ending battle he does become pretty damn awesome it just may not be enough to make up for his absence for the entirety of the film lastly as amazing as loki was honestly playing a perfect first villain to unite this team i wished he used his frightening abilities he shows in the beginning of the film on the avengers at the end i hated to see him practically give up once his army no longer existed loki is very powerful and could have put up a decent fight and i was sad to not even see him try  the pros definitely overweigh those minor bothers with a comic spectacle written all over this one being a perfect summer blockbuster it definitely makes it incredibly difficult for age of ultron to up the scale the final battle alone is one of the most fun action packed and exciting finales i have ever seen i cant wait to see what joss has in store for us next
May 1 2015,positive,it may surprise you to know that ive only seen the avengers once in its theatrical run so before checking out its bigger and badder sequel i thought id revisit the film that so many seemed to love and its still overrated as all hell  first off props go out to writer joss whedon for actually understanding these characters and what seems to work with them he clearly has a lot of fun watching them bounce off one another literally in some cases and it makes for an enjoyable experience for the most part he gives them a reason to band together well get to that in a moment but tends to use humor as a crutch the films more humorous tone works but its hard to take things seriously when shit goes down its as if the characters are too selfaware of their situation to give them the weight necessary id be okay with this approach if the flick was an hour and half but alas thats far from the case  as for the reasoning for the teamup well we have loki whos an entertaining villain but far too incompetent to take seriously anywho he partners with some aliens because    well why not the aliens are something out of a power rangers film and no thats not great when they pour into new york through a portal in the sky its shrugged off in moments and not really brought up again i know this is a world with super heroes exist but films like iron man and even captain america are somewhat grounded in reality i digress given that theyre mostly cg the bloated finale is just watching a bunch of humans fight against a bunch of cg shit and this goes on for nearly 30 minutes it is really tiresome heres a finale that should have taken the lessismore approach  as for every other action scene in the film its one avenger taking on another its as if there was a checklist of who fights who and wedon was sure to check every single box his direction is decent but feels like tv this is undoubtedly the biggest budgeted cheesefest cinema has ever seen  a little cheese is fine every once in a while this on the other hand is two and half hours worth  at the end of the day the avengers proved to be an entertaining but exhausting comic book film the buzz from seeing you favorite comic heroes onscreen together wears off quickly and all the quips in the world dont make up for the fact youre not invested in the characters or the ridiculousness of the finale  whedon got a lot right and fans commend him for that but ive never seen so much praise for a film simply because it didnt suck thankfully movies like winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy proved what marvel can really do with a license im hoping whedon kept that in mind with his followup age of ultron
Apr 30 2015,positive,marvels the avengers is now one of the most influential events in movie history  it has greatly impacted all of cinema forever  it was the first time a big budget live action movie came out in theatres featuring multiple superheroes on screen at once sharing the spotlight  the five movies leading up to it made a big difference as well because now most audiences who saw the leadup movies didnt have to worry about character introductions or development or anything like that because it had been done already so they could just sit back and watch their favorite heroes kick ass and thats exactly what they got   as an event the avengers is very good though not perfect but as a movie it is far from perfect  a movie on its own in my opinion the avengers falls behind many of the other marvel movies  ill explain why shortly the plot really doesnt need a runthrough since its so simple  loki attacks earth in order to get the tesseract which was the mcguffin from the captain america leadup movie  that item will play an even bigger role lateron when we get to avengers 3  loki plans to use it to summon a huge arm supplied by avengers 3 villain thanos  nick fury assembles the avengers to stop him  thats all there is to it  the only thing deep about it is the relationship between fury and the shield council members but that doesnt go anywhere until winter soldier i initially complained of how simplistic the story is here  however i think for this film they made the right call after thinking about it  this was the first time a team of iconic heroes like this would be assembled to one movie  if they tried to incorporate a layered and complicated story on the level of something like batman begins in there it wouldve detracted from the main selling point of the film which was seeing all these heroes together and kicking ass now that this film has been made and done fairly well there will be greater expectations for future installments story wise  with how much darker and sophisticated these films have gotten since the avengers i wouldnt be surprised if age of ultron and all future sequels wont be more deeply layered  in fact ill be disappointed if they arent     like i said as an event the film is quite good  having all these iconic superheroes together has never been accomplished on this scale before  from a production and acting standpoint the film is a work of genius  the effects are all onpoint  the action very good overall and the final huge action scene in the third act is amazing  all the actors do a spectacular job in their respective roles as they did in their own films  the score is also quite catchy and gets you pumped when things start to go down however as a movie itself i think avengers falls short in a few areas  first of all since this is an event that has been builtup to for years its not a film you can really watch on its own  if you want to really know whats going on who these characters are who the villain is or what the tesseract is you really need to either have read comics or watched the leadup movies  the average moviegoer might be rather lost if they simply viewed this without seeing the others also i feel it lacked a suitable threat until the end fight  now i like loki as a villain especially in thor  however for the avengers i feel like he just doesnt cut it  i feel like any one of the avengers the main four by themselves could take loki  the guy throughout the entirety of the movie gets beatup by pretty much everyone from thor to iron man to the hulk hawkeye etc  also his plan in the second act didnt make much sense to me at the start of the second act he allows himself to be captured for really no reason  you could say he was really trying to turn the avengers against themselves and release the hulk but they really did that on their own when black informs everyone in front of loki that he intends to release the hulk he has this surprised face that says no thats not my plan but thats good ill run with that also the second act becomes a little boring  it just consisted of fury and the avengers trying to find the tesseract while being paranoid and disorganized assholes  it provides good setup for future movies like winter soldier or civil war but i didnt really care much for it hear  like i said before lokis plan is quite questionable there there are also a couple things that dont make any sense to me  how did thor get back to earth in the film when the bridge between the worlds was destroyed in his movie  also the hulk makes little sense here  bruce arrives at the final battle and says im always angry as the reason for his success in controlling the hulk  then he hulks out of his own will and seemed to be in relatively complete control throughout the entire fight  so if he could control it so easily then why did he need to hideout in the first place and why didnt he have control of it in the airship   overall the avengers is a fun popcorn film and a fairly worthy fouryear payoff fans had been waiting for since the first iron man film  for comic book fans who longed to see this iconic team on the big screen for so long you shouldnt be disappointed  for average movie goers who wish to be entertained then there is plenty to be had here
Apr 30 2015,negative,good guys vs bad guys good guys with superpowers and bad guys that are evil because there evil thats about it
Apr 30 2015,positive,tis a fun superhero film that anybody could enjoy i sure enjoyed it
Apr 30 2015,positive,marvels the avengers and marvels avengers age of ultron great movies
Apr 30 2015,positive,loved it nothing seen like hulk before
Apr 29 2015,positive,a yeah a certified fresh rating of 94    marvels the avengers gives us a brilliant script and beautiful cgi it lives up to the hype which is something that rarely happens this has raised the bar for marvel movies
Apr 27 2015,negative,0 story 0 plot 0 acting 2 stars for the fx
Apr 27 2015,positive,larger than life characters in a worldending scenario yet somehow it doesnt lose grasp of itself joss whedon can do no wrong with the source material he loves so much overall its just one of the best damn action blockbusters there is
Apr 27 2015,positive,who doesnt like this movie the characters especially iron man are all at their finest right here
Apr 26 2015,positive,loved it  brings everything  to the table and then smashes the table
Apr 26 2015,positive,one scene the hulk cant control himself and is attacking his allies in the next scene he has full control and can change at will plus he knows his allies big hole in the plot otherwise very well done
Apr 26 2015,positive,the hype built around this masterpiece of a superhero movie is completely necessary marvels the avengers is the best marvel movie or one of the best marvel movies since it is hugely entertaining very humorous and has a cast that will blow your mind
Apr 25 2015,positive,375  pros   great ensemble with great chemistry  fantastic action scenes  great cameo from andy serkis   cons   got a bit lost around the middle  used thor too much  could of been a shorter running time
Apr 24 2015,positive,the best comic book movie ever made one of the most entertaining movies ever made simply stellar
Apr 23 2015,positive,a film that stood the test of time good performances all around and a storyline that kept you hooked from start to finish marvel managed to make an epic actionadventure film out of a superhero movie which has never been done before thanks to the brilliant and artistic minds of joss whedon and kevin feige this is a film that will always hold up no matter what age you are
Apr 21 2015,positive,slow build up with excellent pay off
Apr 21 2015,negative,extremely overrated with lots of love a rudimentary plot predictable story and development plagued with bad acting and not nearly as entertaining as one might have thought or some of its predecessors that led to this gigantic waste of time the avengers was a great disappointment and visually it looks like a tv movie
Apr 20 2015,positive,i dont care what people say about this movie for me it is perfect because after the six years of waiting and the trailers and teases unlike many other movies this one lived up to four years of hype and it had great characters because having a room full of six different heroes plus samuel l jackson who is also a superhero in real life their are going to be arguments and possibly fights i have to say that this movie was the best of marvel and my favourite movie of all time
Apr 20 2015,positive,one of the best superhero films ive ever seen not only in the marvel universe but this competes with the dark knight for best superhero movie of the 21st century
Apr 18 2015,positive,marvel gets everything right in their power house super bowl of a film as everything is brought together as the avengers assemble marvel does an excellent job of tying things together from all their previous films and setting up the future of their cinematic universe the viewers are graced with an amazing storyline amazing action sequences and realism the avengers has depth and so many memorable scenes that will be remembered for many many years
Apr 18 2015,positive,this a awesome movie everything is prefect from beginning to end i just love it really really love it great action good characters and the best crossover ever so you better check it out
Apr 16 2015,positive,ive always thought this was a great movie but i was disappointed to some extent because i think they could have done more with the new one coming out i am hoping i will enjoy it even more than this one i felt that it was uneven and served more as a premature iron man 3 than an avengers movie looking at the productive things the avengers do its amazing how much iron man actually does they capture loki iron man fix the ship iron man defeat some of the chitauri whaleship things 23 iron man and stop a nuclear weapon from destroying nyc iron man he has arguably the coolest shot in the film with captain americas shield deflection and the main battle takes place on a skyscraper with his name on the side of it he has all the best lines though hulk is a close competitor with physical humor he runs the show looking at the others black widow relieves hawkeye of lokis control thank goodness since hes such a huge help later on and closes the portal nick fury shoots down one of the nukecarrying planes and assembles them all in his defense hulk saves iron man which is constructive because without him who knows what ultron would be like captain america saves some civilians in a bank and gives instructions so i understand his value thor shows up and hawkeye kind of does too however its so heavily iron man that i found it distracting thankfully iron man is my favorite i think that marvel knows robert downey jr is the financial safety glue holding this thing together so i enjoyed the movie but i dont think it was all it could have been
Apr 16 2015,positive,this movie was a lot of fun and there were tons of character interactions which was the major high point for me the low point the movie wasnt very serious but it doesnt have to be this movie successfully brings the marvel franchise together and it is worth seeing no matter your level of fandom
Apr 14 2015,positive,it has its flaws but overall its a very enjoyable film and is one of the best comictofilm adaptations ever
Apr 13 2015,positive,78 on my tomatometer
Apr 13 2015,positive,just absolutely amazing but coulson dies 
Apr 13 2015,positive,brilliant movie one of the best from marvel up to avengers age of ultron
Apr 12 2015,positive,good movie i want to watch the sequel
Apr 8 2015,negative,words cant describe how much i hate this movie of the 2  hours this film consist of about 20 minutes are solidly entertaining with exception to rdj ruffalo and hiddleston the acting blows and is unintentionally campy then again with dialogue as bad as what this movie has you cant blame the actors when im always angry is a films most memorable line then its probably a bad movie i might like this movie more or dislike it less if it wasnt so overrated
Apr 6 2015,positive,even better than i thought itd be the introduction of loki in the beginning was fastpaced and exciting then it slowed down quite a bit into a wellacted drama more good action and then slow drama again finally the last quarter was actionpacked the movie gives all heroes involved good time to shine and neglects none of them i was totally sold at loki being a very credible villain even more than he was in the movie thor
Apr 6 2015,negative,unless you are bias towards the characters this is just more transformer filth
Apr 6 2015,positive,a whole bunch of immense action and explosives thats really all that anyone wants and they achieved it
Apr 3 2015,positive,this movie is going to be cool
Apr 1 2015,positive,tough big and slick a great summer slice of kick ass action and an ambition fulfilled marvel has raised the bar to a new standard
Mar 29 2015,positive,now i rarely rate films a perfect score but the avengers is a film i truly love even though i know it is not a perfect film it is for me  the cast is great and works perfectly together the action draw dropping the effects great and it is also surprisingly hilarious at times it truly feels like a comic book plastered onto the screen in the best way possible
Mar 29 2015,positive,great movie cant wait for sequel
Mar 27 2015,positive,the movie was good but it wasnt that good its the stuff saturday morning cartoons are made of theres nothing to really say about the movie just like theres not much you can say about an episode of ninja turtles the characters were there they did stuff stuff got done to them but they got their stuff back and kicked the stuffing out of loki the god of no distinguishable features i laughed i cried i learned a little about myself then i went home and fantasized about a 50 foot tall scarlett johnansson terrorizing tokyo and fighting mechajohnansson on top of the empire state building
Mar 24 2015,positive,im no comic book aficionado but i liked the original iron man film a lot thor left me mostly cold except loki and captain america was ok and though it pains me to say so about samuel l jackson i really dont care about nick fury why is he there  so this was fine i still really like iron man and mark ruffalo is fantastic as hulk while joss whedon did a pretty good job of keeping me entertained and interested for so long but the climactic 35 felt like 350 minutes crashing and bashing and destroying a whole city without apparently hurting any actual people and thwarting this worst threat to the universe in barely half an hour was simply beyond stupid  great moments and scenes but plenty of filler and rubble in between should have been shorter except for the postcredits surprise that was beautiful can i just watch the highlights next time
Mar 22 2015,positive,no birds no planes and definitely no optimus prime here just a great big grab bag of intricately synchronized action scenes and i must say pretty darn good humor and its all for our entertainment so live it up when you get in that theater   spoilers the avengers are all sommuned together to stop the diabolical and powerhungry adopted brother of thor loki whom has brought war upon our precious constantly threatened planet earth and he is not above bringing along an alien army to bring the human race to its knees this is a plan that is not in the favor of our heroes hulk iron man thor captain america hawkeye and um  the black widow im still trying to wrap my head around why she was included in the bunch but i digress  the film is a champion made up of champions each in their own right only a few of them as few as they already are seem to get along with each other captain america hawkeye and the black widow are each soldiers so the play by the rules very well thor and iron man not so much and well oh im not going to ruin those goofy scenes for you the only universal character here seems to be bruce banner aka the hulk whom never picks a side with anyone he is only there for his research and not the other guy but i fear have have already said too much as there are some films you should read up on first mainly sequels weve been watching previously for the last 4 years the avengers is logistically a great payoff and is definately earnest of a thorough lookover but no more spoilers  unless you expect loki to conquer the human race and defeat the avengers and anhihilate the sheild devision a world where our heroes all die and our apocolypse is brought on by yet another michael bay installment and his fierce transformers these hopes and requests shall all be honored in the avengersjust saying   that being said i leave you with a quote from film critic david edelstein in new york magazine regarding the relentless action scenes from the avengers comiccon nerds will have multiple orgasms  have fun boys
Mar 22 2015,positive,quite simply the best superhero movie ever joss whedon the master behind buffy the vampire slayer and firefly put together all of these epic characters without it feeling forced or weird each character maintains their own individuality and somehow it all works together the balance of humor seriousness and action was just right
Mar 21 2015,positive,this ultimate heroteam up is spectacular in every sense of the word it is a visual masterpiece actionpacked brilliant performances engaging storyline and provides the necessary amount of comicrelief from the characters we love to make it a film to be enjoyed by a widerange of audiences
Mar 20 2015,positive,the 2nd best superhero film ever amazing film
Mar 20 2015,positive,this movie is neither as good nor as bad as its hype  for starters there are not too many characters to keep track of because each one has gotten their own movie in the past therefore eliminating the need for backstory also the use of loki as a catch all villain is charmingly anachronistic how does loki fight the hulk he doesnt  more than either of these things however is an overall lack of energy the movie is designed like a video game or military campaign with very little explanation of what loki did wrong or why we should care and the first casualty of all the comic book violence is the audiences attention span
Mar 20 2015,positive,the avengers has a perfect tone its dark when it needs to be dark its funny when it needs to be funny this movie never loses pace or goes over the top with anything everything this movie has to offer is handled perfectly
Mar 17 2015,positive,awesome movie with good special effects and legitimum to the comics
Mar 15 2015,negative,people complain about the transformers movies so much but this is the same shit
Mar 13 2015,positive,great movie by marvel and disney i really loveed the storyline
Mar 13 2015,positive,some of the buildup takes a little long and the plot can be a bit flimsy at times but the spectacle here is amazing and the actors are typically strong this was the first marvel movie i saw in the theater and it has stuck with me for a while my expectations are high for age of ultron verdict a
Mar 13 2015,positive,marvels the avengers is fantastic after setting up the universe with iron man 2008 iron man 2 2010 thor 2011 and captain america the first avenger 2011 this is definitely worth the wait   robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth and mark ruffalo have great chemistry and great fun playing their respective roles scarlett johansson and jeremy renner are great as black widow and hawkeye and they definitely kick some ass tom hiddleston makes a great villain as loki menacing and just plain evildo i dare say hes as good as the joker from the dark knight 2008  a movie worth waiting for definitely the best summer blockbuster of 2012 cannot wait to see more avengers movies coming up
Mar 12 2015,positive,the worlds greatest heroes still owned by marvel and not in dc are together and they kick ass in a great well directed movie
Mar 11 2015,negative,such a disappointment after all the hype built up the avengers fails to hit the bar its underwhelming poorly written i never gave a crap about captain america black widow or hawkeye hell the guy playing galaga was more interesting every scene ends in some sort of suspension and that element gets really annoying faster than nick fury yelling at the avengers and dont get me started on the score the avengers is over rated
Mar 9 2015,positive,joss whedon sure knows how to make amazing movies with this being his grand opus film the effects are outstanding and they did a great job making the hulk look realistic the soundtrack is really good and the acting is terrific with mark ruffalo being the best bruce bannerhulk to date the plot may seem similar to transformers dark of the moon but unlike transformers this movie actually has a brain and it doesnt rely on the action the action scenes are exciting to watch and it has some hilarious scenes that we thought couldnt be any more funnier the interplay between iron man bruce banner thor and captain america is surprisingly well done and is also funny which i thought it couldnt be done as movies tend to rely on one character instead of many characters the direction is great and it has a very well written script that has some memorable lines that people are going to say the movie develops the villain more and also develop hawkeye which is really cool marvels the avengers is my favorite marvel movie and im excited to see whats in store for avengers age of ultron
Mar 7 2015,positive,really funny movie entertaining i highly recommend it good plot
Mar 1 2015,positive,great movie great acting
Feb 27 2015,positive,i love this movie  full stars for sure  this movie made me fall in love with marvel  definitely recommend this for anyone who loves action movies
Feb 24 2015,positive,puny dc marvel after releasing this movie and shattering the box office
Feb 24 2015,positive,one of the best movies to come out for a long time there is actually a plot unlike many current action movies they did not buy into the lie that there needs to be constant fighting and an explosion every thirty seconds to keep an audiences attention the characters were well rounded and they flow well with the other marvel movies the references are great and well timed but if you have not seen the other marvel movies the film still makes sense the one liners and back and forth banter are tasteful and well timed there is plenty of intense action and fighting but not too much as to be over the top the visual effects are stunning and the sound meshes with the action perfectly it is all mostly believable allowing for the suspension of disbelief as there are aliens and a hulk the lighting is spot on dark when it needs to be but never so dark as to be confusing the consistency of jokes and bringing things back later in the movie to further the plot is brilliant the effects as hawkeye wakes up from lokis control are stunning the camera angles are all around good and there is no unnecessary hokey camera shaking as is now inexplicably popular yet tasteless this movie is undoubtably a classic this is a movie you can marvel at i am both excited and nervous for age of ultron to come out excited because i am an avengers fan and nervous because i am afraid that the directors and producers will follow the pattern of the captain america series where the first one was great and the second one had little plot value and meaningless explosions every thirty seconds with an overly convenient deus ex machina i have been following movies for a while now and with very few exceptions i e how to train your dragon the sequel is either terrible and desperate or ruins the first movie we shall see
Feb 22 2015,positive,amazing the action affects even the cliff hanger
Feb 21 2015,neutral,a bland 2 hour toy commercial with no story or conflict between the characters remind me again why joss whedon is a good director
Feb 20 2015,positive,sensational film that brings infamous marvel superheroes to life definitely one of the films that has changed cinema history joss whedon has successfully created what is my favorite film by far with an outstanding cast including robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johanson jeremy renner tom hiddleston colbie smulders and samuel l jackson an amazing storyline with great subplots as to how the heroes all join together to defeat the villainous loki and obtain the cosmic cubetesseract
Feb 19 2015,positive,the eleventh commandment thou shalt love the avengers
Feb 18 2015,positive,i really enjoyed this movie

Feb 7 2015,positive,i wish there was more than five stars to give this movie was so good i went to the cinema twice to see it as with all marvels this is awesome the fight scenes are awesome the acting is awesome and they did a really good job of putting the cast together this film is one of my favourite marvel films of all time highly recommended
Feb 4 2015,positive,great a genuine block buster perfect for 11 year olds looking for an introduction to the super hero genre the performances are nothing special neither is the plot but thats not what these kind of films are about the characters are fantastic its entertaining and it made my day i think in this case thats what really matters
Feb 3 2015,neutral,wouldve been 5 if there were spiderman
Jan 30 2015,positive,assembled with incredible style full review later
Jan 29 2015,positive,fun superhero movie combining all the strengths and maybe some weaknesses of all the recent marvel movies all the heroes are actually well represented here even hulk who hasnt had anything recent gets a decent storyline going the only quibbles i had about this is that it gets itself wound up in mythical and technical gobbledegook at times making us pause and twiddle our thumbs
Jan 27 2015,positive,enjoyably engaging and humourous if you can forget that there is actually a world outside manhattan in the showdown then it also manages to draw you into a surprisingly credible fantasy world
Jan 26 2015,positive,best superhero film ever
Jan 26 2015,positive,probably the second best marvel movie to date i personally feel right after captain america ws
Jan 18 2015,positive,from the stunning visual effects its thrilling action setpieces its wellrounded and developed cast of characters and its impressive scope joss whedons avengers shine and dazzle throught and make this nearly 2 hour and a half rollercoaster ride worth watching over and over again

Jan 8 2015,positive,if you give a friend a copy of this movie and he was a fan of the iron man thor and captain america movies as well as the hulk and he had no idea this movie existed he will shit his pants no exaggeration
Jan 8 2015,positive,brilliant high action film
Jan 8 2015,positive,cannot believe critics give it 5stars
Jan 5 2015,positive,very hard to find fault in this the most epic of all the marvel cinematic universe with this amazing ensemble cast great humor some suprisingly good acting aswell as well as a director who clearly knows what hes doing the only problem i had with this is that with such a multitude of characters there often is not  enough screen time to go around
Jan 4 2015,negative,just lots of explosions and a onedimensional story bad guy is bad amazing lots of people found this enteraining at least but personally i was bored
Jan 4 2015,positive,grade low 810  avengers assemble is a marvel movie that produces what you expect epic action massive effects and a crazy villain yes the avengers come along very welcome to the film industry and produce one film that truly is worthy of such a comic book based piece there were times i didnt feel it was quite as good as some feel it is but nevertheless felt it to be a safely fine film and here below is why so  the story is big lots of things go on and it does really draw you in well it contains some good old action and even though the effects are overused the fight scenes do look good and produce thrills i enjoyed the fact that it used comedy to ease us through the movie and it really comes in handy with characters like iron man who just has the best lines and can make even the more serious moments funny  the acting on show is well class robert downey jr as iron man is by far the best and although i am glad the movie gave everyone a fair amount of screen time a bit more of him wouldnt have gone a miss i like chris evans and chris hemsworth and scarlett johansson contributes rather well to the cause as well tom hiddlestone does do well although the overall crazy idea of his costume makes him hard to believe and almost as if they were trying to make literally look like he is in a comic  joss wheedon directs and co writes rather well and does try hard with his trade and all credit goes to him with the not just the fight scenes but also the quick one liners we see so often in this the special effects are probably the biggest thing about this film and after a while they did seem to make me a little dizzy if not just sick of constant effects this movie must have had a hell of a lot of green screens  i guess when it comes to my criticism the effects do get a lot of the flakthere isnt too much flak by the way i didnt like the parts where shield were involved and i felt they make this movie almost too silly the superheroes get away with having style but shield for me drag this film down just a little tiny bit  if you like your marvel or for that sake comic book themed movies then you may like this more than any before seen it has all the things i would say you need in a superhero movie and with the heroes of different movies converging together it makes for an exciting start if you feel like me and dont like to see constant effects then give it a miss they arent bad by any stretch they are some of the best ever but appear too much  overall i gave it a low 810 and felt it was safely there not quite near being a high 810 but the film is still an impressive show my review may seem very negative but in truth this film does grow on you and as the story goes a long you not only warm to the cast and characters but also you feel you actually want to be there experiencing all the madness yet again marvel have made a movie that people like and if they continue like this well it wouldnt surprise me if people look back and call these classics
Jan 3 2015,positive,the avengers has much to offer in action character struggles and story and it entertains people everywhere including me not 100 percent substance though
Jan 3 2015,positive,chris evans really rocks as captain america in this movie and i cant wait to watch the other movies where he plays this role  the acting was good the writing special effects and score didnt miss a beat    in the tradition of alfred hitchcock cameo by stan lee was fitting
Jan 1 2015,positive,action sequences worth the price of admission but the rest kind of drags
Jan 1 2015,positive,the physical manifestation of a product that screams out fun
Dec 30 2014,positive,in my opinion the best comic book movie ever

Dec 20 2014,positive,pretty interesting thank goodness there wasnt much pepper and i still hate hulk not a mark ruffalo fan either but i thought everyone else was pretty damn good the gag reel is hilarious  i found it pretty interesting that hulk managed to find his pants in that rubble clean pants no less lol looking forward to the next installment
Dec 19 2014,neutral,marvels the avengers further exacerabtes marvels reliance on humdrum generic plotlines that fall flat of anything as usual the villains are wasted and used to dismal effect and there are moments with heroes simply standing in a massive battle so that the camera can get a long shot of them well just standing this film does have its pleasures robert downey jr as iron man mark ruffalo as bruce banner not hulk samuel l jackson and probably downey jr some more i mean everyone including many critics said this was a fantastic superhero movie and from what i can see im not entirely sure why i mean some people have been calling this marvels answer to the dark knight maybe the film actually has a power to turn your brain to mush thats the only explanation thank the lord im immune this mashup is overstuffed overlong and overly derivative frankly watchable is pushing it
Dec 16 2014,negative,incredibly predictable corny and clichéd
Dec 16 2014,positive,great superhero movie they put it all together in this one
Dec 14 2014,positive,this movie is good like the cars awesome movie
Dec 13 2014,positive,overhyped and overrated the avengers fails to offer anything that builds on or expand any of its characters previous cinematic entries
Dec 13 2014,positive,well done action film with a respectable enough character development
Dec 13 2014,negative,i dont get the popularity of this film its just a load of explosions with very little in the way of story its a very forgettable picture
Dec 11 2014,positive,apparently dreams come true marvels the avengers is probably the best superhero movie with lots of humor great fighting sequences and a fantastic storywith earths mightiest heroes fighting to restore balance but also having difficulties working with each other at first almost every member of the audience is in for a treat
Dec 9 2014,positive,the best explosion movie ever
Dec 7 2014,positive,this the superhero movie that everyone wanted to see everything is well done it has few mistakes but they are solved in the other movies and the explanation is pretty well sustained all the characters are balanced in terms of screen time and the action sequences are cool and flashy
Dec 6 2014,positive,my favourite movie lots of action and a great script cast was amazing
Dec 6 2014,neutral,absolutely love the graphics and artistry behind this movie theres no doubt that this movie is excellent but i really just cannot get into fantasy
Dec 4 2014,positive,this is not a bad movie at all but i do not see why people say that this is one of the greatest movies ever is it your favorite movie of all time fair enough just choose your descriptive words carefully to not confuse me is the story good yes the acting good music good direction good action great but i am not as entertained by this as most people in general let me get it out of the way i am not a marvel haterdc fanboy i love both marvel and dc it is just this movie i am a little iffy about overall it is an entertaining movie and i do enjoy it
Dec 2 2014,positive,i have pretty much zero interest in super heroes and find it annoying that adults obsess about what are essentially childrens characters but especially having watched all marvel films up to this one in succession for what it is i cant fault it it all and this is speaking as someone who doesnt know or care anything about the history of the comics and characters really well made and really really fun to watch
Dec 1 2014,positive,great classic super hero film bbc one are great for showing it this xmas been waiting to see it for ages but it was worth the wait

Nov 25 2014,neutral,okay for me review to come
Nov 23 2014,positive,marvels the avengers is an excellent film it is about earths mightiest heroes who must come together and learn to fight as a team if they are to stop the mischievous loki and his alien army from enslaving humanity robert downey jr and chris evans give amazing performances the screenplay is well written joss whedon did a great job directing this movie i enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure marvels the avenger is a must see
Nov 23 2014,positive,this film is just fantastic it is a modern day wonder to behold how perfectly balanced the characters their journey and the action set pieces are
Nov 21 2014,positive,this is the quintessential comic book movie being as the majority comic book fans didnt think it would ever happen and now that it has it has become an instant classic its a piece of filmmaking that strives to capture the imagination nothing more or less and it does that with a flawless ease  joss whedon has made something thoroughly impressive here not only is it a fun summer blockbuster its just a genuinely well made film this is our generations star wars because its a talented filmmaker working with rich and creative source material unbelievable visual effects an allstar cast and a consistently fun and exciting atmosphere  i couldnt have possibly enjoyed this movie more its one of the best summer movies ive ever seen
Nov 21 2014,positive,great movie wonderful effects and cgi a really good plot and the conflict between the villain and also some internal conflict between the main characters was really entertaining i love seeing the earths mightyist heroes fight against a charismatic and joking villain very nice superheroes in new york
Nov 21 2014,positive,incredibly awesome and entertaining this movie showed what the entertainment is all about
Nov 20 2014,positive,this movie is good although it is nowhere near worthy of all the praise it gets for all of its goofy and fun dialogue the film suffers from severe problems including an over reliance on a macguffin and an ending battle that seems to come out of nowhere the film seems to rest on its laurels too often on the fact that its a huge crossover event for all the buildup samuel l jacksons character seems underused   its not all bad its actually pretty good fun the movie definatly knows how to strike a good balance between drama and comedy and i did genuinely enjoy the characters its not a great movie but its not a bad one either its the definition of a three star movie
Nov 18 2014,neutral,its really not good i love marvel but i hate all the dumb shield stuff couldnt it just be superheroes with no shield
Nov 17 2014,neutral,generally entertaining    are people not tired of regular humans being thrown around like rag dolls and not even getting a scratch  i walk to get a coffee and take on more damage than these assholes that are thrown from a build and hit by a bus  its so so so so unrealistic  its too much
Nov 17 2014,positive,this movie is slightly overrated the ending is amazing although the first 90 minutes are actually quite boring
Nov 16 2014,positive,in my opinion the best comic book movie ever with great action and effects one of the best movie experiences ever
Nov 16 2014,positive,marvel studios at one of their best efforts the avengers is a movie that the fans of the classic heroes will surly cry for the first time i saw this i pretty much didnt really see any of the other separate marvel movies before this one but i got to say this is one rare movie that really focuses on and mixes great action swift camera movements and hilarious touches of humor in one package for a movie thats well over two hours there isnt very many slow scenes except maybe some action sequences and it feels like the story moves along nice and quick all the heroes and their actors all had their unique parts as with the other marvel movies its always fun to spot stan lee from the avengers getting together to the battle in new york city it was a fun journey while it lasted all i got to say is that the hulk was visually updated and looked amazing in this movie it is a swell film in the marvel cinematic universe
Nov 16 2014,positive,absolutely incredible
Nov 15 2014,positive,i think a lot of people have this movie overrated but it was good enough to get four stars
Nov 15 2014,positive,fun film but highly overrated i cant believe this made more money than the dark knight or the guardians of the galaxy
Nov 15 2014,positive,while the plot is nothing revolutionary marvels the avengers is packed with ballsout action and bright humour to make for a heroic spectacle
Nov 11 2014,positive,hands down the best marvel movie ever it has great action and story
Nov 10 2014,positive,a great way to start off such a new kind of superhero movie that was so sensational it had tremendous action stunning visual affects and an outstanding score
Nov 8 2014,positive,this movie was crazy goodi never thought i would have liked it so muchan amazing castcombined with spectacular action scenesa team of interesting and very different superheroesa good story and a scenestealing villain is what made this movie a mustwatchi enjoyed every minute of it from the very first till the very lastyou certainly will have your favorite superhero but still you will realize as they have already done sothat in the end only if they work together they will achieve their goalgreat moviei will probably watch it many more times
Nov 7 2014,positive,its exactly what it should be and everything more
Nov 5 2014,positive,great film cant say its one of my favorites but i still think its a lot of fun like a lot of marvel films action  story but this one is still pretty fun deep as a kitty pool but you can have a hell of a good time in one
Nov 5 2014,positive,the kind of film you can just watch over and over again joss whedon and marvel studios have really outdone themselves with the latest mcu instalment and the first live action avengers film great performances are given although a bad story you will never not be entertained  one of the best films for me in the 21st century  bring on age of ultron
Nov 5 2014,negative,comic books are awesome superhero movies are not when theyre mass produced and streamlined with a subpar script and overwhelming effects that only seek shock value
Nov 4 2014,positive,the best marvel and superhero movie of all time
Nov 2 2014,positive,there could have been a little bit more action but i love how everything was staged and it kept me interested
Nov 2 2014,positive,i enjoyed this more than the other marvel superhero films but i still prefer the christopher nolan style of comic book movie
Nov 1 2014,positive,keeps getting better with every viewing really fun and funny entertainment  whedon has taken the aspects of superhero films which are weaknesses and has made them highly likeable and enjoyable
Oct 30 2014,positive,a very long film could of done with a big edit it really does drag then it pulls you in then drags on again its good colorful but dull in places
Oct 29 2014,positive,great characters epic action scenes and a kick ass villain make this one of the best superhero films of all time
Oct 29 2014,positive,the avengers film manages to have exceptional visual effects and a great strong plot to drive the film in the right direction but the cheesy jokes just make the film feel a bit like a kiddie flick
Oct 24 2014,positive,awsome sperhero movie
Oct 24 2014,positive,best superhero movie ever epic ending to phase i of marvel
Oct 23 2014,neutral,so this movie was a huge disappointment joss whedon a usually great writerdirector gave us one of the most unexpectedly generic blockbusters ive ever seen how could a movie starring not 1 not 2 not 3 but 6 superheroes be this average its got every cliche one could expect from a giant battle in nyc to end the movie to an absolutely idiotic plot hatched by the cheesy villain to the minor supporting characters death motivating the heroes to win the climactic battle however this movie isnt all bad the hulk is animated beautifully and robert downey jr gives a solid lead performance in addition the movie doesnt feel overcrowded at all despite the large ensemble cast filled with one note characters all in all i didnt hate this movie but i have to say it really wasnt outstanding or unique in any way other than the fact that it did manage to successfully connect the larger universe im probably giving this a higher score than it deserves but what the hell it was really cool seeing iron man fight captain america and the hulk smashing the crap out of loki was genius too bad the rest of the movie wasnt that great 510
Oct 22 2014,positive,this movie was hilarious and intelligent and a credit to all the earlier movies it draws upon highly recommend
Oct 21 2014,positive,a one of a kind superhero film with the best superheroes ever with terrific performances exhilarating action scenes and some great dialouge a terrific film not to be missed what so ever grade a
Oct 18 2014,positive,one of the better marvel adaptations
Oct 18 2014,positive,good real good but not up to the hype still a worthy member of the marvel superhero group
Oct 15 2014,positive,good but its igsactly same as all the other marvel films really cheesy
Oct 13 2014,positive,the avengers is one entertaining as heck blockbuster that will please all audiences thanks to endearing performances lots of fast action and great effects
Oct 13 2014,positive,saw it in the theater on opening night and loved it
Oct 12 2014,positive,sharp writing and great action and camraderie of the main cast make this a true mustsee
Oct 11 2014,positive,this was funny action and had awesome superheroes from individual movies that came together this was one of the best movies ive seen
Oct 10 2014,positive,a film many thought would be hard to pull off joss whedon not only manges to accomplish this  but does so compellingly with this huge cast just about everyone gets their chance to shine well except for hawkeye avengers has its issues just like any other film but manages to keep you entertain and has bit of something for everyone i could watch hulk smash over and over again
Oct 9 2014,positive,at the core of a great film is an even greater story  at the core of every great story are even greater characters chemistry and a strong foundation of source material the avengers have been around since the early 60s and the characters even far beyond that personally in the midst of my parents divorcing i decided to take a second chance on comic books after dipping my toe into captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew in march 1982 while living in broken arrow ok during one of my many many trips to quiktrip to either buy ice cream donuts or penny candy while playing ms pacman  it wasnt a wonder why i became fat around this time  fast forward 2 years to may 1984 when i purchased avengers vol 1 number 243 mostly due to my being intrigued with captain america  i instantly fell in love with comics and needed them to help me cope with the massive changes going on around me at the time    for the next 34 years i was obsessed with comic books which centered completely around the avengers like captain america iron man thor secret wars etc  i read everything i could and became immersed into the years and years of avengers history  even as girls and music became more interesting to me than comics i still always had an affinity for the avengers  at one point after beginning to earn a good living about 15 years ago i tried collecting every issue ever made  i got about 95 there when comics started being graded by cgc and guaranteeing condition  i then sold most of my mediocre conditioned books and wanted to collect 9210 near mintmint copies of every issue  only the expense far outweighed my dedication and to this day i only have a few    my heart has always been with the avengers though  my heart was broken when the first avengers cartoon series in 19992000 was an embarrassment  just a pathetic series  however when the xmen movies did well and other titles like daredevil elektra and fantastic four started to be released i was excited to eventually see at least captain america iron man etc on the big screen  never did i think a studio would be ambitious enough to attempt the avengers as a whole  then came iron mana b character at best perfectly cast robert downey jr as a spoton tony stark  and it was huge then came the news that marvel had owned the properties again and had a strategy to deliver individual movies leading up to an allencompassing avengers movie  no way i thought  oh this was bound to get screwed up  and frankly there was probably no way to please me a diehard avengers fan on the big screen  just no way  especially after ang lees atrocious hulk movie  surely hulk would be left out of the mix    then came edward norton as a superb bruce banner in the incredible hulk movie that hit all the right buttons continued the iron man storyline eluded to the super soldier serum tying it all together with shield  the final scene in the incredible hulk showed us a meditating bruce banner with an evil grin seemingly embracing and enjoying the monster within which told us diehard fans that he must be in the control of loki norse god of mischief as was the case in the classic avengers 1 issue from the early 60s  could they be setting up loki and the hulk as the villains of the avengers movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book  then came iron man 2  a poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more nick fury black widow and avengers talk  way too rushed and thus what caused favreaus exit as director  my interest was still high but i became cautious as the humor of iron man began leaning this whole thing in a direction i had hoped wouldnt come to pass  then at the end of iron man 2 thors hammer in the middle of the desert sparked my interest as designed again  then came thor  i was really worried about this one  a norse god among all these hightech very human heroes  given the extremely strong representation of batman by the nolan films this movie had the ability to throw the whole thing into fullblown camp  however i was pleasantly surprised  introducing hawkeye helped a lot as well  then at the end with loki seeing through the eyes of erik gave us fans another glimpse of loki controlling humans which sparked the interest of the hulk again    finally captain america perfectly cast chris evans and developed a nearperfect story around the red skull and the cosmic cube  the foundation was almost full strength and the avengers movie was on the horizon  could it meet the expectations of the film fans  better yet could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the decades of comic book fans  over the past few months ive seen some of the most uninteresting trailers for the avengers  i have been so worried thinking that the movie ive waited 28 years for was going to be an absolute disaster  trailer after trailer it didnt look any better  did joss royally screw this thing up  well i saw it opening night tonight  the trailers show the tiniest fraction of what happens in this absolute masterpiece  sure its actionpacked  its expected to be  sure its got funny moments  its expected to especially with robert downey jr as a leading man  what joss whedon did was take the greatest care of characters since nolans batman series  the interaction between the characters the way they deal with their own personal concerns and flaws and how they come together as a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes    to most people it might be looked at as an enjoyable popcorn film a great kickoff to the summer movie season to me a diehard multidecade fanatic of this comic these films these characters and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and honestly impossible to achieve in my eyes  joss proved me ohsowrong  when i began seeing the very nigh praise the 93 on rottentomatoes etc my low expectations became super high expectations how often are expectations like that ever met  well i can at least say they werent met  they were left in the dust exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured  bless marvel whedon and these actors for treating multiple generations of fans to a perfect example of how it can be done right  sure nolan has become the gold standard but whedon showed everyone that marvel can do it too    my only regret is that edward norton couldnt reprise his role as bruce banner  of the 3 bruces he was the best  mark ruffalo was the worst  i like him as an actor and he had some of the mannerisms but edward captured the intellectual frightened and loner aspect of bruce banner perfectly  hulk however stole the show  without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie i will just say that joss inclusion of hulk in the manner in which he was was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae    while i cant imagine them topping this one ive been so strongly surprised i would never say never  the setup at the end of the avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to go  i even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie but that was a product of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who wrote the film  bring it on marvel  excelsior  nuff said
Oct 8 2014,positive,very good marvel film all the charterers were paid well though true marvel fans might not like the story the new hulk was epic
Oct 6 2014,neutral,i didnt enjoy the avengers nearly as much as other recent marvel movies
Oct 2 2014,positive,while there solo adventures on film are good by there own right marvel brings the avengers to film with the help of the only person that can bring misfist and in this case superheroes together than mr firefly himself awesome movie
Oct 1 2014,positive,enough colourful action to make your inner eightyearold squeal and enough wit to keep your more reserved side entertained topjob whedon
Oct 1 2014,positive,really wellwritten an action adventure comic book on the big screen joss whedon does a great job of bringing together a group of super heroes having their personalities clash as egos collide then unifying them against a common enemy to save the earth well done
Sep 29 2014,positive,now with all this hype i have come to watch it in cinemas because it has its early release here i completely say this is the most perfect film as a summer blockbuster this is a comic super hero film at its perfection the perfect film in terms of characterization they did make each and every character very memorable the humor in this film is top notch they have one liners that are very catchy and very funny i freaking love the pace the camera shots are magnificent theres no shaky bullsht or whatsoeverin terms of characters i love the improvements they did on this i love the rivals going on between each others intention the last part is epic i love the part where each avenger is fighting on a a one take shot that was bone chilling and by the time when iron man tells everyone hes bringing up the party and capt america says to hulk now it is the time to become angry i freaking love that part i love the details in terms of visual effects you can see a very detailed cgi hulk compared to the previous hulk films this film is not all about the story telling but this is a perfect example of an awesome characterization everyone just proves their roles thus joss whedon gave a marvelous job on how roles can be fitted with all these all star casts in a 2 hour film some say it has a familiar 2nd half of the last transformer movie who cares whedon does the exact execution than michael bays trash it has more heart a lot of love great execution great pacing great humor what can i say more joss whedon is on everyones radar as he is our new savior a superhero extravaganza that surpasses every single marvel film up to date still my heart goes to the dark knight as my favorite superhero flick but then marvels the avengers exceeded all the cgi blockbusters which is really beyond imagination superbly an amazing experience 55
Sep 28 2014,positive,i dont give a five stars review simple because the second time that i saw it i did not get as excited as the first time really entertaining and actionpacked
Sep 28 2014,positive,a modern movie about superheroes that actually knows that people dont want special effects but instead seek inter character relationsthis movie is a masterpiece
Sep 26 2014,positive,often a movie does not live up to its fan expectations this one did big time people will argue that the first 20 minutes are boring but it is all for the sake of character development and this is well balanced by excellent humour throughout puny god fantastic action the battle of new york and excellent acting from the entire cast even the characters and actors we are seeing for the first time mark ruffalo this movie is worth everything you pay to see it please let the sequel be just as good
Sep 25 2014,positive,marvels the avengers by jeff meckstroth if somebody gave me one word to describe the movie marvels the avengers it would unquestionably be loud not the kind of loud that makes your ears bleed though the kind of loud that makes a room swell up with excitement josh weldon directs a fantastic film from beginning to end with big explosions and vivid images as well as touching twist you wouldnt expect the avengers is a thrill from beginning to end oh yeah and i forgot to mention this blockbuster includes not one not two but four major superheros as well as your kickboxing bow shooting kick ass shield agents this movie truly holds nothing back when it comes to saving humanity two superheros has been done before but packing so many personalities on one side of the goodbad line is one bold move this movie will leave you choosing sides between the superhero casts captain america chris evans a wwi superhero iron man robert downey jr a inventorindustrialist thor chris hemsworth the pagan god of lightning and hulk mark ruffalo a scientist with a slight anger problem marvel did an excellent job of casting these superheroes as they all provide just the right characteristics in their roles i truly feel this movie would not have been complete without the casting of samuel l jackson as the nick fury the leader of shield as a huge fan of samuel jackson i found this to be one of his better action film performances his badass persona on screen was a perfect fit for this commanding role marvel had a genius and bold idea for this movie set back into action in the first iron man movie and did an excellent job of carrying it out in no such way did i feel you had to see every marvel movie that lead up to this movie though marvel did a great job of making the movie suitable for newcomers as well as long time fans from the start they did an excellent job of introducing every character at the perfect moment weldon was able to introduce each character as well as their personalities all at once weldon did a fantastic job of using loki tom hiddleston in every which way a villain could be used loki the god of mischief was truly just that during this movie his ability to twist personalities emotions and egos all against each other was what made this movie more than just special affects and action this touch of emotion gave this big budget film just the right amount of perception everybody knew what they wanted to see from the beginning of this movie the epic battle scene with everyone of the mighty superheroes special powers gelling together to kick bad guy butt the final battle scene in downtown manhattan may just have been the scene everyone was anticipating entering this movie this scene included everything from hulk smashing anything in sight iron man leading air raids on giant fly slugs and captain american being well captain america this battle scene could not have possibly been this epic without josh weldons ability to gel all of this super heroes characteristics together from start to finish this movie was jampacked full with all the action every fan new it would be what really separated this movie from others like it was the touching emotions displayed by the actors and a twisting plot line so if its a friday night and you cant decide what superhero you want to watch kick butt marvels the avengers will satisfy everyone of your bad guy butt kicking needs
Sep 24 2014,positive,entertaining and action packed
Sep 22 2014,positive,still awesome and one of the mcus finest movies of all time

Sep 20 2014,positive,amazing movie one of the best superhero movies ever ive seen it a million times by now and i still love it so much
Sep 20 2014,positive,the avengers takes our marvel heroes and slap it into one movie where they all have fun and kick ass along side the visual action there is a decent story which is enough for a superhero movie
Sep 18 2014,positive,the best movie of the summer of 2012 just hope they improve the hulks look in age of ultron no more of that apish stance he looked a lot better in the incredible hulk 2008 film more fearsome and realistic someone i would be afraid of the avengers hulk i did not feel any fear from him i just couldnt take him seriously he was small flabby weak he kind of had this dumb look on his face although he was fun to watch he was very underwhelming the fight between thor and hulk was way to short and it did not deliver the excitement the thor and ironman fight had black widow was overpowered fighting those aliens that would crush cars as they fell to much screen time went towards tony stark than the others mainly bruce banner and captain america bruce never got a scene alone he was always in a scene with another avenger or shield agent a flashback would have been nice to see for bruce general ross and betty and how he is struggling with that but its a good film overall
Sep 16 2014,positive,with plenty of great action and lots of good characters and funny jokes and oneliners the avengers is a popcorn action flick that will leave you wanting more
Sep 14 2014,positive,best superhero movie ever
Sep 13 2014,positive,the only downfall is that the avengers dont seem to break a sweat however who gives a flying piece of the stark tower this one will be in textbooks 200 years from now if in fact we still consume knowledge that way
Sep 13 2014,positive,chris hemsworth  rdjyes please thats all i have to say about that
Sep 13 2014,negative,i still dont understand what people liked about this movie the plot is weak and the jokes are flat
Sep 12 2014,positive,im not like a huge fan but it was a pretty good movie
Sep 11 2014,positive,apparently dreams come true marvels the avengers is probably the best superhero movie with lots of humor great fighting sequences and a fantastic storywith earths mightiest heroes fighting to restore balance but also having difficulties working with each other at first almost every member of the audience is in for a treat
Sep 8 2014,positive,i like marvels movies when i was small every marvels movie i did watch them all  the heros movie makes me feel like i am escaping the reality this kind of movie can relax me a lot so i decided to watch avengers in this movie there are a lot of heros join together appear on one screen it fascinates me a lot i arouse my curiosity to buy the ticket   in the movie of avengers there are a lot of heroes first of all they dont know each other but then they meet so soon they joint together to fight with their same enemies however in this movie i think the movie dont have much relation between each of the hero although they meet each other they dont have a big relationship like they are individual the part of how they meet is the most interesting part of this movie and it create so jokes that can entertain the audience  the fight of these heroes is really great the post production of this movie is really great they spend much on the effect so it is quit attractive   overall avengers is not bad i think avengers can create more interesting stories such as build more new relationship between those heroes i hope it will have avengers 2 later on
Sep 7 2014,positive,everyone gets to have their piece of the cake and eat it too in this superhero ensemble flick
Sep 7 2014,positive,whole family loves this film
Sep 7 2014,positive,great and all but i cant give it a perfect 5 i wont get specific but i was let down when i saw the movie as people spoke of it like rj was a game changer honestly just exactly what i expected of a superhero team up movie nothing really blew my mind
Sep 4 2014,positive,all the previous marvel movies featuring each superhero were good put them all together and you only expect the avengers to be one thing epic and it was an exciting action movie with a generous dose of laughs
Sep 4 2014,negative,soooo boring it did make me want to watch ironman because i didnt care about anything that was happening
Sep 3 2014,positive,a film that gave us more than what we wanted avengers is great and did not dissapoint people waited for this to happen for decades and they felt lucky
Sep 2 2014,positive,this movie really kicked some serious alien tush  it was so good to watch esp on labor day weekend  i really enjoyed it as much if not more than thor 2 which i saw in theaters  i would definitely recommend it and plan on seeing the next avengers movie
Sep 1 2014,positive,93  score 93100  the good action packed funny 3d is great  the bad no real story
Sep 1 2014,positive,89 the avengers is popcorn entertainment at its purest with just enough action character definition and bona fide comic book nuance to please all audiences  v 84
Sep 1 2014,negative,all the clever banter and expensive cgi in the world cant save these heroes who work harder fighting each other for screen time than fighting tom hiddleston for the generic comicbook epic mcguffin of course no one came to see a legitimately wellmade film as is usually the case with sueprhero movies these days writerdirector joss whedon is painfully aware of the wittiness of his characters oneliners but the sass reaches an unbearable level of pomposity within the first half an hour and there are five halfhours in the film each one longer than the last it is after all the same plot youve seen a zillion times this time with no focus and even less dignity
Aug 31 2014,positive,has there ever been a more highly anticipated or more intensely hyped blockbuster than this as a lifelong and proud comic geek this flick sort of represents the true assimilation of comic book culture into pop culture and this both excites and troubles me part of me is so happy that the superhero is finally such an accepted and popular genre the other sees something that was very intimate to me and my childhood becoming a big popular spectacle all in all though im cool with it because 15 years ago i couldnt have imagined something like the avengers in my wildest dreams  this is the culmination of the last 5 years of marvel films at the end of the first ironman when the idea of an avengers project was hinted at it had the feeling of a glimmer of hope for something far off in the future that would probably never happen but then the incredible hulk did the same thing and then ironman 2 hinted further throwing out hints to captain america and thor bringing the full on and awesome realization that the avengers was an impending reality   for the longest time i was actually very worried about the project how does a studio live up to the insanely skyhigh and probably unrealistic expectations of a film like this it seemed almost too big to succeed add that to the fact that i am not joss whedons biggest fan and that ironman 2 thor and captain america were all somewhat underwhelming and i had some real doubts about whether whedon and marvel studios could deliver on something so built up and so huge then i saw the first trailer and i was sold   upon finally seeing it i can say that my expectations were healthily met the fact that all the major characters have already had their own solo movies enables this film to already have established back stories and character development and can therefore jump right in not only that but many parts of the plot have already been set up and mentioned by the prior films because of this i would highly recommend seeing the above mentioned movies if for no other reason than it will really enhance the characters and the story  the special effects are of course amazing perhaps the most impressive ever seen on screen and i dont say that lightly highly impressive action sequences chalkfull of awesome comic book action with plenty of nods to the source material   the script is hit and miss the opening few scenes are pretty shoddily written i wont lie some pretty wooden dialogue makes it feel very stiff at parts but for the most these moments are few and far between the vast majority of the script is seriously funny and witty honestly this movie is funnier than just about any comedy ive seen in the last couple years there are tons of big laughs that had the theater just about in riots while the humor was great i found it as a bit of a negative as well the plot of the film is a pretty big one that involves some pretty earth shattering implications its a bit hard to balance the seriousness of such things with such funny writing thats not to say that it is unsuccessful in any way but the seriousness of the film is somewhat lessened   as far as the acting goes pretty much everyone is rock solid evans hemsworth and hiddleston are all more comfortable in their roles a second time around newcomer ruffalo is great as bruce banner and the hulk he really conveys the intelligence of the character as well as his inner torment jeremy renner is also very good in a dual villainhero role the whole idea behind this film is the cohesiveness of its characters but if theres one character that really personifies the avengers its downey jrs tony stark hes defined the character twice already but he is even better here his smart ass dialogue and banter really seem to give the film its tone and its overall feel as much as i hate to say it samuel l isnt particularly good as nick fury he just seems to deliver a one note performance scarlett johannson is also not super awesome she just seems a bit out of her league and is overpowered by more assertive characters  the direction score and cinematography are all very solid some exceptions include a couple of dizzying shots and a couple of overpowering moments with the music but again very minimal flaws for the most part it is an expertly constructed and presented film  all in all what the avengers has done is nothing short of amazing when you think about it christopher nolan did not have to deal with these sort of expectations when working on his batman films save the uber anticipated dark knight rises and neither did sam raimi with his original spiderman film the fact that the spotlight was on whedon from minute 1 and he managed to deliver in such a resounding way is really pretty impressive great acting performances witty dialogue incredible special effects and its just plain awesome coolness combine for a must see experience as a lifelong marvel fan i enjoyed this tremendously but this isnt just for us fanboys a few flaws with the script minor acting and some questions about its seriousness knock it from flat out awesome territory but this is a seriously good and action packed extravaganza that has more than lived up to expectations
Aug 31 2014,positive,incredible action packed everyone in the film brings their a game material
Aug 28 2014,positive,an awesome superhero combo flick
Aug 27 2014,positive,cant think of anything that is not good about this fun exciting movie
Aug 24 2014,positive,bar none absolutely the best superhero movie ever made rewatched 21020 when i saw the first guardians i changed my mind and made it the best superhero movie ever
Aug 22 2014,positive,for every marvel fan out there this movie is the greatest gift of all time marvels greatest superheroes unite to face an unstoppable threat to protect mankind one of my favourite movies of all time
Aug 22 2014,positive,the marvels one and only best movie in the world it deserves to be the best movie in the world
Aug 21 2014,positive,a fun film to be sure but the action is to over the top and at the same time lacking while the writing and production is top notch as is the acting it is the direction and pacing that really hampers the avengers
Aug 21 2014,positive,nuff said this movie is spectacular and displays what marvel is all about one of the greatest superhero movies of all time the avengers redefine what a superhero movie can be it makes the people at dc cry and fanboys cheer
Aug 20 2014,negative,disappointing i expected more downright dull in places
Aug 20 2014,positive,magnificent the way they managed to bring together all the best actors to give great performances no actor tried to outdo the other they bounced off each other beautifully story line was awesome as well and did the comic book movie fan proud
Aug 19 2014,positive,i have seen this film multiple times but went back on rotten tomatoes to add to my rating to yes my favorite movie of all time i love marvel and have been a huge fan all my life i enjoy everything about it the avengers i feel is a sum of marvels overall creativity imagination and inspiration this movie follows the most infamous superhero team the mighty avengers an all time favorite movie of mine and will probably continue to be
Aug 18 2014,positive,absolutely love this movie all the fighting parts were so dramatic
Aug 17 2014,positive,there really is no reason why this movie should be as good as it is it is almost miraculous  with all of these superheroes in one film it should have been a soupy unfocused mess of a disaster  instead we get one of funniest and action packed superhero films yet    marvels greatest heroes minus spiderman and the xmen come together to take down the demigod loki and his alien coconspiritors who aim a hostile takeover of earth with a convenient little wormhole created by this weeks maguffin  of course getting all of these egos to get along isnt an easy job but nick fury takes advantage of a unfortunate situation to get the team emotionally on the same page your favorite comic books come to life on the screen in the most epic battle to ever occur in a superhero movie  the hulk really steals the show in this movie  he doesnt have much to say or be very interesting so it isnt surprising that his two previous movie incarnations were rather underwhelming  here though there is just enough hulk sprinkled through the film to make you want more of the the jade giant  mark ruffalo also helps as the most well rounded bruce banner yet    watching the hulk battle thor and then the alien horde will definitely get your nerd sense tingling with joy    another thing worth noting is that no character is left behind in the storytelling  everyone has their own storyline and moments to shine  the black widowhawkeye subplot will certainly be played out more in avengers age of ultron  iron man in particular really turns the page on how much he is willing to sacrifice for his fellow man  he proves he isnt just a cocky billionaire playboy in a metal suit  a film that will be enjoyed years into the future  score 10
Aug 17 2014,positive,why am i reviewing this film when i should  be watching it avengers assemble is one of the best films i have ever watched action packed witty and keeps you on your toes throughout can we expect anything less from a marvel film excellent five stars
Aug 17 2014,positive,i really dont understand why this movie is hated by people i honestly believe this movie should be loved not hated the movie has no flaws fully capturing the characters besides hawkeye and black widow but we knew their place the movie got me feeling the tensity at the end and made me feel childish with the action and yet thought about the characters but my favorite was loki and tony starkiron man and how they had the most character development which i think lots of people wanted because they act very well not at all did i think they were out of character or more like they were them the music scores playing really were awesome except for the opening score and in the end it makes you want more and makes you want to explore their set up world which will do very well for now
Aug 16 2014,positive,the avengers is entertaining film with decent plot and a shtload of explosions
Aug 15 2014,positive,this movie is so awesome and probably one of the strongest in the marvel movie franchise thanks to brilliant acting a great script good laughs and plenty of action
Aug 14 2014,negative,one of the most overrated and over hyped movies of all time
Aug 14 2014,negative,were it not for robert downey jr and the much needed selfdistance his character brings to the table i honestly wouldnt have made it halfway through marvels the avengers one one hand i understand the hype and praise on the other  its not my cup of tea or coffee or any other drink
Aug 14 2014,positive,one if best movies ever
Aug 13 2014,positive,earths mightiest heroes has finally come to the big screen and doing a fine good job at that the plot the chemistry the jokes theyre all there but how was bruce banner able to control his anger and become a team player besides that it was an exciting superhero movie
Aug 13 2014,positive,it blew me out of the back of the theater
Aug 13 2014,positive,marvels the avengers or as its known here in the uk marvels avengers assemble is brilliant it is the first marvel superhero crossover film combining iron man hulk thor and captain america as they join together to save the earth from thors brother loki the acting is brilliant as are the actors especially tom hiddleston i love tom hiddleston the plot is great and the fight scenes are awesome this is an unmissable experience that pushes the barrier for superhero movies forever
Aug 12 2014,positive,an action without drama thrilling with comedy what can fight against it nope it is marvel
Aug 12 2014,positive,the ultimate comic book film a great film which will be a classic
Aug 11 2014,positive,pretty slow but that final fight scene is insane
Aug 11 2014,positive,the best movie in the world
Aug 10 2014,positive,is this the best superhero movie ever batman and christopher nolan might have something to say about that the best marvel superhero movie ever for sure
Aug 10 2014,negative,garbage bangs gongs and whistles are no substitute for well written dialogue three dimensional characters and some sort of satisfying story you need about half of one brain cell to watch this tedious tripe boo
Aug 10 2014,positive,better then expected
Aug 10 2014,positive,this movie knocked my socks off cant wait for age of ultron
Aug 10 2014,positive,this movie is marvels greatest achievement ever to quote stan lee nuff said  score this movie is badass

Aug 7 2014,positive,acting 87510 action 92510 script 910 coolness or bad beep ery system overload character development 9510 how much i overall enjoyed the movie you better be proud of me i had to do mathematics 92510 43333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333310
Aug 6 2014,positive,joss whedon does his job in bringing together everyone for one big goofy awesome pile of fun
Aug 6 2014,positive,great fun but it has a lot of faults not best casting choices im looking at you scarlet johanson faulty writing clumsy storytelling its no masterpiece but youll probably enjoy it
Aug 5 2014,neutral,visually stunning but overly simplified plotwise and  with an absence of the kind of human and relatable depth that its director is known for bringing to even the silliest premises this epic blockbuster forgoes its potential to be  the citizen cane of comicbook movies and  settles for a pleasing romp  it falls short of its five movie build up and will leave you lamenting that joss wheadon  could have done so much better and produced what could have been the first oscarwinning comic book move  in the end it feels like yet another prequel to future sequels instead of the culmination it was billed as which may be better for the mcu as a whole but it leaves a lot to be desired as the trademark postcredit scene  fades to black not because of what we got  but  because we feel robbed of what we couldve had
Aug 4 2014,positive,the best comic book film of all time
Aug 4 2014,positive,the avengers is a fantastic movie make no mistake the massive budget is on full display here with truly high powered graphics that drip expensive and look it too the cast is excellent with thors occasional missteps and hawkeyes boredom totally glossed over by a top notch ironman captain america black widow and loki performance that really carries the film and defines it from its superteam predecessors the action scenes are truly epic as well combining the things that make michael bays movies sell any tickets with the storyline and characters that make everyone elses movies sell tickets the avengers is not all good however despite being the most polished superhero movie to date and despite the allstar cast the movie fails to add anything new to the genre instead choosing to merely refine it a move that is acceptable but a bit boring in a world now dominated by the marvel superheroes the matchup is all too predictable as is the outcome new york is destroyed yet again aliens come through portal and a team of flawed heroes comes together at the last moment to end the threat character development is limited solely to a deeply traditional superhero arc hawkeye is a downright pathetic character dont misunderstand the avengers is an excellent movie it just isnt a particularly original one although it is one you should see all the same
Aug 4 2014,positive,best comic book movie in my opinion
Aug 4 2014,positive,really good film liked the chemistry between the characters and each get there time to shine in the final battle highly recommend fourth best marvel movie
Aug 4 2014,positive,this movie was good was good in 3d and everything about this was good the storyline was good
Aug 4 2014,positive,this is the best action movie ever
Aug 4 2014,positive,great plot awesome characters outstanding special effects the avengers is a film for people of all ages with humor action and plot development
Aug 3 2014,positive,in my opinion this film might be a bit too overrated the dialogue is funny the action is very good actually but the whole movie itself is almost kind of boring and it actually rather annoys me on how totally unbelievable this is when i say that im not talking about the superheroes and what not im talking on how the superheroes lifes are affected and how the civilians lifes are as well but i think that is too deep for me to get into and isnt it bad how this movie didnt get me pumped up i mean cmon its supposed to be one of the greatest super hero movies ever made but it did not live up to expectation for me not bad but totally amazing
Aug 3 2014,positive,during this film like bruce banners anger my penis was constantly erect you can tell this is a whedon film because black widow is a strong independent woman who dont need no man and totally not a sex symbol would smash with the force of a thousand mjolnirs 5 star norcs
Aug 3 2014,negative,the most overrated movie of all time the avengers is made to make the movie makers money loki was stopped by thor in thor who would think its a good idea for him to be brought back as the main antagonist again but against all the avengers no one but since all the nerds get a stiff from marvel its universally loved there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out its plot isnt new its acting is average its theme is typical this movie is just lame and simple
Aug 3 2014,positive,another awesome marvel film filled with action superheroes villains and witty jokes however still provides some heart as well only downside was that it kinda felt like it was merely filling in the gaps of other movies in some parts and was a bit too long in my opinion
Aug 2 2014,positive,put multiple marvel super heroes together and you get a great movie
Aug 2 2014,positive,they should have kept the hulk from the 2008 movie and jeremy renner sucked as hawkeye dolph ziggler would have been a better choice
Aug 1 2014,positive,its the avengers need i say more
Aug 1 2014,positive,a fun time but nothing special
Aug 1 2014,positive,a 2 hour geek fantasy was worth my time
Aug 1 2014,positive,loved every second of it brilliantly acted with special shout out to mark ruffalo as he suprised us all with his banner loki is awesome once again however did feel it was lazy using him for the villain in two marvel films superb film and a must watch
Jul 31 2014,positive,one of the best superhero films i have ever seen  another one of my faves 
Jul 31 2014,positive, this may just be a classic
Jul 31 2014,positive,best superhero movie ever made
Jul 30 2014,positive,not enough rating stars to do it justice
Jul 30 2014,positive,if you include this with phase 1 this would be my 3rd favorite of the phase this doesnt say much because i didnt like thor or captain america the first avenger that much i tried to watch this film seven times in a week trying to like it and only enjoyed on the 8th the 9th and 10th times my opinion went back to the way it was the same thing about this film is what fatigued me in the amazing spiderman 2 all plot no story this film is not particularly bad but disappointing to say the least i heard great things about it when it first came out and now i rarely watch reviews about movies i want to see for myself unless ive already seen it i credit joss whedon for balancing all of the characters relatively well and the script isnt complete trash and it doesnt feel like a total insult to my intelligence the narrative is pretty weak but nobody is at fault there this film has little depth and no underlying themes that you leave thinking about i personally like films with a strong narrative if not awesome portrayals of my favorite characters which this does not have because my favorite marvel characters are punisher spiderman and deadpool with that said the hulk and iron man were awesome in this film
Jul 30 2014,positive,an extremely fun superhero movie that perfectly brings together marvels superheroes perfectly it definitely lived up to the huge hype built around it
Jul 30 2014,positive,its all the best super heroes in one movie of course its going to be awesome
Jul 29 2014,positive,show more hulk in the 2nd movie
Jul 29 2014,positive,a bit overrated but a great film none the less
Jul 29 2014,positive,one of the greatest movies i have ever seen it is the most fun i have ever had or probably will have in a movie theater
Jul 29 2014,negative,at least an hour and forty minutes too long trying to give a complex backstory to a bunch of cartoon characters is an exercise in futility  and boredom watched to the end  no surprises here  only for the cgi which does not a movie make but does have some entertainment value really having trouble understanding how this got such high reviews unless of course the reviewers are all 12 year old boys
Jul 28 2014,positive,this is one of the best if not the best superhero film ever made i thought it was a really awesome film if i had an award show for every superhero film this would win the best superhero film ever made
Jul 28 2014,positive,as a longtime marvel nerd the avengers was everything i could have hoped for i loved it and even if you have never picked up a comic book in your life you should watch this film marvels going to have one hell of a problem trying to top this
Jul 28 2014,neutral,great movie but all this talk about it is not worth it it was half but not something i would worship
Jul 28 2014,positive,a quirky smart and funny movie about characters learning that is necessary to assemble with a great casting great soundtrack script and directing by joss whedon this movie plays with the ideia of make a super hero movie and is one of the best yet
Jul 28 2014,positive,i seriously thought this movie would fail there was no way whatsoever it could live up to the expectations of five movies cram this many bigname characters in it and still be both coherent and clever i was completely wrong joss whedon should be given a medal because he did what i believed would be completely impossible is it still a dumb silly movie absolutely is it funny clever and well crafted from beginning to end without a doubt
Jul 25 2014,positive,this film was amazing
Jul 24 2014,positive,hard to get so many big characters to fit into one movie  but i loved it  the appearance of thanos at the end left me looking forward to future movies
Jul 24 2014,positive,universally enjoying for everyone it makes me feel like a kid who wants to be a superhero
Jul 23 2014,positive,its funny great story great acting i give it five stars
Jul 22 2014,positive,avengers is a comedy and action movie all in one that you will never forget  six well known superheroes must team up to save the world  youll be on the edge of your seat the whole time
Jul 21 2014,positive,the ultimate marvel geek fantasy that not only is good with its humorscriptawesome effectsand never forgetting its heroes and villainsbut is a great addition to the marvel canonand let casual and hardcore fans have a good popcorn flick
Jul 21 2014,positive,this i my favorite superhero film ever it is action packed as well does it have a great story joss weden made a monster hit with this tremendous film well done
Jul 21 2014,positive,its hard not to get excited at seeing all the heroes together at last

Jul 21 2014,positive,perfection i love what marvel did with this one great job
Jul 20 2014,positive,the perfect comic book film of all time still wish daredevil and spidey could join the team
Jul 19 2014,positive,action comedy adventure brohood all in one  loved it
Jul 19 2014,negative,the avengers is your typical patriotic superhero film big dumb and forgettable the only thing worth watching was the hulk smashing things up
Jul 18 2014,positive,best marvel movie ever the avengers are finally a movie love the comics i bought it on dvd thats how good it is
Jul 17 2014,positive,a great way to end phase one this movie is great i had a couple of problems with the movie for one it kinda starts out slow but still has great dilogue to fill the gap of action captain americas costume was a little cartoony to me and and some moments some of the jokes didnt stick and came off a bit cheesy having that been said i still loved the movie and cant wait for its sequel
Jul 17 2014,negative,although the avengers is an entertaining blockbuster popcorn flick its not really too much more than that it appears as though its a film for 10 year olds the plot is weak and there is nothing that really keeps you fixed to the screen from an artistic perspective the avengers certainly wouldnt rank high in my books
Jul 15 2014,negative,overrated  heres the movie in 5 seconds talking talking talking hulk smash talking  the end  theres so much talking and yet no development somehow
Jul 15 2014,positive,such a great movie all the way around some how they are able to put in all of these larger than life characters and somehow not over crowd the movie the pacing is great and the special effects are prefect its really amazing how marvel was been able to put four summer blockbuster movies and combine them all together and still make it more than just the novelty of seeing these larger then life heros on the big screen for my money it was the best time ive had at the movies ever and josh will be hard pressed to do it again with avengers 2
Jul 14 2014,positive,a tremendously enjoyable marvel superhero movie incredible entertaining action and special effects combined with witty humor that does not detract from the seriousness of the films narrative
Jul 14 2014,positive,a bit messy in the first half especially with their inevitable ego clashes but got better when they finally fought together was fun to see each avenger meet the other and to observe the dynamics notes  agent coulson died mark ruffalos hulk was interesting tony stark talks to thin air a lot and had wit
Jul 14 2014,positive,all of the famous marvel superheroes in one whole movie epic i cant say anything else just absolutley spectacular action packed and full of suspense and humour i dont know what marvel fans could really ask for more this film definitley had me on the edge of my seat
Jul 12 2014,positive,the marvel movies marvel movie

Jul 7 2014,positive,a great funny actionpacked roller coaster that is deserving of all the praise it gets
Jul 6 2014,positive,a once in a lifetime idea that only delivers after the first hour
Jul 6 2014,positive,love it love it love it marvel has done a phenomenal job bringing this incredible cast of characters together while forming an interconnected universe this is how its done as always make mine marvel
Jul 6 2014,positive,harmless surface entertainment done with immense bombast and a budget that could sink countries remarkably the film manages to tell a comprehensible story despite its ensemble cast of supercharacters and wraps it all up with decent humor and a bravura 20min action scene that is at the top of its class
Jul 6 2014,neutral,one of the most overrated films of all time i have no idea how this film made many peoples top 10 list of 2012 the only thing good about it was the action and everything else i couldnt care less
Jul 6 2014,positive,best superhero movie
Jul 4 2014,positive,fun exciting this film manages to be the film that marvel has been building up to in a great way and while it isnt my 1 favorite comic book film it is however my 1 favorite marvel film

Jul 4 2014,positive,what an awesome movie
Jul 3 2014,positive,dc has the dark knight marvel has the avengers while its plot may not be extraordinary everything else is no marvel movie has been this fun in years
Jul 3 2014,neutral,a glorified kids movie average acting tryhard humor chatter one liners terrible villan and weak of character development  the only reason people overlook these problems is because of its colorful action sequences that are less than satisfying
Jul 3 2014,positive,rocks i wish there where a better way to represent the hulk in these as apposed to complete cgi animation i like ruffalo and banner a lot though
Jul 1 2014,positive,one of the best movies all time
Jun 30 2014,positive,im not a huge fan of the marvel movies but i can sit through them and they provide decent entertainment the avengers is an action packed adventure with great effects a well written story fine performances and great direction from joss whedon while that being said this film doesnt offer anything new to the marvel franchise the concept of this is very repetitive i feel its the same as every other marvel movie i just want something new out of a superhero movie instead of the whole rinse and repeat cycle the movie itself is good and joss whedon does stay true to the source material and he has always showed that he had a knack for creating something great and stylish
Jun 30 2014,positive,marvels the avengers is an entertaining ride of amazing action acting special effects and pretty much everything fans want for a avengers movie its a delight
Jun 29 2014,positive,this is a genuinely great movie despite the fact that theyre always talking into ear prices that dont exist the half because ive seen it too many time
Jun 29 2014,positive,the people behind the marvel universe are geniouses im obvisouly not because of spelling but i love the way they tied the movies together and even tied a tv show into their universe cant wait for upcoming movies
Jun 29 2014,neutral,i am not going to say the movie was bad but at the same time there was nothing making it amazing  the whole movie is predictable and generally boring

Jun 27 2014,positive,one of the best summer movies ever as funny as it is thrilling
Jun 26 2014,neutral,so generic nothing interesting happens just mindless action with no emphasis on characters whatsoever a very basic and cliched plot where bad guys want to rule the world and the good guys have to stop them very predictable entertaining and funny in parts i guess
Jun 25 2014,positive,the best of the best
Jun 23 2014,positive,avengers is something that doesnt happen often this had a lot riding on it knowing that that the stand alone films have all been setting up to this and it does not disappoint avengers puts everything right with the prequels and puts it into one movie a lot of characters but making them all work together is to treat them like there in there own movie and every stole the show everyone had something to do you could even see character development through the movie now that being said its insane that about three quarters of the movie was spent mostly talking in the carrier there are also some minor plot points that arent explained but in all this movie is all about fun and sets up the future of cinematic universe almost perfectly 8510
Jun 23 2014,positive,great superhero movie that has just about everything you want in it

Jun 17 2014,positive,the avengers is not only one of the best superhero films ever made it is one of the best movies of the last 10 years this is the superhero movie i have been waiting for my entire life and my high expectations were greatly exceeded
Jun 16 2014,positive,this film is undoubtedly the biggest film of the decade it brings together great characters who are portrayed by great actors and actresses the only problem was that it seems that they could have done a lot more with it when you go see it you expect it to be all fighting and action but you have to remember that they have to introduce the characters to each other and explain why they brought then together in the end it leads to an epic battle which could either save the world or end it
Jun 13 2014,positive,best super hero movie ever made it managed to please the fans of the source material while pleasing critics as well not enough big movie adaptions get away with that
Jun 13 2014,positive,if you havent seen it go now  this movie has it all if youre any kind of marvel fan you cant afford not to see this
Jun 12 2014,positive,the first twothirds are typical joss whedon goodness with great character development and a lot of kickass fight scenes unfortunately during the last third the movie succumbs to michael bayitis and the film forsakes character and instead focuses on superheroes and aliens crashing into things the movies good but it could have been so much more
Jun 12 2014,positive,what is not to like about this extraordinarily well written superhero team up
Jun 10 2014,positive,one of the best movies ever
Jun 9 2014,positive,all and more im thrilled
Jun 9 2014,positive,best superhero movie
Jun 8 2014,positive,best superhero film to date ruffalo stepped in nicely and rdj stole the show as always
Jun 8 2014,positive,why doesnt this have a perfect score the greatest superhero movie of all time became fantastic it doesnt make any sense
Jun 8 2014,positive,best comic book ever the only movie that make me go to the theater 7 times yeah i saw this movie 7 times and every time i enjoy it love it this movie is a entertainment epic action fun experience
Jun 7 2014,positive,just as funny as iron man was thanks to joss whedon and his top notch team whedon has done no wrong he brings his lingo his wit and his sassy style to bring together the avengers in a fun campy way to tell a story of immense proportions we comic nerds have waited a long time for this story to be told and yet you can nitpick the not so comic things they miss you easily replace them with some of the best action to comedy scenes in all of blockbuster history as long as marvel is smart enough to compromise with whedon unlike they did with so many others they will prosper ever more and not flounder out like iron man 23 seemingly do thor 2 did etc and ya theyre certainly notches above dc ie green lantern waste of money but it doesnt take much to slide off the top of the mountain
Jun 7 2014,positive,the avengers is the one of the best superhero movie you will see the much awaited team up of the avengers was pretty good as the back and forth conversations between tony stark and steve rogers are very entertaining the action is stunning and mark ruffalo is obviously a huge step up as hulk
Jun 7 2014,positive,cant wait for the second one well worth the watch
Jun 6 2014,neutral,as incredible and intriguing as the marvel universe is the team of superheroes didnt ultimately live up to all the hype while the action scenes were pulse pounding there was no real evidence of any loss or risk when youre dealing with so many heroes who are seemingly invincible their flawless fighting style seems to drag on as a bit repetitious with the story drawn out for over 2 hours and then conveniently tied up in 5 mins the film surprisingly lacks explanation
Jun 4 2014,positive,this movie is amazing this is the best marvel film to date slightly even better than the winter soldierbut still amazing imo the best comic book movie ever
Jun 3 2014,positive,absolutely jaw dropping
Jun 3 2014,positive,love this movie to the death
Jun 2 2014,positive,marvels the avengers directed by joss whedon is an action packed movie about superheroes this film was based on the widely popular marvel comics about a superhero team the main characters in the film are iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye all together they form the avengers they all come together when loki an evil super villain threatens global national security by stealing the tesseract  the tesseract is a power source that could be very dangerous if put in the wrong hands  it was taken away from nick fury the director of shield an international peacekeeping organization  that is why nick fury built up a team to help save the world the rest of the movie is about all of the avengers trying to come together to get the tesseract back  one of the major themes that i took away from this movie was teamwork without working with others or working like a team you cannot solve anything this was shown in the beginning of the movie when all of the superheroes had big egos and refused to work together none of the superheroes where better than the other but when put together they are unstoppable and can save the world thats why when they accepted one another and worked together like a team they were able to accomplish a lot more things my favorite quote from the movie was when bruce banner said my secret is that i am always angry before he transformed into the hulk i liked this quote because it was so unexpected and it really stood out in the movie overall the avengers was an awesome movie filled with action and adventure it had a very interesting plot and it was nice to see all of the superheroes in one movie  thats why i would give this movie 5 out of 5 stars i would recommend it to anyone thats 13 years or older because it is rated pg13 other than that it never had a dull moment and had a little bit of everything for everyone
Jun 2 2014,positive,you cant not like this movie
Jun 1 2014,positive,my personal favoritethis film truely defys what these superheros are willing to due to defend humanity with the script amazing cast and incredible special effects not sense star wars have we ever had such a spectacle
May 31 2014,positive,christopher nolans batman series are the better films but i can tell the avengers is a movie i will rewatch many many times it has the polish and smarts of the batman movies but with a great sense of humor to bring it down to earth joss whedon is a master and this is one of his finest hours
May 31 2014,positive,the best superhero film in years loved seeing an ensemble cast that combined robert downey jr mark ruffalo chris hemsworth chris evans samuel l jackson scarlett johansson and jeremy renner from previous marvel films against thors evil brother loki and his alien armada great action strong character development and an amazing story that brings a great group of characters together which has never been done before amazing
May 31 2014,positive,arguably the best superhero movie ever  definitely the most epic
May 30 2014,positive,zzzzzzzzz what huh oh jeez you woke me from my nap oh what oh the movie yeah zzzzzzzz
May 30 2014,positive,decent superhero film but loki is a shite bad guy hulks class in it tho
May 30 2014,positive,joss whedon spearheaded the daunting task of fitting four demanding superheroes on the big screen and he made it look easy outrageously funny and simply spectacular the avengers succeeds on all fronts each character gets its due justice and when they are occupying the screen at the same moment its quite marvelous the avengers sets a high standard that all marvel movies should adapt to
May 29 2014,positive,dont mess with the avengers
May 29 2014,positive,second best comic book movie ever
May 28 2014,positive,cool action scenes and great fx butwheres the script theres no story on the avengers a fiveyearold boy could have invented the plot to this movie

May 25 2014,positive,great movie hilarious and action packed
May 25 2014,positive,joining together a selection of marvel characters produces a spectacular blockbuster the story has its flaws but the dazzling special effects  action make up for it
May 25 2014,positive,hands down the best comic book movie ever made marvels the avengers manages to have each of its caracters shine thanks to the simpleyetpowerful script by joss whedon and the incredible acting provided by the cast if youve been following this characters since iron man came out in 2008 then this will be like christmas to you
May 24 2014,positive,this could have been a disaster that had way too much going on but director joss whedon balances everything out perfectly
May 24 2014,positive,i was amazed by the special effects and story dazzled by the effort they put into combining 4 successful franchises iron man the incredible hulk thor and captain america into one cannot wait for age of ultron
May 24 2014,positive,who cares about logic when a film is this fun
May 24 2014,positive,never been done before so therefore it was awesome
May 24 2014,positive,the best superhero teamup film ever ties for 1 with the dark knight for me only one is a solo superhero film  the other is a team up film it never gets old no matter how many times i see this movie the feeling i had when i first seen it was overwhelming joy  cannot seem to be reproduced make mine marvel excelsior  nuff said
May 23 2014,positive,the avengers is a fun filled action adventure film this film is a fun ride from beginning to end while not consisting of a plot that will make you think deeply about the film once its over the avengers accomplishes what it sets out to do the action can be over the top and needless at times and the humour can be quite silly but the acting from the main leads is very strong  the script handles the characters well the film never feels to over crowded although some fans may feel their favourite characters do not get enough screen time  the special effects are fantastic and add to the film overall a good action adventure film that is for people who want a good two hours of escapism and pure entertainment
May 23 2014,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
May 22 2014,positive,not my favorite marvel movie but it was still good
May 21 2014,positive,a movie you can watch over and over again when your bored and have nothing to do

May 16 2014,positive,best superhero movie of all time
May 16 2014,positive,great movie but couldve done better if there were more scenes with the thor and loki rivalry and could have more known marvel characters like spiderman and some xmen and cant wait for avengers 2 with thanos and the infinity gaunlet
May 15 2014,positive,i dont know but there was a bit of a lack in the color grading and the picture just looked a but faded but the movie was good
May 14 2014,positive,love it cant wait till the next one thor and iron man are bad ass
May 14 2014,positive,the avengers is a lot of eye candy and fun i mean unlike the shitty shitformers movies it is good fucking dumb fun  now the plot is all generic stuff there is some complex stuff about the tessaract and  well the avengers have to save the day now although a lot of people will this this as a shitty bay film dont worry this movie is directed by joss whedon who can actually make films and it shows all the actors are  good in their roles thankfully shialadouche comes nowhere near this and thats a plus the movie is just fun yes there is a bit too much hype on it but it is cool with brilliant action and good acting and it almost lives up to the hype
May 14 2014,positive,medicore at best too much characters to focus on while having a generic plot centered around a glowy cube thing that holds the fate of the universe 610
May 13 2014,negative,over use of cgi makes this movie terrible movie does not make sense how did thor return
May 12 2014,positive,a great payoff to one of the most anticipated movies ever the avengers gives nearly everything youd want in a summer blockbuster with its great cast witty dialogue joss whedons writing and direction layered characters and some awesome action sequences
May 12 2014,negative,theres no history here only explosions and smashs really if youre a 8 year old youre gonna love it if not just pass
May 12 2014,positive,joss whedon at his best the special effects were incredible awesome and amazing the visual effects were spectacular stunning phenomenal

May 10 2014,positive,this movie made my dick rock hard
May 10 2014,positive,best superhero movie of all time period
May 9 2014,positive,the story isnt even really there if not subtlety but its a dream come true and gives anyone even remotely interested a nerdgasm
May 9 2014,positive,marvel gets serious and finally conquers the world with this enormous blockbuster and final installment of marvel cinematic universe phase one 20082012 six dispair personalities including an egoccentric genious millionare a patriotic soldier with a dadcaring sense of responsibility a northern brute god a guy with problems to control its greeny and chaotic anger and a pair of meticulous assassins meet to face what is presumably the greatest superhero final battle in film history watch half of the end credits to get an astonishing final surprise for the sequel pure entertainment pure epicness an instant classic
May 7 2014,positive,wish i could give it a higher rating this movie is just wow a definite must watch for marvel movie fans
May 6 2014,positive,despite a basic storyline the avengers respects both its characters and its audience with its amazing cast spectacular action scenes most notably in its climactic half hour and eyedazzling visuals
May 5 2014,positive,an outstanding movie that includes action drama and comedy very entertaining to see many superheroes something that  everybody will enjoy a great job by whedon
May 5 2014,positive,is there anything to say really its the fucking avengers
May 3 2014,positive,great movie all around
May 3 2014,positive,the avengers is not only a good superhero film but a good anything film its got  action a plot a cool villain even samuel l jackson
May 3 2014,positive,with 5 movies leading up to the hype the avengers delivers with a satisfying often funny and exciting comic book film
May 2 2014,positive,with a good blend of comedy and action avengers will please all but the biggest film snobs
May 2 2014,positive,awesome movie bravo joss whedon
May 1 2014,positive,i have problems with people calling it the greatest superhero film ever heck i even think that captain america 2 is a better flick that this one and i personally believe that superman 1 christopher reeves is still better   with that out of the way avengers gives you a thrill ride from how they tried to kill each other and how they worked together the story on the other hand doesnt give you much but thats how it worked
Apr 28 2014,positive,a good watch more than once
Apr 28 2014,positive,if you look at the credits after watching this and you really should for the extra endings youll see joss whedons name attached to screenplay story and director whedon has his fingerprints all over this film so it pretty much lives or dies with him   well this film not only lives it thrives this is the mighty marvel teamup 10yearold boys in the seventies and eighties have always dreamed about happening on the big screen i have a sneaking suspicion that joss whedon was one of those tenyearold boys  of course to call marvels the avengers a genre film would be a disservice for the mass appeal this film received at the box office young old male female it didnt matter this film appealed to everyone on a massive scale as the 15 billion box office would attest some watched it for rdj some watched it for hemsworth or hiddleston but overall the actors had a mass appeal that crossed genres and conventions  it also helped that the dialogue cracks like a whip and theres not a single bit of throwaway dialogue  the real question is is this the best superhero movie ever well my experience has been yes some people point to the dark knight as being a better film but the only reason why that film is memorable is because of the villain not the hero i guarantee you that the heroes are the ones who shine in the avengers and arent sidelined to make way for the villain although i must say that loki makes a damn fine villain  in closing i dont think the 10yearold joss whedon would have ever in his wildest dreams believed that he would not only helm write and screenplay a film that he always dreamed would happen but how successful and fruitful that endeavour has been for him careerwise in all likelihood its a dream come true that has made scores of former tenyearolds green with jealousy
Apr 28 2014,positive,marvels the avengers had very high expectations and it seemed impossible that it would live up to them but joss whedon surpassed these as he created a fun comical and action packed film that gave each character an important part to play avengers age of ultron will have to be truly amazing to match this entry
Apr 28 2014,positive,the theater experience was 2nd to none in my lifetimeawesome
Apr 26 2014,positive,the avengers is a fantastic superhero film that utilizes the abilities of their fantastic list of actors and isnt ever trumped by the music or the usual loud obscene sounds that dominate most superhero movies
Apr 26 2014,positive,thats what i am talking about 
Apr 25 2014,positive,the long awaited super hero film begins with loki from the asgard and a diabolical plan to bring earth to his knees and only assembling the avengers can come close to stopping him the avengers consist of iron man thor hulk captain america hawkeye and black widow all of which had individual movies prior except for the last two the previous movies help piece together the avengers tale but it is not required to really understand this movie avengers is full of action of it and all of it is clean crisp well directed and looks fantastic the ending sequence was quite entertaining as well and shows has only through team work could the world be saved avengers really is the pinnacle of super hero movies right now and did not disappoint
Apr 24 2014,positive,great story and some of the best cg i have ever seen rewatchable
Apr 23 2014,positive,ahhh the joy  five different marvel movies with teasing post credit scenes lead to this mega spectacular film it pulls together so well  the film starts with a bang and the action is fairly unrelenting throughout tthe reluctant team meet fight argue and whine all while the villain loki maipulates them like chess pieces when the shield helicarrier is almost destroyed agent colson is killed and the heroes are embarrassingly outwitted only then do they start to prioritize their focus and energy  iron man stark is hilarious hulk is both scary and believable captain america is the heart and moral center black widow is manipulative and skilled thor is conflicted yet determined and hawkeye well he gets the short end as a loki puppet for half the film  so many great scenes loki ordering the crowd to kneel and the old guy who wont iron man and thor fighting hulk and thor fighting and when the heroes form their circle on that new york street wow   the only complaint the drone like ineffectiveness of lokis alien army six avengers must of killed thousands of them pathetic little minions and when their base of operations is destroyed they drop like the idiotic robots in the phantom menace  who among us can forget loki ordering hulk to stop arrogantly announcing that he is a god only to be repeatedly slammed into the floor like a rag doll it doesnt get any better
Apr 23 2014,positive,good movie for those that love nothing more than mindless action for those seeking messages and insights youre out of luck
Apr 23 2014,positive,nice even funny at times but i dont see what all the rave is about
Apr 22 2014,positive,looking forward to this sequel
Apr 22 2014,positive,this instalment of the series brought together the disparate stories weve seem dancing around each other into a current narrative that showcased each character and gave fans both new and old something to enjoy
Apr 22 2014,positive,i couldnt hear half of it on the plane but i doubt that would have changed much
Apr 22 2014,positive,great move and the actor who played bruce banner did an amazing job the best bruce banner by far even better than the original
Apr 22 2014,positive,what can be said about the avengers assemble its full of cheese fun and a massive budget marry that together with some top notch actors and iconic characters and you should have a match made in heaven right well kind of see the problem stems a bit deeper this film is best when the entire cast are talking to each other not while being super heroes of course there is the odd scene here and there that warrants an interest mainly surrounding tony stark downey jr or the hulk ruffalo but the majority of this action is quite soulless and 1 dimensional unlike the effort being put in by the cast the story revolves around now bear with me here non comic book fans the tesseract which is a mythical power which has been taken under the power of a group called shield the group run by nick fury jackson and including black widow johanssen and hawkeye renner aims at protecting the earth against other worldly beings so one day loki hiddleston decides to recruit an army and go after the tesseract gaining it and causing a mass disaster setting in motion shield recruiting our favourite super heroes the hulk iron man captain america and thor in order to act as a force against the impending threat that looms of course everything goes tits up and before you know it cgi madness ruins about 40 minutes and a city where to begin dont bother watching this before you have watched at least iron man 1 captain america and thor other wise your just going to be completely lost fair enough those films have all been building up to that however the director knows in the back of his head that a large demographic wont have seen those movies and decides to include tid bits of back story at the begining in order to pull everyone up to speed it reeks of big budget studio but ill let it slide the acting is super dooper awesome now when i say its awesome i mean you have a very good cast of people trying their best with some very cheesey script writing the best performances come from downey and ruffalo hands down in fact their entire relationship throughout this movie actually takes it up half a mark due to it being that entertaining to watch loki is a threatening enough villain but so is anyone who can pull an evil grin and get angry in a subdued manner im not plunging daggers into hiddlestons performance its just hard to look both him and hemsworth in a serious way after the collosally crap film that was thor chris evans pulls chris evans out of the bag for captain america which works but hey ho scarlet and jeremy are merely 1 dimensional robots going through the motions and jackson he just showed up on set really the effects are hit and miss also yeah from time to time some of it works and the hulk is pretty entertaining to watch reek havok but its all a bit stale otherwise typical cgi bombast over actual solid thrills its camp its big and its loud just what youd expect really but i cant say that im overly impressed with its final execution although ive never seen eye to eye with joss wheedon entertaining when our cast are all in one room talking or the occasional block busting scene souless hack and slashery most of the other time kills a few hours
Apr 22 2014,positive,one of the best superheroes movies ever being fastpaced and funny
Apr 21 2014,positive,what more can you say this movie is great fun there isnt really much more to it than that terrific special effects and wonderful interplay between the various marvel heroes i find it particularly interesting that most onscreen adaptions of the hulk have been pretty flawed particularly the recent ones while here he totally steals the show well second to scarlett johanssons cat suit anyway maybe hulk is just better served in smaller portions of gamma ray fueled brutality or somethingits the terrific writing which really holds this one together though and provides the solid spine that makes it one of the best super hero movies of all time
Apr 20 2014,positive,really enjoyable entertaining superhero movie best movie that the hulk character has been involved in in my opinion the black widow should definitely get her own movie showing her past very interesting background for her
Apr 19 2014,positive,good but i thought it could have been better considering all the star movies out on each of these characters individually
Apr 19 2014,positive,best movie marvel has made so far period

Apr 16 2014,positive,i love that this movie is full of action and the fact that it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout out the entire film well done marvel well done
Apr 16 2014,positive,the avengers was probably the best movie of 2012 it had more great actors than any movie in the past decade and it succeeded in keeping the audience entertained throughout the entire film the story was good but the action and special effects were out of this world on top of this the comic relief is abundant and never disappoints robert downy jr has never been funnier than he is in this movie the back and forth between him and the hulk is truly incredible
Apr 15 2014,neutral,it was awesomei guess

Apr 12 2014,positive,its a wonderful juggling trick theyve all pulled offeveryone gets their moment to shine the excitement in the theater was palpable
Apr 12 2014,positive,there was an idea stark knows this called the avengers initiative the idea was to bring together a group of of remarkable people to see if they could become something more to see if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles that we never could

Apr 5 2014,positive,this movie had everything you love about the characters because of everything you love about joss
Apr 5 2014,positive,smart mix of comedy and action very enjoyable
Apr 5 2014,positive,i have a whole list to describe how awesome marvels the avengers is but if i had to describe this movie in only four words it would be this bestsuperheromovieever
Apr 5 2014,positive,excellent  excellent  excellent a wonderful adventure with grouchy heroes that are just as human as the rest of us just watch out for their bark and bite  will be seeing this again and again
Apr 5 2014,positive,in world filled with dark and gritty comic book movies marvels the avengers is a breath of fresh air due to its light hearted tone and fun the avengers knows what it is where it came from and not for one second does it back down or try to suppress that it is a comic book movie in short the avengers is pure movie fun and in many regards a truly epic super hero movie
Apr 5 2014,positive,very good movie the script is fun and smart at the same time the comedy feels forced sometimes im very pleased with this movie but they couldve done things better such as the dynamic between thor and his brother or the relationship between natasha and clint barton
Apr 5 2014,positive,yes the movie has its flaws but most great movies do its a superhero movie and its a fantastic one at that though really overrated this blockbuster is sure to give the audience thrills and those of the comic book greek world will love it some people overrate this and some underrate the film i would be in the middle and say its pretty great but dont go in thinking your mind will be blown 9210
Apr 4 2014,positive,fun movie lots of good laughs lots of great action great cast and ya fun to see all the heros coming together i only wish they kept the same actor as the other movie to play the hulk
Apr 4 2014,positive,a handful of comic heroes team up to save the worldsaved from what really doesnt matter all that matters is that iron man and a green honey badger called the incredible hulk appear on screen together and invoke laughs and destruction these two were the movie movie downgrade for excessive transformer mayhem and probably 12 characters too manyboth accomplices to the 2 hr 22 min running time but a smashing time in the end grade b
Apr 4 2014,positive,first twenty minutes had some effy production value and i didnt care for captain americas costume however whedon does great with an ensemble cast and the movie has a great balance of action story and humor
Apr 4 2014,positive,because it has a hulk
Apr 3 2014,positive,i have to say initially i didnt know what to expect i already love the marvel movies but my background with comic books is rather fuzzy i knew the avengers was going to be something special when i walked in but for a marvel movie to defy my expectations and deliver what is probably the most satisfying movie experience ive had since the 2000s is something that was beyond my wildest dreams  if i could sum up the avengers in one word i would be envious of myself the avengers is impossible to describe in just one word because if that were possible the movie would have to feature just one hero but the avengers takes every marvel character of the last four years with the acceptation of edward nortons bruce banner who has been replaced by mark ruffalo and collaborates them all into one kick ass epic storycharacter driven action extravaganza that rivals the sci fi classic status of the first star wars  the avengers does something that has initially been done several times mostly in tv crossovers but never has the movie collaboration concept taken its potential to the level that joss whedon took to this masterpiece of true blockbuster entertainment  unlike any collaboration movie or show the avengers allows for all nine characters including the villain to have a chance to breathe most would look at the avengers as an excuse to bring in the benjamins by trying to jam several characters into one movie and falling down the same path as every other movie that tries to do the same thing but this movie does the unthinkable and gives us time to relate with each character this is something that has never been done successfully in the history of movies  in addition to revolutionizing the bar of which comic book movies are made the avengers also boosts the best writing the best directorial eye and the best acting of any movie of its genre since the dark knight joss whedon is certainly no stranger to sci fi and dedicated fandoms and this movie only boosts his popularity that was already concrete with his short lived tv show firefly you know this is a joss whedon movie the second the first line of witty dialogue appears from samuel l jacksons flawless take on nick fury who has a much larger role here than in the previous iron man and captain america films every scene in this movie has at least one line dialogue that you will carry with you long after the movie is done and the action is just as memorable the final battle of manhattan could be considered a movie in its own right the acting is top notch as well robert downey jr does wonders with the character tony starkiron man and most of the hilarious dialogue courtesy of joss whedon comes from him captain america is the perfect fish out of water character his methods of heroism collide with iron mans in some of the more dramatic and character driven moments and chris evans is brilliant much better than the still very good but also kind of silly 2011 cap america film chris hemsworth and tom hiddleston also reprise their roles as thor and loki and their complicated brotherly relationship provides the film with a much needed shakespearean level of drama they have some of the best scenes of the movie and of course tom hiddleston is the show stealer here his performance as loki is the most entertaining villain work in recent memory he is certainly a great actor whose charisma will be the notch that makes his acting consistently memorable hemsworth is great too his thor is the only thor as i mentioned before mark ruffalo has replaced edward norton as the hulk character bruce banner but dont be disappointed because hes just as good if not better than norton he adds a level of depth to the character that wasnt as present in the 2008 movie and when he turns into the hulk he turns into the hulk i have to applaud the visual effects team for their work on the hulk and to joss whedon for his brilliant writing of the character and his directing for making the hulk the single greatest crowd pleaser in marvel history as another critic put it never under estimate the entertainment value of the hulk smash filling out the principal cast is samuel l jackson who is as i mentioned the perfect nick fury scarlett johansson is nice to look at as black widow but maybe her acting has room to improve but her presence does not detract from the movie at all every character has their own shining moment and jeremy renner plays the conflicted clint bartonhawkeye who has a pretty good aim with a bow and arrow that would make katniss everdeens jaw hanging in suspension  as i mentioned this movie is a masterpiece of blockbuster entertainment if you want oscar quality film making then you should go and watch the kings speech or the artist because to compare this movies quality to that of those movies is biased and unfair to people who actually enjoy these movies as well as cinematically accomplished oscar gold  i wasnt a comic book enthusiast before i saw the avengers but i certainly am striving to learn more about them now that ive experienced the greatness of comic book movie making first hand with the epicness of marvels the avengers go and see this movie and dont let snobbish minority groups tell you its terrible because theres a reason why theyre in the minority
Apr 3 2014,positive,this movie thought me a valuable lesson never go watch a movie with sky high expectations now dont get me wrong this was a good movie overall but fans and critics were praising this movie left and right and saying this is a great movie and a must see it was a good movie but it had nothing special just your generic superhero action movie that scene where hulk just grabs loki and smashes him may have been funny but it showed us that loki was a weak villain
Apr 2 2014,positive,that it works us astonishing great time had by all
Apr 1 2014,positive,possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life
Apr 1 2014,positive,this movie broke a word record for how many people saw it marvel has taken its next step into phase 2

Mar 28 2014,positive,best action in a comic book movie yet
Mar 25 2014,negative,it was okay kind of redundant 
Mar 24 2014,positive,probably the most powerfully structured movie ive ever seen what i admire about the avengers is that it doesnt go in guns blazing from the start it doesnt open with the avengers themselves but with nick fury and maria hill who are there right at the beginning of what is eventually one of the best superhero movies ever charged with explosive action mind blowing spectacle and big laughs when the world is threatened by loki and his army of alien chitauri the avengers initiative is activated and a team of the most remarkable beings come together to save the world from obliteration iron man thor captain america hulk black widow and hawkeye team up in one of the best movie finales to hit our screens new york is a playground for jaw dropping action stunning camera shots and immersive 3d joss whedons ability to balance out this enormous cast is unlike any other and with whip smart writing and a powerhouse story this is the ultimate marvel adventure would i watch this again a dozen times and more this is a perfect choice for a movie night a family night in and the cast are better than ever playing these superheroes weve come to love over the past few years
Mar 24 2014,positive,perfect balance between humor and action
Mar 22 2014,positive,pretty close to perfection

Mar 13 2014,positive,the avengers was the best superhero movies in the marvel universeity  the setting looked real the acting was fantastic and the fight scenes were incredible  iron man captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeye did a great job of saving the world tom hiddleston who played loki was one of the smart villains that led his army to destroy the world samuel l jackson as nick fury was his best role ever   the space scenes looked beautiful the action scenes were fun  and the aliens looked strong  what a great way to end the marvel cinematic universe phase 1

Mar 10 2014,positive,absolutely love this movie watched it 8 times while it was in theaters and i also own the movie and ive watched it 3 more times
Mar 10 2014,positive,the avengers is one of the best superhero ever the action was great and evenly spaced out so theres a good amount of dialogue the characters are great there are so many moments in this movie that are just awesome and so unforgettable this is what all superhero movies are supposed to be like joss whedon did a great job directing so kudos for him
Mar 10 2014,positive,dont get much better than this
Mar 10 2014,positive,overrated in my opinion cheesy loki nearly ruined it for me but hey the hulk captain america iron man and thor all in one movie that makes it so much better
Mar 10 2014,positive,pure entertainment done right a film that should please fans of the source material as well as those of previous marvel films while also being a blast for new comers joss whedon again proves his value by taking a concept that could be utterly disastrous and turns it into a home run for audiences and the money men
Mar 9 2014,negative,god i was falling asleep
Mar 9 2014,positive,ensemble films are usually a mess trying to give everyone screen time and failing to pull all the plot threads together  not avengers  this movie is tightly written and perfectly executed giving everyone a chance to shine even hawkeye i was never a fan of any of these marvel characters before their movie incarnations and now im a fan of them all even hawkeye

Feb 26 2014,positive,huge entertainment value and vibrant characters who bounce off each other in truly inspired ways give this the strength to power through some of the more glaring story inconsistency
Feb 26 2014,positive,produced and directed without the same kind of goals as previous marvel films the avengers focused on taking its massive budget and making the coolest most spectacular movie they could they pulled that off with aplomb iron man and co must unite and work together to defeat loki thors crafty wisecracking bro  every avenger cast member hits the bullseye in the acting department mark ruffalo and robert downey jr probably are the best as the hulk and iron man tom hiddleston will endear himself to the world with his portrayal as loki  the action is plentiful but thankfully director joss whedon doesnt saturate the film with it too badly we still get some merciful respites as the directing crew really nail the pacing factor dont try to seriously compare the avengers with marvels other movies its less serious and more obligatory and it give fans a heck of a ride
Feb 26 2014,positive,a wonderful movie with great special effects and excellent so i think the avengers is one of the best movies ive seen in my life

Feb 8 2014,positive,i love the advengers it keeps your attention all the way thru
Feb 6 2014,positive,absolutely perfect movie
Feb 6 2014,positive,marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the marvel cinematic universe and after the success of this film it seems to be getting much bigger and more ambitious before making the avengers the studio decided to have a couple of films dedicated to each main character and in a way filled the world that would then be the setting of the avengers honestly i dont think this film would be as successful if it wasnt for those films so as years and films gone by the hype for the avengers kept growing larger and larger as we have never seen a film so ambitious in its cast and its concept in 2008 when iron man came out we never thought that this would be possible now here it is does joss whedons take on the avengers do it justice my answer is yes but not to a point of high praise  the avengers was written by joss whedon who is commonly known as the showrunner of some of the best tv series of this generation he is an experienced writer but when it came to films he has very little to brag about whedons work has always been known to be ambitious and in a way quirky especially in dialogue what whedon has created for this film is actually quite simple in its plot it touches on themes that have been explored on many films before and is a common aspect in comic books these themes include teamwork ego good vs evil responsibility and war i didnt mind whedon in applying these themes to this film because they are universally relatable and it allows the films plot to be simplistic my biggest concern in his writing is the characters i think whedon was happy to have the opportunity to work on multiple different characters and he knows that he could express each one with their own individual personality allowing the characters to feel unique and at the start be uncohesive with each other but whedon has forgotten to give any character a sense of depth beyond their dialogue as he just wanted things go quickly as they could to the parts that have us jumping in excitement i understand that the individual marvel films are the one that showcases this multilayered character study that i was looking for but that doesnt mean that the avengers should lack it almost completely i dont care if the film spends more time on these characters and letting the film run at 3 hours because it would have allowed me to appreciate more than just the surface of these characters whedon sometimes make their personalities and intentions too obvious which takes me aback as it doesnt feel at all natural it is almost as if he was too afraid that we might not entirely get it though there was potential in characters like maria hill phil coulson and natasha romanoff but very brief whedons dialogue on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth between members of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film through dialogue whedon has shown us just how different these characters are and how each one thinks they are above one another  joss whedon is also the director for this film he also doesnt have a lot of directed films in his name as he seems to be more preoccupied with his work on tv the success of the avengers did open doors for him and allowed him to create films with more creative control like with his next film much ado about nothing i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but at the same time i felt it was a bit too tame i am not sure whether this was a result of the studio or it was the intention of the director in order for the film to be appropriate for its younger audience it would have been nice if we actually see some civilians die during the fight in new york so at the end we can really feel that the event was a huge travesty to our kind and that we have hope it wont happen again whedon has created something very ambitious containing a number of characters and yet still give enough screen time for each one the area where whedon has impressed me is the last hour and a half of the film this is where the action comes in supported with big sequences that are memorable and exciting whedon has given the last fight a large portion of the running time because he wanted it to be better than what anybody else could have thought of which i personally agree the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesnt come off as fake or lacking in texture because the budget and time that was given to him allowed the film to be polished ergo having the audience be immersed in the experience my main issue was the first hour of the film as it felt very rushed it contained fast editing cuts that made things feel off i think whedon trimmed a hefty amount in order to move the plot along and i think that was a bad decision as more time with these characters at the start would have allowed the audience to identify with them easier overall i think whedon did a good job in creating a film that contained so many beloved characters and still make a decent movie out of it its a tough job and maybe it could have been a different experience if someone else helmed the project but nevertheless it was good enough  the films director of photography is seamus mcgarvey what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the films cinematography is disappointing as the film contained many shots that felt unnecessary there were many moments earlier in the film where i ask myself why did they use that angle or what was the point of it i felt that some shots were too concerned in what would be filled in it rather than what it could do for the actors performance or its connectionrelevance to the films plot or themes it is during the moments that contained action sequences is where the films photography shines as the irritating approach they applied for the slow and earlier parts of the film would actually work in this situation i assume a lot of the film is shot with a green screen but it never proves to be as obvious or distracting like in baz luhrmanns the great gatsby the film also uses a more handheld approach for most of the scenes assumingly using a steadicam i was really hoping for this film to knock me off my feet when it comes to its cinematography but sadly that wasnt the case  the films score was handled by alan silvestri who is mostly known as a collaborator with robert zemeckis silvestris work here is astounding the films score is so grand and memorable that it becomes the first thing i think about when i recall back to this film yes it does follow the many trademarks and styles in mainstream action films but this is an example of one that is excellently crafted the films theme track is the highlight of the score as it just hits the right notes and when it comes it feels so epic that you cant help but get goose bumps when it comes on  the avengers contains a wide cast and overall i felt that they did quite well with their roles it is already established from their previous films that they have already given these legendary characters justice the stand out performances mainly came from robert downey jr mark ruffalo scarlett johansson clark gregg and cobie smulders the rest were good but their roles i felt were underdeveloped therefore the actors were limited with what they can do with it  in the end i thought this film was a bit of a letdown but there were some areas that bring this up and keep it from being a disaster its something that i would definitely watch again just for its amazing action sequences and to hear the chilling score but thats really about it
Feb 3 2014,positive,awesome teamwork in this seemingly awkward and impossible collection of members including captain america who came from the past biologist turning hulk physicist tycoon iron man and a demigod thor

Jan 18 2014,positive,the action and comedic elements more than make up for its weak villains and uninspired story
Jan 17 2014,positive,wow three years on and this film is still great the avengers is a fantastic film and one of the best marvel movies easily in the top 5 now im not going to lie the avengers is not as perfect as when i first saw it in the cinema after seeing quite a few more times the problems in this movie are starting to become more obvious however that doesnt ruin this great movie one of the best things about the movie is the cast i mean look at this cast robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston samuel l jackson cobie smulders and clark gregg everyone is great in the movie and there isnt a bad peformance is thee whole film all the characters are handled very well except for two unfortunately hawkeye is very underutilized and captain america is really badly handled even his costume is terrible in the movie its just a big shame as movies like captain america the winter soldier prove what a badass he can be but in this movie hes really badly handled luckily though iron man thor black widow and especially hulk are all handled brilliantly the shield regulars nick fury maria hill and agent coulson are all fantastic loki is a great villain hes not the most threatening but hes absolutely brilliant tom hiddleston makes him a charming villain and he has some good jokes speaking of which the humour in this movie is great and while it might not be as funny as guardians of the galaxy its still hilarious the action in the film is also brilliant especially the final action sequence which is just fantastic and a visual treat i also love seeing the avengers all work together and its just tones of fun joss whedon also brilliantly directs them movie and its a shame he wont be directing any more avengers movies after age of ultron while this film is absolutely brilliant it unfortunately does have some rather big problems that stop this being a perfect movie probably the biggest and most common problem with the film is the first half and hour is actually pretty bad it goes on to long and to be honest its very underwhelming another big problem is that even though i do love the end action scene the chitari are actually a terrible army they are very unthreatening and and we never actually see them kill anybody so it makes them seem really terrible they also did extremely easy one personal problem i have with this movie is actually more to do with the marvel series as a whole spoiler alert the motivation for the avengers to all team together and fight the chitari is because loki kills agent coulson this scene is actually very well done and its very sad to see such a likeable character die however agents of shield came out and now coulson is alive why would they do that you had a very sad death that proved loki could be evil and that the series is fine with killing off main characters however now hes alive why couldnt they have just based the show off of maria hill but problems aside this is a fantastic movie with great acting great action great humour and great music i would say see it but who hasnt a
Jan 17 2014,positive,marvel heroes from previous movie combined into one movienot so surprising especially the villain since he already appear in thor is it that hard to show another villain from the huge marvel universe i hope to see more surprises on avengers 2 but hey on the positive side it does have a great action and a bit of funny dialogues

Jan 16 2014,positive,i didnt know films could be this perfect

Jan 13 2014,negative,first saw it on opening weekend midnight showing
Jan 13 2014,positive,the best marvel movie i have ever seen i remember going to see this two years ago not knowing what to expect and i left in the most excited stage ive ever felt joss whedon was the perfect choice to direct this movie and im so happy that he didnt screw it up he wrote each character perfectly and the script was fantastic it was smart clever funny everything i had hoped it would be the performances were excellent by everyone downey evans ruffalo hemsworth johansson renner hiddleston gregg smulders skarsgard jackson paltrow bettany denisof they could not have picked a more outstanding cast for this movie the action was over the top but it also didnt seem to dull and the hole movie flowed so perfectly the whole time it was probably the most entertaining and fun movie of 2012 i think what stood out the most in this movie would have to been hiddlestones performance as loki as a big fan of the comics that was what i was most worried about hollywood has a tendency to not show marvel villains in the correct way but after seeing this i think i liked movie version of loki better than comic version im looking forward to the second on in 2015 and really hope in can live up to this ones expectations and doesnt let me down
Jan 13 2014,positive,entertaining collection of superheroes do battle against thin weedy man with stick hulk smash

Jan 9 2014,positive,epic superhero movie   taking hulk iron man captain america and others together displaying a great blend of storytelling action and humor you have a blockbuster that matches its enormous expectations it keeps you fully engaged throughout
Jan 9 2014,positive,nothing remarkable for an epic superhero movie all blame on talentless joss whedon who is not good in making epic movies first the scenes in the movie were not epic all involved small actions  sucked second the enemies  lokis forces are suckass too weak as challenge to the avengers when i watched how the avengers won the battle easily without any challenge i felt sleepy come on they are the avengers make the enemies stronger joss whedon  sucked

Jan 7 2014,positive,not just a great superhero movie but a great movie in general its very fun and entertaining with great charecters and a great story
Jan 7 2014,positive,you get what youd expect from this comic book blockbuster hulk smashes thor talks funny and stark rips on everyone there are some laughs the team takes a bit of a detour to settle some pissing contests and the good guys wail on the forces of evil im just left with the lingering thought of if only the ip owners of spider man or the xmen would have played ball damn
Jan 7 2014,positive,great sound effects loved it
Jan 7 2014,positive,given that they only made this in six months tops the movie was pretty epic the bonding of the cast on and off cam is commendable too

Jan 3 2014,positive,its fun cheesy well acted and shot nerdy fun and not really much else but then again it doesnt really need to be
Jan 3 2014,positive,the action scenes are spectacularly exciting with excellent use of visuals and cgi i loved seeing the heroes argue and not getting along and seeing them working together and just beating the crap out of everything
Jan 2 2014,positive,top 3 mcu movies and a must buy it is a five star movie no doubt
Jan 2 2014,positive,predictable nothingnew plot but the action scenes are spectacular who doesnt love superheroes
Jan 2 2014,positive,best movie ever has great character and a wonderful cast
Jan 1 2014,positive,what can i say other than earths mightiest movie
Jan 1 2014,neutral,fairly predictable but come on its a comic book movie  if youre looking for convoluted storylines try some actual literature  this movie didnt need to be nearly as long as it was  most of the airborne happenings were extraneous and not very believable frankly  they didnt add anything to the plot or the character development and frankly it feels as though some stuff hit the cutting room floor that might have better explained why we spent so much time there though i doubt it would ultimately justify that time    obviously trying to provide a modicum of backstory for each of the characters takes time and future installments of the franchise wont have to do that as much  but for this first movie it takes up a lot of time without a great deal of payoff  there isnt enough character development to really connect yet its time consuming still    theologically this movie was interesting for its portrayal of the gods and particularly humanities abilities to outwit and outmanuever them thor and loki as demigods clearly are not vastly superior to the abilities of the avengers  they might be impressive enough and overpowering enough for ordinary humans but for the cream of the crop theyre marginal at best  hulk summarizes it best with perhaps his only line of the movie  puny god    while captain america provides at least a headnod to the judeochristian god of an america past that god is otherwise nonexistent in this film and in particular in the lives of the various heroes  humanity is alone in dealing with this otherdimensional threat  the demigods of ancient civilizations are not enough on their own to save us  we have to do this for ourselves  it would have been interesting to see this played out a bit more explicitly but this probably isnt the forum for it
Jan 1 2014,positive,absolutely loved it it was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish with great chemistry between the cast robert downey jr as tony stark delivers great value as always
Dec 31 2013,positive,faithful to the source materialand mind blowing comic adaptation
Dec 31 2013,positive,action pack nice plot and never gets boring
Dec 30 2013,positive,the only word to describe this movie awesome just awesome
Dec 30 2013,positive,the inner comic book nerd within me absolutely adored this movie thank you joss whedon
Dec 30 2013,negative,this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life how people liked it is beyond me the script was absolutely terrible and i had actually fallen asleep during the movie due to boredom having to finish it later i would rather blind myself than watch this movie again
Dec 30 2013,positive,this is a great movie
Dec 30 2013,positive,every nerds dream with an amazing cast
Dec 30 2013,positive,a movie we have been waiting 49 years for and it completely delivers everything we wanted and more
Dec 30 2013,positive,love this movie but thor 2 is best marvel cannot wait till age of altron
Dec 30 2013,negative,over hyped and overdone the avengers heros stories dont mesh well and its skinny plot doesnt contain enough strength to hold them all together
Dec 29 2013,positive,a great superhero film that equally distributes the spotlight on each of its characters
Dec 29 2013,positive,i owe my fondness for superheroes almost entirely to this film when it came out i went to the marvel movie marathon held by amc and ended up watching the five previous films in the mcu leading up to the premiere it was kind of a lot to take in all at once but i fell in love with the characters in each of the movies and seeing them all brought together in a single movie was brilliant it must have taken enormous effort to work in enough screen time for each of the main characters without favoring one over the others and i cannot get over just how well whedon managed it it was very wellbalanced wellpaced just excellent overall definitely one of my alltime favorites
Dec 29 2013,negative,overhyped and pretty slow to take off before all the action near the end the tony stark and captain america bitch fest seems so unnecessary not a fan of this movie
Dec 28 2013,positive,would be a five if it werent for all the damn us military advertising
Dec 27 2013,positive,avengers is a stellar film with tons of twists and turns it starts with a thrilling high jack by loki the demigod in pursuit of the tesseract the stress and struggles the avengers experience are intriguing whedons comical style added to the piece is in no way cheesy has a fantastic balance between action and comedy it ends with an amazing battle against the chitari warriors all of the efforts i have mentioned make this movie a five star classic
Dec 27 2013,negative,this lacking movie is a great example on a superhero movie that only serves up to the action that so little is given to go deeper into our superheroes and answer the raising    questions throughout this movie in general the avengers has the ability to prove actionwise but never in a millenia goes to serve as a realistic or even an ejoyful movie
Dec 26 2013,positive,one of greatest movies of all time
Dec 26 2013,positive,one of the greatest marvel movies ever nothing and no one can beat this movie  except the second one
Dec 26 2013,positive,im sure that joss whedon is a person of genius he succeeded in mixing all of marvels heroes and making one of the greatest team in the world
Dec 26 2013,positive,when it comes to me rating a movie i always think of how the plot unfolds character development the theme and the acting this is different because honestly it was just so much fun i enjoyed the tension snark comments between the teammates and for sure the action in this movie i mean it generally performs favourably in every other aspect as the story unfolds towards a grandefinale at the end if there was a weak spot for this movie it would be the character hawkeye in this movie but honestly thats a minuscule complaint im a comic book fan and hawkeyes cool its just when you got the big guns in this movie you dont really care about him he seems like just an addon i do feel however that the actual figure hulk didnt get enough character put into him  which is understandable as its hard to relate to a rage monster i just wish i could have seen a greater conflict between bruce banner and hulk all in all fantastic movie recommend it
Dec 25 2013,positive,the avengers this film boasts an impressive cast with downey jr chris hemsworth and mark ruffalo make no mistake with all of the talent on this cast downey jr absolutely steals the shows this film was entertaining from beginning to end and contains some of the most impressive action sequences ive ever seen the hulk smash was just as enjoyable as was thor throwing mjlonir at iron man the movie does lack a solid storyline but you are still left very satisfied the avengers is a very funny movie and its in large part due to joss whedons ability to write wittingly with all that said this film is still way overhyped and this does not mean its a bad film because its the exact opposite the more i watch the film the film the more i enjoy it at first the hype around the film somewhat ruined my experience i expected something other wordily which is not what i got none the less the avengers offers great comedy and mind blowing action but there not much more than that at the end of the day it really didnt matter this movie was easily one of my favorite movies of 2012 and definitely worth seeing  425
Dec 24 2013,positive,good but not great most overrated movie of 2012 if you ask me now for starters this is in no way a bad movie it was smartly written it fit together and it wasnt uneven and it actually had charachter develpoment something almost unheard of in an action movie despite those perks it has flaws that seem to be always overlooked for starters the plot is much to simple which is ok for most people but i often enjoy complex stories the plot is also predictable and cliched so there arent many suprieses this was also a pain to watch in the theather with so many toddlers and little kids talking and crying constatly overall its not bad but terribly ovverrated and not that great as well
Dec 23 2013,positive,a hell of a gathering for all the super heroes coming together in this action packed helarious movie bringing all the hero movies together 5 stars from me
Dec 23 2013,positive,top movies   1214  on demand blu library
Dec 21 2013,positive,it never fails to amaze me that some people seem to think that movies such as this should 1 make sense 2 have the dialogue of dickens masterpiece 3 match the cinematic greats of yesteryear it has explosions it has super heroes and super villans all in all it delivers in spades minus sides some of the super heroes you might not miss if they died  man with bow makes me yawn and the invading force seem to be cannon fodder for our super heroes however the overall affect is good and you will leave the cinema wanting to see the next installment
Dec 20 2013,positive,simply brilliant i liked it a lot the gods were a bit average the man in an iron suit his good old self a sexy scarlett say no more and wow hulk is so handsome and why is it called the avengers well the explaining could be cut a bit but i dont think its a waste of time plotting the leadup to all the actions each hero rocked up in hisher own brilliant way the superhero movie of the year for sure
Dec 19 2013,positive,the avengers is an fantastic movie with great amount action and a wonderful story and im especially amazed by the music and the special effects   another thing thats great about the avengers is the opening scene which truly is exiting and thrilling i found this movie highly entertaining because its so damn good and unique and its packed with great actors and the movie overall is cool and touching the negative thing about the avengers is that the tempo is a little to slow at some places but also that there are some scenes thats not so original because some scenes looks like they might have taken from other movies like transformers but except for that is the avengers truly fascinating  an amazing film from marvel but with to much slow scenes and boring conversations  the avengers gets a 8710
Dec 18 2013,positive,very long but great movie
Dec 18 2013,positive,need more hulk smash less banner
Dec 18 2013,positive,needed a longer fight between thor an hulk but besides that dam near perfect
Dec 17 2013,positive,the best crossover ever
Dec 16 2013,positive,incredible movie along with breathtaking special effects one of the best movies ive ever seen perfect blend of action and humour
Dec 16 2013,positive,over the top makes me chuckle
Dec 16 2013,positive,it was alright but i dont understand why people are saying things like it was better than star wars and it was the best movie ever it was just another super hero movie nothing more
Dec 15 2013,negative,i like a good super hero flick but this was a dumb waste of 25 hours blah boring
Dec 15 2013,positive,great movie must say on point with the action and the suspense
Dec 15 2013,positive,very good top ten from the past half a decade
Dec 14 2013,positive,i am still utterly confused as of why this movie is as popular as it is  yes it was good and yes the characters are cool  but why was this the big success  i really dont get it  thinking back i cannot remember any real iconic scenes or any moments of gripping dialogue  the enemy that guy from thor  what was at stake the earth how emotionally attached was i to any of the characters almost not at all  i love ironman as does everyone but thats about it really  captain america was good too  but again what was amazing about this i really do not understand  maybe in time years later more people will really see this movie for what it is mediocre
Dec 13 2013,positive,the avengers was the movie where all the marvel pressure liedif this movie failedall the previous marvel movies would have been a a failureif not a complete lossi must say that if you are not one one of those moviegoers who feels that the plot should be really goodand just feel that you should have a good time and thats itlook no furtherthe avengers is an all out superhero fan fest and the epitome for all marvel and superhero fans   the plot is simpleeverything unfolds just the way you expectbut what elevates the movie above your previous marvel ones is the chemistry between all these heroesall these characters know each otherand are all of a sudden thrown together to save the world from lokitom hiddlestonthe best marvel villain after magnetoherethey must overcome personal differences and work a teamand how they get about to become is the team is what the movie isand not how there is endless action to save the worldthere is a lot of actionno doubtand its good action toobut at any given timethe dialogue and the interplay between the characters is what makes this movieand that was probably what whedon was aiming at   robert downey jr as iron man is always a treat to watchhe is as badass as he can get herebut also shows his importancethe way he jabs at captain americachris evansis really funnycalling him old fashioned and of no usechris hemsworth as thor is as reliable as everand he too has some really funny scenesbut the superhero who steals the show here is hulkplayed by ruffaloits a treat to see bruce banner and hulkwhich was not so in the previous independent hulk moviesthat does prove whedon is a great directorrennerscarlet johhansson and sam jackson arein my honest opinionnot given much to doin factthere is importance is so minutely feltthat i cant even judge if their characters were of any use in the movie at allthat and the fact that the plot was a little too weak are the two major issues with this movieotherwisethe avengers fits as a perfect popcorn entertainerpossibly the best superhero oneand one of the better superhero movies in general
Dec 12 2013,positive,while not perfect what could be asked more from this ambitious movie that surpassed many people expectation s
Dec 12 2013,positive,there are two schools of superhero film that are currently enjoying success the first is composed of gritty complex semirealistic reinterpretations of classic comic characters the most successful example being christopher nolans batman trilogy the second is more light entertainment fare with colorful heroes duking it out with sinister villains in over the top action sequences interspersed with humorous material thats what this is and this is one of the best examples of the breed every actor that makes up the titular team has enough charisma to lead his or her own feature which makes bringing them together a bit of a risk but joss whedon manages it brilliantly so no one feels wasted here there may not be a lot of substance to it at the end of the day but it never feels as if its lacking needed weight it just feels like a fun ride
Dec 10 2013,neutral,well made in that the effects and banter between characters are pleasing enough except loki whose dialogue and character development as opposed to the original thor movie are atrocious but other than that it seems people have a hard time accepting this movie just has a far too weak plot with too many plot conveniences to count while the characters are charming the storyline is just hokey and campy
Dec 10 2013,positive,so much action great sfx loved it from start to finish
Dec 9 2013,positive,best of the marvel films so far a thats a big deal
Dec 8 2013,positive,while it could have been better with the budget it had it pleased me very much and can even get noncomic book fans excited
Dec 7 2013,positive,this movie stayed pretty close to the comics i thought  it is week worth your time watching it enjoy i loved it when hulk called loki a puny god
Dec 7 2013,positive,a high action blend of the greatest super heroes known to the marvel universe avengers proved itself and then some i was expecting a clamored mesh of terrible  acting and a pathetic story to go with it but what i saw was just amazing
Dec 7 2013,positive,beat comlcbook movie ever
Dec 7 2013,positive,witty actionpacked and a rock solid installment in the marvel franchise the avengers is an unprecedented masterpiece that is wondrous to behold
Dec 6 2013,positive,i mean yeah it was good
Dec 6 2013,positive,slightly overrated but still entertaining af
Dec 5 2013,positive,needs no review cause its to great for words
Dec 4 2013,positive,this just makes me happy  i loved the avengers and justice league this is a great take on it  i like this hulk much better youll have to see to appreciate  
Dec 2 2013,positive,for se 5 stars for cast of characters 4 stars for cast of actors 4 stars for story 3 stars  i watched a redbox dvd in the library killing some time  i laughed aloud at some of the sarcastic humor
Dec 2 2013,positive,i liked the film  it was another great comic story on the big screen
Dec 2 2013,positive,coolest superhero movie ever best of all times cant wait for avengers age of ultron
Nov 30 2013,positive,one of the best superhero films ever
Nov 30 2013,positive,one of marvels best films
Nov 30 2013,positive,a great big action movie that is absolutely worth watching even if youre not a comic book fan a nice portion of the film was filmed in my hometown of cleveland ohio and its a blast watching it and saying i know where that is and that and so on cant wait for 2
Nov 29 2013,positive,its certainly superior to man of steel which i class as the most disappointing superhero film of recent years and which has a second half featuring incessant irritating noise and constant boring sequences of stuff getting smashed into stuff but this genre of films on the whole is starting to follow a very similar and increasingly tired formula to be fair avengers assemble works better than most inevitably helped by the added options offered up by teaming all the heroes together one significant addition being all the banter and wisecracking between the avengers i didnt mind the film when i went into it actually expecting to dislike it so in that sense its a success but as director joss whedon himself has admitted it could have been better
Nov 28 2013,positive,a definite win for marvel
Nov 28 2013,negative,really i guess it looks cool but really maybe i want a little more than just mindless action in m movies 5 minutes of good solid character developing dialogue would have been nice i have no emotion toward any of the characters it would have made no difference had any of them been killed not that it treats major character deaths in an emotional manner anyway
Nov 27 2013,positive,possibly the best marvel movie to date the avengers is one of the the most fun movies ever and it still manages to have some brains and drama
Nov 27 2013,positive,the best part of watching this movie in the theater isnt just that its amazing but everyones reactions in the audience made watching it so much more comfortable this will universally give people something to talk about and have in common
Nov 27 2013,positive,this movie was excellent its a collision of worlds for all these different people this had a very good story excellent villian and a good plot structure i cant wait for the age of ultron
Nov 27 2013,positive,it was aight if your 15 years old
Nov 27 2013,positive,with an amazing cast and a script that cares about every of its heroes it totally delivers a blockbuster extravaganza of film the characters are the main thing that made the film great the special effects action sequences score story and script are spectacular it is one of the best films from marvel
Nov 27 2013,positive,great movie never stopped laughing
Nov 26 2013,positive,some of the best superheros team up to stop loki i personally loved it must see  i cant wait for the squeal
Nov 26 2013,positive,throughly entertaining and spectacular to look at but the avengers stumbles a bit with a script that couldve been polished and story that couldve been more compelling
Nov 25 2013,positive,you had me at shakespeare in the park
Nov 25 2013,positive,great action movie that i enjoyed
Nov 24 2013,positive,ive never had so much fun watching a movie the comic book truly became alive with the direction of joss whedon
Nov 24 2013,positive,an amazing superhero team up movie cant wait to see the 2nd one when ultron brings them to their breaking points
Nov 23 2013,positive,damn good and funny too
Nov 23 2013,positive,this has got to be one of the best movies in 2012 with superb acting thrilling action believable special effects and great story and script this movie is the best marvel film yet  overall this is a must see movie for all actions fans and simple movie lovers  number grade 92
Nov 23 2013,positive,as a crossover and an action film the avengers nails both while it has its flaws they are far outweighed by the good its not the greatest superhero film of all time but its one of the best
Nov 22 2013,positive,1 scene that made my day captain americaand hulk smash
Nov 22 2013,positive,loved it so much action
Nov 21 2013,positive,im sure there will be another sequel for this franchise movie
Nov 21 2013,positive,as egos powers personalities and conflicts let rip a punchy script cohesive story and deft dialogue flow outstanding action zealous stunts and exceptional 3d effects amaze reviewers can finally put cynicism aside and allow the avengers to stake its claim as an excellent marvel film and one of the most balanced and best superhero movies ever made  true comic aficionado and writerdirector joss whedons creator of buffy the vampire slayer angel firefly and dollhouse and highlyregarded comic author influence is apparent in every facet from the culturally appropriate tone plausibly integrated characters subtle interpersonal turmoil too blatant sarcastic witty every element comes together in harmony to create something to be savored  when the villainous norse demigod of mischief loki the masterfully pithy foe from thor tom hiddleston infiltrates the international peacekeeping agency shields secret bunker to steal the fundamental source of unlimited sustainable energy known as the tesseract and the only man who can tap into its power and turn it into a weapon scientist selvig stellan skarsgård the world comes under imminent threat of war and ultimate enslavement   attempting to save the world and prevent complete human annihilation shield director nick fury the stylishly authoritative samuel l jackson brings together a motley collection of superhero recruits  the uniquely talented mastermanipulator natasha romanoff  black widow scarlett johansson who  deftly hints at her characters tumultuous undercurrents recently defrosted ww2 supersolider steve rogers captain america chris evans with his oldfashioned allamerican wholesomeness selfproclaimed genius playboy billionaire philanthropist nick stark  iron man quick quipped scene stealing robert downey jr brilliant scientist come green rage monster bruce banner  the hulk film standout and deeper ed norton replacement mark ruffalo unsurpassed archer and expert assassin clint barton  hawkeye the as yet underutilized jeremy renner  and lokis own stepbrother the god of thunder thor the physically and mentally imposing chris hemsworth  internal quarrels erupt as the myriad of alphamales bicker and vie for top position clouding their vision to lokis evil schemes but when he opens a portal to another world to allow passage for an invading alien race of superfast minifighters and ominous giant slithering sloth come lobster ships the avenger team must put aside their childish squabbling for the greater good  from the onset there is a palpable feeling of camaraderie between the actors manifesting in some genuinely unforced laughout loud moments and after all it is meant to be a comic having so many leads could have resulted in a cinematic battle of supremacy but by previously having their backstories explained in individual films and whedons deft understanding of internal dynamics noones story arc has been  shortchanged each heavyhitter gets at least one moment in which to shine and for some an even better than when they were the focus   each actor brings something different to its massive table even though it is only ruffalos first turn as the hulk the depth he brings is dramatically profound contrasting wonderfully with downey jrs levity inducing natural smartarse swagger  evans injects some selfdeprecating humor into his outdated character and hemsworth sidesteps the inherent cheesiness of a strong silent type meanwhile the only real human characters of johansson renner and jackson ground the story in a slither of reality   not to bring about a spoiler alert there are a few scenes that warrant special mention romanoffs two interrogations are a work of seductive art the confrontation between hulk and loki is hysterically appropriate the final battle sequence takes care in showing viewers specific detail rather than relying on disorientating rapid editing and pretty much every time stark speaks you wish it was a dvd you could replay   the verdict not to be confused with shakespeare in the park the avengers has a certain gift light and dark deep and shallow its grand but damaged figures from parallel fictional universes meet somewhere in the middle between antiquated comic and contemporary cinema to transcended the makeup of its elements   published the queanbeyan age date of publication 04052012
Nov 21 2013,positive,fantastic film would watch over and over one of my favourite marvel movies
Nov 20 2013,positive,from iron man to the incredible hulk then iron man 2 to thor and from there captain america the first avenger all the bases are filled and have been seen from the public started in 2008 to come its conclusion in 2012 bring them all home marvel the avengers the film that tied all the franchises together and made one hell of a movie and a thrilling and exciting ride no super hero movie has ever brought franchises together like this so marvel knew it had to be a success in order to truly complete what they had intended to do four years ago they brought in fire fly creator joss whedon to help write and direct the film as he is familiar with bringing everyone together and interact with one another  the story revolves around loki and his quest to rule and be king and the tesseract from captain america crises happens and the crew is brought together but not before even more things happen and the team isnt really a team officially when the finally happens which by the way is unbelievingly awesome and just great  the cast is fine and with a huge cast like this why wouldnt it be its great great summer movie great action movie great fun with everything in between love this movie and anyone who loves heros will love this one only recommendation is that you watch the films that lead up to this one  already saw iron man 3 and thor the dark world waiting on captain america the winter soldier and guardians of the galaxy for the sequel the avengers age of ultron in 2015
Nov 20 2013,positive,loud actionpacked and fun the right ingredients for a comic blockbuster film
Nov 19 2013,positive,an entertaining romp through the marvel universe close to pure superhero spectacle gold
Nov 19 2013,positive,the story the six super heroes unite to fight against a global threat this action film is phenomenon and epic its the best film of marvel when i watched this movie im stagger all the spectators in the cinema applaud there are a lot of actions scene nearly two hours we havent the time for relax its fascinating the special effects are awesome its clearly amazing the graphics are perfectits top notably for the characters hulk and the scenery cityits for that avenger thrill fan of marvel and of action film but i understand the avengers haters maybe there are too action and a lot of scene are not decent not really possible  there is a good casting for example robert downing jr he is the best actor ever and he ist the moste popular and the most compelling actor in hollywood scarlett johansson she is the most beautiful actress on earth chris evans he played in many marvel films the other actors are not verry popular and they havent much talent that robert downing and chris evans apart avenger the movie maker joss whedon dont produce a good films its absolutely mediocre
Nov 19 2013,positive,as not a big marvel fan the avengers was still pretty good even though i didnt like it quite as much as most
Nov 19 2013,negative,boring and its trying too hard to be funny
Nov 18 2013,positive,overatedits the avengers wheres all the action
Nov 18 2013,negative,i hatedhated this movie   i attempted to watch it twicei just couldnt make it the whole way through so i had to watch it in halfs marvel movies are either realy awesome or a huge let downthis one was frustrating for me or any real marvel fan at least its better than the superman movies
Nov 17 2013,positive,whether a marvel geek or not marvels the avengers did everything right and oh boy it was a helluva fun time director joss whedon did an incredible job putting these characters from previous marvel films together and his and feiges take on putting the avengers together on screen was brilliant as well as the effects and the story itself grinning from cheek to cheek the film was great until the last twenty minutes the last twenty minutes were purely phenomenal hulk and captain america are awesome all the characters in the film matter and had a dynamic contribution to the storyline personally captain america is my favorite personal bias because he was the first superhero action figure and comic i had and i was six years old at that time and the way he was portrayed was awesome the film made me more excited for the winter soldier his banter with iron man was fun and you have to give credit to joss whedon for the conversations and character dynamics for a film that relies on strong character development and relationships joss whedon did an amazing job with that my only gripes about the film was that there was no antman and wasp in the avengers roster i understand the film has to be more grounded so it would make a lot more sense to add hawkeye and black widow and that they were apart of the earlier phase 1 films but antman and wasp were apart of the founding members of the avengers hawkeye is an amazing character and one of my favorite superheroes of all time but they misused him and made him more serious than he should have been the other gripe is a tiny one but it needs to be addresses how can the avengers communicate without any communicators just sayingto offset it was an amazing job of joss whedon of creating this dynamic storyline in which all of the characters have a relevant role that doesnt drag and entertains all the way for comic fans some would expect some serious weight to the film like in the dark knight especially when a certain character dies and the city endures massive casualties but it wasnt necessary these marvel studios movies under the direction of kevin feige knocked it out of the park and the avengers film sits up there as their crown jewel of achievement i gave the film five stars and even to extent the greatest superhero film of all time because it is everything a superhero film should be and surpasses the expectation the magic of having all of the franchises from phase one come together in an amazing story arc is undeniably awesome and it sets off on what appears to be a bright and limitless future for marvel
Nov 17 2013,positive,all it has going for it is the action because the story was terrible but they focused too much on it rather than the action but for the moments where the visuals could really show off wow lots of eye candy
Nov 17 2013,negative,i was bored  kept looking at the clock and taking breaks to look at my facebook newsfeed  i wanted to like it because its a joss wheedon movie and i love buffy  firefly and dollhouse sorry joss  but i couldnt get into this  maybe because the story is preexisting and the characters arent new  there just want anything to hook me in and make me care much about the outcome  there were some cool and sometimes beautiful  action sequences and the flying turtleeel things were pretty cool  but other than that not much interested me   some of the costumes were nice  but mostly i just want the last 2 hours b and 20 minutes back i mostly watched because i wanted to try watching sheild agents of storm and needed the backstory hopefully joss does something more exciting with that
Nov 17 2013,positive,this is a fun superhero film nothing else
Nov 16 2013,positive,big fan of marvels work thought it was great
Nov 16 2013,positive,open your eyes people the special effects are spectacular and the acting is solid but the main bulk of the movie is just trying to tame hulk only the last 30 min of the movie is actually defeating the real enemy
Nov 15 2013,positive,i was never a huge fan of marvel movies except for the xmen series and i still am not the avengers story was extremely weak and the combat and 3d was the only thing left behind to enjoy when they werent pacing around concentrating on a story they didnt even have all figured out
Nov 15 2013,positive,the avengers lives up to the massive hype as many movies a rarely can do i have never before had so much fun watching a superhero movie in my life with so many characters to handle from the multiple superhero franchises it could have easily failed but joss whedon gives each hero time to shine balancing all these characters with such care the script is packed with humor all around and adds to the enjoyment its well paced exciting and an absolute blast the final battle in new york is one of the most amusing battles and most satisfying movie climaxes i have ever viewed even the villain is awesome proving a formidable foe for the team seeing the struggles for the avengers to assemble is very funny all the personalities in the marvel universe facing off all the set up for this movie pays off and you will not be disappointed if you looked up entertainment in the dictionary id be surprised if this movie didnt pop up the avengers gets 55 stars a
Nov 15 2013,positive,thanks to strong performances from robert downey jr and mark ruffalo the avengers while formulaic in structure has intricate action sequences along with clever dialogue that makes it too fun to deny
Nov 15 2013,positive,this movie was amazing  i consider it to be a pinnacle of superhero filmography
Nov 14 2013,positive,an amazingly done film with great cgi and story whats not to love about tony starks hilarious comments and witty comebacks
Nov 14 2013,positive,great movie best movie in my life
Nov 14 2013,positive,enjoyed every minute of it simply stunning despite a huge cast robert downey jr steals the show with his charisma yet again awesome superheros film
Nov 13 2013,positive,the way they integrated each character was great they didnt miss a beat so excited for the next avengers adventure
Nov 13 2013,neutral,rerate 510 mediocre  overrated it cant even compare to other movies in the comic book genre like the dark knight or days of future past
Nov 12 2013,positive,fact marvels the avengers made more money then any other movie to me its one of the greatest superhero movies of all time hulk is the best
Nov 12 2013,positive,fantastic thor and loki were fantastic iron man of course stole the show
Nov 12 2013,positive,for a film that for a time had zero chance of existing the avengers brings together the best super hero league of them all in a fittingly glorifying fashion in joss we trust
Nov 12 2013,positive,avengers is a fairly decent flick even for comic book novices like myself watching guys fly around punching and zapping things is always great but beware take the story with a pinch of salt theres a few occasions particularly with captain america which are toe curling  downey jr as expected steals the show iron man just kicks arse and ruffalo as the hulk is great  its a pity the main villain was so weak though loki reminds me of orlando bloom in troy a pussy if they had had someone like patrick steward play the bad guy avengers would have been a 4 star movie
Nov 11 2013,positive,do you know whats hard to do apparently for me its writing a review on the avengers i think its because it is one of those films that everyone has so much to say about that getting in the conversation and actively adding to it is really difficult we have all seen the great spectacle and for the most part great movies that has defined the mcu marvels ambition has yielded great results and in recent memory i cant think of a movie thats had such a great pay off since the dark knight like the avengers has had    the good character intros dysfunctional team comedy escapism done very well tom hiddelston investment in the loss of coulson logical final fight quick pace in knowledge isnt necessary    the bad slow and weak opening very bland final enemy and caps uniform      the good    introducing characters in a franchise film like the avengers is really difficult there are going to be some who have seen iron man but not captain america or thor but not the incredible hulk joss whedon had the good sense to say to hell with it concise intros that perfectly reflect who the characters are and theyre intentions this is fantastic we have exposition that doesnt irritate the initiated into the series while accurately describing to new comers who these heroes are  whedon did the same on serenity and shows why he is one of the best scifi directors working today     cinema has its fair share of dysfunctional teams but not quite like the avengers does the premise almost sounds like a bad joke a billionaire genius a patriotic war hero a god and a man with anger issues have to work together  whedon does a really great job of showing off different ways the team is dysfunctional the obvious thor and hulk fight to captain america and iron mans huge culture and class clash while characters like coulson and us as the viewers look on in dismay all we want you to do is work together its great frustration and good story telling    escapism done right is impressive and has a high high replay value i saw the avengers six times in the cinemas the film never takes itself too seriously but also never forgets what is happening will this film change your life no will you watch it again and again yes this is great movie that is an easy watch     great escapist movies have great villains die hard had hanz gruber harry potter had voldemort and the avengers has tom hiddelstons loki loki is a devilish trickster whos swagger is disarmingly charming his motivations are sound and although i never really came to hate loki i did love his brand of villainy that if it were not for tom hiddelston would have been an unconvincing performance from any one else     the end of the world is a been there done that sort of fair its sad but really it is whedon had a better object at stake funny and average yet extraordinary phil coulson phil was almost like the audience in the moment more of an observer and yet he separated himself from us by his abilities when coulson died in the film that was worth avenging it was a novel move a dark surprise and not only solidified the team but also the ultimate motivation for the final battle    speaking of the final fight scene it was really welcome to see some logic behind a final fight instead of a messy oh god its everywhere final fight the team actively says logically we should contain this that tiny bit of foresight does wonders for not only the scale of the fight but the reliance on the team    the film has a very brisk pace it has to be for the amount of star power  that is very well divided among the team  many events in the film come and go all done justly and quickly with the team growing until it comes to a quick assemblage in new york considering the run time of the film it never feels like a long film    for the avengers ultimately being a sequel to several films it never feels like it the same foresight that kept the intros concise but elaborate is at work the entire movie you never need ot have seen another film in the mcu to understand just whats going on in the avengers its nice to have it especially in terms of scale but it never stalls or leaves you wondering about anything     the bad    the opening scene is the only moment in the film that sort of drags on its a lot of exposition about the tesseract and were it not for tom hiddelstons intro i would have thought the avengers opened with more of a splat than a bang thats not to say the film has a completely weak opening its just bloated and even a collapsing building barely warrants a meh     the chitauri are a very very bland enemy there is nothing distinctive about them and their ships look almost like transformers loki is leading an army of faceless followers and it is distracting their numbers are impressive yes but i never feared them and honestly to describe them is almost ot say grey velociraptor predatorish things weak support to a very strong antagonist    captain americas uniform in the first avenger is utilitarian plausible and works really well for the period piece had i been the one to make the call for captain americas uniform it would have been to stay in line with that maybe a bit more modern but lets not completely go full on spangly on the outfit caps outfit in the avengers is almost distracting it is uninspired and it does wonders to take the mask off the colors swirl together and create an unimpressive scheme in comparison especially to the other costume minor note but it still does damage since cap is such one of the leaders of the team    the avengers is a film that i honestly did not expect to succeed on the level that it did whedon is a great director and as his work in serenity showed he can work around a team marvel has raised the bar for escapist super heroes at the movies that will be difficult to match however it does suffer from an almost non starter beginning and issues in the visuals 8510
Nov 11 2013,positive,outstanding movie a pack of superhero
Nov 11 2013,positive,this film will always have a special place in everyones heart including mine josh whedons plan to bring the epic marvel universe together since 6 years has finally been fruitful hope that this never changes way to go marvel
Nov 11 2013,negative,incredibly overrated tv fare
Nov 10 2013,positive,the avengers brought together some of marvels greatest heroes as well as one of their greatest villains i thought that every one of the heroes got equal praise even characters like hawkeye and black widow loki was easily one of the best villains and could be compared to heath ledgers joker there was lots of unexpected humor and brought each characters strengths from all their individual films
Nov 10 2013,positive,boring it lost my atention by 34 of the movies
Nov 10 2013,positive,most awesome movie ever
Nov 9 2013,positive,is the avengers the greatest superhero movie ever made i think so its has amazing effects a terrific actionadventure script full of humor and great performances from a dedicated cast of young professionals who have made this group of american icons their own with repeated viewings ive just liked it more and more great stuff
Nov 9 2013,positive,it is in many ways the antidark knight a large loud extremely silly blastemup superhero epic that doesnt search for deeper meaning and doesnt care but sometimes a story about guys hitting aliens is just what the doctor ordered it may be completely pointless but it taps into a primal need of humans the need to have pure uncomplicated fun every now and then it is my pleasure to report that the avengers delivers
Nov 9 2013,positive,the best superhero movie
Nov 9 2013,positive,one of the best worth watching multiple times
Nov 8 2013,positive,welldone for the action genre kept attention entire movie nice variety of heroes with some character development and history causing the viewer to care about the what happens to the characters not a deepthinking movie but fun form 3 morals 3
Nov 7 2013,positive,definitely one of my top ten favorite movies of all time
Nov 7 2013,positive,having all the comic book characters in one big blockbuster movie spell epic
Nov 7 2013,positive,plotsummarymarvel studios presents marvels the avengersthe super hero team up of a lifetime featuring iconic marvel super heroes iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow when an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security nick fury director of the international peacekeeping agency known as shield finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster spanning the globe a daring recruitment effort begins my review this is one of the greatest films of all time and its the best comic book movie of all time ever since the ending credits of iron man where you see nick fury talking about the avengersever since you saw tony stark walk to general ross saying that they were putting a teamever since iron man 2 you saw black widownick furyagent colsunand seeing thors hammerever since thor you see hawkeyeand loki taking unlimited powerever since captain americayou see a small quick tease of the avengerswe have been waiting for earths mightest heroes to assemble on the big screen and know that day has come the avengers were born the avengers revolves around a group of heroes iron man captain americahulkthorblack widowhawkeye who are all formed to stop loki and his army this one hell of a film a great one and all i can say is if you love the hulk see this movie now this truly is the best hulk ive ever seen on film mark ruffalo as drbanner is amazingrobert downey junior is as great as iron man as alwayschris evans owns captain america and i cannot stress this enough its the best comic book movie of all time
Nov 6 2013,positive,i saw this without seeing any of the iron man movies i had only seen thor and captain america so i was a little lost on some of the character relationships and call backs to other movies  also i found several parts to be boring  at least there were some very funny laugh out loud moments    maybe ill try it again at some point
Nov 6 2013,positive,it is an incredible film about a group of superheroes with the fight against asgards god loki the with the tesseract wants to open a portal to a different world and enjoy his army on the world of men the superheroes of the film are iron man the incredible hulk black widow captain america thor hawkeye there are leader is director fury the superheros together  i think the film super there is so much going on to keep on the hard drive the computer animation is excellent you should not think that they did this in a highly developed computer the fight scenes are exceptional the film also has some disadvantages you can easily guess what would happen and that the avengers want to win against loki it is very predictable the film was also very expensive it cost more than 255 million usdollars
Nov 5 2013,positive,this is more like it  the avengers manages to lose the slow build up the horrible love stories and focus on what it does best  being ridiculous it does help that they manage to throw in some capable villains tom hiddleston was excellent
Nov 5 2013,negative,suspension of believe buffer overflow
Nov 5 2013,positive,witty philosophical selfaware funny and dynamic
Nov 3 2013,positive,mark makes for the best hulk
Nov 3 2013,positive,if the money it made nor these rating numbers dont convince you how fun this movie is then nothing i can write here will if you refuse to watch it because it has superheros and monsters i would say your you need to open your horizons a bit more
Nov 3 2013,positive,really was almost perfect cant wait for the next one
Nov 3 2013,positive,off the chain enjoyed
Nov 2 2013,positive,marvels the avengers ends phase 1 with a bang it is marvels best film to date with perfectly written characters great cinematography a great score and great performances from all of the actors but this all couldnt have been the same without directorwriter joss whedon who absolutely nailed the entire film giving fans as nonfans alike a lot of excitement to take as well as some great actionset pieces and very great character moments
Nov 2 2013,positive,really good i cant wait for the second and third one
Nov 2 2013,positive,this was an awesome superhero movie you have a whole lot of superheroes kicking lokis scrawny little ass over and over again thats all i have to say
Nov 2 2013,positive,for 4 years marvel had been leading up to this movie and it definitely doesnt disappoint the action is amazing the main characters have great chemistry and where many other directors would fail joss whedon makes it so each character has important things to do in the movie my only complaint is that hawkeye does not get alot of screentime but that is only a minor complaint considering how big this film universe is and hopefully soon well be able to see more of him on screen
Nov 2 2013,positive,a truly mind blowing experience speaking as a true fan of the genre and somebody whose been following these character both on the screen and in the comics this film was everything i could have asked for not only is marvels the avengers a dream come true for any true marvel comics fan but even both casual fans and regular movie goers wont be able to resist the exhilaration and grandness that is marvels the avengers
Oct 31 2013,positive,as much as i loved avengers it pains me to see that whedon opted for a popcorn flick over what couldve been a revolutionary film in the superhero genre the cast has perfect chemistry with each other and while i understand that whedon couldnt have known this i still feel like there was too much comedy in this film
Oct 31 2013,positive,i love this movie it is loaded with really incredible action and there is also several funny moments as well most of which came from iron man rdj is so cool lol
Oct 31 2013,positive,great moviemore hulk
Oct 31 2013,positive,great movie  loved every character  they did a really good job on the acting part
Oct 30 2013,positive,if this isnt an epic superhero movie then i dont know what is the groundbreaking special effects fantastic and yet slightly unexpected storyline and of course the superb acting from everyone involved made this film the groundbreaker that it was robert downey jr brings his loved portrayal of tony stark the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist into the mix which creates some beautiful chemistry downey jr takes the beloved iron man down emotional paths we have never seen before which creates an interesting scenario to view chris evans returns as the first avenger with his shield at the ready with some wonderful dialogue and leadership which seeps through evans performance chris hemsworth makes a comeback as the mighty thor who we see strutting his stuff in his usual fashion we also see some wonderful chemistry between him and other members of the cast such as robert downey tom hiddleston and clark gregg mark rufallos first outing as dr bruce banner aka the hulk is an absolute gem rufallo takes the character to levels we have never seen before surpassing that of eric bana and edward norton by a long shot tom hiddlestons portrayal as the devious and loveable loki makes for the type of villain we love to see in a movie he loves doing what he does the chilling enjoyment and enthusiasm for his work makes loki a tricky and intriguing villain he has certainly evolved since we saw him in thor 2011 other charming and dominating performances include samuel l jackson as the nick fury leader of shield whose past is a thought provoking mystery clark gregg as phil coulson who we learn is the ultimate goodguy who isnt afraid to fire very large laser powered weapons scarlett johansson as black widownatasha romanoff johanssons performance as the talented and stategic black widow is certainly a highlight jeremy renner also stands out as hawkeye  the legolas of the avengers we see him at the height of his abilities giving everything he has to save new york renner portrays barton well and i only see potential for a more elaborated hawkeye with more past to play with especially seeing as his relationship with natasha romanoff is such an intriguing one the film depicts some epic nexttoreal visual effects a huge highlight of which is the hulk in the avengers we see him looking better and more realistic than ever the look of the chitauri army should also be commended as from a design point of view these alien creatures look spectacular  overall a hugely enjoyable movie that should be seen by anyone who enjoys movies this thrill ride of superb acting perfect visual effects and a design that can hardly be matched will stay with people for a long time all i can say is bring on the sequel avengers age of ultron
Oct 29 2013,positive,god dammit this movie is brilliant

Oct 27 2013,negative,with all the money behind it it should have been much better i have to give it a low score for how cookie cutter the product  was with such promise behind it and i wanted the movie to be good this movie game comic book fans a quick kick to the balls

Oct 23 2013,negative,img    overrated shallow boring pew pew pew kabloom  these are words that describe joss whedons god of the nerds avengers  what really impressed me was how this film rips off transformers 3 and gets a 94  now im not saying tf3 deserves a 94 but it is pretty much a double standard  i would say that man of steel is the same thing but that film was pretentious  anyways this film holds no significance to anything  its really a waste of time      there are many unanswered questions such as how was hulk able to control his power and why did all the aliens just die suddenly when their ship exploded  listen you may say that you enjoyed it as dumb fun but if you say this was the best film evar lolololol  i seriously think you are retarded  even the answered questions such as how thor got to earth were glossed over really quickly  no seriously they only mention that in one line  there are many gaping plot holes such as what did loki accomplish by getting captured  the film is just here to show some splosions and a little pew pew  the script has to have been written in 10 minutes cause this was embarrassing      well after the events of cpt america all the heroes unite to fight loki and his incredibly foolproof plan to enslave mankind  the film is pg13 but it couldve slipped away with a pg seeing how only one person dies besides the aliens but he comes back on marvels show  seriously at least transformers 3 and man of steel werent afraid of deaths but no no one can die  that may be a nitpick but it really pisses me off  also the actions scenes were all just boom boom kabloom bow pew pew and there was too many jumpcuts i couldnt even tell what was going on      the acting was okay i guess  robert downey jr still plays robert downey jr so if you liked him in the previous iron man films youll like him here  scarlett johanson is terribly miscast as black widow again  she has no charm or charisma and at the end of the day she just has some nice tits  chris hemsworth as thor is alright  all he really does is speak in shakespearean language and flexes his muscles  chris evans who i despise as an actor is terrible as the cap  he is wooden and very cheesy and campy  samuel l jackson is probably the best part of this film as he is often hilarious think django unchained  jeremy renner who i believe is one of the most underrated actors in hollywood the hurt locker sucked though is practically given nothing and he just stands around shooting arrows  mark ruffalo another underrated actor is an okay hulk but he isnt given any good substance     but after 2 12 hours of sitting through the deluge of explosions witty banter and generic storytelling i was happy the movie ended all around me there were people applauding and telling each other what an awesome movie they just saw my plan was just to go home and put on a real movie with plot twists and character development both things i missed in the avengers you could say its fast paced but if the story doesnt grab you by the balls its all irrelevant the only thing the movie had going for itself was that it was hilarious to bad it were the scenes that didnt mean to be  i knew after five minutes that the movie wasnt going to live up to the hype and it was only downhill from there to be honest the last sequence was the worst in my book the alien invasion was so stupid we were all wondering what was going to come through the black hole and what came to wipe out all of humanity a few hundred alien beings wow is that an invasion six avengers got their stuff together and mobbed the floor with them that was a huge anticlimax    and the major major flaw oh i might have already let that slip this movie is boring surely i cant be so bored that easily by a film ive never seen before its impossible avengers yes theres some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me yaaaawwn honestly i was expecting to enjoy the avengers especially since i kinda liked the thor movie nothing to do with portman who does very little for me and also my total nonappreciation for the avengers goes against what id hoped that i could say something great about this film and be able to champion joss whedon for a new era of scifi movies serenity was good very good  albeit with forgivably tvmovie quality unfortunately it seems budget wasnt the limiting factor and ive now lost interest    john tyler you can go fuck yourself for thinking this film is much better than spiderman 2 which had a story and character development rather than boom pew pew
Oct 22 2013,positive,this is the movie that made the super hero team happen outstanding job
Oct 22 2013,negative,absolutely terrible only redeeming factors were loki and scarlett johansson the plot was way beyond predictable
Oct 21 2013,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever  fulfills the dream watching super heroes matched up against eachother until they unite and become a super force
Oct 19 2013,negative,maybe it was the hot shower and glass of sangria zzzzzzzzz
Oct 19 2013,positive,one of the best superhero films of all time that manages to meet our expectations and make it worth the wait this is the film that we had been waiting for years and provides exhilarating action impressive performances a wonderful story and dazzling visuals with the overwhelming success of this film expect a justice league film to be finally made anytime soon
Oct 18 2013,negative,i appreciate im in the minority but i found this underwhelming to say the least  the heroes spent the first hour trading playground insults while absolutely nothing happens  things brighten up in the second half when they finally get round to bashing the bad guys but there is zero plot zero suspense and zero brain cells required  ok if you like watching things exploding and an extra star for a few comic moments
Oct 18 2013,positive,how can anybody not love this
Oct 18 2013,positive,best superhero movie ever
Oct 17 2013,positive,as cheesy as it was it always reminds us the main reason for why we pay to see films
Oct 15 2013,positive,black widow and the hulk  theres nothing else to say
Oct 15 2013,positive,i dont hate it but it is over rated
Oct 14 2013,negative,illogical silly crap no idea everyone likes it
Oct 13 2013,positive,amazing movie with all the superheroes
Oct 13 2013,positive,joss whedon has really outdone himself this is a movie that i call a masterpiece
Oct 13 2013,positive,i dont know what all the fuss is about its no dark knight but its also not bad
Oct 12 2013,positive,was a very heart warming film for all those superhero fans out there
Oct 12 2013,positive,as a marvel fan for years it was truly exciting to watch a movie totally dedicated to earths mightiest heroes the film itself was a hit from beginning to end though the pacing dragged a bit in some scenes the overall duration of the movie was satisfying for a true comicbook fan the witty dialogue is a contributing factor to the films success though hawkeye wasnt portrayed with true character the rest of the cast delivered an intense film
Oct 12 2013,positive,funny and very entertaining
Oct 11 2013,positive,a perfect comic book come to life
Oct 11 2013,positive,great action scenes the storyline is awesome cant wait to see part 2
Oct 10 2013,positive,every single thing about this movie is either epic or the work of a genius i saw this three times in theatres and never grew tired of it it had me cheering laughing and on my toes the whole time im not a ginormous fan of marvel but i can already tell this is their best film yet
Oct 9 2013,positive,awesome movie amazing cast and just all i can say is wow
Oct 8 2013,negative,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that it disappointed me i felt that i had seen it all before and overall was uninspired the highest grossing film of 2012 d
Oct 8 2013,negative,i was looking forward to seeing this movie but have to say that it disappointed me i felt that i had seen it all before and overall i was uninspired
Oct 8 2013,positive,marvel has put a lot of effort into producing the marvel cinematic universe and after the success of this film it seems to be getting much bigger and more ambitious before making the avengers the studio decided to have a couple of films dedicated to each main character and in a way filled the world that would then be the setting of the avengers honestly i dont think this film would be as successful if it wasnt for those films so as years and films gone by the hype for the avengers kept growing larger and larger as we have never seen a film so ambitious in its cast and its concept in 2008 when iron man came out we never thought that this would be possible now here it is does joss whedons take on the avengers do it justice my answer is yes but not to a point of high praise  the avengers was written by joss whedon who is commonly known as the showrunner of some of the best tv series of this generation he is an experienced writer but when it came to films he has very little to brag about whedons work has always been known to be ambitious and in a way quirky especially in dialogue what whedon has created for this film is actually quite simple in its plot it touches on themes that have been explored on many films before and is a common aspect in comic books these themes include teamwork ego good vs evil responsibility and war i didnt mind whedon in applying these themes to this film because they are universally relatable and it allows the films plot to be simplistic my biggest concern in his writing is the characters i think whedon was happy to have the opportunity to work on multiple different characters and he knows that he could express each one with their own individual personality allowing the characters to feel unique and at the start be uncohesive with each other but whedon has forgotten to give any character a sense of depth beyond their dialogue as he just wanted things go quickly as they could to the parts that have us jumping in excitement i understand that the individual marvel films are the one that showcases this multilayered character study that i was looking for but that doesnt mean that the avengers should lack it almost completely i dont care if the film spends more time on these characters and letting the film run at 3 hours because it would have allowed me to appreciate more than just the surface of these characters whedon sometimes make their personalities and intentions too obvious which takes me aback as it doesnt feel at all natural it is almost as if he was too afraid that we might not entirely get it though there was potential in characters like maria hill phil coulson and natasha romanoff but very brief whedons dialogue on the other hand was fun to listen to as the back and forth between members of the group as tension rises were the best moments of the film through dialogue whedon has shown us just how different these characters are and how each one thinks they are above one another  joss whedon is also the director for this film he also doesnt have a lot of directed films in his name as he seems to be more preoccupied with his work on tv the success of the avengers did open doors for him and allowed him to create films with more creative control like with his next film much ado about nothing i could see a bit of artistic license in the avengers but at the same time i felt it was a bit too tame i am not sure whether this was a result of the studio or it was the intention of the director in order for the film to be appropriate for its younger audience it would have been nice if we actually see some civilians die during the fight in new york so at the end we can really feel that the event was a huge travesty to our kind and that we have hope it wont happen again whedon has created something very ambitious containing a number of characters and yet still give enough screen time for each one the area where whedon has impressed me is the last hour and a half of the film this is where the action comes in supported with big sequences that are memorable and exciting whedon has given the last fight a large portion of the running time because he wanted it to be better than what anybody else could have thought of which i personally agree the film contains a lot of visual effects but it doesnt come off as fake or lacking in texture because the budget and time that was given to him allowed the film to be polished ergo having the audience be immersed in the experience my main issue was the first hour of the film as it felt very rushed it contained fast editing cuts that made things feel off i think whedon trimmed a hefty amount in order to move the plot along and i think that was a bad decision as more time with these characters at the start would have allowed the audience to identify with them easier overall i think whedon did a good job in creating a film that contained so many beloved characters and still make a decent movie out of it its a tough job and maybe it could have been a different experience if someone else helmed the project but nevertheless it was good enough  the films director of photography is seamus mcgarvey what mcgarvey and whedon have done with the films cinematography is disappointing as the film contained many shots that felt unnecessary there were many moments earlier in the film where i ask myself âwhy did they use that angleâ or âwhat was the point of itâ i felt that some shots were too concerned in what would be filled in it rather than what it could do for the actors performance or its connectionrelevance to the films plot or themes it is during the moments that contained action sequences is where the films photography shines as the irritating approach they applied for the slow and earlier parts of the film would actually work in this situation i assume a lot of the film is shot with a green screen but it never proves to be as obvious or distracting like in baz luhrmanns the great gatsby the film also uses a more handheld approach for most of the scenes assumingly using a steadicam i was really hoping for this film to knock me off my feet when it comes to its cinematography but sadly that wasnt the case  the films score was handled by alan silvestri who is mostly known as a collaborator with robert zemeckis silvestris work here is astounding the films score is so grand and memorable that it becomes the first thing i think about when i recall back to this film yes it does follow the many trademarks and styles in mainstream action films but this is an example of one that is excellently crafted the films theme track is the highlight of the score as it just hits the right notes and when it comes it feels so epic that you cant help but get goose bumps when it comes on  the avengers contains a wide cast and overall i felt that they did quite well with their roles it is already established from their previous films that they have already given these legendary characters justice the stand out performances mainly came from robert downey jr mark ruffalo scarlett johansson clark gregg and cobie smulders the rest were good but their roles i felt were underdeveloped therefore the actors were limited with what they can do with it  in the end i thought this film was a bit of a letdown but there were some areas that bring this up and keep it from being a disaster its something that i would definitely watch again just for its amazing action sequences and to hear the chilling score but thats really about it
Oct 6 2013,positive,dont get me wrong i loved this film ive seen this film about 7 times but i felt like all the characters were quickly thrown into their own films so that they could make avnegers
Oct 6 2013,positive,one of my favorite superhero movies of all time it has awesome actions great characters and acting stunning cinematography and effects and an awesome story
Oct 6 2013,positive,candy for your inner manchild i still cant believe they pulled it off
Oct 5 2013,positive,director joss whedon finds a way to reunite an all star cast and make a comic book adaptation classic awesome action and acting to make it a top movie of the year
Oct 5 2013,positive,heck everybody likes it even me
Oct 5 2013,positive,finally the avengers are assembled and does it pay off to put it lightly yesyes it does  it has tons of mind blowing action that never leaves out any of the heroes
Oct 4 2013,positive,it was a f awesome movie but what happened with the hulk you cant change the character like that but otherwise it was pretty cool fighting scenes are pretty awesome i like the final battle
Oct 1 2013,positive,cool movie it got so much hype before it came out i kinda expected more but still enjoyed watching it thought dark knight rises was better by far
Sep 30 2013,positive,the quirky wild fun of the marvel comic books adapted purely and prominently into film its a wellstructured and eyecatching affair thats hard not to enjoy
Sep 30 2013,positive,the best superhero movie
Sep 28 2013,positive,about what i expected not great but good enough for what it had to be
Sep 28 2013,positive,good mindless entertainment a year after seeing it i cant remember a single thing about it
Sep 28 2013,positive,a lot better than i would have imagined  not being familiar with any of the films from which the characters are drawn and barely familiar with the comic series i had only the story presented in this film to go on the direction appeared to be spoton as many of the cameraangles were great the cgi was good but the action was a little to drawn out of for me despite some awesome fight scenes worth a watch even for those nonblockbuster film fans such as myself
Sep 27 2013,positive,great action scenes and soundtrack but for me there was too much dialogue  probably just my preference the action scenes were well made but lacked a certain quality to it i wanted a more intense fighting sequence  the film in general is excellently produced but my preferences get in the way of this if this wasnt actiony enough for me and although the atmosphere of the film is perfect  it made the film a little boring excellent cast and performance
Sep 27 2013,positive,it has its faults mainly with a predictable plot but damn is it a good movie one that raises the bar from which all others must be judged  710  good
Sep 25 2013,positive,fantastic work by joss whedon
Sep 25 2013,positive,the best marvel movie
Sep 25 2013,positive,generally good  liked that there were so many superheros in this movie but all fighting just one bad guy  turns out loki has an army  iron man had some great memorable lines  loki had a great scene in the beginning and then later with thor and iron man  hawkeye and black widows conversation after he came to his senses was really good  the last battle scene was too much mindless action for me that went on too long  the dialogue between the characters was much better  thor and lokis relationship was very interesting as well
Sep 25 2013,positive,this movie makes me wanna wear a cape and punch bad guys
Sep 25 2013,positive,great movie the whole family loved it
Sep 24 2013,positive,it was a bit hard to follow the story while staring at mark ruffalo in that purple shirt of sex
Sep 24 2013,positive,what a blockbuster  im still watching it over and over
Sep 23 2013,positive,awesome movie  such a collaboration of awesome powers and its executed just right i forgot how much i enjoyed seeing hulk smash truly an epic movie with all the fixings
Sep 23 2013,positive,action comedy superheroes everything you could want in a summer blockbuster no complaints this is one of the few movies ive seen over and over again in the theater
Sep 23 2013,positive,arguably one of the best superhero films ive ever seen
Sep 23 2013,positive,while the first 35 minutes are boring and the tesseract is never fully explained properly this movie is a ton of fun and is definitely one to see i dont think they did the villain justice and there wasnt enough character development the cgi is fantastic and its really enjoyable to watch i would recommend it
Sep 22 2013,positive,i loved this movie so much a funny but  action movie at the same time
Sep 22 2013,positive,great movie one of my favorites
Sep 22 2013,neutral,an action movie with too much talking the avengers is a very watchable very overrated superhero movie
Sep 21 2013,positive,great film lots of action funny when is sequel
Sep 21 2013,positive,iron manhulkcaptain americathor all in the same film yep a 55
Sep 20 2013,positive,real lighthearted and funny very selfaware for such a huge blockbuster
Sep 20 2013,positive,great good to see the super heroes working together  i thought the film started a bit slow but once it got into it it was good iron man is the best
Sep 20 2013,positive,all super heroes at one time one movie
Sep 20 2013,positive,10 acting  8 writing  7 dialogue  8 plot  characterization  85 cinematography  editing  95 soundtrackscore  set design  9 how much i enjoyed it personally  85
Sep 19 2013,positive,for some reason i did not like this film i can see why people liked it however i think it still was predictable for example when the avengers fought between each other i always thought they would end up as friends also loki was an awfull villain i mean he is enterteining tom does a good job however the moment he is smashed by hulk he just becomes a comical relief and no longer a threatening villain unlike obidia or the joker the action was fun but it didnt feel intense also the climatic final battle felt too much like independence day spoilers in both movies the aliens are defeated by an atom bomb and a few other similarities hawkeye and black widow in the final battle are you kidding me i just never beliebed that i mean iron man has a suit thor is a god captain america and hulk have powers but hawkeye and the widowm come on that was way too stupid i never bought that also when loki gets captured i instantly thpught he got himself captured on porpouse however the movie had a really awsome moment that is when coulson died i never expected that and also when nick fury makes the avengers unite was awsome however the final battle was comical and fun instead of dramatic as those previous scenes where making it have a dull pace i cann see why people like it it has drama action good characters and actors not so many cliches but for one reson i always saw miself one step ahead of the movie the movie never caught me i saw it as it was a predictable not so fun action blockbuster with not that much tension
Sep 18 2013,positive,great scifi movieworth seeing dont wait for dvd
Sep 18 2013,positive,the movie was not exaggerated and the heroes dont have powers beyond the solar system which the superheroes can appear in real life except for the hulk this movie runs with the possibilities that can happen in real life
Sep 17 2013,negative,honestly people this is the most overrated film off all time and it flatout sucks
Sep 17 2013,negative,horrible movie  really really horrible  bad story line bad acting bad casting  totally unrealistic  its like all they wanted to do was spend the entire movie smashing things up i was shocked at how bad this movie was  and i loved iron man and captain america  the only positive about the movie was loki  he makes a really good bad guy
Sep 17 2013,positive,i loved seeing this in the theater and bought it once it came out on dvd
Sep 16 2013,positive,the movie was great and i live how they took there time to make it but the one thing is when hulk in the movie is crazy and just destroys anything randomly becomes allies with the avengers you tell me of your thoughts about this
Sep 14 2013,positive,this is itthe end all be all of superhero movies or so ive been told  usually throwing a bunch of superstars together in the same movie is a recipe for disaster but this one actually holds its own  character and actor continuity is key with all sequels and its fun seeing all of the charactersactors together after being showcased in their own individual stories  the script is fun and light and doesnt get bogged down in mythology  pretty solid overall
Sep 11 2013,positive,has become one of my favorite superhero movies of all time
Sep 10 2013,positive,insanely high rotten tomato score for what this movie was i do not agree with the critics it was a cliché and repetitive super hero movie
Sep 10 2013,positive,seen bits and pieces on youtube pretty good
Sep 10 2013,positive,the money made on this film speaks to the excellent plot and quality cast it also speaks to the worlds craving for something larger than ourselves
Sep 10 2013,negative,i could entertain myself more if i was wading around in a pool of my shit
Sep 10 2013,positive,i am a fan of all the marvels movie they make and this one is sooo good
Sep 9 2013,positive,lots of fun but lots of needed destruction too ok movie but compared to the other summer superhero movies in theaters during its run amazing spiderman and dkr it could not compare in execution good superhero movie though compared to green lantern and batman
Sep 8 2013,positive,same idea as transformers
Sep 8 2013,positive,excitingfunny and hulk
Sep 7 2013,positive,slow start but the action was good   big thing for me was it was an ironman movie my kids 4  9could watch without me having to explain a lot of adult relationship humor
Sep 6 2013,positive,so funny cool effects
Sep 6 2013,positive,the avengers is as good as it could possibly be its not a good film but it is a great cap off to the series like harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 it functions poorly as a film yet incredibly well as the climax that it should be  its too bad that theyre still making more of them
Sep 6 2013,positive,a thrilling roller coaster of a film that never lets down on action and has some great cgi but is lacking in plot better than i expected much due to the performances of robert downey jr and samuel l jackson but still a bit too much whizz bang for my taste
Sep 6 2013,positive,one line summary lots of action in the marvel universe        loki travels to earth with the help of aliens who intend to invade  loki steals the tesseract in order to open a portal from the invaders location to earth  while doing this he instills a large amount of tension among certain shield operatives      the shield project avengers gets started to counter lokis activity  by the time the avengers iron man thor hulk black widow hawkeye captain america get done dealing with each others egos loki has opened the portal      when the invaders flow through to earth the avengers and the shield flagship are already bruised and battered  will the avengers save earth  scores      cinematography 810 the blend of sfx and real photography was consistently well done      sound 610 the volume levels were wildly out of control      acting 810 better than i expected  i liked the performances of downey hiddleston ruffalo johansson renner and gregg quite a bit      screenplay 910 the story was well told  two hours and twentytwo minutes is fairly long but went along very smoothly
Sep 5 2013,positive,even if the pacing was fast as hell and the introduction to some characthers like hawkeye was not there the entertainment value of this pop master piece is gigantic
Sep 4 2013,positive,great storytelling and years of preparation helped to bring this film to as best as possible with amazing performances and great action scenes
Sep 4 2013,positive,this film has changed the whole genre of superhero films forever
Sep 4 2013,positive,this movie fully exploits the moviegoers anticipation to see characters that have appeared in their own solo movies in the same universe join forces for possibly the best action movie in recent memorythis movie kinda is very slow and kinda boring in its first 30 minutes and the alien robots are quite generic but most fanboys and fangirls really wont mind because their just getting wet  from seeing their favorite superheros kick ass marvels the avengers is the greatest superhero movie when comes too action and it lives up to the hype that was made from all the easter eggs that have happened since the first iron man
Sep 3 2013,negative,continuing the latest generic marvel movie trend the avengers shows no signs of deviating from the daredevil of all action fodder it doesnt take any risks instead plays the family friendly budding superheroes card laced with insufferable clichés it begs the question have i seen this before even if you havent it feels like you have a testament to what marvel has always been mediocre
Sep 2 2013,positive,not bad but not as great as everyone says
Sep 2 2013,positive,awesomegreat fabolas boys girls teens and adults will like this flick so good have it on dvd
Sep 2 2013,positive,only thing necessary to say is that this is awesome
Sep 2 2013,negative,the movie has received many glowing reviews but i fail to see the overall entertainment value there is almost no plot and there are many inconsistencies such as bruce magically appearing to save the wimps of marvel from a small scale invasion the new hulk looks stupid compared to the incredible hulk film there is only 1 fight scene that isnt amongst the team members and it is conveniently ended with a nuke in a wormhole there is a little comedy but it wouldnt make it anymore watchable is ur had more
Sep 2 2013,positive,despite the recasting of bruce banner which normally really bugs me i actually loved this movie i love marvel movies and was pleasantly surprised how well whedon weaved the many storylines so seamlessly together theres no shortage of action or handsome men in this one its a must see
Sep 2 2013,positive,the avengers is no doubt one of the greatest if not the best superhero movie ever
Sep 2 2013,positive,pretty much the same as iron man 1  2 quality entertainment with a great cast
Sep 1 2013,positive,this superhero film is a little pop style but is totally entertaining smart and is well done
Sep 1 2013,positive,this movie was just epic i really liked so did my two brothers
Aug 31 2013,positive,live action avengers was what we wanted and we werent disappointed great story and awesome special effects deserving of your undivided attention
Aug 31 2013,positive,several very decent individual avenger movies culminate beautifully in joss whedons the avengers it comes together so perfectly nicely paced fun characters dramatic yet fun my only complaint about this film and its a very small complaint is the acura product placement its one thing to issue shield agents company acuras  that acceptable but when capt usa black widow and hawkeye run out of a freshly crashed plane into a war zone  right past an undamaged acura suv that takes up half the shot thats taking it a bit far 
Aug 31 2013,positive,can you say best superhero movie ever made action emotion and some seriously funny moments make this one as many critics have put it not just an awesome superhero film  its an awesome film period
Aug 31 2013,neutral,am i the only one who felt this movie was empty hawkeye and widow were underused and the mindless effortless destruction of countless aliens was just dull i mean if youve seen all the films then youve seen lots of explosions and flying and after four individual franchises it becomes monotonous there wasnt even any strategy to defeating loki they just wandered into the city and killed lots of monsters then loki gets beaten up and iron man almost dies
Aug 31 2013,positive,witty and high action with flawless comedy
Aug 31 2013,positive,whedon makes the film work so well and makes the movie unbelievably fun
Aug 31 2013,positive,it was just a delight to the eyes
Aug 31 2013,positive,second best super hero movie ever made behind only batman rises in my opinion
Aug 31 2013,positive,a movie well waiting for  it was great to see what marvel had in the makings for so many years
Aug 30 2013,positive,the avengers surprisingly transitions one of marvels most famous comic series into one of the best blockbuster superhero films of all time boasting an ensemble cast of robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston and samuel l jackson excellent use of cgi adrenaline rushing action sequences and appeal to old and newer viewers by balancing source material with cinematic pleasure
Aug 30 2013,positive,i revolves around and relies solely on the action sequences and it never fails to deliver everything we wanted and more
Aug 30 2013,positive,after loki steals the infinitely powerful tesseract from nick fury the director of shield puts together the group that hes had in the works for years gathering iron man the hulk  thor captain america hawkeye  and black widow the team of  lost creatures takes on loki and  his army to save the world    plot of the avengers contains lots of action and lots of use of special effectscgi to make it hugely entertaining director joss whedon made this thrill ride without any major flaws story written by zak penn is good perfect story for this kind of film the pace of the film is accelerated by many thrilling scenes  cinematography is absolutely brilliant dialogues are good especially funny one liners delivered by robert downey jr editing is sharp every scene is perfect  also film is very good in character development department     the performances in the avengers are excellent robert downey jr as iron man is charming chris evans plays the role of captain america sensibly mark ruffalo as hulf does very good his character in final battle is absolutely brilliant after watching this film i added tom hiddleston in my favorite villains list he is awesome as menacing loki also  scarlett johansson jeremy renner chris hemsworth are brilliant in their roles     overall the avengers is an absolutely brilliant film packed with mindblowing action a perfect summer blockbuster
Aug 29 2013,positive,though im a dc fan more i was excited to see it and this is the avengers film that all could imagine joss whedon has created it wonderfully im hoping that the sequel will be just as good if not better
Aug 29 2013,positive,its a very actionpacked  fun movie  story not really  it was really predictable  but you know what  thats ok  i enjoyed seeing these characters on screen  i enjoyed watching the avengers come to life  if i had any complaints it would be about the underusage of hawkeye thor trying to kill captain america for no reason and banners contrivance of control over the hulk  even with that joss whedon was the perfect guy to bring this to fruition  i cannot wait to see if they do this better the second time around
Aug 29 2013,positive,the most surprising aspect of this film for me was the writing  yes the script itself  the humor and the dialogue  it made it seem like before they could have a chance to do anything as a team they would first have to bicker as all humans superhumans gods mutants do  larger than life and yet at times so relatable  i would like to see more of bruce banner and tony stark sharing scenes in the future just because of their individual genius and shared interests   i think that was really rewarding to see and hear
Aug 29 2013,positive,very good wrap up for marvels phase one
Aug 28 2013,positive,best one ever from marvel i really  enjoyedi can see it as many times  never get tired of it cant wait to see the second one hulk he is the man
Aug 28 2013,positive,as much as i love this film it just had something missing dont get me wrong id watch avengers every night if i felt like it anyway the characters are spot on how they are in the comics captain america is the leader iron man is comic relief etc everything was great but it felt just satisfying not spectacular sorry
Aug 28 2013,positive,i can never resist a superhero movie so i loved this
Aug 27 2013,positive,its fun 4 stars bc i was expecting a mess unprepared for ensemble film that was so good at balancing the cast
Aug 27 2013,positive,really good movie but the hulk was the icing in the cake
Aug 26 2013,positive,this movie was awesome cant wait for the sequel
Aug 25 2013,positive,very few summer blockbuster movies ever live up to the hype thats built ridiculously high for them  however marvels the avengers is one major exception  packed with heroes action heart and wit this supercharged epic ranks with films such as the dark knight spiderman 2 and iron man films that have raised the standard for heroes in capes and masks on the big screen
Aug 25 2013,positive,best marvel movie to date absolutely magnificent
Aug 25 2013,positive,amazing action and had loads of superheroes im it so obviously it was good
Aug 24 2013,positive,had it all violence funny and comics no complaints here
Aug 24 2013,positive,one of the hero greatest movie ever since ironman must watch and own it
Aug 24 2013,positive,a geeky nerdy orgasmic dream so much fun great performances from downey jr ruffalo hiddleston and hemsworth with great writing and direction from whedon the only thing that brings it down a bit is evans captain america who looks absolutely ridiculous and renners hawkeye who adds very little also the characters with no powers here are able to do the unbelievable with no explanation at all its a distraction for me but i absolutely love this movie and watch it regularly fanfuckingtastic
Aug 23 2013,positive,this was such an inspiring super hero film at this point films like this are played out and as of late they are being dragged out for hours and hours but this was one very good it was brilliant how they came together and saved the city of new york which always needs saving worth seeing though
Aug 23 2013,positive,phenomenal movie humor great acting stunning visuals and lots of great action whats not to love
Aug 23 2013,positive,this was some good stuff joss whedon i was hooked from beginning to end i cant wait for more
Aug 22 2013,positive,love this movie so funny  action packed
Aug 22 2013,positive,perfect action movie nuff said
Aug 21 2013,positive,excellent best movie of the year
Aug 21 2013,positive,great film so entertaining i look forward to joss whedon doing more marvel
Aug 20 2013,neutral,lots of explosions which i grow weary of but it was also plenty of fun lots of movies packed into one sort of like expendables
Aug 20 2013,positive,cool movie it was a long time coming and it payed off super overrated in my opinion though
Aug 19 2013,negative,given the other relatively good movies leading up to avengers i found this flick to overly strong on outlandish action and extremely weak on plot if i wish to be overwhelmed by giant flying aircraft carriers again ill just watch sky captain and the world of tomorrow as it had a much more interesting plot and good threedimensional characters if whedons goal was to turn a two dimensional comic book into a two dimensional movie then he succeeded if your looking for any depth though your definitely going to need your 3d glasses
Aug 19 2013,positive,good movie i enjoyed and purchased
Aug 19 2013,positive,the pinnacle of the comic book movie the avengers holds a special place in my heart for being hands down the best experience ive had at the cinema when you are in a crowded screen full of people with tremendously high expectations and each and every one of them is crying with laughter cheering with excitement totally engaged thrilled and engrossed in the spectacle as their expectations receive a hulk smash you know you have a winner its characters are many and each perfect with their chemistry portrayal and heroics the direction is impeccable the story while totally simple works tremendously well to bolster its characters and make it a film made souly for the fans marvels 5 year experiment paid off the avengers is in a word marvelous
Aug 19 2013,positive,best movie of all time
Aug 19 2013,positive,i absolutely loved this  iron man what are we dealing with shakespeare in the park  hulk holding loki in hand puny god
Aug 18 2013,positive,all my favourite marvel characters in one place yes yes yes anyone who think this film sucks needs to go to hell
Aug 18 2013,positive,the avengers was a pretty good film i definitely enjoy the superhero stuff but thats literally what the film is so marvel would obviously excel at that and the banter and human aspects between each character make this feel real
Aug 18 2013,positive,not much depth to it but very enjoyable a must see
Aug 18 2013,positive,marvels the avengers just the best superhero movie of all time a movie ive been waiting my whole life to watch theres absolutely nothing bad i can say about it it gots action and great super hero moments
Aug 17 2013,positive,i loved this movie this is a must see the hulk was of the chain
Aug 17 2013,positive,absolutely an awesome movie 
Aug 17 2013,positive,i really like this movie i thought the cast was awesome and the acting was great ive always loved all the avengers personalities the premise was great and loki was just as awesome as he was in thor the effects were out of the park also the scenes were excuted nicely and the violence ran at the right time they had great humor and everything was awesome and just unbelievable it may not be a movie you want to watch 45 times but it definitely deserves five stars
Aug 17 2013,positive,visually spectacular and altogether entertaining but poorly scripted and entirely too predictable
Aug 16 2013,positive,cant wait for the next
Aug 15 2013,positive,i love marvel and i love superheroes but some superheroes just arent great in the lime light to me this was a needed movie for the superhero world its a great comic and a respected group but to me it wasnt the best film it was critically glorified yet i dont see all the fuss if you are going to keep all the characters from their individual superhero movies the same why did you bring in mark ruffalo as the hulk when you either choose eric bana or edward norton the original two it was a fun movie and a good plot but little things like the hulk cast change and the villain of loki were just ridiculous to me that said it was fun and a summer blockbuster i gave it a 355 because it was a better superhero movie than some recent ones
Aug 15 2013,neutral,a wellmade and entertaining film but i left the theater feeling empty and unaffected definitely doesnt live up to the hype
Aug 13 2013,positive,best super hero movie yet
Aug 13 2013,positive,i will just always love feelgood team banter combined with epic explodey action
Aug 13 2013,negative,this movie is another superhero movie with the very same formula superheros need super problems to solve so that they can shine each hero has to face the kind of super problem which is appropriate to hisher individual super powers they only can defeat the evil threat when they work as a team but suddenly some social problems between them jeopardize the whole mission to save the humanity from that super tread as you can guess and only towards the end begin to rely on one and other for me i am disapointed in studios need to over load special effects and place a storyline on the back burner theres more animation then actors doing stunts and seriously an australian as thor fyi thor is norwegian just saying
Aug 13 2013,positive,the best super hero film ever made
Aug 12 2013,positive,one of the greatest movies i have ever seen it is the most fun i have ever had or probably will have in a movie theater
Aug 12 2013,positive,if your super hero fan you will love this movie
Aug 11 2013,negative,eyecandy and nothing more the problem with marvel characters is that they have no substance this is another example where they tell the audience forget character development and story focus on the effects this was overladen with special effects to the point where i was getting dizzy from watchingi mean seriously a flying aircraft carrier   marvel seems to be launching an assault via movies these days as they have launched phase two how more manufactured can you get
Aug 11 2013,positive,it was long but it was awesome
Aug 11 2013,positive,robert downey jnr owned these movie my eye was on him the whole time i think it is a brillant movie showing what i think is a showing that iron man is best avenger
Aug 11 2013,positive,coming from a die hard marvel fan its a pretty bad movie considering how much hype it got it was just boring hawkeye was evil most the movie and the fact the hulk has no control until the final battle is just plain stupid i hope the second will be way better also why fear the alien invaders all they did was blow up some cars and buildings they are going to rule the world by wiping out humanity but when they have an opportunity to kill at least 50 they take hostageswhat the fffuuand still the dark knight powers on as the best superhero movie and once again this is from a marvel fan
Aug 10 2013,positive,the avengers is an amazing movie funny action packed filled with an amazing cast robert downey jr steals the show cant wait for the next movie
Aug 10 2013,positive,i dont even really like superhero movies but the avengers is pretty awesome the actors all seem to genuinely enjoy working on the project and it shows in their acting there are great comedy lines and the action is great and not overwhelming
Aug 10 2013,positive,the best superhero movie so far  it has done something no other superhero movie has done before  it explained the orgins of each hero iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor captain america the first avenger before releasing the movie about the ultimate superhero teamup  that is whats so great and terrific about this film  avengers assemble
Aug 10 2013,positive,action packed star to finish
Aug 9 2013,positive,whedon has taken something that at first sounded laughable and made something extraordinary out of it
Aug 9 2013,positive,great movie lives up to its expectations cant wait for the sequel
Aug 9 2013,positive,what i got to say about the avengers is that its a marvelous superhero movie that i have ever seen before its absolutely a action pack thrilling and moments in this movie that as great humor as well the performances by the hole cast is magnificent everyone is skillful to very high degree the directing by joss whedon and screenplay by zak penn is so spectacular the cinematography is well done the score in this movie i personally love this score so much it give the movie more powerful energy that give the movie a perfect sound and even when the effects are going on it get even better im raving that the avengers is the best action movie of all time its that good this is a must see movie
Aug 9 2013,positive,a great movie with stunning visuals sound and storyline making it a movie that any body will love
Aug 8 2013,positive,although i admire most of the stars in this movie especially tom hiddleston for his charming acting talents but i must honestly say the story is the same old same old type   through the universal language of music and dance shen yun weaves a wondrous tapestry of heavenly realms ancient legends and modern heroic tales taking you on a journey through 5000 years of chinese culture its stunning beauty and tremendous energy leave audiences uplifted and inspired
Aug 8 2013,positive,although the sweeping arc of the marvel line of superhero movies may be reaching its inevitable nexus sooner rather than later with the general public at least joss whedon perfectly captures the most badass aspects of the marvel movies thus far and mashes them into a perfect pbj sammich of dynamic battles that utilize the same handicam techniques of micheal bay but dont overload the screen with useless clutter so you can actually see whats happening during the bevy of battles and interpersonal conflicts between the team and main villain loki played to a gleefully perfect tee by new fanfavorite tom hiddleston of course rdj gets more than his fair share of awesome moments but sam jackson chris hemsworth and chris evans shine nonetheless in roles that most actors would consider too corny to be cool unfortunately jeremy renner and scarlett johannson cant match the energy of the bigger powerhouses however this movie wouldnt be as insanely fun to watch if it wasnt for whedons biggest trump card  the hulk ruffalo expertly renders bruce banner as a sympathetic dwad and the fxcgi team ace the look of his green counterpart finally bringing the green giant into the main continuity of the rest of the marvel film canon as a huge badass 55 nuff said
Aug 8 2013,positive,the greatest superhero film ever robert downey jr steals the show and ruffalo hemsworth and evans are all brilliant the script is great and the final battle is awesome the charcter of nick fury needed to be developed further and also all we ever knew about the alien army was that it was an alien army
Aug 8 2013,positive,great movie hopefully 2nd movie can be better
Aug 7 2013,positive,a decent flick that was totally over hyped it has a predictable story and i was just sitting waiting for action other than the secret of the hulk and the relationship of hawkeye and black widow
Aug 7 2013,positive,this movie will never get old even after watching it over 300 times which i probably have
Aug 7 2013,positive,dark epic full of non stop action that blows your mind you never get bored with this movie 
Aug 7 2013,positive,thor capiron manand the hulk in one movie epic and who better to put these superheroes together than a fan of the genre
Aug 6 2013,positive,best super hero movie ever
Aug 5 2013,positive,balances the characters with precision and gives us the hulk weve all wanted fun bombastic and almost perfect
Aug 5 2013,positive,awesome movie keep up the good work for marvel loved it 
Aug 4 2013,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time funny and action packed its a must see
Aug 4 2013,positive,good movie doesnt fall victim to the cliches that can make so many other action  superhero marvel flicks wither and die definitely worth watching  really well done high production value great special effects and  most importantly of all  loki
Aug 4 2013,positive,the best marvel film out there i saw no dull moment in the film
Aug 3 2013,positive,the avengers is just a fun movie experience
Aug 3 2013,positive,love this movie cant wait for part two
Aug 3 2013,neutral,the avengers  its a high budget superheroe movie with nothing but a regular story hollywood nonfunny jokes pure modern special effects the characters were very well planned but the avengers its a prove of the crap people call nowdays as a great movie 255
Aug 2 2013,positive,what is really moving in the movie is that in the end of the tale tony stark is more formal and warm than when he is in a similar situation with pepper potts as he offers bruce banner a seat next to the drivers just before they take a spin in tonys best car mark ruffalo is the best banner there has been i actually just felt that scarlett johansson was the child star of charlie and the chocolate factory i mean the karate child sensation who doesnt inherit the factory because she stands out
Aug 2 2013,positive,wow just simply amazing cant wait for the sequel
Aug 1 2013,positive,one of the best super hero flicks that sets a high bar for others to follow its amazing that each character gets their moment to shine and the team has great chemistry in pairs and as a whole also its pretty funny
Aug 1 2013,positive,its just a silly comicbook movie in many ways that silliness works but in some ways it doesnt
Jul 31 2013,positive,by far the best superhero group put together lots of action from start to finish all the actors came together and put an awesome movie together
Jul 31 2013,negative,the hands down worst movie of all time awful acting cheesy plot if you enjoy giant flying catepillars attacking nyc then you will like this but if you are like most people you would not enjoy that
Jul 31 2013,positive,great fun film it was much better than i expected and tied all the different marvel characters together very well it was very enjoyable especially so if you are a fan of all the other marvel films
Jul 31 2013,positive,great superhero film
Jul 30 2013,positive,the best superhero film since superman there is never a dull moment and no character is singled out or especially focused on
Jul 30 2013,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it did a very good job at staying balanced between action and story i plan on buying this movie which is something i usually never do
Jul 30 2013,positive,while it doesnt disappoint in special effects and likable characters almost too likable and the script is fun and witty the avengers has trouble distinguishing itself from other superhero action romps only this time there are more that doesnt mean its better
Jul 30 2013,positive,iron man hulk thor captain america in one movie perfect
Jul 30 2013,positive,good watch for all marvel fans
Jul 30 2013,positive,with all the heroes explosions and fights you could ask for the avengers is arguably the best summer blockbuster in years but like any summer blockbuster it has plot holes for example how bruce banner is suddenly able to control his powers without explanation or why the aliens decided to attack only one city instead of simultaneously attack the whole world at once but the movie is fun and exciting so youll forget about any inconsistencies in the movie
Jul 30 2013,positive,totally outstanding mark ruffalo made up for ed nortons hulk and more the whole cast was excellent at playing their parts excellent fights and a really good storyline cant wait for age of ultron
Jul 30 2013,positive,great movie with lots of great moments
Jul 30 2013,positive,though i think its a little overrated the avengers assemble is still a very good superhero movie with great action and as usual a movie stealing performance by robert downey jr
Jul 30 2013,positive,an orgy of comic book goodness
Jul 29 2013,positive,this is an awesome movie the avengers best part was the the humour good movie that well remember for years
Jul 29 2013,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever made i love this movie and so will any other fan of the marvel series full of action and also full of great comedy 910
Jul 29 2013,negative,probably the most overrated movie of all time
Jul 29 2013,positive,great movie funny and action packed
Jul 28 2013,positive,one of the best action movie i seeing hulk  ironman and thor are awesome but the two side kick have no reason to be there make the test yourself you have to choose 2 super hero to fill up the avenger movie here a list of every caracter who been in the avenger team in the marvel history  antman wasp quicksilver hercules black panther vision black knigth mantis beast moondragon swordsman captain marvel hellcat twogun kids wonderman wizzer miss marvel falcon the cape teh sword jocaste tigra miss hulk starfox mockingbird war machinethe thing firebird moon knight us agent human torch living ligthning spiderwoman 2 machine man darkhawk then dark widow and hawkeye  
Jul 28 2013,positive,great action movie i loved this movie
Jul 27 2013,negative,too over the top for me  dialouge written by a corny 7yearold  effects not spectacular just a lot of crap flipping and blowing up  the only thing that saved it for me was iron man  could not get into it
Jul 27 2013,positive,succeeds visually as a masterfully crafted adventure and keeps the heroes alive with great chemistry and innovative action
Jul 27 2013,positive,robert downey jr made this movie
Jul 27 2013,negative,entertaining but with many flaws
Jul 27 2013,positive,this is in my opinion not just the best marvel film but the third best superhero film ever behind the dark knight and the dark knight rises everything was brilliant some scenes gave me shivers and this was the redemption of captain americatfa and iron man 2 3d was great and the cast had real chemistry the only negative i can actually give is in relation to mark ruffalo as the hulk hes a great actor but i prefered edward norton the change in actors ultimately changed the hulks appearance which i didnt like but thats not marks fault thats marvels fault they should have had edward norton sign a paper or something if the avengers had been planned at the time of the incredible hulk but i recommend getting this on blu ray 3d completely worth it
Jul 27 2013,positive,great action scenes great jokes great plot great acting brilliant film
Jul 27 2013,positive,it waz freaken awesome liked the whole movie watched it like million times and i never dislike it 
Jul 26 2013,positive,joss whedon brings the most popular marvel franchises together for the greatest movie in the companys history that is full of laughs explosions and great character chemistry   details breakdown   the good let me first address the elephant in the room many critics complain of the ending chaos that ensues saying it is too michael bay this cannot be further from the truth the final epic battle is full of clever one liners elaborate multihero fighting and buildings being exploded  but in much more fun ways than michael bay could ever even dream the mass destruction was inevitable when one lets the hulk loose on new york city to smash but it does not get out of control that aside the final fight scene is not even the best part of the movie there is an unbelievable amount of heart here for a movie that has an ensemble cast of heroes whose main purpose is to blow things up the death of a beloved character the chemistry between heroes even the new ones and the cleverness of the villain make this an exciting movie that will a blockbuster for the ages the story line is a bit illogical at times as to be expected with a superhero movie but overall it does not venture into the realm of plot holes and breaking their own rules as many such movies have the tenancy to do there is great acting all around from our favorites like robert downey jr and chris hemsworth and even from the two new heroes introduced in this film played by jeremy renner and scarlet johansson the showstealer by far though is mark ruffalo the hulk movies have never done too well and are not most peoples favorites but using a whole new actor for the character was a bold move and it paid off big ruffalo is the greatest bruce banner to have ever lived and actually made me hope for a new hulk movie that in and of itself is impressive  the bad jeremy renner as hawkeye does not get a whole lot of facetime as a hero and the movie left me wishing that he was able to do a lot more than he was given the film was not as deep as it could have been and there was a lot more squabbling than there was building relationships although the squabbling was quite entertaining the very end of the movie was a bit cheesy compared to the rest there was a tad too much hulk smashing going on in the final sequence but not so much as to make it not enjoyable it just took up valuable time that could have been better spent on deepening the characters
Jul 26 2013,positive,amazingly badass 3rd favorite superherocomic book movie
Jul 26 2013,positive,what is there not to love about this film
Jul 25 2013,positive,great action packed movie
Jul 25 2013,positive,what else do you want
Jul 25 2013,positive,its an almost perfect movie in its genre
Jul 25 2013,negative,there must be wolverine in the movie somewhere h he is the one most famous character of marvel comics
Jul 24 2013,positive,brilliant somehow they managed to cram all the heroes into this film with great success
Jul 24 2013,positive,never have i enjoyed a movie this much in the theatre than the avengers the chemistry between the superheroes is a blast to look at the action is suburb every superhero gets the same amount of attention what a blast this movie is
Jul 24 2013,positive,that was my first movie in 3d so its special the story was nice but we all know the special effects are the selling point in such movies   4 s
Jul 24 2013,positive,saw it in the theater and want to see it again im not usually into special effects but i do love superhero movies and the dialogue suits each character perfectly
Jul 23 2013,positive,best comic book movie of all time
Jul 23 2013,positive,this is my favorite film of all time just loved it
Jul 22 2013,positive,entirely enjoyable comic book romp but doesnt quite hit every mark a wonderful achievement nonetheless
Jul 21 2013,positive,this movie  was one of the best  movies i have seen in a long time
Jul 21 2013,positive,starts slow but gains steam and ends great
Jul 21 2013,positive,an incredible film  the best of the year
Jul 21 2013,positive,hollywood take notethis is how you do a superhero movie  none of that hulk batman or daredevil nonsense
Jul 20 2013,positive,amazing superhero fight scenes and a pretty good storyline that keeps on giving makes it one of the best marvel moviesoh and dont forget scarlett
Jul 20 2013,positive,not my regular genre of movie but rented the dvd for my son surprisingly entertaining  just wish it would have had wonder woman although she was dc and these guys are marvel she deserves her own movie anyway
Jul 20 2013,negative,one star for the 30 mins of action at the end zzzzzzzzzzz
Jul 20 2013,neutral,this one was all action so if thats your bag then its all you not the most original plot basically another alien invasion vs super hero movie i must be getting old if these movies dont do it for me anymore but check it out its entertaining also want to mention the whole thorloki thing is totally a rip off legend from the sumerian enki vs enlil and anu but my guess is even the sumerian was a rip off from prior to that
Jul 19 2013,positive,kind of a slow start 20 mins into it starts getting interesting though and it gets very good it could possibly be one of my favorite action films all characters in it make a great film and theyre all awesome at their roles and everyone plays an important role the action scenes are incredible and it really gets your heart pumping i loved almost everything about the avengersfunny when these movies first came out i didnt think much of them and then i saw iron man 1  2 along with captain america the winter soldier and then i just had to see the others and now im a huge fan marvel i own all of the original avenger movies highly recommended
Jul 19 2013,positive,lots of action a little humor and great fx
Jul 19 2013,positive,to have some of the eras greatest actors renew such incredibly prominent roles all in the same film is something most would expect too difficult to make work that is not the case in this instance every aspect of the avengers especially the screenplay theme music and compelling performances is so perfectly crafted that the only negative thing to be said is all film makers are now arduously pressured to live up to the hype
Jul 19 2013,positive,a fanboy dream of superhero team ups arguably the best comic book movie ever made
Jul 18 2013,positive,rewatching in 2021  combining iron man hulk thor and captain american from the previous marvel films into one finaletype film is really a fanboys wet dream  although each film previously stated had its own style and flair marvels the avengers doesnt exactly wow the audience with auteur filmmaking or even a groundbreaking storyline but i would be lying if i said didnt enjoy every second of it  hampered down by the top notch cast beautiful special effects memorable and lovable characters and the execution of joining all the characters into one film without it feeling overbearing this film is quite the experience
Jul 18 2013,positive,love it if youre in to action and jokes watch
Jul 17 2013,positive,perfect blockbuster entertainment fun from beginning to end
Jul 17 2013,neutral,while there is an appropriate playfulness to the movie if the dialogue were any cheesier id stuff it into a burrito
Jul 17 2013,negative,i majorly hate it
Jul 17 2013,positive,an obvious classic marvels the avengers  has action and drama a great line up cast and a brilliant script
Jul 17 2013,positive,amazing job with the montage and with the visual effects a lot of  great and interesting scenes but a few of unnecessary scenes too pretty good job with this movie it makes people feel excited
Jul 16 2013,positive,extremely entertaining easytofollow plot harmless and very satisfying the avengers is very cool and worthwatching
Jul 16 2013,negative,probably most boring movie of 2012 wait for 2 hours of talk and and predictable dialogue just to get to a transformers rip off action scene dont waste your money and timeinstead watch man of steel or something dc related at least its realistic but this is just trash
Jul 16 2013,positive,you know it most loved it  it is exactly what you would think it would be and what it is supposed to be  no more no less  break out the popcorn and enjoy
Jul 16 2013,positive,after watching on netflix for the first time id say its a decent crossover of the marvel cinematic universe
Jul 16 2013,positive,a good accessible blockbuster that everyone can like
Jul 16 2013,positive,greatest marvel movie yet
Jul 16 2013,positive,the best no wonder i came back to america where else is there such impact
Jul 15 2013,negative,the avengers did not hold my interest but is very interesting for anyone who is interested in super heroes
Jul 15 2013,positive,an awesome movie the movie event of 2012
Jul 15 2013,positive,3 stars    i did enjoy this however it was kinda long and did drag for a bit but id definitely be up for seeing the second one
Jul 14 2013,positive,the avengers   12 out of 5     after four years five films and one change in casting the avengers finally made it to the big screen and it was awesome the best choice marvel ever made was hiring joss whedon who was one of the most underrated tv creators of all time firefly may be dead but at least we got this fun film     the story is pretty simple loki tom hiddelston wants to take over the world and its up to the avengers to band together and stop him its the execution of this simple story that works and the interactions between iron man with downey owning every minute thor and captain america are fun and interesting i had worries about mark ruffelo replacing edward nortin but my fears were put to rest the effects and portray of hulk are not only fun but ruffelo plays the role of banner much better than nortin making him feel more like a scientist and a man looking for inner peace     the last forty minutes of the film make any problems i had disappear it is the kind of action you wish michael bay would imitate hands down the most entertaining comic book movie ive seen
Jul 14 2013,positive,a near perfect movie  riddled with apocalyptic action and zany dialogue  this is one to own
Jul 14 2013,positive,quite possibly the most popular superhero film besides the dark knight the avengers is everything a marvel fan could want what really sells the film is the team up between all these characters seeing them play off one another and then fighting alongside each other utilising their own unique abilities joss whedons character focused direction and writing really makes this film and provides some great humour as well as some effective personal drama each of the cast is great but mark ruffalo is the biggest surprise here being a much better bruce banner than edward norton when it gets to the action it rarely halts and keeps you on the edge of your seat with amazing visuals and each individual action setpiece feeling unique because of the different characters involved whilst i wouldnt say this is my favourite marvel film as im sure it is for many others i still think its awesome

Jul 14 2013,positive,perfect movie good to see marvel teaming up together cant wait for the next one
Jul 14 2013,positive,josh whedon and rdjr hit it out of the park  the combo of whedons snappy dialog writing combined with rdjrs sharp delivery is magic  very well done  that last scene post credits in the shawerma restaurant is pure gold  great flick all around  wish they could have done this with the xmen franchise
Jul 13 2013,positive,this movie is very cool great special effects good acting some funny scenes in their and its just really cool to see all these heroes on one screen but they spend to long on getting these heroes together the avengers also dont really talk to each other unless they are fighting or planning which is really disappointing overall it is really fun but could have been better 70

Jul 11 2013,positive,there are so many wonderful adjectives to describe this movie  amazing  awesome  action packed  exciting  the list goes on and on and on  it is one of the best marvel movies ever made and i loved the consistency that this franchise has kept between all the individual movies like iron man thor captain america etc and this conglomeration of characters in avengers  i am eagerly awaiting when we get another one  joss whedon did a fabulous job with writing and directing  i hope he does the next one too

Jul 10 2013,positive,great movie watched it 4 times in 3 days love jeremy he was fantastic as hawkeye all the characters showed the different emotions about the heros loved it its candy for marvel geeks lol like me had hilarious humor in it i was constantly laughing or on the edge of my seat best movie ive seen in awhile
Jul 10 2013,positive,both iron man  thor were surprisingly entertaining and witty movies  when the two meet its not disappointing some great escapist fun and not just in the 3d imax action
Jul 10 2013,positive,very entertaining however as a comic book movie it definitively falls short story wise of the brilliance of the dark night
Jul 9 2013,positive,an epic masterpiece we have never seen a movie of this magnitude thor iron man captain hawkeye black widow hulk just a sensational movie that rivals the dark knight for best comic book movie ever
Jul 9 2013,positive,wow what a ride from beginning to the end the movie stay true to the many other movies before it and still works well downey has found himself a home in the arrogant role of tony stark and he owns itnot a fan of his other snooze feet movies this one is exciting from beginning to end
Jul 9 2013,positive,yea its that good  even if youve never followed the comics you owe to yourself to watch it if youre a fan of action movies  it is one of the better ones of the last decade
Jul 9 2013,positive,it was a fantastic 3d movie
Jul 9 2013,positive,these simple 5 words can describe the avengers the best superhero movie ever also one more word masterpiece
Jul 9 2013,positive,alittle slow at some parts but it was great overalljust love superhero movies
Jul 9 2013,positive,its a great film with a great cast just wished they had a better villain loki come on so many more bad guys out there to chose from in my opinion the bad guy shouldnt be able to be beaten by just one of the heros the villain should be able to go toe to toe with all of them at once
Jul 8 2013,positive,i loved the teamwork aspect of it just a tad too unrealistic with a few things the flying aircraft carrier and a few scarlet johansonalso flying scenes to name a few otherwise very cool
Jul 8 2013,positive,this was a solid movie they got all the superheros together and somehow they got equal screen time maybe iron man a little more than others the story is straight forward with a good amount of action throughout
Jul 8 2013,neutral,overhyped and overrated film a film where all the characters compete to see who can give out the best one liner it had great sequences a strong cast and amazing special fx however i believe all the hype this film garnered was unjustified because i didnt think it was as great as it was made out to be i also dont understand why some people even suggest this as the greatest film ever made it is completely a falsity on so many levels the film is merely ok i wouldnt even call it good but having said that i dont think its a bad film either its just a film which was over produced over commercialised and over hyped    typical a list celebrities trying to garner a huge pay check a recorded budget of 225 million dollars went into the making of this film however you leave the theatre with not one intelligent thought in your mind because the film doesnt provide you with anything meaningful or intellectual all it gives you is almost 3 hours of big budget hollywood formula
Jul 8 2013,positive,a great movie its every geeks dream to see iron man hulk captain america and thor in a whole movie the act was amazing as always robert downey jr was the main show he is perfect to be iron man in every case samuel l jackson was also a very good act he bring a little old school acting to the movie well thats my favorite part  as many like me i thought that edward norton was the perfect hulk and his replacement will stink i was diffidently wrong mark ruffalo was the best hulk iv seen well we cannot forget chris evans chris hemsworth scarlett johansson and jeremy renner who did a great job too i am expecting avengers 2
Jul 8 2013,positive,mediocre remix of many superheroes
Jul 7 2013,positive,a solid superhero movie where the characters stand out more than the action and explosions
Jul 7 2013,positive,an overall fun and entertaining superhero flick with good character chemistry and excellent action
Jul 7 2013,positive,dc better catch up
Jul 7 2013,positive,entertaining superhero movie
Jul 7 2013,positive,this movie was a visually dynamic and actionpacked film with cutting edge digital wizardry and characters as true as possible to the comics in behavior and abilities it was excellently cast and realistic rifts and minor grudges against one another loki was an awesome villain with smooth talk and true evil tendencies by far my favorite action film
Jul 7 2013,positive,though there are some potholes and lazy ways to close it up avengers is a thrilling and entertaining joyride the reason why it was so good is that the already existing superheroes and the actors who played them are interacting with each other this is the first time in movie history when standalone movies turn into a big extravangaza known as a superhero epic
Jul 6 2013,positive,i liked the story line and the movie made me fall in love with super heroes again  a must see for the man who wants to be a kid again

Jul 6 2013,positive,rdjsighfinally saw itbetter late than neverwas great
Jul 6 2013,positive,grandiose and bloated although extremely entertaining  its jammed with impressive action sequences and the characters are all welldeveloped although that may be due in part to all of the preceding films the script is generally wellwritten and theres a good amount of humor and witty dialogue as well
Jul 6 2013,positive,between the directing acting chemistry and effectsthe avengers is the perfect summer superhero flick i still dont know how they managed to bring all these heroes together into one film without a mess like i expected instead i was rewarded with what is now one of my favorite films
Jul 5 2013,positive,i give this movie a 9910 for pure goddamn awesomeness
Jul 5 2013,positive,not bad stark downey jr was quite overbearing but other than that a very good film
Jul 5 2013,positive,wanted to rate it higher but its a bit too transformers for me acting doesnt impress
Jul 5 2013,positive,unsurprisingly i did not marvel at marvels avengers assemble  jam packed with action too much and all a bit samey if you ask me with few memorable set pieces heavy on the buff no complaints there laced with witty one liners  its not really my cup of tea but theres lots about it to like  particularly the buff
Jul 5 2013,positive,learned to appreciate what it is still not my favorite

Jul 4 2013,positive,this is easily one of my favorite movies
Jul 4 2013,positive,seriously i didnt get the hype it was entertaining but these super heroes were more welldone on the solo tip
Jul 4 2013,positive,entertaining funny exciting but sometimes silly
Jul 4 2013,positive,great entertainment as you would expect from a set of super heros
Jul 4 2013,positive,this definitely broke a lot of box office records and the millions of people who went to see it should have thought it was worth it robert downey jr was funny as always and the visual effects were amazing the only downside is that the big action is at the end of the movie and you might not understand some of it if you havent watched thor captain america the first avenger or the iron man movies but the movie was definitely good in many ways hulk smash 455
Jul 4 2013,positive,exhilarating action scenes an engaging story meaningful characters and an exciting finale make the avengers live up to its hype as a spectacular example of pure blockbuster entertainment
Jul 3 2013,positive,one hero is not enough for any 2 hour movie any more
Jul 3 2013,neutral,its entertaining but its also nothing special a superhero mashup that does everything its expected to do
Jul 3 2013,positive,no doubt one of the best action films i have seen so far the movie grabs you from the get go and keeps you in place the entire time even adding in a little comedy and a slight love interest i can watch this over and over
Jul 3 2013,positive,the movie was great i cant wait to see the next one ill watch this one about a thousand times before the second one comes out jared jones
Jul 3 2013,positive,this movie is funny and has lots of action at the same time
Jul 3 2013,positive,very well done comic book movie each character feels like the star of their own movie and i really appreciate that because not only does robert downey jr as iron man steal the show but the other characters do as well
Jul 2 2013,positive,best comic book movie ever hands down 
Jul 2 2013,positive,its wellshot and exciting but the avengers isnt nearly as funny or charming as it thinks it is

Jul 1 2013,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Jul 1 2013,positive,joss whedon played this movie really safe about as safe as you can make a movie but in this case it actually works for the most part the writing is great the cast blends well and their are alot of comedic moments that fit in the film well a problem i see is the villans i thought they could have choosen better villans also parts of the movie seems bland but again the movie still has a lot of good and even great scenes  i give the movie a grade b but the acting gets a grade a

Jun 26 2013,positive,i like the part whn hulk swang the guy
Jun 26 2013,positive,after four years and five movies of buildup the avengers is out andits a great film the avengers is a certain turning point for both the nerd culture and filmmaking in general filmmakers are going to be copying this elaborate world building for decades and for good reason if you havent seen the avengers rush out and see it its an absolute marvel no pun
Jun 26 2013,positive,best super hero movie to date very funny action packed great acting and directing was amazed by the special affects cant wait till the sequel hulk smash
Jun 26 2013,positive,i f you dont like it youre dead inside
Jun 26 2013,positive,like catching lighting in a bottle the greatest comic book movie of all time understands just how ridiculous it would be if the source material suddenly became modern real life this popcorn masterpiece walks the fine line of never taking itself too seriously with the pin point perfection of a 6 year olds beautiful imagination
Jun 25 2013,positive,the avengers is one of the best comic book adaptations out there  it has great action special effects and the screenplay which usually kills comic book movies is pretty decent    one thing i noticed while watching this a second time is that they did a good job of balancing all of the heroes parts in the film  that must have been difficult trying to allot time to so many main characters  well done    i do have one complaint   captain americas uniform was much cooler in his stand alone film  his uniform in the avengers was a little costumey  why the change i wonder  everything else was great
Jun 25 2013,positive,funny full of action charismatic and memorable characters the story simple and fairly cliche but is still very disfrtubale if you do not like probably do not have soul
Jun 25 2013,positive,definitely not the best superhero movie ever but the avengers is a fun and exciting movie
Jun 25 2013,positive,superheroes in new york give me a break
Jun 24 2013,positive,spectacular movie with enough comedy action and sex appeal that can keep you near the edge of your seat
Jun 24 2013,positive,it was great but i thought it was funny that the hulk can control his powers only because the plot calls for it lol
Jun 23 2013,negative,i understand that it was popular but i am baffled that this film was well received by critics  there was nothing in particular that was memorable about this film  its bloated with superficial characters participating in a lowstakes humdrum plot filled with wallto wall transformerstyle action  the few witticisms and humorous moments that appear throughout the movie are not enough to save it from its oppressive mediocrity  in fact there were several times where i almost laughed at the ridiculousness of the whole big bugeted affair  however i cannot say that it was particularly terrible  it was just average  slightly below average
Jun 23 2013,neutral,the avengers is a for the control of earth between aliens and the team of marvel heros  the plot is somewhat predictable with only a few twists but there is a lot of action  i suppose people will watch it with so many alist actors in it
Jun 23 2013,positive,perfect well paced character development is absolute and the best third act any action film can offer i can honestly say this was torn from a comic book and splattered onto the big screen
Jun 23 2013,positive,a quality superhero movie
Jun 23 2013,positive,great superhero movie possibly one of the best i have seen
Jun 23 2013,negative,there is completely nothing but fx huge overrating and waste of time for cinema loving people

Jun 22 2013,positive,i love this movie i will own it soon
Jun 22 2013,positive,very amazing movie  every character had enough screen time 
Jun 22 2013,positive,marvel pulled off the team up almost flawlessly  one of the most enjoyable movies of the summer
Jun 22 2013,positive,i wish i could rate it 100 stars
Jun 22 2013,positive,the lowdown on marvels the avengers the best thing about it was that it showed people how much fun it has been to growup reading comics and to play within the marvel universe
Jun 22 2013,positive,loved it  the best of the best in comic book movies
Jun 22 2013,negative,the dark knight rises watchmen and man of steel make this flick look like a kids movie its just so over rated
Jun 22 2013,positive,one of the best films in history
Jun 21 2013,positive,extremely entertaining extremely fun this is a nerds dream come true  marvel fans will be proud of this however my only complaints are that the plot was in someway generic there were a few slow and boring moments and the aliens i found werent that threatening overall this is easily one of the most delightful comic book movies to date
Jun 21 2013,neutral,great visuals but i really cant understand all the hype for the avengers i found it entertaining no more no less its so overrated and predictable
Jun 21 2013,positive,how could you put a bad rating with this one loved it
Jun 20 2013,positive,sort of slow but picks up speed and is good
Jun 20 2013,positive,great movie a lot of action could have had less cursing
Jun 20 2013,positive,alright 6210 b good if you dont watch it seriously
Jun 20 2013,positive,the best superhero movie ever make avengers 2
Jun 20 2013,positive,fun characters great writing and fantastic action sequences whats not to like
Jun 20 2013,positive,take a bunch of good movies and put them all in one and you get one of the best movies ive ever seen
Jun 20 2013,positive,the avengers was the cinematic experience of the 2012 summer and showed that we could enjoy fun superheroes as well as our dark and brooding ones the avengers had a big rival in the dark knight rises but it overpassed it with success the avengers showed hollywood and fans that joss whedon could again handle big blockbusters after most people criticised his script for the alien resurrection being the reason that it floped   the storyline was not to complex but was fun and provided the right amount for each character to shine except for hawkeye joss managed to bring in his sense of humour like he has had in all of his work this managed to make the long run time fly by the that he handled all their individual powers and strengths is again what he does best and has managed to convert from his shows like buffy and angel  the visuals in the avengers was very good and shows off what can be done with character hulk because even though he is fully cgi he managed to communicate better than in the previous hulk instalments it also gave a chance for joss to destroy new york many of the cgi set pieces like the shield hover craft were very well done and did not stick out as being that way  the way that the actors managed to work together so that they all got the same scene time shows off the way that they were all committed to this movie some actors did outshine others with their performances though tom hiddlestons loki was amazing and was the perfect villain for the first avenger film rdj like usual also stands out for his crowd pleasing turn as tony stark however there was an unexpected highlight from mark ruffalo and the hulk mark played bruce brilliantly as mild mannered and calm and then the hulk was unstoppable but funny and totally different from the way that he was portrayed in ang lees hulk and the incredible hulk  for me personally the avengers shows the humourless man of steel that it is okay to have a laugh but dont go all quest for peace with us
Jun 20 2013,positive,come on entertainment just doesnt get better its supposed to be outrageous and over the top perfectly scripted and shot movie
Jun 20 2013,positive,possibly the best superhero movie ever made  i dont think i have anything the complain about here
Jun 19 2013,positive,incredible i loved the hell out this movie all of marvels heroes teaming up what else can u ask for
Jun 19 2013,positive,dont know how this could have been done better
Jun 19 2013,positive,everything you could possibly want from a comic book movie when things are done right it just works
Jun 18 2013,positive,more of a screenwriting stunt than a great action movie there seemed to be a giant checklist guiding the plot scarlett johansson vs jeremy renner check the action scenes were overplanned stylefree cgi by far the best parts of the movie were in between the big set pieces
Jun 17 2013,positive,an action movie thats actually not ridiculously over the top  its kept grounded by an amazing cast along with wit and fast pacing  this is a near perfect example of an action film
Jun 16 2013,positive,a wonderful execution of everything we wanted as kids avengers assembled flawlessly to the dismay of many
Jun 16 2013,positive,thogh starting out as a normal bad guy trying to take over the world good guys stop him story the film takes a turn for the awesome in the third act and we finally get great hulk moments with mark ruffalos performence getting special marks and a better hulk then both of the privous hulks combined
Jun 16 2013,positive,marvels avengers delivers a well packed script and full of coherent action scenes that serve as a meeting point for the first phase of marvels cinematic universe
Jun 16 2013,positive,brilliant film cant wait for number 2
Jun 16 2013,positive,perfectly brings the characters together and has enough action to keep you enticed without losing a few iq points
Jun 16 2013,positive,this movie gets better on multiple viewings  just a stunning realization of marvels shared universe plans
Jun 16 2013,positive,incredifuckingble
Jun 16 2013,neutral,i couldnt get into it
Jun 15 2013,positive,with an already set up potential by means of its standalones the avengers advances the climax of the marvel cinematic universe with utmost action packed brilliance and by being amongst the few movies that relish the essence of their source material
Jun 15 2013,positive,this is an awesome movie
Jun 15 2013,positive,i made the mistake of seeing this movie before the individual marvel films comprising it after seeing those the quality of the movie increased substantially as i was able to pick up on more subtle character traits and easter eggs throughout the film
Jun 15 2013,positive,best movie of the year i loved the way the actors blended
Jun 15 2013,positive,after four years and five previous films that were effectively used to build a cinematic universe we finally get the avengers
Jun 15 2013,positive,how could i forget to rate this movie when i finally got to see it i must have been too hype afterwards it was great to see the thor iron man hulk and captain story lines all come together im not even a big comic book fan but the movie was awesome
Jun 15 2013,positive,the avengers executes the wonder and spectacle of the comics on the big screen while  injecting a much needed style of joss whedon the cast works great together with giving all enough screen time time for character development a great blend of humor and action an all time high for all geeks fanboys and newcomers to the marvel universe phenomenal entertainment 55
Jun 15 2013,positive,you will love iron man and captain
Jun 14 2013,positive,i was bored and disappointed after much hype preceding the showing of the film the movie turned out to be soso
Jun 14 2013,positive,entertaining but mostly overhyped and only considered by critics because it had a notable director
Jun 14 2013,neutral,overrated a few clever one liners but the narrative was stupid and predictable  just word noise to get you to the next action sequence  visually i can see why the avengers would be entertaining but other than that it had nothing to offer  i do respect whedons work so maybe ill give this another chance one day
Jun 14 2013,positive,featuring one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled marvels the avengers shows off marvel comics superhero best combining action comedy and emotion to create a fully functional and resonating cinematic story
Jun 14 2013,neutral,its like the whole movie build up amounts to just mindless action yes i said it uninspiring script with too many cliche dialogues and it was too much on the surface good vs bad wants the same thing fight meh in saying this yes i did watch all of the preceding movies
Jun 14 2013,positive,good action but hagtag storyline
Jun 14 2013,positive,too much fun to handle
Jun 14 2013,positive,meh  i feel like a real curmudgeon when i say i didnt really like this movie  but i didnt really like it  i thought it was a shame that a cast like this couldnt be brought together for a better script  the story was good but told in a ham handed way so i didnt care at all about any of the characters  and since im not a fan boy i could have used a bit of introduction to the characters  the avengers focuses more on cool special effects than story and since this is no longer 1985 and im not impressed by great sfx id prefer more story less flash  as reviewer al alexander says joss whedon empties everything at his reported 225 million disposal to assault the eyes ears and intelligence with one of the stupidest comic book tales ever put to film  i dont know about the stupidest tale ever put to film but throwing everything including the kitchen sink into a movie continues to ruin the experience for me
Jun 14 2013,positive,its something like bays armageddon bunch of funny guys avenging manipulated dead agent saving of the world its just a sceondary objective
Jun 13 2013,positive,awsome the hulk is bad ass in this one
Jun 13 2013,positive,the only thing that makes this movie good is because its eye candy that being said all of the people thinking that the avengers is an innovative movie need to watch the dark knight again the avengers is a highly predictable movie that is an obvious cash cow
Jun 13 2013,positive,great film by all means
Jun 13 2013,neutral,it was okay but the movie doesnt deliver like i thought it would take out the comedy and you have really no plot
Jun 13 2013,positive,64 the avengers is even more for kids than the hobbit
Jun 13 2013,positive,brilliantly written great action phenomenal acting  overall great movie
Jun 13 2013,positive,i simply love the script the visuals and the acting
Jun 12 2013,positive,great action with the usual funny parts
Jun 12 2013,neutral,yeah yeah yeah whatever
Jun 12 2013,positive,al thought i did enjoyed the movie sometimes i felt like i have to wait the whole movie till the end which was the best part
Jun 12 2013,positive,the avengers doesnt seem to have the top notch kick
Jun 12 2013,negative,superhero movie for kids

Jun 10 2013,positive,the first 15 minutes were hard for me to sit through but over all i enjoyed this movie more than i thought i would might even be worth a second viewing
Jun 10 2013,positive,probably one of the best comic book movies out there however its too long and incredibly formulaic to the point of being predictable
Jun 10 2013,positive,never underestimate the entertainment value of hulk breaking stuff
Jun 10 2013,positive,cannot wait til sequel
Jun 10 2013,positive,the best superhero film you will ever see joss whedon strikes again with a fantastic film a absolute must watch
Jun 9 2013,positive,good but cap america is an asshole
Jun 9 2013,positive,its good fun for the most part but ultimately further proof that i want more than some okay characters  lost of special effects to be satisfied with a film overall there are touches of where whedon wants this to go on display here and ill be interested to see where he can take it
Jun 8 2013,positive,the avengers is the big film we all were expecting probably better than expected actually the plot is the classic evil vs good but puts several elements to make it work characters that interact with each other great action scenes and everything a comic book fan is looking for a highly enjoayble experience and unforgetteable
Jun 8 2013,positive,the 3d version is amazing
Jun 8 2013,positive,its my third time watching this wonderful piece of work very entertaining and funny i cant ask for more everybodys favorite superheroes are here in the movie i love to watch it over and over again hulk make me laugh and thors power is amazing
Jun 7 2013,positive,best action hero movie hands down
Jun 7 2013,positive,waiting for the 2nd one      had me flies to the big screen the whole time 
Jun 6 2013,positive,unlike the dark knight and superman the movie youre not going to expect this movie being a comic book film that will be incredible but it is what its meant to be a summertime midnight movie spectacle that you can just check your brain at the door and have a great time
Jun 5 2013,positive,i will never forget this movie ever it was so awesome i cant even explain it in awesomeness words
Jun 5 2013,positive,overrated as all hell for a two and a half hour movie about super heroes there really isnt a whole lot of action going on just a whole lot of talking too much talking the battle scenes arent even that enjoyable so there is no reward for sitting through all the insufferable dialogue the loss of edward norton as the hulk is disappointing since mark ruffalo cant act to save his fg life robert downey jr is the only entertaining aspect of the entire film
Jun 4 2013,positive,its so much fun to see all the superheros we watched in their own separate movies finally come together
Jun 4 2013,positive,great movie amazing work on the costumes and effects but with loki being the main villain after not really loving the movie thor i was a little disappointed with that i also felt that there was far too much time spent on the airship it was still a great movie overall but some parts also felt a little too rushed as if each character had to introduce themselves into the movie in a 30second or less scene or else be cut i just wanted to care a little more about some of the heroes and other characters awesome acting too though  hopefully the 2nd movie is makes up for those little things and the villain is a little more badarse
Jun 3 2013,positive,loved it nothing else to say
Jun 3 2013,positive,clearly marveldisney will have a bright and lucrative future releasing the various avengerrelated films iron man thor captain america ect but the fact that theyve set the bar so high with the leadup to the avengers makes me worry about the quality and continuity of the future films  weve already seen bruce banners character replaced twice personally i think eric bana should have reprised his role for this film and the war machine character once which was for the best i think  needless to say my greatest concern is whats going to happen when one of those box office superstars gets sick of paying the character theyve now played multiple timessometimes more than once a year  for comic geeks like me the marvel universe on film is complete and utter paradisebut at least its expected to last for several more years     im going to assume youve seen the other marvel films that have led us all to this blockbuster because if you havent youre just cheating yourself to the epic buildup which centers on the formation of one massive super team called the avengers  the avengers picks up right where the captain america film leaves off  in many ways the film feels mostly like a captain america sequel since it involves a newly awakened steve rogers and the backnforth possession of the cosmic cube the tesseract which was the red skulls obsession in the last film  this time around loki played by the absolutely marvelous tom hiddleston is hellbent on harnessing the cubes power for his own personal gain  he may be the main villain for the film but hes not the one pulling the strings hintwatch the scenes after the credits for an appearance by a villain that only die hard comic nerds can identify  i didnt just decide this now but anytime you can get robert downey jr in one of your films its worth every single penny  this film is no different since he brings the typical tony stark charm to a room filled with serious characters  without the humor this film would not have been as enjoyable as it turned out to be  the scene between stark and gwyneth paltrows pepper potts character simply wets everyones appetite for next summers iron man 3  personally i find the iron man films to be the most enjoyable and the backbone films of this franchise  basically without downey jr and paltrow pulling the weight at the beginning there would be nothing to enjoy right now     one of the two gripes that i have about this film is that there arent any real major comic book references off in the background for the diehard comic book fans to explain to their friends sitting next to them who really dont care especially since there were several references in previous films  we dont even get an avengers assemble  i suppose the fulltime additions of nick fury samuel l jackson hawkeye jeremy renner and maria hill cobie smulders make up for the need to have any of those tiny little details in the background  there are so many characters in this film that its surprising that i didnt feel like i got screwed over because one character wasnt in the film enough  some of them have more lines than others but the film feels like a perfect character balance     whats the biggest gripe i have about the film  comic books have a way of killing off characters in order to further the plot or enlarge a villain so when one of the characters and one of my favorites bites the dust in the film it left me pretty bitter  the good news about comic book deaths is that characters usually dont stay dead for long  with that being said im hoping thats the case here because if its not the film writes off an incredibly brilliant character  did the plot of the film need the death  maybe but probably not   did the scenes afterwards improve because of the death  absolutely  i just really really hope its not permanent     overall the action sequences throughout the film make a two hourplus movie feel like half an hour  if you have to go to the bathroom at any point during this film hold it  who would win in a fight between captain america thor and iron man  this film might not supply you with a definitive answer to that question but it does supply you with a round of sensational superhero vs superhero vs superhero action  then of course they unite and team up to fight lokis random alien army that is destroying everything in sight  bottom line  lots of action     enjoy this comic book masterpiece  if youre not entertained by this film you are beyond help
Jun 3 2013,positive,oh yeah i watched this a few weeks ago i liked it but it wasnt transcendent it was something like the perfect application of a familiar formula in that it was perhaps the most entertaining summer movie in recent memory but it didnt add to the superhero genre in novelty the first spiderman depth the dark knight or setting xmen first class like the best superhero films that said i completely understand whyhow it was the cash cow it was and unlike a lot of movies i dont root against it merely because it appealed to everyone  my only substantive gripe is the short shrift given to bruce banner suddenly figuring out how to control the hulk the singular plot point of prior hulk movies and a significant plot point underlying this movie is resolved without mention when only a few scenes removed from a prior uncontrollable rampage banner confidently hulks out without losing control
Jun 3 2013,positive,is the avengers the movie everyone was hoping for yes and its even more this is how a sommer blockbuster has to look like
Jun 3 2013,positive,i love it cant stop watching it
Jun 2 2013,positive,awesome all i have to say
Jun 2 2013,positive,the hulk is best of them but ironman gt it in too

Jun 2 2013,positive,greatest superhero movie ever made
Jun 2 2013,positive,this is the end of marvels phase 1 and its a perfect note to end on great movie keep them coming
Jun 2 2013,positive,seeing the avengers assemble itself is enough to make any comic or superhero film fan get shivers down their spine thankfully the film happens to be great too let me put it this way its done so well that even the hulk is entertaining
Jun 2 2013,positive,it was great having most of the super herod in this movie
Jun 2 2013,positive,every character complemented each other perfect
Jun 2 2013,positive,loved it so much  i am i really big fan
Jun 2 2013,positive,with fantastic performances from all the actors from playing their charactersand with fantastic special effects and a great climaxmarvels the avengers is definitely is a great      welcome to the marvel universe
Jun 1 2013,positive,awesome  100 badass throughout the entire film  you go joss whedon  the film has awesome costume designs awesome cast and crew perfect performances from all of them and mark ruffalo is the best bruce banner and hulk ever way better than eric bana and edward norton separately and combined  has lots of heart and humor very funny good pacing and awesome character development throughout  awesome special effects a terrific story the connection and bond between the characters and nonstop action make this the best superhero movie ever  best superhero movie ever
Jun 1 2013,positive,a amazing roundup of the marvel superheros
Jun 1 2013,positive,only thing i can say this movie is awesome
May 31 2013,positive,nothing beats up a collection of super heroes in one magnificent film
May 31 2013,positive,they brought it together  the story delivered and i think marvel is just cashing in while theyre still hot the problem with putting the team together is that now marvel has to take them apart to make more movies  purely by accident thoughthey did make the best superhero movie ever
May 31 2013,positive,hope the cast and studio working out the money issues would love to see every one come back highly anticipating a sequel
May 31 2013,positive,every comic nerds wet dream fan of the or not everybody should check this out
May 31 2013,positive,im usually not one for comic books never grew up with them as a kid but my god this movie was awesome each character gets their fair share of screen time and each has their own personal character arcs to deal with a big movie with a great ensemble cast
May 31 2013,positive,not just a hugely entertaining piece of popcorn cinema but also a very energetic movie with great characterization suitably fast paced and focused direction and a script that is sure to satisfy comicbook fans and casual moviegoers alike perhaps the quintessential superhero movie due to the way it deftly blends action and drama to craft the perfect blockbuster experience
May 31 2013,positive,best superhero movie of all time the avengers is absolutely perfect in every way the heroes are great the villain is great the acting is great i saw this movie in theaters twice because it was so good it made me fall in love with marvel fantastic film
May 31 2013,positive,a good action movie with quick witted jokes throughout  very clearly a joss wheaton movie
May 31 2013,positive,a good action movie with quick witted jokes throughout  very clearly a joss wheaton movie
May 30 2013,positive,dont get me wrong i had a lot of fun with this movie but i dont get how this movie is basically untouchable to so many people
May 30 2013,positive,love this movie good special effects good cast and best action this is the best movie ever in 2012 buy it and rent it and i cant wait for marvel the avengers 2 in may 2015 good job marvel and disney you did a amazing job a marvel the avengers
May 29 2013,negative,only one thing was good in this bore fest hulk smashing the puny god
May 29 2013,positive,this was the best action hero movie of all time
May 29 2013,positive,one of the greatest movies ever made simply put a ton of action incredible graphics and something funny at every turn this is one i can watch again and again
May 28 2013,positive,love it absolutely amazing i even bought it for my kids
May 28 2013,neutral,finally i saw it and boring what is this i didnt like it at all because i didnt like all super heroes and i didnt wanna see them together in just 1 movie but i liked the hulk and his parts only little were great mark ruffalo was the best performer and he was very quiet and naive so it was really shocking when he became hulk story was boring too many unfunny jokes noisy overacted actors bad guy looked like a girl and too complicated i think joss whedons good director but i think his movie serenity was better pretty good special effects dynamic action fight sequences and i liked battle scenes at grand central station in nyc but i really disappointed best part fast food restaurant scene after the end credits if you stopped watch it during the end credits you missed it
May 28 2013,positive,joss whedon is an astoundingly good filmmaker he successfully crafted a film that is not only record and ground breaking but feels like a dream come true to marvel fanatics like myself do yourself a favor and experience this incredible achievement in film
May 28 2013,positive,thor is still my favorite and iron man my least but this movie was pretty awesome yes i know im slow
May 28 2013,positive,a very good film to bring together the heroes fun action but has too many one liners
May 28 2013,negative,out of all the hype this movie was incredibly boring
May 28 2013,positive,grudging props to a superhero movie with few insights about the human condition but a helluva lot of style personality and wit
May 28 2013,positive,so many great moments 
May 27 2013,positive,i love the way the superheroes play off each other the fighting scenes get long i live for the funny robert downey junior moments
May 27 2013,positive,lets get them boys great movie full of action
May 27 2013,positive,it is overrated and takes too long to start up but when it does it is a lot of fun
May 27 2013,positive,joss whedon gets it right i hope michael bay is paying attention it is possible to have a massive special effects display and still tell a good story
May 27 2013,positive,comic books make great movies
May 27 2013,positive,the plot was so so it took too long for the avengers to come together and the villian wasnt particularly impressive if thor on his own can beat loki then why do the avengers struggle so much that being said the humour and the chemistry between the characters was pretty good and the hulk smash scene is worth 2 stars on its own the dude with the crossbow is incredibly lame though
May 26 2013,positive,fantastic movie cant wait for the second one
May 26 2013,positive,other than captain america winter soldier the best marvel movie
May 26 2013,positive,amazing one of the best superhero movies ever
May 25 2013,positive,shut up and take my money a great coming together of the universe that was made up over the course of 4 or so movies blew my socks off but then i put on new socks and it blew then off too  see it again for the first time
May 25 2013,positive,it was everything the movie was perfect
May 25 2013,positive,the best super hero movie so far
May 24 2013,negative,very overrated rdj and phil coulson are great as usual but the rest is garbage full of cheesy predictable one liners i dont know how people love it so much i wanted to see an action film i saw a disneyfied bullcrap attempt at family fun you know exactly how this movie is gonna play out 10 minutes in movies like the dark knight make this movie look pathetic basically its a bunch of superheroes doing their own thing battling for screen time thor loki captain america and black widow were horrible characters iron man hulk fury and coulson were good however this movie was horribly directed and very very predictable no suspense or originality this movie isnt as bad as thor but its not much better because thor is still in it 25 stars
May 24 2013,positive,one of my favorite superhero movies of all time
May 24 2013,positive,this movie was only possible with cgi however the movie blends the best of these action heros and has a story line that flows with the franchise we have the best actors coming together with one of the best scifi directors joss whedon  of the firefly series and motion picture serenity
May 23 2013,positive,if it werent for captain americas suit it would be perfect
May 23 2013,positive,excellent movie with broad appeal from the most rabid comic fan to the average movie goer bravo to everyone involved  also as a long time comic book collector it proved that the stuff ive been reading for years can be brought to life on the big screen and be excellent
May 23 2013,positive,josh wheedon is force to be reckoned witg when it comes to epic actionsuper hero movies
May 23 2013,negative,its like any old avengers comic books with the addition of explosive special effects the interactions between characters were dull and highly artificial and there was so much explosive carnage throughout the film that by the time the climax came there was little to be impressed by fairly run of the mill modern day super hero film i dont understand why its so popular
May 22 2013,negative,this movie had the ability to be amazing but it would seem that the writing staff either didnt exist were ineffably rushed lazy or simply lacking any amount of flesh within the cavity that is suppose to house the organ most critical to their craft besides filmography and the thrill of seeing such a large conflict this movie has nearly no drive it lags in the worst of places and lacks a significant amount of drive and expects the audience to immediately accept it as amazing without actually earning the right
May 22 2013,positive,the avengers  the avengers is one of the best hollywood superheroes movies the first time the news mentioned that the avengers movie was in the making i really thought that it was impossible for any directors to make it or it would become a disorganized movie because each character has different stories and it impossible to connect them in one story  however the movie showed the opposite it is really linking among different heroes who have different stories in one amazing story  the avengers movie shows some famous heroes who come together to get rid of the enemies the heroes are an inventorindustrialist iron man robert downey jr the incredible hulk mark ruffalo the pagan lightning god thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson and the enemy who is thors brother loki tom hiddleston in this movie when the international peacekeeping agency felt that the earth was in danger they started to ask the earths heroes for help when the unexpected enemy who threatens global safety and security came to the earth the heroes succeeded to kill him and save the earth so the avengers movie want us to believe that these action figures have worked nice as a team which is good news for humanity but it is bad news for the enemies some people do not like action movies or superheroes movies however this movie is different than the other movies what i would like to say is that everyone who loves action movies or even who does not should watch the avengers it is really a worth watching because it has seriousness and humor so you will cry in some sections and laugh in the other sections
May 22 2013,positive,a good experience that left me wanting more
May 21 2013,positive,i liked all of the super hero movies by themselves ut having them all in the same movie was awesome
May 21 2013,positive,great fun actionfamily movie
May 21 2013,positive, strong cast  strong production  strong script  enjoyable action  strong supporting
May 21 2013,positive,since iron man 3 is out id better review this movie this movie is so incredible you never get this kind of movie nowadays yeah cap thor iron man widow hulk and hawkeye get together and they work as a pretty good solid team the supporting cast did a great job i loved this movie and i highly recommend watching over and over again avengers assemble
May 20 2013,positive,awesome shit and some damn fine men right there
May 20 2013,positive,i knew from the moment joss whedon was announced as writerdirector of marvels supergroup franchise the avengers that the right decision had been made while it seemed like a gamble to industry observers  whedon had previously only made one feature film a sequel to his shortlived television series firefly  genre fans were immediately frenzied with excitement whedons track record at crafting stories with large ensemble casts buffy the vampire slayer firefly made him a great fit for the avengers his respectful and insightful handling of the characters made a potent film out of a premise that could have been an overstuffed mess in the hands of a lesser craftsman the avengers is essentially a sequel to five other movies all made with this one in mind nothing like this has ever been done before and while it is true that there are not a lot of complex character arcs in this film  those were largely taken care of in the solo movies before this one  whedon never lets the characters feel superfluous even the ones who admittedly should ie black widow and hawkeye his handling of the team dynamic is near perfect hitting the right character beats that dont slow down the relentless action and actually bring some stakes to the film if the team cant learn to work together then they cannot save the world and it is the focus on the character dynamics and grandiose action set pieces that overshadow the films rather rote and conventional plot it is as if whedon understands that the nature of the conflict is not as important as its meaning what it does to the team and accordingly treats loki and his worldconquering quest as something of a macguffin not for the heroes to obtain but for them to unite against the avengers manages the impossible to not only deliver on all the set up of the previous five films but to match or surpass them in pathos and fun whedons gift for dialogue feels perfect coming at a fast pace out of robert downey jr who gets some great oneliners as tony stark and the avengers finally gives us not just a decent film version but the definitive film version of bruce bannerthe hulk played with just the right balance of nervously unhinged by mark ruffalo replacing edward norton  marvels unprecedented gamble in trying to create its own interconnected cinematic superhero universe conceived before its first seeds were planted in iron man 2008 has reached the apex of phase i with a film that does everything right and exemplifies how marvel has treated this ambitious project not just as a moneymaking tool but as a viable storytelling medium
May 19 2013,positive,this movie just screams win
May 19 2013,positive,great combination of all the marvel movies
May 19 2013,positive,theres only one god maam and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that  marvel studios has created perhaps the most unique franchise in the history of film combining superheroes and putting them in their own universe before the avengers came out marvels definitive masterpiece was iron man and others were memorable as well including the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger when it was announced that disney had purchased marvel studios i panicked knowing the recent track record of disneys liveaction action blockbusters i believed that disney was going to dumb down the story and turn the story into a disaster but the advertisements looked awesome and combining an allstar cast and the teaming of marvel heroes had never been done before so i ended up watching it opening weekend looking back i realized that disney didnt dumb down the story along with director joss whedon disney has created a cinematic epic masterpiece and is without a doubt the greatest superhero filk ever made yes even better that christopher nolans masterpiece the dark knight  asgardian exile loki tom hiddelston ends up on earth threating the safety of the world by using the tesseract a cube source of unlimited power to unleash an alien race called the chitauri to destroy earth as we know it shield director nick fury samuel l jackson decides to unleash the avengers program bringing together a group of unique people to stop loki from his evil scheme involved in this project includes billionaire tony starkiron man robert downey jr dr bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo asgardian and brother of loki thor chris hemsworth patriot steve rogerscaptain america chris evans agent natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson and agent clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner but lokis manipulation causes the avengers to turn against each other and allow a tragedy to strike with one agent dead the avengers must put aside their differences in order to defeat loki once and for all  the avengers also features clark gregg as agent coulson cobie smulders as agent hill stellan skarsgard as dr eric selvig gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts and stan lee cameos in a news footage scene  besides the fact that disney purchased marvel the other thing that made me skeptical about the avengers was the premise i knew that a team of superheroes was a cool and awesome idea but as weve witnessed in michael bays transformers too much action is loud noisy and can be overdone causing a film mess and a massive headache but thankfully joss whedon knows his action and the avengers features tons of exciting action without being michael bay overdone causing the avengers to knock the transformers out of the park seriously a 3040 minute finale action sequence in new york featuring the avengers in action is much much more thrilling than multiple autobots fighting evil autobots causing a confusing mess one critic went as far as calling the avengers transformers with a brain and whoever that critic is hes absolutely right besides the awesome finale theres an exciting mission on shields helicarrier a flying naval ship a massive showdown between thor and hulk and an even more awesome fight scene between thor captain america and iron man  making the avengers reach its full potential is joss whedons excellent script filled with excellent humor and unforgettable dialogue also the visual effects are marvels alltime best finally making hulk the beast he really is by use of motioncapture and the explosions in the new york battle jawdropping i first saw the avengers in 3d which i rarely watch cause im not a huge fan of the format is extremely jawdropping and is currently the best nonimax 3d presentation ive witnessed this is coming from someone who missed out on 3d viewings of avatar hugo life of pi and pacific rim making the film worthwhile is alan silvestris score silvestri mastered epic sounds with his captain america score and here he outdoes himself even more the avengers theme is simply amazing and awesome and the score in general is one of the most thrilling epic scores in recent memory  but its the allstar cast that is the greatest thing of all in the avengers my absolute favorite in the group is robert downeys performance of iron man downey continues to be extremely funny while being an awesome superhero genius i was skeptical of mark ruffalos take on the hulkbanner cause while edward norton was excellent as banner in the previous hulk movie he failed as hulk cause hulk was just a cg creation well it turns out not only does ruffalo outdo norton as banner but with the incredible motioncapture technology created on this beast ruffalo is awesome as hulk as well and makes a realistic creature that nortons hulk lacked norton probably regretted turning down the role now due to the huge money this film made chris hemsworth continues to be awesome as thor while tom hiddleston is even more menacing as loki and is the scene stealer in every scene captain america was likely the weakest super thus far but here chris evans reaches cap to his true potential making more excited to see his sequel now  scarlett johansson continues to be an awesome chick as black widow clark gregg is awesome and even moving as coulson and samuel l jackson shows his cool and occasionally violent side as nick fury while i wanted to witness his backstory than hear it from his own mouth jeremy renners take on hawkeye is a good performance and the lack of backstory does not hurt my score in any way i just hope that in the future marvel will make a hawkeye movie that will make me love the character even more  even with the new purchase of disney marvels the avengers is the greatest superhero film ever made featuring a truly excellent allstar cast joss whedons excellent direction and script awesome action sequences that have common sense and not overdone like bays transformers junk alan silvestris awesome epic score and features every single character in development and getting their chance to shine plus the fact that the visual effects are marvel at their very best phase 1 ends on a very high note and marvel has really raised the bar in their superhero films phase 2 started with iron man 3 and i am hoping their future releases will continue to impress and thrill now that disney has purchased lucasfilm i have full confidence that disneys new star wars film will be equally incredible
May 19 2013,positive,a great blend of actioncomedydramacharacter studygeek outspecial effects its the movie michael bay wishes he knew how to make i didnt know how theyd manage to contain the 4 main characters iron man captain america thor and the hulk without having one outshine the others but they do while still including a good amount of time for nick fury hawkeye black widow and shield impressive the movie manages to set up the rivalries that underpin the avengers probably for later storylines but still shows that when its time to get together then they do oh and schwarmas tasty tasty schwarmas
May 19 2013,positive,the most epic superhero movie of all time
May 19 2013,positive,great film joss whedon does an amazing job brining huge names together and not letting one overshadow another each character has their time at the forefront the action is great and believable even for a superhero movie   51913  home
May 19 2013,positive,it was funny dramatic action filled and a great family movie
May 19 2013,positive,the greatest superhero movie of all time even better than dark knight an amazing cast clever script simple story and great director this movie is great for anyone from little kids to grandparents the avengers was fantastic and action packed great humour too loki wasnt trying to be a batman like villain he just wanted to be respected he is a great and likeable villain robert was great as usual as tony as were chris evans and he worth mark ruffolo replaced edward norton which was didnt annoy me that much honestly hes a great bruce banner overall this is an outstanding superhero movie and disney didnt screw it up
May 19 2013,positive,not only is this an excellent movie but it serves as the link between the many franchises that marvel has created which in turn opens up a whole world of possibility
May 18 2013,positive,great movie cant wait for 2
May 18 2013,positive,very good direction
May 18 2013,positive,slightly childish twist to what could be a more grownup film but still bringing all the big marvel hits together it really works robert downey jr and scarlett johansson along with the rest of the cast are perfectly assembled
May 18 2013,positive,best movie of the year
May 18 2013,positive,one of the best marvel movies
May 18 2013,positive,fantastic movie that had some laughs and great action scenes
May 17 2013,positive,its the greatest movie ever made with the most amount of flaws in it
May 17 2013,neutral,how this movie rated higher than star trek 2 is proof some people are just dumb this was an overly long boring movie that had no right to be  lots of super heros standing around each fighting over screen time a lame plot and an even lamer bad guy ohh and sam jackson the guy wholl do anything actually refrains from using the word niggar in this one although sometimes he acts like sam jackson not a character
May 17 2013,positive,got to live the way everything came together with the way hulk and thor worked as a team
May 16 2013,positive,ultimate movie  im glad i live in these technological times
May 16 2013,positive,good addition to the franchise although certainly not as good as thor or captain america from a story perspective robert downey jr was not as good in this as he is in iron man works  scarlett johannson a nice surprise as an action hero  nothing really bad about this just not a great story
May 16 2013,positive,the avengers is every kids dream to see their favorite superheroes all together for me it was a truly reborn of my love for movies it made me felt some kind of excitement that i hadnt felt in years
May 16 2013,positive,what the dark knight did for seriousness and realism the avengers does for a fun comedic and joyful romp with a great ensemble of characters as different as it was effective this finally made it worth it to sit through all those thor and captain america movies and post credit scenes
May 16 2013,positive,great action movie with favorite super heros
May 16 2013,positive,the avengers is everything you want in a summer blockbuster while making every fanboy wet themselves   joss whedon weaves a simple but strong story to bring these lost creatures together he makes captain america less of douchebag while unleashing rdj in full blown tony stark mood youll feel like a kid in a candy shop just listening to the conversation between banner and stark its grand and larger than any movie before but why shouldnt it be marvel has done something never done before in movies and it delivers on all levels   it wasnt going to be an easy journey for the characters to get along not with such large egos whether they flaunt it or not   each character gets a good three actions scenes culminating in the final scene which was like stimulation overload its hard to not get chills when they finally all come together in epic fashion with banner revealing his secret and punching a freaking giant worm in the face   tom hiddleston takes a whiny character of loki and makes him truly evil unsympathetic villain without any regard for human life he sees humans as mere pawns and ants to be ruled under an iron fist   youll walk away believing in superheroes
May 16 2013,positive,great movie overall wonderful action
May 16 2013,positive,great action effects characters chemistry acting and that feeling this is epic
May 15 2013,positive,just plain awesome movie  i could tell you what is so awesome about this movie but there is just to much and i dont want to type forever i personally expected it to be a good movie because the other marvel movies are pretty good but i didnt expect it to be this good period loaded with action  comedy in moments anyone who gives this below 4 stars is just a hater plain and simple cant wait for the next one and the new iron man movie coming next summer
May 15 2013,positive,i fell the beginning of this wave of comic book movies began with the first ironman i saw that film in the theaters 5 times and it still blows me away i gave the avengers 5 stars because such a tremendous undertaking with so much talent in the cast and such a difficult setting to direct joss whedon did an excellent job the only draw back to this film is that with so much going on it is hard to contain it to one movie i could feel at times the sense of urgency in the story telling almost as if the writers knew they were running out of time to tell all of the story this lead to the movie feeling rushed and implied at times fans that are not familiar with the comic books or the characters may have found themselves lost at times other than that this is a crowd pleasing thrill ride for lack of a better word i still enjoy watching this over and over today
May 14 2013,positive,what more could you ask for in a movie
May 14 2013,positive,i really liked the avengers the story was very interesting and the acting was very good as well with that said i thought the villain was more annoying than scary and i really enjoyed watching them repeatedly kick his ass but the villain seemed more like a spoiled brat who had found himself a new toy then a believable villain if it was not for each superhero and their stories i probably would not have lived it  my favorite scene is probably the one where the villain is trying to enslave iron man by touching his heart with his magic staff only to find out that iron man doesnt have a human heart and the hulk flies in through the window and kicks the villains ass i was laughing so hard thought i was going to cry  its a decent film with all kinds of great effects an a lot of unpredictable stuff that make for a really great movie one of the best super hero movies i have seen
May 14 2013,positive,perfect movie joss whedon an instant classic and awesome to show my younger siblings and have them dash around the room and having them all act like iron man or the hulk
May 14 2013,positive,the funniest movie of the year trevsreviewswordpresscom  i know marvels the avengers has been out for quite some time now 96 days to be exact but after my recent second viewing i was inspired to write this review  the avengers is a smoragasbord of superheroes including iron man thor hulk captain america black widow and hawkeye theyre brought together by nick fury played by the supercool samuel l jackson to do you guessed it save the world from an evil invasion writerdirector joss whedon does a brilliant and i mean brilliant job here i still dont know how he did it but ill get to that later  thors adopted brother loki the evil mastermind in the film leads an army of giant flying slugs to destroy planet earth im actually glad they brought back tom hiddlestons character his sly charisma and devilish charm was the only thing i liked in the pseudoprequel thor chris hemsworth and chris evans both do their jobs as thor and captain america respectively jeremy renner does what he can with what hes given as hawkeye i thought scarlett johansson actually had some nice human moments as black widow as oppose to just looking pretty in spandex most people felt mark ruffalo stole the show as the hulk which i admit he did a fantastic job with the amount of pressure there was on him to deliver however no one else comes close to the level that robert downey jr is on he simply shines in this film as tony starkiron man the way he excels with tony starks humorous sass and human emotion when he loses a dear friend makes him look like a man among boys ill admit im a robert downey jr fan so i am bias nonetheless in my opinion no one else could have played this role better but yes he certainly had help from joss whedon who gave him some of the best lines including a jab at the villains shaft  now let me state that im not a joss whedon fanboy ive never seen a single episode of the critically acclaimed firefly the only other work ive seen of his is the hilarious dr horribles singalong blog however now im slowly becoming one the only reason why the avengers succeeds so well is because of joss whedon his writing is smart hilarious and masterfully arranged every scene feels like a little puzzle piece that whedon perfectly assembled no pun intended together to create a complete picture that combines story action and character development beautifully even though this is a summer superhero blockbuster this is a great film to study for any aspiring writers such as myself  now in the realm of superhero movies i personally prefer the darker realism that christopher nolan brings to the dark knight films i would say marvels the avengers is the best superhero movie excluding the dark knight trilogy having that been said im not entirely sure the avengers gets all of the credit for that title a part of me asks is the avengers really that good or does it just appear to be because its surrounded by the mere mediocrity of its marvel superhero movie counterparts captain america iron man 1  2 and thor  which was a 15 for me in the end i think its a little bit of both  however putting the genre population aside the avengers is pure fun it is cheesy in every sense of the word its a superhero movie mashup bonanza i practically heard a comic book fanboy orgasm a few rows behind me but what makes the avengers special is that it knows it and is not afraid to make fun of itself it knows its not an oscar contender it knows why it was made  to haul in the masses for huge huge profit however this film doesnt feel like it was made for the money you can tell the cast and crew really put their heart and soul into the film and had a lot of fun doing it i wish more blockbusters were made with more genuine care and dedication like this one as oppose to just splattering cgi on the screen a la battleship a good movie doesnt have to be a powerful heavy drama it can be a silly blockbuster thanks to joss whedon and company seeing the avengers was the most fun ive had at the movies in a very long time
May 14 2013,positive,really good movie cant wait for the sequel 
May 14 2013,positive,great addition to marvel line up fantastic to see the comics come to life

May 13 2013,positive,ok boys and girls time to rob the piggy bank and go see this summers biggest block buster you might want to get there early as once the reviews are in the lines will be long and the seating scarce because this is the one all others will be judged by and i think will come up wanting even after being home for an hour my mind was still reeling from this one un cufking believable start to finish action the story line i thought might be sketchy but everything came together in a timely fashion marvel really took their time with this one and really hit it out of the park they get super kudos for this one mind blowing and people if you havent learned yet dont leave before the very end of the film i will not spoil it for all you true believers who have not seen the movie yet but dont leave they are setting up the premise for avengers 2 and the bad guy for the next film is going to blow your mind nuf said this one gets a full 5 stars from this house wished i owned 110 of 1 of this film id never have to work again this is going to be the years best grossing film no questions asked so its a must see film for any marvel fan most definitely worth the price of admission after seeing it i would say its worth it at twice the price so to all uou true believers i say excelsior

May 11 2013,positive,it achieves its place as one of the best superhero movies ever the dialogue works the action sequences are cool and the comedy is really the icing on the cake joss whedon successfully brings together genres the same way he successfully brings together superheroes
May 11 2013,positive,one of the coolest movies ive ever seen epic extraordinary and a bit hilarious marvels the avengers is a oneofakind blockbuster love it
May 10 2013,positive,i expected more there was way too much going on
May 10 2013,positive,this was the best movie ever
May 10 2013,positive,although it does suffer from a rather dull first thirty minutes avengers does provide the team up fans have been waiting for giving each member equal time to shine and of course gives plenty of time for some great set pieces  355 stars
May 10 2013,positive,marvel gets serious and finally conquers the world with this enormous blockbuster six dispair personalities including an egoccentric genious millionare a patriotic soldier with a  dadcaring sense of responsibility a northern brute god a guy with problems to control its greeny and chaotic anger and a pair of meticulous assassins meet to face what is presumably the greatest superhero final battle in film history watch half of the end credits to get an astonishing final surprise for the sequel pure entertainment pure epicness an instant classic
May 10 2013,positive,should have been called iron man 3
May 10 2013,positive,the biggest crowd pleaser in geek history
May 10 2013,neutral,entertaining fast paced action superhero movie same story all the time
May 10 2013,positive,pretty awesome to bring all the stars  together wish there was more to the writing though
May 9 2013,negative,it was a very childish film and once again chris hemsworths acting sucked i really didnt enjoy this compared to the dark knight trilogy dc all the way
May 9 2013,positive,the avengers simply saying the name makes audiences tremble in awe it is widely known to be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made for bringing together some of marvels greatest heroes and having them all kick ass against aliens while also forcing them to learn to cope with each other this was the film of the year that every single living critic on the planet gave a 1010 55 44 a 100 do i think the film deserves a 100 no in fact i may consider the film to be just a little bit overrated but did the film kick ass you bet it did    ill make my praise of the film short because everything i say has probably been said before well where do i begin for starters the action kicked ass even by superhero standards the manhattan alien battle was stunningly rendered reminding me of some of the finest moments from transformers the special effects are equally stunning and the cinematography is gorgeous simply put the film is visually stunning the actors have remarkable chemistry with each other all giving excellent performances as usual the only actor that i really didnt like was mark ruffalo as bruce banner i thought he was flat unemotive and just flatout bland he looked the part he just didnt act the part but everyone else was excellent alan silversti score is simply magnificent almost rivaling hans zimmer for the best superhero musical score the films dialogue is smartly written and well delivered doing a good job of keeping the humor balanced and not going too overthetop    basically those are the positives i cant really go into much detail about them because theyre just so obvious one really big thing i disliked about the movie is its lack of explanation for several plot devices like how the fuck did loki survive falling into the crevasse wasnt that supposed to be him committing suicide or whatever im sorry did i miss something some detail i dont know and wasnt breaking the azgard bridge in thor supposed to break all connectivity with the human world and what was the deal with hulk saying im always angry what does that mean none of it really made sense but i understand that the film has a lot of ground to cover so i cant blame it too much also i thought the film took a little too long to develop in the first half there wasnt even that much interaction between the heroes until much later i think the pacing could have used a slight touchup    really those are my only big criticisms i do think the film is a bit overrated i mean its not particularly thoughtprovoking or unbelievably intelligent its just good popcorn fun its certainly no dark knight rises but its one of the better films of 2012 i know this review is rather simplified but thats pretty much the way this film can be summed up theres not much to talk about not much detail that can be given about its pros and cons the film is fun and enjoyable and its worth a watch on bluray
May 9 2013,positive,being from india i have had the distinct pleasure of viewing avengers last night the movie is long which is to be expected since every character was given his own movie just to bring them all togetherbut every minute of the movie was about somethingthere was never a idle moment in the whole show it was fast it was beautiful to watch and it was funnythe casting was near perfect although i think hawkeye deserved a more meatier role than a simple mind controlled enemy reverted to friend everyone else did their roles superblyespecially the hulkmark ruffalo pulled off being timid and imposing at the same time although sometimes he felt really dumb the villan is my favorite character in any moviecomic book and i must say i was disappointed at loki loki is the god of night and above allthe god of mischiefi think the directors have taken it in a childish sensesince loki is nothing more than a angry brat he is as tony stark says a diva howeverhe seemed pretty weak and easily led to meon the wholethe movie is superb theres action theres comedy especially with the hulk theres drama and intensityand theres scarlett johansson as black widowneed one say more
May 9 2013,positive,easily one of the greatest action movies ever created the chemistry of the characters is fantastic i could try to name a weak spot in this movie but i seriously dont think there is one a movie that will be talked about and rewatched for decades to come
May 9 2013,positive,after many years of waiting the avengers is finally here lets put the clock to a few years ago when i first heard joss whedon was directing i didnt know what to think i didnt think it was a bad choice i just didnt know sure iv seen a few episodes of buffy buts thats all now lets skip forward to the fist interview i saw with him about the movie i knew from then on marvel had made the right choice he sounded so passionate about making movie for fans and how he wanted us see these charcters and wasnt wrong the avengers is fantstic movie and im opinion the best marvel movie so far  the avengers strong point is its dialougue joss whedon now im my opnion has the best dialogue than any other screenwriter its clever its wity and makes you care about the charcters now dont get me wrong the action scenes are top notch espcially the last one and the one with hulk side note this hulk is far the best mark ruffaloo kills edward norton and eric bana in the role but the dialouge is the films strong point    this movie is the defintion of a comic book movie it literally is like a comic book coming to screen the visuals and dialogue joss whedon uses makes it so the cast are superb  its amazing that  joss can not let one character overshadow the other fantastic  now to the negative points and i know this is just nitpicking the reason i give it 4 and a half stars out of five is just because even though the dialouge and humour are fantastic they do they do both seem a bit to try hardand in your face sometimes and also some of the action sequences at the end even though they are fantastic  look abit fake especially when cars are being blown you can clearly see they are just adding a bit of cgi if thats sense but other than these two thing the movie is superb so to finish up  see this movie and bring on avengers 2 nowone but joss whedon must be aloud to write and direct
May 9 2013,positive,an amazing movie wow just wow
May 9 2013,positive,an excellent addition to the marvel franchise the only thing wrong with the film is the tedious fight scene between two disliked characters hawkeye  black widow
May 9 2013,positive,absolutely fantastic
May 8 2013,positive,all hands down to one of the best of best superhero action movie ever
May 8 2013,neutral,it was an alright movie
May 8 2013,positive,this was probably the biggest nerdgasm ive ever experienced
May 7 2013,positive,easily the best superhero movie  like a scifi return of the king  a solid 94 is my rating  great acting and a very actionpacked thriller
May 7 2013,positive,i believe that the avengers was the most riskiest project ever marvel took 4 years to bring the avengers to the big screen it is not an easy job to make a movie with such iconic characters joss whedon did a perfect job with these characters loki is my second favorite super villain of all time next to joker of course after the avengers im looking forward to all the marvel phase 2 movies they are doing a great job not to mention iron man 3 it was a disaster it is so much fun to watch these characters interact and hulk steals this show like taking a candy from a baby the avengers is awesometacular
May 7 2013,positive,brilliant and legendtastic i have seen the awesomeness since the time when the world has ended it has the ultimate alien invasion of 2012 this was awesome hahahahahahaha
May 7 2013,positive,this movie was great my only concern was that some of the characters whim were underdeveloped had significant roles such as black widow and hawkeye
May 6 2013,neutral,25 hmm i dont think i am terribly impressed  it certainly doesnt deserve to be the biggest box office hit of the year  it seemed reasonably entertaining but nothing more  the cast is starstudded but i couldnt quite get into it  i kept wishing i were watching a full version of practically any of the one characters  by combining so many characters and stars into one cast basically everyone gets shortchanged  directors like altman and pt anderson can obviously make an ensemble film like this but whedon is no altman  the macguffin seemed tired as did virtually the entire plot  i felt virtually no urgency exhilaration or excitement  maybe i just wasnt in the mood  im sure ill find it entertaining in a mindless sort of way the next time around as well hopefully more so
May 6 2013,positive,5 starsgreat mix of so many super heroes in 1 picture  they all worked and created a comic book super movie for the ages  watched this movie 2 time at theaterthat is rare with the higher prices of theater tickets these days  then ordered it online in bluray  hoping the followup movie will be as good if not better  captain america did great job as combat leader during the main battle
May 5 2013,positive,the main thing that i loved about this movie is that it had more than one protaginist and that all of them were played by brilliant actors it has a brilliant plot and lots of awesome fighting and action scenes
May 5 2013,positive,an entertaining rollercoaster ride where even conversational scenes make it more then what it already delivered its at best a popcorn film probably of all time
May 5 2013,positive,best movie ever joss whedon is awesome and is even more awesome that he managed to bring the greatest supper heroes of all time together
May 5 2013,positive,going into this film i was very skeptical and was sure it would be bad i assumed that disneymarvel would make it iron man featuring the avengers i was pleasantly surprised when i saw that each hero got ample amount of screen time and the story was a good blend for the characters to interact in joss wheadon has given us another wonderful piece of film history
May 5 2013,positive,what i thought would be a disaster was a great action packed movie
May 5 2013,positive,love comic book movie this one really rocked
May 5 2013,positive,it is really hard to bring all those hero into a team it just feel great when people put down their difference and work together
May 5 2013,positive,i love to watch this really very very good and excellent especially what hulk done to thor i love to watch this  wow very fantasy
May 4 2013,positive,this movie was the epic movie of earths mightiest heros ironman hulk captain america and thor it had humor and some other movie characters like janes dad from thor nick f and more plus awesome action the only reason this movie doesnt get full stars is because captain america sucks and hulk can control his anger which is not explained and the stupid scene at the end of the credits plus it didnt live up to its hype at all but overall not the best marvel movie but not the worst
May 4 2013,positive,needs a little better story line but overall great movie
May 4 2013,positive,growing up with comics i can happily say we are in the golden age of comic source movies this one is the best because of the interactions between superheroes hulk and thor made me laugh got to see it again in 3d on a disney cruise ship disney has done a great job shepherding all these projects to this point
May 4 2013,positive,coolest movie ever  loved seeing everyone together
May 4 2013,positive,i love super heros and this moviebest movie i have ever watched
May 4 2013,positive,on paper this may look like a convoluted mess fortunately they hired the perfect director for the ocassion joss whedon and what resulted was a movie where not only do all the characters shine and are relevant but its story is as engrossing as it is just epic combine that with dazzling action sequences and outofthisworld special effects and you have what is as of now the best marvel comicbook adaptation ever one of the best superhero movies ever one of the best action movies ever made and one of the best movies of the year
May 4 2013,positive,really really really great film solid script great characters intense action avengers provides the audience with what they paid for i cannot stress how great this film was enough anticipating the second film very much
May 4 2013,positive,it was spectacular movie foul
May 4 2013,positive,whedon treads a delicate balance with the finesse and grace of a tightrope walker johanssons wooden acting is a speed bump in the midst of great characterization and a stellar script ruffalo in particular stands out as the first hulk that leaves nothing to be desired
May 4 2013,positive,the avengers was action packed filled from captain america to thor to iron man to hulk to hawk eye to the widow it was so much fun
May 4 2013,positive,well written and entertaining
May 4 2013,positive,no better superhero film than this
May 3 2013,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
May 3 2013,negative,the beginning of the film relied extremely heavily on the audiences previous understanding of the comics along with a series of boring action sequences bad dialogue and flat performances dont get me wrong im a comic fan but as its own entity the film jumped all over the place  the flat acting never improved with characters coming across as cardboard cutouts with nothing more to do than throw out unfunny oneliners and argue with each other almost every piece of dialogue contained plot exposition in the most overt way possible ie you know that x is happening this is because y you already knew that but the audience didnt film is a visual medium not a radio play  while i do agree that the film was a fun representation of the comics it was based on to some extent at no point were any of the characters relatable and nor were their decisions for example a character we neither know or care much about dies much less each of the avengers themselves and yet this motivates the main characters into action i spent most of the film trying to justify in my own mind the decisions characters made along with their sudden 180degree turns from one idea to another which brings me to the lack of consistency in the characters having just met the dialogue comes across as though theyve worked together for years in this organisation only seconds later to reveal their personalities suddenly dont mesh at all overall selfindulgent injokes and oneliners take the place of truthful character interactions  i would forgive this in the name of mindless enjoyment if not for the very backwardslooking visual effects in which nothing much looked convincing likewise the cinematography ranged from fakelooking light sources which screamed studio set to shots which looked like home movies perhaps this was an attempt to capture some realism following nolans dark knight trilogy but if so the filmmakers missed the point indeed the compositional choices in general did little to complement each scene and the events taking place all these elements did was to break the viewers suspension of disbelief and make the other flaws more glaringly obvious due to disengagement with the story  i have to say during the large fight scene about 34 of the way into the film i started to forget finally about some of these problems this was perhaps because this was the first time in which the pacing was constructed to add excitement and draw in the audience at last even within these sections though there were jarring moments of disbelief how many damn arrows fit into hawkeyes quiver and jokes which missed the mark completely worst of all were the frequent similarities with a large number of scifiaction flicks from independence day through to the abomination that is the transformers trilogy  i could go on about the problems with the avengers for quite some time but this is just an overview of the most prominent issues which affected my enjoyment of the film in actuality i dont think there was a single scene that wasnt packed with unbelievable character actions fakelooking visuals andor logical errors  in its favour the film did a very good job of providing a framework onto which fans of the genre could place their preconceived notions of the characters and the marvel universe in order to overlook the oddities which arose continuously throughout the film it was nice to see these characters united at last in live action just disappointing how bad its execution was
May 3 2013,positive,really good movie cant wait for sequel
May 3 2013,positive,one of the best marvel film so far
May 3 2013,positive,a wonderful blockbuster  both amusing and exciting

Apr 29 2013,positive,on the action scale the avengers gets an a  on the thought side it receives a solid b  nothing special but certainly good enough to elevate it far above the transformers series  amazing action with an average plot good acting and above average dialogue
Apr 29 2013,positive,its whedon whats not to love
Apr 29 2013,positive,kinda love this even though i shouldnt story wise and character wise there is nothing going on absolutely nothing heres where it gets good this movie feels so big the fact that this movie combines characters from four different franchises and just feels so epic its never ever boring its hilarious colorful this movie has it all the fact that this even came to be is commendable and the whole movie i just had that giddy laughter you get only from pure joy this probably couldnt have been executed in a better way its just so much fun
Apr 29 2013,positive,loved it favourite marvel movie to date really brought the characters together few little bits that were missing still dont know what was going on with the hulk and hawkeye got a bit short changed in it but still a fantastic movie
Apr 29 2013,positive,iron man hulk thor and captain america come together with hawkeye  black widow to take down loki i saw this at the cinema not in 3d and i really enjoyed it the way i put the trailer clips together into a story in went completely a different way which i was glad of i enjoyed how they did it and how they brought them together and how they disagree and then find out they need each other there are a few twists in this that i really wasnt expecting the dialogue in this movie absolutely awesome and so funny more jokes and hilarious quips than i expected which were really good im glad it wasnt really bad and it was the complete opposite as there are no origin stories and its just the avengers even people who havent seen the rest of the mcu i think will enjoy it as there isnt much depth and a lot is explained like why the hulk is why he is and how they found cap alive so with very slight back stories and awesome plot i will get this dvd and everyone else needs to too yes right now go
Apr 28 2013,positive,one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen the action are amazing the characters are well developed the screenplay was entertaining joss whedon is a very good screenwriter and film director the plot isnt mindblowing though its a superhero moviewere you expecting a spectacular plot
Apr 28 2013,positive,perfect and iron man is sexy
Apr 28 2013,positive,lots of fun but doesnt match the quality of the dark knight rises easy movie to watch
Apr 28 2013,positive,awesome movie in all kept mymy interest from beginning to end i would have preferred storyline be small bit less complex but that could be nitpicking all actors actresses played their role to the tee i enjoyed samuel l jackson role as nick fury the ending set up for what i expect a awesome phase 2 of the marvel universe
Apr 28 2013,positive,a good movie without a doubt a nice tiein from the movies so far but it did not leave a lasting impression on me stunning visual effects great performances just not my favorite comic book movie cb

Apr 26 2013,positive,awesome my favorite movie of all time
Apr 26 2013,positive,one of the best movies of 2012 the avengers lived up to the years of hype and provided a spectacular and unforgettable superhero blockbuster joss whedon perfectly brings each character to the screen and provides the best action sequence of the year and is the best superhero movie since the dark knight
Apr 25 2013,positive,action packed awesome great amazing incredible spectacular movie
Apr 25 2013,positive,i may not be familiar with the whole history of the avengers but i really did enjoy this film  i saw the midnight release and it was a true actionpacked thriller  im sure some comic book fans found some or many things wrong with this film but i loved it

Apr 25 2013,positive,the avengers is as good as comic book superhero movies ever get and that proves to be extremely good indeed there is a reason that joss whedon has become a brand name in the world of scifi and fantasy his deft touch is on full display here expertly mixing engaging characterization snappy dialog and plenty of brilliant action everything about this movie is great

Apr 24 2013,positive,breathtaking special effects and enough star power to light up the universe
Apr 24 2013,positive,with the unprecedented avengers whedon has accomplished what many believed to be impossible an onscreen superhero team up  intense action perfectly balances with thoughtful character development  moments of genuine emotion and earnestness compliment a spirit of fun and adventure  honestly what can i say that hasnt already been said
Apr 24 2013,positive,a lighter dark knight the conflict of the members of the avengers works well yet can be annoying after a while despite that the extremely well executed action makes up for it
Apr 24 2013,positive,awesome perhaps my favourite super hero movie yet stark steals the show again
Apr 23 2013,positive,a fun action film funny dialog and great action i recommend it to anyone who likes comic books

Apr 23 2013,positive,the best superhero movie ever great writing to bring these heroes together and giving us all what we were expecting
Apr 22 2013,positive,it was a very good movie lot of action there just needs to be more comedy and romance the 3 things i look for in a movie are action comedy and romance it does have a lot of action very little romance and a barely any comedy but overall it was a great movieso my final decision is to give it 3 and a half stars

Apr 20 2013,positive,all the marvel heroes come together to make a fantastic team i love iron man and cant wait until the third one
Apr 20 2013,positive,well it is entertaining but still a simple comicsaction movie without any contant
Apr 20 2013,positive,action packed really enjoyed it
Apr 19 2013,positive,very entertaining just the right balance of action superheroes and mushy storyline cant wait for the second one
Apr 19 2013,positive,movie was good but it was pretty over hyped ill say to much talking at a certain point  not bad but not that great  good
Apr 19 2013,positive,immersed in the marvel world you find yourself looking at the time hoping for avengers to continue one of the best movies ive seen the story was just right they didnt just band together alk cohesively the had to bond and fight through there differences awesome movie that left you wanting more we are all looking forward to the sequel
Apr 19 2013,positive,this movie and the movies that built up to it redefined what a superhero movie could be or should be it has a perfect balance of giving each of the characters time to shine and comedy laughlines with plenty of action there are multiple times that each character shows relatable emotion onscreen that just ties you to them and makes them feel like real people you could know and like in my opinion it is the best movie of the superhero genre to ever be made
Apr 18 2013,positive,the avengers is one of marvels best and its not a dumb mindless summer film like many others
Apr 18 2013,negative,this really didnt live up to a lot of my expectations joss whedon has been known to do better and i was disappointed that he didnt he did well for what it was but there were a lot of good things that just werent done
Apr 17 2013,positive,what can be said about this movie it was amazing i wish hawkeye had a bigger part  but this movie just wow
Apr 17 2013,positive,i began to watch the avengers the other night and was reminded why it was such a cool movie the cast of the movie included robert downey jr ironman chris evans captain america mark ruffalo the hulk chris hemsworth thor scarlett johansson black widow jeremy renner hawkeye tom hiddleston loki and samuel l jackson nick fury all of the actorsactresses that i just listed are incredible actorsactresses  the reason this movie was a box office hit was because of the cast the action and the humor there were many action scenes as well as funny scenes and scenes where you felt as if you were actually in the room the movie had a great story line which came with its rivalry between some characters as well as chemistry with others the ratio of action to comedy was just about perfect in this movie the reason being is because of the key ingredient of comedy timing another piece that made the movie funny was tony stark robert downey jr and loki tom hiddleton  tony stark being the corkycrazy guy he is makes the character great loki tom hiddleton is sarcastic at times and very witty he cracks jokes whenever an opportunity comes up  in this movie loki tom hiddleston a norse god comes to earth in search of something of great importance and power in the process he causes chaos and brings on war nick fury samuel l jackson is not fond of this idea and gathers a group that we all call the avengers  as loki was preparing to begin a war he was caught but when his accomplices did what he commanded they eventually freed him this stirred up quite a large amount of chaos the avengers were dispersed and eventually all gathered up to fight the chitauri army that was attacking new york tony and captain are not the best of friends throughout the movie but when the time came for them to work together they stepped up their game  the avengers fought against the chitauri in new york city although they did cause a lot of damage to new york the battle was a great one all in all this movie was great it is a movie that the family can sit down and watch together and its even a movie for all ages whether you are a comic geek or business person doesnt matter because this movie kicks ass i am neither a comic geek nor business person and i loved it it is extremely entertaining and fun to watch this is a movie that you dont necessarily need to know all of the characters to understand what is going on although it is probably better if you know the characters and to tell everyone the truth i couldnt find anything bad about the movie they really knocked it out of the ball park with this one
Apr 17 2013,positive,i love this movie really the effects is so amazing the adaptation is very good  this movie contains all the action fun abeyance and excitement  is a fantastic movie
Apr 16 2013,negative,i was not a fan thankfully it is over and i have a year to wait until the next one
Apr 16 2013,neutral,as i settled in for marvels the avengers to cite its full title my mind began to drift back a few years all the way back to another marvel action team the xmen i complained then that the problem of multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control how do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers the xmen series never straightened out this problem but with marvels the avengers this is not an issue  it was a smart plan for marvel studios to build the characters one at a time giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here as a leadin we got iron man 2008 the incredible hulk 2008 iron man 2 2010 and last summers thor and captain america the first avenger  next up is nick fury with that by the time we get to marvels the avengers most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us that frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by one  the avengers are more interesting to me than the xmen because they come from different places thor chris hemsworth is norse god from another galaxy captain america chris evans is a geneticallyaltered army strongman from the 1940s hulk mark ruffalo is a green muscle mass hiding out in india under the passive alter ego of bruce banner and iron man robert downey jr is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the chrysler building in new york plus theres an archer called hawkeye jeremy renner and a token female russianborn woman named black widow scarlett johansson who i think is good with martial arts for whatever reason these last two didnt get a movie of their own but stay tuned  the avengers like the xmen are also led by a secretive baldheaded authority figure with a handicap he is nick fury samuel l jackson who runs a shadow organization called shield whose function is to stop super villains from    well doing supervillainy i suppose the task here is to get back an object called the tesseract an object that  if i understood it correctly  acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy thats bad news for our planet because it means that the norse god loki tom hiddleston thors adopted halfbrother can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful superarmy it also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain shield personnel lokis first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world germany maybe he hasnt heard but thats probably not a wise place to start  the avengers personalities are known to us but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another in this movie many are meeting each other for the first time and no one knows who can be trusted thats especially true with a tense relationship between iron man and thor since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil loki can he be trusted another issue of tension comes with the addition of bruce banner everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyones apprehension that hulks destructive nature could be a potential problem  the most engaging character in the film for me is bruce banner played this time by mark ruffalo who manages to pull off the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role ruffalo plays banner as a mildmannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check he does something interesting he quiets his voice to a calm mellow deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls the other guy i liked his rendition of bruce banner although i think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check maybe with the mantra keep calm and carry on that might have been perfect  i liked the character touches in marvels the avengers i liked the dialogue which is written at a smart snappy level by writerdirector joss whedon he has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive he is the man behind buffy the vampire slayer firefly toy story and a brilliant horrorcomedy the cabin in the woods still in theaters  i just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act hes a smart writer but the movie goes into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that weve seen a million times it would have been see the same inventive brilliance as the last act of the cabin in the woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special his avengers is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue when you stand back and look at the plot as a whole you see that it really doesnt add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world his movie as it stands exists somewhere between the hohum of the xmen and the brilliant extravaganza of the dark knight it isnt a perfect film but i enjoyed it probably more than i expected
Apr 16 2013,positive,this may be the worst movie of all time next
Apr 15 2013,positive,the true example of a great summer blockbuster  the avengers is a great superhero film thats a spectacle to watch  whedon feige and penn do a fabulous job at integrating six very different characters from entirely different films into one masterpiece  the whole cast is nearly perfect and puts on huge show  ripped straight out of the comics the avengers is a major success for marvel for a five year ambitious project and is on the right track in this cinematic universe it has created
Apr 15 2013,positive,the most fun ive had at the movies in a long time the critics need to relax and enjoy the fun exactly how i wanted to kick off summer movie season
Apr 15 2013,positive,one of films greatest achievements bringing characters from all franchises together only marvel can pull this off excellent visuals great cast epic story avengers assemble
Apr 15 2013,positive,went into watching this thinking after watching captain america can it get any worse but i was stunningly surprised and impressed characters who i thought were portrayed to weak in previous films took a lead in which i felt their characters were more projected and the acting was amazing too good loved it and the new additions to the cast are brilliant and had be hooked
Apr 15 2013,positive,best superhero movie ever
Apr 14 2013,positive,i love it great make up artist  special effects i love the hulk
Apr 14 2013,positive,i had to record all of the other movies to i got caught up loved it cant wait for ironman 3
Apr 14 2013,positive,great blend of action and thriller its been a long time since theyve came out with one
Apr 14 2013,positive,was that it seriously 1 hour of inane dialogue and one hour of just overblown action i get it i really do you have all the character development in the first half to make the ending more powerful i understand but when the hour before it was just completely hollow dialogue that really had nothing to say it just came off as pointless and boring one line of how bruce banner tried to kill himself is not good character development it is just something that was just started and then never added to hawkeye and black widow are boring super heroes who no one cares about with hawkeye being completely useless after he runs out of arrows i dont particularly care for hulk and thor that much i like captain america and iron man though i liked their rivalry and the banter they shared with robert downey jr doing what he does best have a good time his dialogue made me laugh quite frequently and it was just fun to watch him even if i personally did not like the first half the script was great at making the characters feel the same from the movie that they were in and i liked the fact that they were not all friends from the getgo i like how they had to grow as a team and the scene before the final fight begins where they are all standing together was quite awesome it is a joss whedon film so of course the visuals looked spectacular and the action was very nice but id have preferred a mix of talking and action but i cannot really see that working well here even so after all was said and done i did have a smile on my face just because of the enjoyment of the ending so the movie must be doing something right i am not one to listen to hype because i am usually let down because of overhype but i do feel that people need to calm down with this the movie is merely average it is just the spectacle of seeing all these heroes together at once although if you love it more power to you have fun
Apr 14 2013,positive,the avengers superhero film written and directed by joss whedon the film was produced by marvel studios and distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures the movie is based on the marvel comics superhero team of the same name starring ensemble cast of robert downy jr mark ruffalo jeremy renner chris evans scarlett johansson tom hiddleston samuel l jackson and more   the avengers grossed 151 billion worldwide topping it to the list of highestgrossing films of all time at 3   loki main antagonist villain from thor and an adoptive brother of thor is stealing the tesseract a sparkling cube of infinite power from the movie captain america the first avenger from shield agent nick loki is planning to go on the human race to tie them with his own rule iron man the hulk captain america hawk and thor all have to assemble together to face this prevailing threat to planet earth   i missed this movie in theater on purpose thank god to save myself from sitting through more than 2hrs while the movie does prove joyful for the viewers and fans but simply it stretches too far it seemed like the avengers themselves were being part at destroying much of the city   i love the hulk character loved the ang lee summarizing the characters definitive approach to unlocking mystery of what simply gripped and feared him the most ang lee version was the assumptive analysis of the hulk that so little movies really dare to tackle and present to viewers of course the fans obsessed with hulk in action missed much part of that i loved edward norton in sequel and i got to learn about mark ruffalo one of my topfavorite actors playing the character i was too excited to see the film i could not understand though why dr bruce banner would go and live in kolkatta india if he had to hide there are several other nations where he could quite easily hide from those looking for him such as cuba zimbabwe afghanistan or pakistan but as it has always been the case the producers needed to attract the 2nd largest population of a country in the world for ticketsales   excellent witty touch of humor from robert downy jr made it quite enjoyable  a pure annihilationfilled film of 2012
Apr 13 2013,negative,one of the most overrated films ive ever seen
Apr 13 2013,positive,great film cant wait till they make a second film
Apr 13 2013,positive,great characters great actors and great dialogue but the plot was lacking loki needed to be more evil and powerful it was like he was over powered and over whelmed heroes are as good as their villains witness darth vader vs luke enough said
Apr 12 2013,positive,a highly entertaining movie that  lives to the many years of hype and expectations
Apr 12 2013,positive,whoooo in your face dc this rules
Apr 11 2013,positive,it is a good movi to watch
Apr 11 2013,positive,rating a without a doubt one of the greatest superhero movies one of the greatest movies for that matter i have ever seen spectacular special effects clever humor and great directing the avengers is an awesome film almost every character in this movie really could not have been cast any more perfectly seriously samuel l jackson as nick fury two thumbs up for that one marvel all of the buildup movies were pretty good and i did not see any that i did not enjoy since i have seen pretty much every superhero movie ever i have great expectations for almost all of them this one goes beyond the imagination more than any other film almost any superhero movie after this was great man of steel the wolverine iron man 3 dark knight rises all pretty great but still im sorry you cannot beat the avengers to wrap up to anyone that did not enjoy this movie as an old man in an abandoned building would say you have a condition because the avengers is the most masterful and spectacular superhero movie that there ever was and might ever be
Apr 11 2013,positive,inevitably overhyped this film delivers on action but sacrifices character development in the process  funfilled but again inevitably not all the characters get their deserved time in the spotlight and the film feels like iron man 25 now with superpowered sidekicks
Apr 11 2013,positive,a great actionsuperhero film
Apr 10 2013,positive,hard to follow if you havent watched the other movies in the series particularly thor and captain america but still a good flick
Apr 10 2013,positive,an outstanding cast of heroes put together to make an unbelievable film one of the best of 2012
Apr 10 2013,positive,extremely bad ass the avengers is arguably the most action packed movie ever created to date it mixes four iconic superheroes and none of them take a back seat in the action or story excellent entertainment
Apr 10 2013,positive,thoroughly entertained the ego bouts between the heroes were great and made the ensemble cast actually work funnier than i had anticipated
Apr 10 2013,positive,the best movies of superheroes
Apr 10 2013,positive,the avengers are awesome
Apr 9 2013,positive,its really good but its also a little overrated
Apr 9 2013,positive,a well chosen cast and a action packed blockbuster that was well crafted from beginning to end
Apr 9 2013,positive,in the era of films today film disappointments are scarily common usually in a much anticipated film like this you usually expect it to either be pretty good or a complete mess fortunately it is neither of those and it didnt just meet my expectations but surpassed them not just a good film but an amazing one the plot works there are fantastic action sequences stellar performances and brilliant special effects loki is one of the best comic book villains ever put on screen and all the heroes are just plain badass a modern classic
Apr 9 2013,positive,marvels the avengers is a great action movie in which writerdirector josh whedon assembles all the great marvelsuperheroes   tony stark robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth and natascha romanov scarlett johanson are enlisted by nick fury samuel l jackson into an organisation called shield to fight thors evil brother loki tom hiddleston   its really fascinating to see the way the avengers with all those individuals become a team in the course of the movie especially captain america and tony stark who at the beginning cannot even be in one room together without arguing   shield has to retrieve the tesseract an energy cube loki thors brother stole with which he can open a portal from space to earth for his alien army the chitaury to come and destroy earth  hiddleston did a great performance as loki because he showed the selfishness and arrogance selfconfidence of loki in an unserious and ridiculous way which makes him look like the wannabe bad guy but given his immense mysterious space power he remains a huge threat to the avengers  the special effects are breathtaking thats what makes this movie so expensive with a budget of 220 million it was one of the most expensive movies of 2012 the main action scene in which the avengers defend new york from lokis alien army are thirty actionpacked minutes full of marvelous effects that leave the audience openmouthed  its absolutely worth watching this movie because all these great characters come together in one fabulous movie
Apr 9 2013,neutral,dont get me wrong this movie had a lot of great parts but as a whole it felt clunky
Apr 9 2013,positive,easily one if my favorite comic book movies had skyhigh expectations along with everyone else and it was as good as advertised
Apr 8 2013,positive,best freaking super hero movie ever
Apr 8 2013,positive,one of the movies that made me scream with pleasure its minor plot holes arent enough to make me not to love it one of the most enjoyable movies of the past years finaly marvel made a really great film
Apr 8 2013,positive,coming into the movie i wasnt sure what to expect  as a kid i spent most of my time outdoors  i can count on one hand how many times ive touched a comic book and most of those times were to roll them up and use them as an imaginary sword  id never seen any of the accompanying movies either  so naturally i figured id be completely lost throughout the entire movie  the first time i watched it i was  i had no idea who was who or what they were trying to accomplish  to be honest i didnt enjoy it  if it werent a part of a school project i probably wouldnt have given it a second chance  so i watched it again  after watching it a second time i picked up things that were initially missed and ended up enjoying a movie that i never thought i would the movie starts with thors brother loki finding his way to earth with the objective of stealing a renewable energy source called tesseract  the avengers are called to save the day in classic comic book fashion  hawkeye was initially assigned to guard the tesseract  a portal opened and out came loki  loki manipulates hawkeye along with dr selvig using his magical staffspearlooking thingy makes off with the tesseract and the avengers are assigned with the task of retrieving the tesseract and bringing loki to justice  that proves to be quite a difficult task  there are points during the movie that each of the heroes butt heads with each other making it difficult to accomplish their task  evidently playing well with others isnt part of a super heros genetic code  it takes the death of one of their own to bring them together as a team  as a team they prove to be unstoppable  the hulk smashes stuff  ironman is the billionaire playboy genius philanthropist that doesnt work well with others  hawkeye eventually gets out of his funk with the help of a face smashing by romanoff  captain america reminded me of a younger stronger and better looking version of my grandpa  he looks at the world with the eyes of an 80 year old but has the abilities of a 20 year old  thor was also interesting to me  you could tell at the beginning of the movie that he was a little conflicted with the assignment hed been given  you could tell that he wasnt thrilled about having to bring his own brother to justice but did it anyway because he knew that it was the right thing to do all things considered i enjoyed it  it caught my attention enough to watch the other movies associated with it that may lead to me appreciating the avengers more than i already do
Apr 8 2013,positive,violence  gore 510 lots of action guns explosions a few frightening images and some violence very little minor graphicalbloody scenes   sex  nudity 010 no sex or nudity    language  profanity 210 minor profanity   age 11
Apr 7 2013,positive,this movie is just awesome action packed funny great cast and a good story the prequels were awesome and it mightve took a while for it to come out but it was worth the wait it was a complete surprise of how good it was and how much i liked it it might not be my number one marvel movie but its 2 or 3 on my list its spectacular
Apr 7 2013,positive,the most fun you can have at the movies this year
Apr 7 2013,positive,gooddecent superhero movie but is highly overrated by fanboys and others uninteresting plot and pretty predictable action is okay but ive seen better overall this is still an enjoyable flick

Apr 6 2013,positive,awesome childhood come to live i want the sequel now
Apr 6 2013,positive,ovr 10 could not fault it and in 3d was epic
Apr 6 2013,neutral,the avengers while it is heavy in humor lacks in substance simultaneously as joss whedon is arrogant enough to completely ignore the source material that all these characters come from while making a decent iron man movie whedon forgets about the heavy hitters of the marvel universe such as thor and captain america by portraying them in an forgettable and uninteresting manner
Apr 6 2013,positive,this is my favorite movie
Apr 5 2013,positive,the avengers to me are a good team  but to me individually in there own separate movies are more entertaining than united 
Apr 5 2013,positive,excellent whedon is a genius but we know that
Apr 5 2013,negative,i hate any superhero movies i think they are all boring and they all are pretty much based on the same thing
Apr 5 2013,neutral,very funny and entertainingstrong perfomances but this movie is really overrated
Apr 5 2013,negative,i am not a fan of superhero movies  because most of them are stupid  however i can not believe there exist a movie like this the avengers  its already beyond stupid 
Apr 4 2013,positive,i would watch it over  over again awsome movie
Apr 4 2013,positive,this easily could have been a disaster but thankfully it wasnt no fan of action or superhero movies has any excuse not to have seen this already
Apr 4 2013,positive,the perfect action movie has just the right amount of foreshadowing humor setups and payoffs although robert downey jr was a giant part of its success he didnt make the movie the script cinematography effects and were all in perfect harmony
Apr 4 2013,positive,comic book movies are my thing
Apr 4 2013,positive,best superhero movie i have seen in a long time

Apr 1 2013,positive,awesome movie cant wait for the sequel one of my all time favorite superhero movies
Apr 1 2013,positive,i enjoyed this movie immensely  each character had their own thing going on their own weaknesses strengths yet also had amazing group dynamic and chemistry  actually the chemistry of the group was very palpable and desirable almost making me want to be apart of their friendships  i hate to say it even enjoyed the villain though i dont like siding with evil guys  tom who played loki is cute so maybe thats why  oh well moving on  robert downey jr was good at being himself as always lol and just everyone meshed so beautifully  i loved captain america also  even scarlett held her own incredibly well because i dont know her to be a action hero type actress and despite being outnumbered by a bunch of actiontype men she was not overshadowed bringing umph yet some estrogen to the mix  she was awesome and made me notice her despite not giving her much thought before this movie  i loved all the characters to be exact  no one seemed left out concerning the character development part of the movie it seemed complete in that area  i liked some of the moral aspects of it good overcoming evil spoiler alertironman changing from being selfish to sacrificing himself for others reconciliation in the group  just it was a feel good movie plus the action sequences werent too shabby either  it was a complete package
Apr 1 2013,negative,not as good as i expected it to be
Apr 1 2013,positive,dramatic cinematic and full of entertaining heroics takes a while to get into at first but a must see for any marvel or superhero fans witty and fun it could definitely have been shortened but the wonderful character dynamics and complementary soundtrack liven up the movie considerably
Apr 1 2013,positive,i really like how they combined all the action heroes
Apr 1 2013,positive,great action movie it will keep you on the edge of your seat

Mar 30 2013,positive,best part is the hulk
Mar 30 2013,positive,i expected more from joss whedon while avengers was a reasonable romp it lacked whedons more typically irreverent snarkiness there were only 3 cases when whedon let his inner browncoatslayer out when thor advises the team that loki was adopted when hulk pwns loki and when hulk takes one last jab at thor thats not enough for a 2 hour movie  i also didnt like how the avengers spent so much time bickering like schoolchildren  and why oh why must battles always result in so much destruction it seemed that the good guys demolished as much of new york as the bad guys did  and seemingly with as much relish  still im grateful that whedon has received the recognition he deserves finally although i wish it had been for firefly or buffy rather than avengers
Mar 30 2013,positive,do you like action and state of the art special effects if so then this is the film for you do not expect a serious realistic film here this is simply a fun and sometimes funny thrill ride through the marvel universe

Mar 28 2013,positive,best movie amazing writing
Mar 28 2013,positive,this is the perfect superhero movie characters pop with such gleeful humor that the film could be considered a comedy and yet the drama has much weight and its presence is always felt of course the action is wonderful and you wont want to wait until you can see thor smacking hulk with his hammer again ultimately i can say little that has not already been said avengers is the movie to beat this summer
Mar 28 2013,positive,fuck yeahone of the most exhilarating films ive ever seen
Mar 28 2013,positive,popcorn entertainment at its finest  fun not too deep not too thoughtful but very engaging and exciting
Mar 28 2013,positive,love this movie  its full of action and surprise  im nit a comic book fan but this movie is awesome
Mar 27 2013,positive,did i just see hulk beat the hell out of two gods this film is not just actionpacked it is also full of comical performances one of the best superhero films ever made
Mar 27 2013,positive,it isnt often that a superhero movie of this calibre is made with a million laughs per second and amazing action scenes this one is worth every penny
Mar 27 2013,positive,best superhero movie ever
Mar 27 2013,positive,this movie really blows my mind i never thought 6 heroes could be so powerful this movie is action packed comedy filled  in my top three favorite movies the avengers work hard and eat some well deserved schwarma in the end
Mar 27 2013,positive,awesomeness    not just for the geeks  this one serves it up real nicely
Mar 27 2013,positive,how can you not love this movie
Mar 27 2013,positive,theres not much sophistication to it but its still wildly entertaining
Mar 27 2013,positive,a nerds dream this film had a lot of hype to live up to what with all the films marvel made leading up to this and it payed off in every way possible and made a hugely enjoyable and entertaining film with a good simple plot
Mar 27 2013,positive,nobody gives a shit about tom hiddleson he is the best
Mar 27 2013,positive,if you are a true marvel fan then you will love this film  the plot and characters were already developed in previous movies highly recommend you see the individual titles acting is suberb for this genre the alist names work well together  one of the best superhero flicks to date
Mar 26 2013,neutral,like teenage mutant ninja turtles 2 with a bigger budget and worse dialogue
Mar 26 2013,positive,youll never get the feeling you got from watching this movie the first time again the magic of bringing different characters into one movie holds an awesome magic
Mar 26 2013,negative,dreadful what happened to super hero movies from marvel this movie was hailed to be some sort of modern masterpiece for the genre but upon viewing it on the big screen i wanted to scream and run to get my money back this painful piece of cgi trash has about as much entertainment value as a steaming pile of dog excrement   dont get me wrong the cast did their best and are fine but the script and reliance of cg was a slap in the face to viewers the villains were not explained the story made me check my watch every other minute and the over the top sequences of green screen violence were a major insult to everyones intelligence in the theater i understand some people really seemed to enjoy it and i say more power to you but for me this was a complete joke the realism that was interlaced in films like the original spiderman xmen daredevil and punisher proved that marvel had a dark side it really worked for those films ever since disney got their sparkly little fingers in marvels pie it is easy to see how things have gone down hill  a complete and utter bore that will undoubtedly have an equally lame sequel that mindless hordes of people will flock to see these films thrive because of the excellent trailers sitting through 2 hours of this is just mind numbing your kids will love it but in a few years it will be evident that these marvel avengers are cheesy and two dimensional a huge money makerbut ultimately a sorry excuse for a film
Mar 26 2013,positive,awesome enough said a
Mar 26 2013,positive,all those ripped abs is enough the action is a bonus loved it
Mar 26 2013,positive,best superhero movie ever  arguably yes
Mar 26 2013,positive,the entertainment value alone should be enough to make you enjoy this film i personaly found myself constantly amazed at how the script was able to jugle so many great names and charcters in such an effective way i didnt think that a movie with 4 main characters can work i was wrong 910
Mar 25 2013,negative,cant really feel for super heros who are have such a ultra egoalso it feels as though none of them can die except for one momentand its too predictableit never felt as though the bad guys could winits gone down to me as a horrible filmand im surpised anyone could actually give a positive review for this 2 stars from me
Mar 25 2013,positive,a bunch of superheroes come together to save the world from alien invasion  this is a pretty good effort as far as superhero movies go  the group dynamics are interesting enough and the special effects are impressive  the movie is a little long since while original in a way the goodies vs baddies save the world deal has been done many times before  nice effort
Mar 25 2013,positive,beside all the obvious perfectness of this movie cobie smulders was the best addition to the cast even though her screentime was minimum maria hill gave me something to hold onto on this ride of a movie
Mar 25 2013,positive,movie had good action but the whole funny parts during the movie killed the moment and would have been a more interesting movie if it wasnt for that transformers 3 didnt have optimus doin funny scenes
Mar 25 2013,positive,marvels the avengers builds up its cinematic universe by bringing in all the characters we came to love and the finale definitely showed the spectacle marvel had promise us and even more
Mar 24 2013,positive,best movie i have seen in years and definitely best movie of this year
Mar 24 2013,positive,if you are a fan of the genre you must see this
Mar 24 2013,positive,best super hero movie to date
Mar 24 2013,positive,would watch over and over
Mar 24 2013,positive,this is what a superhero movie should feel like
Mar 24 2013,positive,good wholesome fun  my only complaint is that the final battle sequence started to sag under the weight of all the cgi creatures stuffed in
Mar 24 2013,positive,probably one of the best summer movies to come out in a long time
Mar 24 2013,positive,this is an awesome movie that wraps up phase one wonderfully there is lots of action and awesome iron man epicness
Mar 24 2013,positive,its good but for some fans it will provide disappointment over its story and development
Mar 24 2013,positive,this film is exactly what i wanted it to be nuff said
Mar 24 2013,positive,final fight scene was badly written but dope overall
Mar 23 2013,positive,with each movie adaption of marvels various superheros gaining mixed reviews i had a feeling this would have some ground to recover with the hulk changing actors hawkeye having no background before this and captain stuck in wwii it seemed marvel would have to pull a miracle to make this work they did an amazing line up of actors and actresses all building certain relationships with each other and with the head of shield himself nick fury loki returns from the thor movie so those who havent seen that may be a bit behind when the movie kicks into high gear however all other roles not previously established are done well and dont seem to occupy as much screen time as one may think would be needed this movie is one of the best of 2012 and deserves a shot at a sequel
Mar 23 2013,positive,could watch this movie over and over love it
Mar 23 2013,positive,this excellent cast makes an excellent entertaining movie
Mar 23 2013,negative,erik webers statement without robert downey jr delivering his witty quips in patented ratatattat fashion the avengers would largely be a soulless shell of a movie that could be mistaken for a michael bay production holds very true joss whedon and zak penn played this game too close to the chest and failed to surprise me in anyway whatsoever the only good thing about this film is the fact it made up for thor and iron man 2
Mar 23 2013,positive,trailer looks awesome
Mar 23 2013,positive,while it may not be the best movie ever made it has a charm that is unforgettable it will bring laughs to everyone while creating a visually stunning masterpiece the cast is 100 top notch and all critically acclaimed this film is not just for nerds or gentlemen it is for women and even the little ones too this film helps me enjoy going to the movies again
Mar 23 2013,positive,i had no expectations of it even though it did have a lot of hype there were one or two scenes in it that i felt didnt need to be so long but a film needs that i think especially when its a character based movie more than an action film  everyone in the cast did awesome and everyone from a behind the scenes creative aspect did their jobs really well  one of the best movie going experiences ive had in a long while
Mar 23 2013,positive,the avengers is funny sometimes its very good not at the level of the dark knight but better than the dark knight rises its very good it deserved more than only one nomination to the academy awards but the ones that decided not to give the avengers more nominations are the same that gave the academy award of best animation movie to brave instead of wreckit ralph
Mar 22 2013,positive,entertaining even though i dont know my comics like i should to watch this film  i know im going to get hate on this but i love the casting of johansson  and whoever decided ruffalo should be hulk was brillianti never would have pegged that one but hes believable and so unexpected
Mar 22 2013,negative,a hype without any substance little to no character depth or development to be found the film runs its course from substanceless action scene to fanserving action scene the actors have great chemistry but they are given nothing to do with it  a world is going to end film with literally no stakes attached we are supposed to be moved by a characters death which already is undone because he is written to be us the fanboyto bad he had little to no screen time to make us really care not only does this film have plotholes galore it completely 2dimensionalizes its villain to the point of absurdity beginning in thor as a god struggling to meet his fathers approval and find a purpose he somehow ends up trying to rule a planet he never even cared about before with the help of because a god needs help aliensaliens who trust and make a deal with him becausewe dont really know  these aliens decide to bring mindless hive aliens to attack only new york citybecause that always worksthe film is a straight up 2dimensional brawl with characters only given depth by their associations with their previous better films dont even get me started on how little thor mattered or made sense in this film basically the same treatment winston got in ghostbusters 2
Mar 22 2013,positive,joss whedon can do no wrong
Mar 22 2013,positive,the avengers is one of the few great examples of putting a large cast together and making the chemistry work i would recommend this movie even to those who arent fans of superhero movies and trust me i should know
Mar 22 2013,positive,such a good film and very well done the actors were brilliant for their roles this film holds the balance of action and sensability
Mar 22 2013,positive,like a red carpet for superheroes the avengers showcases all of marvels alisters except the xmen the fantastic four and spiderman in a funny and spectacular way   one of the best if not the best superhero movies ever
Mar 22 2013,positive,one of the best action adventure movies but ive seen the past decade the comedy is also placed perfectly
Mar 22 2013,positive,not bad but grossly overrated
Mar 21 2013,positive,probably the best super hero movie yet
Mar 21 2013,positive,though it hit boxoffice gold its still underrated on a critical level its script and character development are somehow able to keep up with its fantastic action sequences making it that rare package thats shockingly complete
Mar 21 2013,positive,one of the most satisfying films in recent memory its very rare to see a film with this much hype actually live up to its promise and joss whedon pulled off what many thought was impossible devindra hardawar from the filmcast described this as a miracle movie which is perhaps the most accurate description for this you know that a film like this has done its job well when you actually care about the characters and are enjoying the journey even when a bunch of stuff isnt blowing up
Mar 21 2013,positive,whedon assembles a mighty avengers  in the 1960s marvel comics pioneered mature storylines for its super heroes of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films spiderman  the avengers were a group with individual icons like iron man who had already established identities contrary to the fantastic four and x men  marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters and several years later it has culminated in the avengers a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and marvel its intended audience  as orchestrated by versatile writerdirector and comic book fan joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics its nirvana a comic lovers dream come true  the tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish loki thors half brother  kept for study by shield the elite security agency and once possessed by the red skull in captain america the first avenger the cube can open a doorway to another dimension  when loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth the shield agents are no match for his supernatural powers  what to do  who ya gonna call   well theres nothing like puttin the band together for the first time  assembled by shield director nick fury samuel jackson and aided by agent coulson clark gregg the avengers initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response  these avengers comprise of six extraordinary individuals an otherworldly warrior thor chris hemsworth a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past steve rogers aka captain america chris evans a meek scientist dr bruce banner mark ruffalo and his anger induced gamma radiated monster the hulk inventor tony stark in super armor as iron man robert downey jr and two shield agents master archer hawkeye clint barton jeremy renner and top assassin black widow natasha romanoff scarlett johansson   when lokis legion of soldiers descend on manhattan its avengers assemble time  drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by captain america its teamwork at its finest as the avengers battle these nasty hordes to save the earth     after initially bickering and fighting each other it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness  this film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films but it certainly does not hurt to have seen captain america the first avenger thor iron man and the incredible hulk  whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each heros personal life    we learn some interesting background on romanoff and barton who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax  rogers the honorable idyllic soldier has to adjust to a world like a modern day rip van winkle  dr banner keeps his anger at bay but what will that mean for the avengers if it cant be controlled  whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters eg starks assistant pepper gwyneth paltrow from other the films  all the stars perform ably including tom hiddleston who is appropriately devious as loki  downey who clearly improvised much of his dialogue has a rousing good time jackson embodies fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanity    this is the third movie version of the hulk and while ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted banner his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot  to say more would spoil some hilarious moments  the filmmakers got this hulk right    a couple things dont quite add up like how does the hulk decide to be a dogooder at a critical moment  who is the mysterious council resembling the syndicate from the x files that shield answers to and what are their intentions  there are however nice touches like the stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the avengers  when the grand showdown is imminent there is a marvelous circular shot of the avengers that is iconic      when the evil army attacks one is reminded of ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of superman ii and any transformers film  whedon though never forgets to include intimate moments and details  although each avenger gets a heroic moment to shine the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle  the film is also about self sacrifice and people do perish in this film including a major character    despite a 143 minute running time the film is full of subplots and wellpaced action and every bit of the enormous effects laden budget is on the big screen the avengers is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made the dark knight being the apex but it is the most complete entertaining multihero film to date  the question now is what do you do for an encore and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement  it would require the abilities of a james cameron or peter jackson or maybe studio executives can plead for whedons return  lets hope so do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat
Mar 21 2013,neutral,the first time i watched this movie i really liked it the second time i didnt like it in the end its just okay marvel is so childish its kind of upsetting not a big fan of the goofy jokes and corny characters although i really wanted to be
Mar 21 2013,positive,it was fun but it didnt really do anything that original or spectacular it had the same old joss whedon humor and charm to it it did not have any new action scenes or special effects i hadnt seen before and it seemed to be flawed in its plot it still accomplished its job and satisfied my expectations completely it leaves me wanting more and im excited for more marvel movies
Mar 21 2013,positive,always love a superhero film
Mar 21 2013,positive,with five separate films years of hype and billions of dollars all leading up to this how in the world can director joss whedon satisfy expectations surrounding his new film the avengers easy up the stakes as high as theyll go and pack in as many glory moments as humanly or in thors case godly possible into two and a half hours digging deep into what the avengers has to offer isnt recommended but the film as a whole is recommended unreservedly its full of pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo and some characters are rather disappointingly tossed aside but its impossible to at all dismiss a film as fun and full of energy as this  after the events of thor loki tom hiddleston was exiled from his home on asgard and an allpowerful source of sustainable energy known as the tesseract was in the possession of nick fury samuel l jackson and shield minutes into the avengers loki breaks into shield headquarters to steal the cube of energy and in the process he brainwashes and escapes with erik selvig stellan skarsgard and hawkeye jeremy renner  the destruction left by lokiand the threat of worse things to comeleads fury and company to give the avengers initiative another shot agent coulson clark gregg tracks down tony stark robert downey jr at the newly renovated stark towers while the black widow scarlett johannson heads to india to find dr bruce banner mark ruffalo captain steve rogers chris evans meanwhile lives under guard of shield after the events of captain america and thor descends from asgard not long after learning about the trouble his brother has caused loki is soon captured but the avengers challenges are only just beginning their egos are constantly getting in the way of their mission which remains a little mysterious and its unclear whether iron man the hulk thor and cap will stop fighting with one another in time to start fighting their common enemies  its funny how much setup is needed for a film that already required hours and hours of setup and the deeper the avengers goes into the tesseract and gamma radiation and thermohydronuclearmicro fusionism particles and all other sorts of nonsense the more likely you are to jump off the wagon my philosophy if you cant explain a concept with a fivewordorless analogy it doesnt belong in a film the avengers breaks this principle a lot i feared whedon had lost me several times but each and every time the film felt in dire need of a jolt it breathlessly delivered the sets are massive and the enemy is surprisingly strong whats most exciting however is the fact that no one character seems more powerful than the others when thor and captain america and iron man all fight you dont know wholl come out on top  nothing however comes close to the incredible final act which throws everything at you plus the kitchen sink and a few giant armored space caterpillars for good measure all the films flaws go out the window as we learn exactly why these superheroes are so super theres something special and exciting about seeing characters like these become vulnerable but perhaps just as exciting is heroism in its truest form which is what we have here the six individuals featured in the avengers are flawed but thats not what this movie is about its about them rising to the ultimate challenge and performing at the peak of their powers and about five minutes into this magnificent final sequence its clear heroes in movies have never quite been this super  there was a ton of concern leading up to the avengers at least from me that characters wouldnt get their due particularly that the film would essentially turn into an unofficial iron man 3 it happens to a certain degree tony stark is the star of the show and downey is probably the best hes ever been in the role but plenty of others get their due my own personal favorite character was mark ruffalos hulk throughout the film his powers are only talked about in a very fearful way but ruffalo imbues bruce banner with his trademark style of lowkey humor and when he finally goes green he smashes like eric bana and edward norton never did  almost as good and just as pleasantly surprising is scarlet johannson whose black widow isnt nearly as superfluous here as she was in iron man 2 the actress isnt quite revelatory but its definitely one of her better performances over the last few years and shes a welcome addition to this gang rather than an unnecessary distraction  so three great performances and characters so far is good unfortunately the remaining trio of heroes doesnt quite measure up thor and captain america are merely adequate the former shows up late in the game while the latter is hurt by some of his physical limitations hes strong but not as capable of amazing feats as his fellow avengers neither is nearly as bad as hawkeye whos completely wasted jeremy renner is merely ok but i blame whedon more for what happens to him its a shame  the film obviously cost a ton to make but its all there on screen the score is terrific and the camerawork is sensational overall its an extremely wellmade motion picture that works in spite of its many flaws because its just so damn entertaining so heres your bar summer of 2012 lets see if you can clear it  
Mar 21 2013,positive,a great sci fy film that lives up to its potential from the first marvel films in 2007 and 2009 this is comedic heartwarming and epic
Mar 21 2013,positive,even with the incredibly annoyingly stupidly dumb moments you expect this is such fun you feel like youve just seen a brilliant movie at the end of it
Mar 21 2013,positive,one of my all time favorite movies
Mar 20 2013,negative,loud mindless action so thoughtless i actually forgot what they were trying to accomplish during certain points of the film this will probably be the most overrated movie that i will ever see
Mar 20 2013,positive,i loved it and it was so easy to watch no boring parts
Mar 20 2013,positive,this is a real slow burner but when it finally kicks into life packs a big punch the closing battle scene is right up there with the best of any comic book yarn and is well worth the admission price alone the comedy between characters entertains throughout with downey jnr as always at the forefront however the surprising star of the show is one large often angry green monster puny god
Mar 20 2013,positive,cant wait to see avengers 2
Mar 20 2013,positive,considering the huge budget this is a loki film
Mar 20 2013,positive,great super hero movie kant wait for the 2nd one to come out
Mar 19 2013,positive,a childhood dream come true well done
Mar 19 2013,positive,visually bright well acted and presented director successfully brings all these superheros in a single movie keeping every single ones own importance
Mar 19 2013,positive,what can i say its awesome
Mar 19 2013,negative,this was one of the most boring super hero films ive ever seen  each hero is just a caricature of themselves from previous films to the effect of boring recycled dialog  how this film scores above a 90 on rt is beyond me
Mar 18 2013,positive,even better than i thought itd be the introduction of loki in the beginning was fastpaced and exciting then it slowed down quite a bit into a wellacted drama more good action and then slow drama again finally the last quarter was actionpacked the movie gives all heros involved good time to shine and neglects none of them i was totally sold at loki being a very credible villain even more than he was in the movie thor
Mar 18 2013,positive,im not a comic guy but this was a pretty good movie i loved the character interaction the action was forgettable and cliched and the story was silly but i guess this was a comic book movie adaptation or whatever stupid big dumb ending
Mar 18 2013,positive,this film was expected since 2008 with the movie hulk movie more or less since marvel has promised the film the avengers the famous group of super heroes basically the justice league marvel then came the movies iron man 2008great iron man 2 2009good thor 2010good captain america 2011very good and finally in 2012 came the expected and exceeded all expectations a film that brought together four powerful super heroes and 2 that appeared in the movie iron man 2 and thor with all the elements of a superhero film and who directs it all joss weedon nerddirector best direction for a superhero film there its not except for nolan the dark knight he took the heroes and their bds took manhattan the stage of all superhero movies and with a little touch of realism and pum  the avengers born managed to put together a fantastic action die laughing humor and even a bit of emotion and the most impressive are the heroes all were perfect in their roles and each had their moment in the film it didnt had a main character all leading heroes in the film are for example when iron man appears it is all about him when hulk appears everything it is about him and thats with all the characters but to understand the story better its kind of mandatory watch the other films that i mentioned earlier but you can see the same movie and love it completely after the dark knight trilogy the avengers is the best superhero film ever made
Mar 18 2013,positive,a fantastic movie great acting mindblowing action scenarios  a great story this movie is a comic books fans dream come to life a must see for all comic book fans
Mar 18 2013,positive,my rating is more based on preference than anything else because this really isnt my kind of movie it was tooactiony and i wasnt even close to tears at any part of the film i think loki should have gotten more screentime and more focus on his personal struggle
Mar 17 2013,positive,the avengers was extremely built up but fell a little flat only giving some action and a decent story
Mar 17 2013,negative,to be honest i think this is the most overrated superhero movie of all time didnt like it and i personally love superheroes
Mar 17 2013,positive,it didnt live up to its hype for me but having said that it was entertaining enough
Mar 17 2013,negative,over hypedlong and boringvery disappointedm
Mar 17 2013,positive,the avengers is one of the rare superhero team movies that truly work amazingly
Mar 17 2013,positive,fun for the kids nice special effects not my cup of joe but my girl loved it
Mar 17 2013,positive,a very good movie that kept my eyes fixed on the tv
Mar 17 2013,positive,flying invisible aircraft carriers fuck yeah
Mar 17 2013,positive,this movie kicked arse i loved it
Mar 16 2013,positive,this movie is a movie
Mar 16 2013,positive,a good action flick but the comedy ruined it
Mar 16 2013,positive,even now i can hardly believe this movie exists the first 45 minutes is slow and the plot itself is silly fluff but few genrestorytellers can craft compelling relationships like joss whedon and thats really what makes the film work scarlet johannson is the stand out and more downey jr as tony stark is never a bad thing this is also the best screen version of the hulk since the bill bixby days the script bubbles with delightful dialogue and hilarious moments of inverted expectations they seriously pulled it off a joy
Mar 16 2013,negative,the goofiest heroes with exception of hulk and iron man ever united at last little to no interaction between characters an alien invasion that doesnt makes any sense typical joss whedon direction
Mar 16 2013,positive,awesome movie if you like marval comics you going to love this one
Mar 16 2013,positive,behind the dark knight this is the best superhero movie i have seen
Mar 15 2013,positive,best superhero movieperiod
Mar 15 2013,positive,a film that has no delusions of grandeur the avengers is a film in which charismatic leads take part in largescale and welldesigned battles while making selfaware quips in many ways chick flick of the year
Mar 15 2013,neutral,a lot of money put into this movie for a predictable story with big name actors big name comic characters etc  it was just okay  the one highlight was the hulk not ruffalo i think norton did a way better job  just an okay movie really
Mar 15 2013,positive,this is truely one of the best films of the year bar none action special effects and the acting wasnt bad either so this true hits the mark  1010  but then theres the expenderbles 2 to come yet
Mar 14 2013,positive,a hit way out of the ball park
Mar 14 2013,positive,the hulk was the man in this movie
Mar 14 2013,positive,i love this movie it was so much fun to watch
Mar 14 2013,positive,this movie just worked the writers obviously knew the comic books well and the actors took their roles seriously but not too seriously the special effects were awesome the tags at the end cracked me up the first one because i recognized the villain and the second because it was such a departure from the usual nick fury invites the hero to join the avengers
Mar 13 2013,positive,absolutely awesome i cant wait for the reassembly in avengers 2
Mar 13 2013,negative,a special effects orgy that drags on for two hours and change with little internal plot or character consistency i rate it as high as i do purely on the strength of the cgi adults who read comic books will probably like this splashy colorful violent movie personally i think adults who read comic books are retards  and so am i for ordering this one in the first place
Mar 13 2013,positive,some of the most entertaining action and fight scenes youll ever see in a superhero movie great film
Mar 12 2013,positive,the best superhero movie ive ever seen
Mar 12 2013,positive,everything was just perfect
Mar 12 2013,positive,deftly balancing a large roster of iconic characters without skimping on story or action whedon proves to be the perfect choice to close out the first phase of the marvel cinematic universe and usher in the second
Mar 12 2013,positive,the perfect superhero movie i cant think of any other words to describe it
Mar 12 2013,positive,amazing best movie this year
Mar 12 2013,negative,highly overrated and far too long for what is a paperthin story the avengers tries far too hard to be the best actionsuperhero film of all time but just seems to be a ride where they show off outdated special effects if youve already seen any comic book movie youre getting nothing here besides hulks return to the big screen which is highly satisfying to say the least mark ruffalo is amazing as bruce banner and i look forward to him in far better films than this disappointing action flick
Mar 11 2013,positive,most rewatchable film ever love it
Mar 11 2013,positive,the avengers is visually stunning to add so many superheroes from their previous movie outings from the marvel franchise is very challenging it was either doomed for failure or guarenteed success and thankfully it was explosive entertaining and arguably one of the best superhero outings in recent years downey jnr and ruffalo deliever stand out performances as the iron man and hulk respectively but the others in the all star cast also impress to the highest standard it looks too much and it has too many superheroes recruited and its hard to see who was given more screen time there were a few spots i thought everyone was too over crowded but they overcome that by keeping the audience entertained giving their audiences favourite hero a special moment for each one with a huge spectacle special effects were dazzling and well put together the avengers was challenging but extremely good
Mar 11 2013,positive,probably warrants a higher rating but fuck it i aint no comic bitchnigganerd
Mar 10 2013,positive,a kickass super hero movie
Mar 10 2013,positive,i really dont get the hype over this it was okay i guess i just dont get it
Mar 9 2013,positive,totally awesome sure weve all seen ny attacked in an epic battle countless times it feels like but whatever incredible bunch of characters a laugh a minute for me this is a very much unforgettable movie and is one of my top 10 favorites ever go marvel
Mar 8 2013,positive,in a film where every superheros emotions and feelings are portrayed not one character being ignored when it matters the most and a satisfying rush of some kickass superhero action the avengers definitely proves that it was well worth the hype
Mar 8 2013,positive,had a good amount of action and exceeded my expectations thumbs up d
Mar 8 2013,neutral,i dont understand the hype with this i thought it was cliched predictable and formulaic there wasnt a satisfying resolution
Mar 7 2013,positive,avengers assembled flawlessly wow smart actionpacked witty and immensely entertaining as one of the best marvel films ever made and this is the third highestgrossing box office hit of all time for good reason director joss whedon takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history the avengers iron mantony stark robert downey jr captain americasteve rogers chris evans thor chris hemsworth hulkbruce banner mark ruffalo black widownatasha romanoff scarlett johansson and hawkeyeclint barton jeremy renner as assembled by nick fury whedons scripts usually include clever banter gripping action sequences and an air of mystery and the avengers is no different whedon has an utter love for comic books and it is proudly put on display in the avengers  at a runningtime of 2 and half hours the avengers is well paced and time flies by the effects are topnotch the acting is very good and the script drives the movie elevating its strengths i see the new hulk is awesome in cg motion capture better than the incredible hulk and hulk  my allthetime favourite scene is the avengers fight loki tom hiddleston and his chitauri aliens from space armies in defense of new york city for half hour
Mar 7 2013,positive,a zenith of superhero movies propelling marvels juggernauts the climax of the previous five films looking forward to iron man 3 thor 2 captain america 2 guardians of the galaxy and avengers 2
Mar 7 2013,positive,im not even a comic book movie fan and i enjoyed the hell out of avengers  
Mar 7 2013,positive,love this movie watching it right now
Mar 6 2013,positive,this movie is awesome
Mar 6 2013,positive,i dont care how silly it is it is amazing
Mar 6 2013,positive,favorite part by far was when the hulk whipped loki around like a ragdoll
Mar 5 2013,positive,the perfect superhero movie a lot of action nice performance from all the actors and excellent special effects well done great 3d
Mar 4 2013,positive,the greatest superhero movie of all time and my favorite superhero movie
Mar 3 2013,positive,the best of the best in popcorn action flicks but a lot more enjoyable if youre a longtime fan of the superheros that appear on the screen  i had little previous knowledge or investment in them so seeing them all interact and fight side by side didnt excite me as much as it could have
Mar 3 2013,positive,loved it best superhero movie ever
Mar 3 2013,positive,this movie was aweinspiring to me the conflicting personalities of all of the characters could have been too tough to handle for this film but joss whedon proved to me that he could handle nearly everything thrown at him the action was engrossing the final battle positively epic and it only left me feeling completely satisfied and elated it was absolute magic in the theater and didnt lose its luster when viewed at home a truly remarkable film
Mar 3 2013,positive,i have mixed feelings about this film or rather about the genre it belongs to dont get me wrong  i had a great deal of fun watching this  whedon is very good at ensemble set pieces including how to weave good turning points and of course witty dialogue as well as little charming moments that just light up the film like few directors can thing is  its also the avengers complete with macguffin and epicbattletosavetheworldagainstintergalaticsuperbeings which i never liked in the comic books to begin with  i prefered spider man a local hero with very relateable issues which is super epic spectacle and escapism but to me a not very interesting story i lay none of that at whedons feet mind you  he  does the best anyone possibly can with this material even so id prefer movies like the dark knight or xmen first class
Mar 3 2013,positive,thats probably the best marvel movie and one of the best superheroes movie ever a movie that will keep you watching it and wanting more of it good stuff
Mar 3 2013,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever simply pulled of by great characters all of the plot comes from character based motivations and thats why the story is so good and after a long while we get rewarded with a juicy battle scene and enough humour
Mar 3 2013,positive,pure action  i love seeing the comic book heroes that i loved as a kid come to life on the big screen  ive been waiting for this for a very long time  now dc comics should follow  they should start with wonder woman  see how that works
Mar 2 2013,positive,the best comic book movie ever and probably one of the best movies ever so why are you reading this review and not watching this movie
Mar 2 2013,positive,absolutely loved it plenty of action and loved the hulk he took no prisoners so to speak
Mar 2 2013,negative,i couldnt even force myself to like this movie i hated almost every second that i had to watch it i still cannot believe that so many people thought that this movie was great the script was unbearably boring and the acting was nearly as bad also having an action sequence for a half an hour and then having no important things happen in it is a massive waste of onscreen time this movie should not be thought of as a good movie by anyones standards
Mar 1 2013,positive,all of them are cool
Mar 1 2013,positive,the best superhero move
Mar 1 2013,neutral,finally got around to seeing this and i am stunned by all the love its a pretty standard comic book flick with some trademark josh whedon fireflylike humor final battle scenes felt endless good performances from downey jr and johannson dont make the pretty weak storyline any more compelling  no where near as good as ironman
Mar 1 2013,positive,a masterpiece and one of the greatest superhero movies and one of the greatest movies of all time  period  it would be a crime to rate this movie lower than five stars
Mar 1 2013,positive,this movie was heller good
Feb 27 2013,negative,horrible and unmemorable amazingly stupid plot with weak battle scenes and a pathetic resolution i was expecting so much more from this debut film disappointed
Feb 27 2013,positive,the best action movie by far
Feb 26 2013,positive,ehh i dont see what all the hype is about to be honest
Feb 26 2013,positive,i love this movie so much
Feb 26 2013,positive,awesome movie best in a very long time
Feb 25 2013,positive,the best superhero movie i have ever seen by far
Feb 25 2013,positive,maybe one of the best movies i ever saw
Feb 25 2013,positive,the perfect superhero flick joss whedon did an awesome job directing on a bigger scale than ever before
Feb 25 2013,negative,the only thing that marvels the avengers uses to work is its great visual effects and its several oneliners however this isnt enough to build an interesting story nor a relationship between the characters and the viewers it simply doesnt stand on its own
Feb 25 2013,positive,great fast pace movie
Feb 25 2013,positive,a film that weve been dying to see ever since comic book fanatics first read the justice league back in 1960only marvel were able to put together their superhero teamup film before dc  and to devastating effect  the build up to the film via the preceding iron man thor hulk etc film was done particularly well  the film itself was everything comic book fans have wanted for so long and marvel duly delivered
Feb 24 2013,positive,hulk inexplicably was able to control his rage and talk
Feb 24 2013,positive,i am a comic geekbut i love movies more this movie combines both into one very entertaining movie based on the comic book of the ultimates a retelling of the avengers updated and how many individual heroes combine to make a superteam to save the world it combines excellent story telling just as accurate as iron man captain america thor and hulk some comic relief just enough for a few laughs without looking too funny and action that will please any movie goer  you do not have to be a fan to see this movie but you may be a fan of comic book movies after this
Feb 24 2013,positive,pretty awesome better than expected but the individual stories have a better setting hoping for a justice league movie d
Feb 24 2013,positive,tough to rise up to the hype but the sum is not greater than the parts still better than most comic book flicks
Feb 24 2013,positive,one of my favorite superhero movies ever
Feb 24 2013,positive,decent enough graphically awesome  plot basic but entertaining enough would have like more hulk but thats just because hes a personal fav as expected downey jr iron man makes the cast gel in a good performance again number 2 should be good
Feb 23 2013,positive,the best part of this movie was the interaction of the different personalities which makes these characters believable  add the humor and action makes this a mustsee movie
Feb 23 2013,positive,one badass superhero extravaganza  the special effects in this movie were amazing fight scenes spot on a must watch even if your not into comics its a fun movie to watch
Feb 23 2013,negative,warning controversial reviewdo not read if you are easily offended    ah marvels the avengers a universally loved film that contains the worlds favorite superheroes fighting as a unit again an alien onslaught on paper this sounds like a blast but the final productand i mean a product is incredibly flawed and surprisingly tedious     the film opens sloppily with a poorly shot action sequence after lokithe most overrated movie villain ever steals the teseractdont know if thats spelled right but i dont really care and escapes shields headquarters after it blows up due to the teseracts power the teseract instantly reminded of the allspark from transformers which this film borrows heavily from yet transformers gets shit on and this steaming turd gets all kinds of praise from both critics and audiences  the first transformers is solid dumb fun and is way more entertaining than this     the rest of the action in this film is unexciting and dull because we know nothing will ever happen to any of these characters hell the one characters that does die came back for marvels shitty tv show avengers is a live action cartoon and the characters are in no danger because marvel wouldnt dare kill off any of their heroes because  they are all about fan service and trying to please the mass comic book reading populace joss whedon takes zero risks with this film and it might as well been sold as a family film its so sanitized clean and safe that its fucking boring and the poor unfunny writing doesnt help things captain americas dialogue was pitifulson just dont i was also annoyed by the blatant product placement it reminded me i was watching a product used to sell more comics and toys and also southwest airlines flights    since i gave it a 410 ill give you some pros the acting was fine the visual effects were great and the action sequence on the aircraft has moments of mild awesomeness i also found the hulk smashing loki amusing but thats really all the rest of the film lacks real tension and the film isnt very involving like i said i never felt fear that any of these characters would die and if they did theyd just return in a sequel or a tv show    final score 410
Feb 23 2013,positive,very entertaining i love seeing the comics brought to life
Feb 23 2013,positive,dammit joss whedon you go girl
Feb 23 2013,positive,entertaining needs a sequel
Feb 23 2013,positive,very well made entertainment but hollow at its core plus the villain was such a pussy and generic great action and direction but got sick of the one liners spouting from every direction joss whedon is a great writer but i felt the script was battle of the one liners
Feb 23 2013,positive,second only to the dark knight
Feb 23 2013,positive,very cool really liked the characters esp iron man hawkeye and hulk
Feb 22 2013,positive,not being into the whole superhero genre still found this pretty good although i think id rather have bill bixby with me in a tight spot ahead of bow  arrow man
Feb 22 2013,positive,the highlights here include the snappy witty script the interplay between the characters and hiddlestone as loki who should have been given a much larger part in the proceedings the assemblage largely seems to happen because this film was going to be a massive hit and thats what takes the shine off the final fight scene may have looked nice but the realism in three mortal characters the captain bw and hawkeye surviving could only happen in a comic book im not particularly frightened of alien invaders whose ships are destroyed by lightning good fun all the same
Feb 22 2013,positive,a brilliant film with stunning visuals and a nice blend of all good super hero movies my only criticism would be that it is slightly underwhelming despite all the hype still a good film with a good cast though
Feb 22 2013,positive,a real fun time but like most of the marvel movies pretty shallow
Feb 22 2013,positive,well performed and well acted movie cant wait for the a2 perfect timing for one liners
Feb 22 2013,positive,i think this is the best film ive ever seen
Feb 21 2013,positive,it was a good film good action good dialogue and comedy but what made me give a low rating is they argued more then work together and the ending sucked for the film thats why i hope the second is better
Feb 21 2013,positive,went a little over the silly line at points but bloody good film must watch
Feb 21 2013,positive,what a movie i am not a comicbooks fan at all i dont know captain america thor or even hulk i thought hes that wrestler named hulk hogan or so anyways this one was watchable dialogues and most of the scenes were as dumb as the plot itself so those couple of witty moments and quips are appreciated i might regret not watching this one of a large screen because with hd quality movie the effects might have been astonishing the ship was monstrous as cool as the arch in 2012 movie and those flying armoured fish with incredible movements awesome  i guess 35 out of five
Feb 21 2013,positive,awesome enough said
Feb 20 2013,positive,the ultimate superhero movie  the chemistry of all the stars make it even better than most movies that mix stars
Feb 20 2013,positive,shiny speedy and as slick and deep as glossy paper
Feb 20 2013,positive,suffers a little from the transformers syndrome of destroy the city but very funny and enjoyable
Feb 20 2013,positive,wow another masterwork mastercraft so much fun the ending was absolutely flooring with wit humor effects action and aliens i loved how they focused on 9 or so characters and they all had 10 minutes to shine i could never make a movie like this as it was full of cgi mostly the hulk which was very fun to watch just a brilliant real superman movie for adults
Feb 20 2013,positive,for a while i though this movie wasnt going to work but after watching this movie it was entertaining from start to finish i would rank this in top five best marvel superhero movies
Feb 20 2013,positive,saw it in theaters great movie the dvd released and ive seen this movie so many times that i hate it but i do recommend it
Feb 20 2013,positive,the first comic book movie that actually made me fee like i was watching a comic book if that makes sense
Feb 19 2013,positive,great story and action  all actors wored well together
Feb 19 2013,positive,for a marvel and hollywood action typical lovers
Feb 19 2013,positive,finally the superhero movie everyone waited for marvels the avengers is fantastic amazing beautiful and packed with everything a superhero movie needs there were 5 marvel movies of these four fantastic superheroes iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger joss whedon brings all of them together to make this fantastic movie when thors brother loki threatens to destroy the world and all of humanity nick fury head of shield brings earths mightiest heroes together to save the world let the biggest superhero battle begin the avengers is a great movie that deserved more oscar nominees than just one
Feb 18 2013,positive,pretty much delivers on all summerblockbuster fronts  a good touch of character and story with some sweet action sequences  nothing more you could want as a fan of superhero movies
Feb 18 2013,positive,i loved this film i didnt manage to watch it in cinema but really enjoyed it on my 60 inch flatscreen led at home characters were amazing and story was simple but effective no complex rubbish
Feb 18 2013,negative,probably one of the most overrated movies i have ever seen this superhero movie is horribly written from the script to the characters too many heroes that they dont go in depth about their story
Feb 18 2013,positive,this is what cinema and tv is made for pure entertainment from beginning to end spoiler hulk steals the show
Feb 18 2013,negative,what a load of pants poor plot acting and boring i know it is a comic strip film but compared to the nolan batman trilogy this film was slapstick unrealistic and not very entertaining
Feb 17 2013,positive,awesome movie for kids and adult
Feb 17 2013,positive,love you wanting more very action pack but the storyline needed more indepth interaction and less action so i give it four stars because the action is very good but not great enough
Feb 17 2013,positive,at 16 this was officially my favourite movie will always remember this film as it delivers thrills classic performances hilarious gags and jaw dropping action dream come true seeing the superheroes share the screen together for the first time the last 45 mins is awesome brilliantly written  directed by joss whedon too
Feb 17 2013,positive,plot line is a little weak but the characters and actors are incredible and joss whedons directing is superb as always whedon has a talent for taking disparate characters and weaving them together to make a strong cast
Feb 17 2013,neutral,i spaced out about 50 times throughout the movie id be lying if i said that it captivated me some likable characters still i didnt do it for me boring
Feb 17 2013,positive,this movie was really fun to see with its incredible special features but it packed good story development either way it was fun to see though i would still recommend the movie despite its one flaw
Feb 17 2013,positive,joss whedons witty script and enjoyable set pieces enable the film to stand out from other superhero movies that are clearly the products of soulless production companies
Feb 17 2013,positive,this was one of the greatest movies experiences i have ever hadthis is what the art of film is all about
Feb 16 2013,positive,not a big fan of comic book movies but i really enjoyed this one would love to see all the other movies now with their individual stories the action was awesome and the story was pretty good
Feb 16 2013,positive,awesome  the best of the actionsuperhero genre
Feb 16 2013,positive,hulk and thor nuff said 
Feb 16 2013,positive,an entertaining action flick with great oneliners and great fun for all
Feb 16 2013,positive,if youre gonna make people wait then you better make it damned good  this is good around five years in the making starting with iron man in 2008  concluding with captain america in 2011 we eventually get to where it was all heading  the creation of the avengers the film does have its flaws tony stark being one of them although stark is an egotistical narcissistic billionaire he did have that air of vulnerability about him after his near death experience coupled with a wicked sense of humour which made him a loveable character sadly it seems his new arc technology has cranked up his annoyance levels to astronomical terms  quite frankly his role in this movie seemed to be self motivated  it had to be about him in fairness the testosterone levels are oozing out of the screen as each hero tries to exert his manliness in what can be best described as a dick shaking contest the humour throughout the movie is great with possibly the best saved for the hulk involving loki another flaw is its a bit of a slow burner before the main dish is served up in the last third of the movie there are some snippets of action but as ive mentioned before  it was more about who was stronger than each other as each hero argued amongst themselves a good thing about the movie was it felt like a montage of each heroes movies as each hero was given a fair share of screen time before finally putting differences aside to save the world from an alien invasion  loki has gathered an army to take over the earth  finally realises his dream of ruling after his failed attempt of ruling asgard fell to the wayside after finally getting his hands on the tesseract he can open up a worm hole to let his army through  take over the planet sadly for loki a group of heroes brought together by the secret organisation shield stand in his way to world domination sadly for the world this group called the avengers initiative was disbanded due to the dangers each member could bring upon the planet but nick fury has other plans  tries to bring our superheroes together again in a bid to save the planet after a few teething problems each hero finally gets together to save the day  we get a battle reminiscent of the transformers movies as the city in question becomes a battle ground
Feb 15 2013,positive,awesome movie cant wait for a second avengers movie 
Feb 15 2013,positive,kickass movie bought it on blueray
Feb 15 2013,positive,enjoyedbut almost too many heroes to follow and each trying to get screen time it seemedbut still liked the story and action
Feb 15 2013,neutral,it will take many years to find out if superheroes are genuinely todays greek gods or if they are cheap imitations that will be laughed at a few generations later watchmen the novel and the batman animated series make impressive cases that perhaps superheroes actually deserve to be placed among high art that will be remembered for centuries the avengers does not   yes it is by no means terrible whedon who joins christopher nolan as one of the most overrated directors working in hollywood still keeps an eye on his characters throughout the overbudgeted spectacle it is also pleasantly surprising that in an age where blockbusters are taking the michael bay tactic of beginning with half an hour of exposition and the rest of the film being an overlong climax  the avengers has a consistent threeact structure its a shame this is the only thing whedon remembers from his scriptwriting lessons   the plot is the most underwhelming one can get it still shocks me that in 2012 there are major films that still without a shred of irony centre their plots entirely around a maguffin we hardly see a glance of the villains until the finale so we are not threatened by them in any way in star wars there was always the shadow of the empire looming over everything out heroes did also despite star wars having a simple plot it had enough twists and turns to make our heroes go through character arcs the avengers attempts this with a will they work together or not dilemma  which is immediately spoiled by films poster   buts its fun everyone says just turn your brain off and enjoy it   no to turn off your brain is to stop caring if you dont think about what you see then you become a mindless drone who doesnt observe anything see ed norton slumped halfasleep in front of the tv at the start of fight club that is you if you turn your brain off   in such films as xmen first class and the amazing spiderman i actually began to sweat i cared about the heroes and i felt the threat the fictional universe was feeling i did not feel this in the avengers the explosions are all very impressive but i suddenly realised that i did not care at all i had no idea who the villains were loki is defeated within the first act thus he is absolutely no threat to anyone and the superheroes are all ridiculously overpowered thor shrugs off a stab in the abdomen but since hes basically a god he is indestructible the hulk is showered with bullets but treats it literally like water on a ducks beak and the other characters seem to hardly break a sweat the only person to actually sustain an injury is iron man  and this is after the battle   in the amazing spiderman  peter actually gets injured and is forced to carry on with the third act barely concious things look as though they will fail yet spiderman triumphs against the odds at absolutely no point in the avengers does it seem as though our heroes may actually fail  which is something even the most basic films have a child writing harry potter fanfiction would include a moment when it seems like harrys day might go wrong   this is a thoroughly overrated affair that fails its only promise to deliver satisfying action i simply did not care about anything occurring  which is a shame since i like these superheroes they are cool theyre powers are cool i want to be these people so its the mark of a particularly bad filmmaker when you make me bored by these godlike entities
Feb 15 2013,positive,it has a wellwritten script combining most of marvel superheroes in one film is an amazing idea which led the movie to be amazing the best of the move is its visual effects they are totally awesome and dazzling with the release of almost 7 marvel movies excluding this and the planned release  guardians of the galaxy avengers 2 captain america 2 thor 2 and antman i dont think that any will top this if the godfather is the king of classic movies i can say that this is the king of superhero movies  along with tdk  a mustwatch
Feb 14 2013,negative,this movie is terrible a complete mess with a subpar foe  it takes iron man 45 minutes to fix a turbine which was his toughest opponent in the film ridiculous  too much going on too cheesy mark ruffalo doesnt work as the hulk blah blah blah  i could go on for as long as it took iron man to fix that damn turbine blade here with examples of terrible movie making but to avoid sounding like the teacher from peanuts ill end my rant here
Feb 14 2013,positive,ok for all those superhero fans heres the cast plan and simple ironman hulk thor you want action here they are because i can barely understand thor and he is powered down in this film he doesnt leave as much impact as the other two ironman is such a smartass and i love it banner even when human is a great character ah fuck it i want to see hulk smash and honestly who gives a crap about the others why the hell does captain america exist his very character is so bland and so useless in combat spoiler a single gunman almost kills him you do not get overwelmed by a single mook captain america was made to be us propoganda and he fails misrabley at that his appearance in the movie makes merica look weak if black widow was replaced by catwoman it wouldnt really change anything except catwoman at least is a fun character hawkeye green arrow ripoff and nothing more demoman no one cares finally loki is an interesting villain though i wish i knew exactly what his powers are because he almost kills thor in one scene and is pwned by the hulk in the next more hammier than the dark knight series more of an action flick than a serious film
Feb 14 2013,positive,after 5 years the ultimate idea for a superhero movie payed off with the third best superhero movie ever
Feb 14 2013,positive,easily one of my all time favourite films fantastic cast great story the action will in no way disappoint anyone all the characters get their well deserved face time revealing their strong personalities which in turn make for hilarious situations between characters i cant wait for the sequel to come out
Feb 13 2013,positive,amazing movie with great comedy
Feb 13 2013,positive,tony stark you really have got a lid on it havent you whats your secret mellow jazz bongo drums huge bag of weed   so i finally got around to seeing one of the more hyped films in recent memory i purposely didnt go see the avengers when it was first released because the hype was so huge i honestly didnt think it would live up to all of it im glad to say i was wrong ive never been the biggest marvel film fan the hulks were nothing special i thought thor sucked captain america was pretty good iron man was the best of them and a great movie but the second one was a big step down put all those guys together give it a huge budget an allstar cast and amazing effects and you have something though   this movie was huge huge massive epic aweinspiring the movie looked great sounded great and most important of all was great it started a little slow for me but with each scene the movie just picked up momentum and kept getting better and better   im not going to say this is the best superhero movie ever because in my opinion it just isnt id take the original superman the nolan trilogy and iron man over this in those regards but that isnt saying i dont completely respect this movie for what it is this movie had so much going on it didnt just have a focus on one superhero versus a villain or two it had to put emphasis on a large amount of characters and it did so rather impressively from bruce bannerthe hulk who i thought was the best character in this film to scarlett johanssons sexy spy all the characters were given just treatment and the character interplay is what made this film as good as it is  so if youre one of the very few people who have not seen this yet do so its definitely another move in the right direction for the superhero films im extremely excited about the sequel and if they dont go to far away from what made this one so good i could see that one even being potentially better only time will tell though and hopefully this will give dc the push it needs to put out a justice league movie although i dont see them touching this quality with that
Feb 12 2013,positive,lots of superhero fun  some say it is a little long but i disagree completely all the worlds greatest heroes had ample screen time  only real negative is the bad armies aim
Feb 12 2013,positive,just as good as i was expected its a mixture of comedy and action what could be more fun than that each character stands out and no one is left behind but there is always the top character in the movie iron man ladies and gentlemen i love to see small jokes that the characters make even when in a serious situation i have to tell you this i love captain america hes a true soldier and no one can deny his wise orders unfortunately the cut scenes are only available on dvd you can find it on youtube some of the scenes are connected with whats going on in the big screen must watch movie
Feb 11 2013,positive,so good want to be a second one
Feb 11 2013,positive,the avengers avengers assemble in uk and ireland pits together the protagonists of marvels properties  iron man downey jr captain america evans thor hemsworth and the hulk ruffalo in an optimistic neverbeforeseen or attempted ensemble the reasoning behind this get together the god of mischief hiddleston has set his sights on earth with an extraterrestrial army at his disposal and earths peacekeeping organisation shield simply cant contain the situation without major help why did it take 50 years for this film to be made    the film starts with the threat loki gathering his army from an unknown benefactor and readying himself to once and for all take his brother down oh and to conquer our little blue planet nick fury jackson doesnt like this not one bit important side note the interesting thing about the avengers and part of the reason its so successful is that its part of a much bigger story this is correctly referred to as the marvel cinematic universe it has five yes five prequels that lead up to the avengers this has made us love the characters before weve even seen the in a group dynamic back on track being the director of the worlds most secretive and powerful organisation he has contacts each of these being superpowered well not all of them heroes that come in all shapes and sizes being a huge comic book fan just seeing these guys in the same room gave me goose bumps shields top agents black widow johansson and hawkeye rennercome along to join the fight to only for one of them to be turned into a bad guy kill loads of his colleagues and give the bad guy the object he was earlier hiding from the forces of evil     delaying the assembley starks selfishness and arrogance annoys and pushes apart everyone maybe even more than loki does caps goody goody oldfashionedness doesnt impress anyone except coulson gregg thors sleeveless pointbreak appearance is nowhere near as impressive as it is in his own film black widow and hawkeyes vague yet uninteresting relationship bores the hell out of you and the hulk the hulk is the best thing about this film when i heard that mark ruffalo was cast as bruce banner i was a little skeptical to say the least the incredible hulk was okay and i do quite like edward norton however i seemed to like norton a lot more when i heard ruffalo got the handmedown part lets just say i was prepared for the worst another recasting however his performace was absolutely perfect as the nervous as for a good reason brilliant scientist bruce banner you can see that the hulk has turned him into a ever so slightly bitter man especially when you have tony stark poking you with sharp objects trying to get you to hulkout as banner you cant help but feel for him but as the hulk you cant help but laugh at his humour other actors whose performace deserves a mention tom hiddleston a cold calculating and interesting villain clark gregg fan favourite coulson robert downey jr oh he does play well with others who knew     the chemistry of these fine actors is bliss to watch when they finally come together the story is great the vision of geekfavourite director joss whedon is a pleasure to witness this is what i say to those who said this film is too overcrowdedits not crowded enough     with 6 future films announced and well underway this optimistic yet fascinating story is no where near ending and being a comic book fan im hugely proud to be a part of it the avengers is a brilliant flick for everyone now im off to watch it again     pros  the tonybruce bromance  the natural feel of the group dynamic  the little easter eggs for those who were really watching  hulksmash    cons  not once did anyone say avengers assemble  thors helmet looked awesome in his solo movie where is it  same for caps uniform the first avengers combatinfluenced outfit is miles better   the way all the chitauri died phantom menace style   banners sudden control over his anger although it was a sweet scene    recommendations for further enjoyment  watch all of the mcu films in order research all of their easter eggs if you cant find the all and then finally watch avengers again i guarentee youll enjoy it even more the second time
Feb 11 2013,negative,to much going on mark ruffalo is the only thing thats amazing
Feb 10 2013,positive,best comic book movie ever
Feb 10 2013,negative,very disappointing nothing special here and kept reminding me of other similar movies
Feb 10 2013,negative,i hate this film its so overrated
Feb 10 2013,positive,i think this is one of the greatest movies ever made this is one of those movies i could watch 100 times and never get tired of it its one of my favorite movies ever its the superhero movie ever one of the best movies ever and the best movie of 2012
Feb 10 2013,positive,marvels the avengers 2012 is a crowd please with great performances by the leads you expect robert downey jr and good performances by the rest  anticipation for a  film of this magnitude growing up as a young boy one would expect utter failure back in the early 90s when comic book films were all but rationed to dcs batman franchise  however in the day and age of working my way back to you babe type film making ala starting with solo films iron man incredible hulk thor etc the build up in the film was preordered via a few years of solid films in their own rights  however i cant help but feel a certain manufactured quality amongst this film knowing the characters ahead of time and knowing the pull your punch make it somewhat kidfriendly for the audience it somewhat has  great action good performances and of course a setup for future installments avengers fits the bill  nonetheless in further films i want a break the mold type of filmmaking with these enduring characters to satiate my sense of progression that is now to be expected in the world of what is comic book films in the modern ear of films
Feb 10 2013,negative,one of the most overrated films ever the script was as stupid as boring there was nothing new in this movie also they spoiled the hulk it is just a big boy that smashes like a wwe wrestler loki do i have to say it i will have to he was so mediocre his plan was very foolsih with ghost rider spirit of vengeance i want my money back
Feb 10 2013,positive,brings hero action films to a new level
Feb 10 2013,positive,fun witty and action packed  the avengers is a must see for comic book fans  the lessismore approach used with the incredible hulk and expanded use of black widow are definitive highlights of marvels best film to date
Feb 10 2013,positive,a get together of some of the less popular superheroes that havent been given trilogies or even particularly successful films the result is extremely entertaining the science side of it went a bit over my head but for just pure superhero fun this was really great
Feb 10 2013,positive,no higher because of the lack of fighting and i wanted more smash
Feb 9 2013,positive,it was fantastic now get out of here
Feb 9 2013,positive,it doesnt have the darkness and human drama of batman films batman being my favorite superhero but the avengers was an excellent film of solid storytelling and sheer fun with its exceptional effects and cool characters
Feb 9 2013,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
Feb 9 2013,positive,this film has definitely avenged the genre after a parade of subpar super hero films
Feb 9 2013,positive,action filledexcellent and filled with excellent charisma from the cast this is the ultamate blockbuster blast see it
Feb 8 2013,positive,awesome movie with great action
Feb 8 2013,positive,everything i had hoped for from the moment i heard this movie was in the works
Feb 8 2013,positive,amazing movie what marvel films achieved with this movie is nothing short of astounding combining 5 movies with different plot lines into one mesh of a film is recipe for utter disaster but they pulled it off not only did they pull it off they spiked the ball and did a td dance that makes all td dances pale in comparison only joss whedon couldve pulled it off as well perfect choice in casting the man has been building ensemble pieces all his career with great success glad he is getting the main stream recognition he has earned and deserves avengers was brilliant on every level and cannot wait for marvel phase 2
Feb 8 2013,positive,a remarkable comic book movie
Feb 8 2013,positive,this movie is the shit
Feb 7 2013,positive,iron man thor captain america and the hulk  theres a good chance that at one time or another every boy fought an epic make believe battle pretending to be one of these comic book heroes i dare say that a movie that brings these four to life on the big screen is about as good as it gets for a fan of the comic books and action movies the avengers 2012 does just that and it does it spectacularly    the avengers are a team of super humans brought together to prevent the human race from being enslaved by a banished asgardian known as loki played by tom hiddleston with a score to settle loki is the stepbrother of thor and was banished from asgardia after waging war on earth he returns in this movie to enslave the people of earth as retribution against his earthloving brother      thor chris hemsworth iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans and the hulk mark ruffalo are each the stars of their own blockbuster movies that preclude this movie its in those prequels that we get to know the characters and their motives the challenge with a movie that brings together four huge characters into one plotline is screen time i was concerned that 143 minutes would not be enough time to do the characters justice its this balance that really makes the avengers special director joss whedon does a marvelous job of keeping the dialogue and interplay between the characters seamless that and the writers also did a great job pacing the action and giving just enough time to each character it never feels like one character is dominating the screen which means whether youre a fan of thor iron man captain america or the hulk youll feel like you saw what you paid to see    something that often gets overlooked in movies of this action genre is the subtle nods to other films or pop culture events that make it special this movie is loaded with them which is especially entertaining to the diehard comic book fans for example the scene involving the interrogation of the character black widow is a parody of many of the james bond interrogation scenes while the casual james bond fan may not notice the avid fans will recognize it as a classic james bond escape from being bound to a chair during an interrogation    the avengers could be called a classic hollywood action movie the good guys must fight off the bad guys to save the world however the aweinspiring presence of four of the biggest actioncomic book heroes combined with a script that allows each of them to shine makes this movie a cut above anything else ive seen
Feb 7 2013,positive,really good better than i thought it was going to be
Feb 7 2013,negative,long drawn out and non sensical plot
Feb 7 2013,negative,no matter how amusing it is to watch the hulk smashing everything and iron man s flights with their exquisite special effects nothing can save this film from being an utter dissapointment to an audience with at least some basic intelligence the plot is obviously a silly excuse for bringing all the heroes together and making them fight each other much in the juvenile tradition of marvels plots back in the 60s and 70s minus the kitch naive charm of the latter the biggest problem arises from the ideological core of the film which much like the dark knight promotes a totally unrealistic view of human values choices and consequences one has only to look at the scene in which loki makes the common people to kneel before him while he makes his archvillainous speech about how humans are made to obey one person a common average old american citizen stands up and proudly defies loki with his stance now there is nothing wrong with someone standing up to his convictions but where are the consequences of doing so well there arent any in this film loki shoots at the old man but of course at the crucial moment captain america comes in front of him out of nowhere and deflects the beam with his american shield so obvious and moronic is the symbolism not to mention that the film shyes away from showing a single death of one of those average american citizens because if they did this would go against the fantasy that the american superheros succeed in protecting the common people instead we get a lot of shots with people running in the midst of destruction but no on screen killings the only death in the film the death of that childlike goodhearted shield agent he collects captain america vintage cards whom loki kills becomes a whole parade of melodrama that moulds the heroes in the end into a team in other words the film promotes the fiction of heroic death which is a meaningful death however in real wars meaning is nowhere to be found one can get a bullet while walking the street without even realizing what happened anyway at leat mark ruffalo is good as bruce banner and the special effects are well done other than that it is funny or rather alarming how these films get so much praise from audience and critics alike without any critical thinking done one of the critics here even called it one of the best films of the year critics should take their roles a bit more seriously i think
Feb 7 2013,positive,one of my favorite movies
Feb 6 2013,positive,this is the ultimate example of a blockbuster actionfilled superhero movie it is solid popcorn entertainment all around and should be expected this much dont expect an incredibly deepthinking or thought provoking movie but expect a predictable but fun explosive ride that never lets up till the end
Feb 6 2013,positive,i came to see this film expecting very poor results i had gotten aacustomed to thors incredible hulks iron man 2s and captain americas just like when i went to see iron man in 2008 after 4 years i already had very little faith in marvel pictures  wow best marvel film ever almost a marvel masterpiece this is what iron man had promised in 2008 and i was wrongly expecting from iron man 2 it is the avengers classic i was like crazy i had a marvelgasm i watched it again 2 times so ive seen it 3 times in theatre thats why this movie is historys 3rd biggest boxoffice blockbuster
Feb 6 2013,positive,the avengers was the full packageinteresting storygreat charactersgreat action and great character chemistry joss whedon the god among nerds pulls together a amazing cast of people to accomplish one of the greatest super hero movies of all time my only complaint is the first 30 minutes was a snore but the last 30 minutes made up for that
Feb 5 2013,positive,completely overrated movie is it a good action movie yes that it is i still think people are being ridiculous when it comes to this film
Feb 5 2013,positive,hands down the greatest comic book movie ever
Feb 4 2013,positive,great job on this movie go see it
Feb 4 2013,positive,one of the best superhero movies of all time
Feb 4 2013,positive,i think the hulk takes steroids yo
Feb 4 2013,positive,sheer brilliance biased opinion  12 star missing because there was no uma thurman in leather haha
Feb 3 2013,positive,man all in one i liked it a lot although it starts kinda slow
Feb 3 2013,positive,another slam dunk for josh whedon
Feb 3 2013,positive,currently my favorite movie a terrific super hero romp featuring some of marvels best  i thoroughly enjoyed that the super heroes were portrayed by the actors from the most recent versions of their respective super hero films   what a treat i hope there are plans for a follow up film
Feb 3 2013,positive,wow great movie the best marvels movie ever great performances funny well scripted and incredible special effects i just adored it a must definetely
Feb 3 2013,positive,great show i love the hulk smash in this movie
Feb 2 2013,positive,a witty script with plenty of those classically cheesy super hero one liners and some top notch special effects make for an enjoyable viewing experience however there is nothing serious about this film
Feb 2 2013,positive,still the best action hero movie the hulk has one of the best oneliners in the film easy to watch over  over  great music
Feb 2 2013,positive,a fun movie it delivered what was expected from it
Feb 2 2013,positive,the best superhero movie of all time action from beginning to end after this dc has got some work to do with jl
Feb 2 2013,positive,having read marvel comics way back when i felt an emotional link with this movie the avengers was a link to my childhood and could easily have disappointed but it excelled this is fun respectful fast paced and well composed josh is the man excelsior
Feb 1 2013,positive,the avengers is directed by joss whedon who did a fantastic job in this movie avengers is one of the best superhero films i ever seen and actually this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life people may say that im being a fanboy but avengers is not only an incredible comic based film it also stands out as amazing actionscififantasy film it is just so good    the beginning is powerful and quick but of course it was supposed to be quick half of the avengers story is in other films like iron man 1  2 the incredible hulk thor and captain america anyways the beginning is fast and immediately sucks you into the movie impressive    the story is fresh and is not only about some superheroes that make a superteam and start fighting against the bad guys is deeper than that you will see constant discussions and fights among the characters that make the story more interesting because you dont if the avengers team is going to end right loki is this film is like the joker in the dark knight he is a smart evil man that plans everything very well after i knew the kind of villain that loki was in this film i got excited i knew that i was watching a smart film filled with action scenes and drama    whedon knows how to put his actors into work he is one good director  robert downey jr owns the iron man role that guy was born to play tony stark he is like johnny depp with jack sparrow downey jr is iron man for sure   chris hemsworth does an incredible job playing thor it was so amazing the best thing about hemsworth is that makes thor cool so thank you   evans is very good with captain america in my opinion one of the funniest characters in this film is really funny to watch this man discover a new world filled with new kinds of technology   mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk was just amazing the best hulk to the date norton was good back in 2008 but ruffalo owns it hands down   scarlett johansson is perfect as the black widow she really put some hard work into this character   i didnt see jeremy renner a lot of time in screen but he did a great hawkeye and samuel l jackson how cant you be entertained samuel l jackson is awesome    the script has it plot holes but whatever is a wonderful script if you are watching a movie just to question all the things that happen in that movie the you are not watching the movie im really sorry but you are just acting like an idiot avengers is so good that you dont care about the plot holes great job joss whedon    cgi is great it was very impressive it deserves an oscar actually has an oscar nomination for best special effects they were so neat powerful they were better that transformers i know they are pretty much the same effects but im gonna tell you why the cgi was better in avengers that in the transformers whedon knows how to use them he is moderate while using cgi he is not exploding things everywhere and giving you headaches he is really carefull while using special effects    what else can i say it was a great film charged with action perfectly balanced and well acted thank you so much joss whedon       please understand and respect this is my own review and it has my own opinion if youre not agree with the review you can write a comment and it can be discussed in a civilized and mature way    thank you for reading this    
Feb 1 2013,positive,there you go micheal bay thats how you direct an epic battle sequence first rate action
Feb 1 2013,positive,its another superhero movie with all the heros you love to see squashed by the bad guys then save the day the story is something we have seen before the heroes are ones we have all seen before but this time they are all in the same movie the start of this film was long and questionable but when the film got going it picked up the paceand ended im only hoping that this film is paving the way for the next one which will be much better
Feb 1 2013,positive,the avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen while the heroes stand alone films doesnt have that enough action this movie executes more of their super abilities its really fun and exciting a lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes this is what all fans and moviegoers want in avengers more fighting more explosions more smashing and more fun in the end you will crave for more because of its awesomeness the avengers is simply marvelous  our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense bland characters and too long runtime the runtime here is long but its necessary the storytelling is quite simple as it gets we already knew who these characters are the best part is when they develop their relationship to each other this happened mostly in the second act these scenes are funny and entertaining its more entertaining when theres robert downey jr stealing the show of course he will always be like this his chemistry with bruce banner is wonderful two geniuses working together other than that the rest of the performances were also good chris hemsworth is just mighty enough as thor and chris evans is cool enough as captain america scarlett johansson is probably the weak link here shes still sexy though  maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains they are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for hulk to smash them but it doesnt matter because theres loki stealing all of his scenes once again tom hiddleston is simply fantastic as loki the action is pretty awesome its suppose to be awesome the hulk nails it in these scenes its exciting to see him smash stuff with glory while theres iron man flying thor wielding his hammer captain america throwing his shield and hawkeye shooting with his archer more explosions just what everyone wants its fantastically cool and fun  there are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions the film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them its a rare kind of blockbuster these days it has clever humor awesome action and really fun characters it makes the fans and moviegoers happy and amazed this is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch this film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer though i still think the first iron man movie is the best of this set but still this is a big fun experience you will have in the big screen
Jan 31 2013,positive,though pretty boring in the beginning the avengers picks up in the middle with very wellcrafted action sequences impressive visuals and a good story mixing all of the avengers
Jan 31 2013,positive,best way to spend two and a half hours on a friday night everything wanted from an action movie it here impressive sets great action deep characters etc each of the characters have their moments here in this masterfully handled movie
Jan 31 2013,positive,although i really disliked the movie it looked amazing and had to be seen at the movies to fully appreciate how epic it looks
Jan 28 2013,positive,it was my favorite in 2012
Jan 27 2013,positive,to be honest i dont really care for this movie all that much at first i liked it even calling it solid after leaving the theater however when i watched it a second time the movie felt much more long tedious and dull than before maybe it was just because of all the hype and i walked out during the big fight scene in the city i wasnt even paying attention much of the time before then either so yeah i think its kind of average in my humble opinion
Jan 27 2013,positive,just wish they started with the originals but still badass
Jan 27 2013,positive,a perfect superhero movie
Jan 27 2013,positive,what a film  waited a long time to watch it but it didnt disappoint tony stark obviously stole the show followed the hulk if you dont like it then youre just not normal
Jan 27 2013,positive,beyond entertaining
Jan 27 2013,negative,quite typical brains off super hero movie nothing new to this genre
Jan 27 2013,positive,possibly the best superhero movie ever
Jan 27 2013,positive,an overrated but formidable entry in 2012s catalog of high quality films more coherent fun and true to the spirit of comics than christopher nolans dark knight trilogy could ever hope to be
Jan 26 2013,positive,the best super hero movie on the planet
Jan 26 2013,positive,this movie is awesome
Jan 26 2013,positive,the best movie from 2012 d
Jan 26 2013,positive,this film was a good laugh as well as action packed its unusual assemble of heroes that not only rub each other the wrong way but can pull it off when its time will happily watch again
Jan 26 2013,positive,of course i entered this movie having been told that it was incredible and one the best movie of the year  sorry its not  its too corny  there are too many one liners and overproduced action  with that being said if you want to watch a comic book action movie this one is still enjoyable  the first time
Jan 26 2013,positive,need i say more if you hate this youre a total douche
Jan 26 2013,positive,good is just epic heroes unite all these together and fighting together but the essentials of a movie is the story and here there was none at all but i could not see the story that the action scenes were too much fun and i could see that the story was missing until i left the movie theater but yeah the movie was the movie that all the geeks want to watch
Jan 25 2013,positive,a very nice payoff with an excellent assemble of characters all of which are relevant and entertaining
Jan 24 2013,positive,they couldnt have made an avengers movie any better
Jan 24 2013,positive,a very funny movie wich although it doesnt have a great plot makes you have a nice time when youre watching it recommended to watch all the other marvel superheros movies first specially the iron man saga captain america and thor
Jan 24 2013,negative,highly uninspired and very disappointing little by way of character involvement i have heard it defended theres too many characters to get that involved xmen first class destroys that theory immediately its was flashy the graphics were epic but left me entirely empty
Jan 24 2013,positive,one of the bestnothing more to say the plot is clear and holesfree which is good
Jan 24 2013,positive,basically just brillant
Jan 24 2013,positive,great popcorn fun what big movies are made for
Jan 24 2013,positive,absolutely a must see i âââ this movie  it is one of the only movies i would watch more than once
Jan 23 2013,positive,best superhero movie ever no more words are needed to be said
Jan 23 2013,negative,i couldnt find anything attractive in this movie
Jan 23 2013,positive,yep zesty and knowing a blast
Jan 23 2013,positive,this is marvels best movie to date with great humour a dynamite script and some fantastic action sequences that perfectly blend cgi with practical effects there is nothing more riveting than watching samuel l jackson assemble the likes of captain america iron man hulk and eventually thor and loki is by far the marvel cinematic universes best villain i would even go as far to compare him to the dark knights joker the long takes in the fighting scenes linking all the avengers together are masterfully excuited and the actors perfectly match the superheroes they are portraying this is how to make a superhero crossover movie
Jan 23 2013,positive,too good 5 stars arent enough
Jan 23 2013,positive,spot on and funny in places brilliant movie
Jan 22 2013,positive,a fun movie  joss whedon wrote some trully funny lines but the story as a whole is really bland the villain for me was just dumb i didnt like him never felt like he was evil or mad or heck even cold hearted that is what drags down what could have been one of the summers best movies to just good 315
Jan 22 2013,positive,a movie that will be watched 10years maybe 100 heck maybe even  1000 years from now if you have not watch  this movie yet i have to say i feel sorry for you bc this is a movie that will blow your socks off and shoot them into space 55
Jan 22 2013,positive,the most entertaining superhero movie ever whedon does a brilliant job with pacing character development story and humorous this movie will be a dayone bluray purchase avengers assemble
Jan 22 2013,positive,my entire life came to the moment i saw this in the theater my whole life was worth it
Jan 22 2013,positive,highly overrated a good fun movie to see with friends but unlike iron man or even other super hero series it doesnt get deep or offer freshness the acting is good dont get me wrong with robert downey jr and jeremy renner but the plot is what gets me another man plans world domination and yet again a hero risks his or her life for humanity and lives good but nothing special to the plot or around the plot
Jan 22 2013,positive,after years and years through each foreshadowing end of each marvel movie they finally produce the avengers i had a lot of hype for this movie and it lived up to every bit of it great flick anticipating the second
Jan 22 2013,positive,avengers delivers on all fronts although the villain could have been better the story was still great
Jan 22 2013,positive,seen it 4 times already in the theaters instant one of my favorite films of all time everything i love and then some
Jan 21 2013,positive,it was simply fun to watch
Jan 21 2013,positive,veryveryvery good it could use a little less swearing though
Jan 21 2013,positive,the movie was good but it was way overhyped i think that in an effort to fit all of the different characters in we lose a lot of the character development that makes marvel movies fun in the first place the movie is in an essence three drawnout masterfully shot action sequences the problem with this is that the characters suffer as a result
Jan 21 2013,positive,very good i didnt expect to like it
Jan 21 2013,negative,it was fun despite the fact that i dont know about some heroes but neither more nor less
Jan 21 2013,positive,seen it all before only excellent aspect was the special effects nothing more
Jan 20 2013,positive,so much could have gone wrong here thank odin it did not
Jan 20 2013,positive,super fun thoroughly entertaining thank you mr whedon
Jan 20 2013,positive,this is by far the best superhero movie ever  its also more than that its actually a great action movie thats filled with thrills humor and pathos go see it now
Jan 20 2013,positive,aside from the dark knight rises this was probably the most waited movie of the year was it the movie of the year no but it was still fantastic up there theres a not very certain rate of this movie but heres a true review of this movie the avengers was not so good as i expected to be that i can admit but i still loved it i admired that joss whedon did a great job with the characters screen time it all had a balance so no character seems distant that was a very important element of the movie and they succeeded at not blow it up that was a great thing they did the avengers is the reunion of marvels greatest heroes yeah unfortunately theres no spider man well hes probably only amazing for them and they needed great so this movie needed memorable action scenes well along the movie theres some great action scenes but they cant be compared to what they saved for the end it was almost 20 minutes of fantastic action scenes featuring iron man at his best thor captain america the hulk black widow and hawkeye the special effects were tremendous as they shoul be and they brought a very significant and pleasunt quantity of humour in this movie that was really helpful and enjoyable  downey once again suits up as iron man and he was amazing once again bringing to the screen hes amazing sense of humour and smartness chris evans wasnt at donweys same calibre but he was still solid mark ruffalo was amazing as the hulk his performance was very solid chris hemsworth fired some good jokes along the movie nothing more than that i dont appreciate thor that much scarlett johansson was amazing and hot here as the black widow wich is a really strong character by the way  jeremy renner was too distant tom hiddleston wasnt an amazing choise to play the villian clark gregg was great cobie smulders was a surprise i was seeing robin turning into a serious secret agent oh and l jackson was also great with his nick fury  overall the avengers is a great blockbuster that didnt fail whedons direction made this happening so good of course the story isnt amazing they didnt care about an amazing story only the union of these heroes but the avengers is not a perfect fairy tale it also has its flaws like the long second act that was mostly placed at a submarine and weird enemies that bored he viewer when shown but aside from that the avengers is a fantastic movie that succeeds at uniting all these heroes together amazingly it was amazing to seem all work together the avengers is not easily forgotten highly recommended oh and by the way geeks this is the new geek porn
Jan 20 2013,positive,great film got it the day it came out
Jan 20 2013,positive,fantastic chemistry and great dialogue but above all just boldly brilliant fun
Jan 20 2013,positive,as a completist im forced to type up something about the avengers here goesits big its fun its bright its exciting its funny there all done hmmmthat doesnt seem complete really  the most compelling characters are the hulk and iron man the hulk is great here but and this is going to earn me zero comic book geek points i find ang lees hulk monster more appealing in that movie you can knock him on his ass and shoot him up he takes a second or two to shake it off and then he comes back for more the hulk smash scenes in that movie are intense and real in the avengers hes just another indestructible superthing mark ruffalos bruce banner character is much preferable though   robert downey jr is once again perfect as tony stark he wisecracks and outsmarts plenty here and is the one who holds the whole thing together  captain america is a bit under powered being that thor is effectively a god and all they try to add a superpower for cap with the shield and all but hes relegated to fighting with the other secondtier avengers crew speaking of thor he misses out on a lot here like superman hes just too powerful he cant really fit into a story like this  for as many characters as there are everyone has their moments the story does feel a bit under told but the movie is so viscerally exciting and bombastic that the lack of clever or emotionally impacting moments is forgiven this is an ideal summer blockbuster
Jan 20 2013,positive,a heroic film of epic proportions teaming iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth the hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye  jeremy renner and nick fury samuel l jackson together to fight against loki tom hiddleston the film is directed by the great joss whedon the cast work well together and create an action packed fun filled film
Jan 20 2013,positive,really enjoyed this
Jan 20 2013,positive,not to crazy about any of the avengers but good movie
Jan 20 2013,positive,more than just a superhero movie
Jan 19 2013,positive,i went to see it last night with my mom and older brother we all loved it loads of fun and laughs and great character interaction
Jan 19 2013,positive,i am a comic book collector this movie combines the well loved comic books with the adapted movies for the major characters so there were high expectations from both sets of fans these expectations were fulfilled it was a difficult task but the movie has some great acting from downey jr and ruffalo plus some great lines and a continuos action romp that does not bog down probably not as good as ironman the first ironman movie but it brought in more people i loved this movie but im a fan
Jan 19 2013,positive,probably one of the best movies ive ever seen in my entire life  1 iron man 2thor 3 captain america
Jan 19 2013,positive,great characters can not wait for the next one
Jan 19 2013,negative,i honestlty dont get what all the fuzz is about i slept almost through entire movie poor dialogue and boring i only gave it two stars because its a good movie to fall asleep
Jan 19 2013,neutral,so much hype for what i feel to be rather disappointing good action scenes and some funny moments but boring story with some long dragging moments also scarlett johansson is by far the worst actress they ever could of hired yes shes pretty but incredibly dull and not a good actress
Jan 19 2013,positive,what an amazing movie joss whedon pulls it off again with this one a great story amazing action and just the right ballance of drama and comedy carry you on an exciting rollercoaster of summer movie fun again hats off to joss whedon for this one everything here is well paced and every hero has an equal part to play in the action grab your popcorn and get ready to have a blast make sure to stay for after the credits there are two after the credits stingers so make sure to stay till the end end 5 out of 5
Jan 19 2013,neutral,things blow up pop culture references are made and the characters are better used than is typical of the genre its a good enough movie but theres not much to it
Jan 18 2013,positive,fabulous  chris helmsworth is just delicious
Jan 18 2013,positive,to good makes it worth another hulk film and make cap thor and ironman must sees
Jan 18 2013,positive,was a solid superhero movie although i thought it didnt live up to the hype its worth watching
Jan 18 2013,positive,its been awhile since ive seen cgi and action this good a lot of the jokes miss and the acting isnt great but the action makes up for it all go see this movie
Jan 17 2013,positive,this how a comic book movie should be done
Jan 17 2013,positive,how can anyone resist a beautifully made movie which assembles all the great heroes
Jan 17 2013,positive,pure unadulterated awesomesauce what more need be said
Jan 16 2013,positive,this movie is amazing except one thing joss whedon is the only man that could make an actionsuper hero movie have so many intimate character development moments which i love but black widow is awful black widow is breasts in a tight suit she wasnt even an avenger for long in the comics joss i wish you wouldve done more with her i appreciate the couple of scenes she is shown as such an intelligent person but in the end that largely is just meant to show im seductive for avengers 2 replace her with ant man or black panther or one of the other comic book avengers one with a story and a personality i know this will never happen because sex sells nowadays but hey a guy can wish
Jan 16 2013,positive,holy crap great characters amazing visuals and a perfect blend of action  story awesome
Jan 16 2013,positive,a reasonably entertaining super hero film some nice character exploration highlighted by robert downey jr as tony stark  scarlett johansson as black widow   the final act was very entertaining but i almost shut the film off a couple times earlier on it was just not very enjoyable  overall a reasonably good super hero film that gets better towards its final climax
Jan 16 2013,positive,sickest super hero movie for awhile
Jan 16 2013,positive,great action and special effects but in the end just another high budget superhero film with very little development of its ensemble cast
Jan 15 2013,positive,all things considered this was an amazing movie everything worked well story special effects acting akl blended together for excellent movie a must see
Jan 15 2013,positive,one of the best movies ive seen ever
Jan 15 2013,positive,me and the boy loved it
Jan 15 2013,negative,though considered among film goers i was out of it after 15 minutes though there is a lot action the story and its characters get lost in the confusion
Jan 15 2013,positive,for something that has had years of build up hype and various movie titles leading to it the avengers only barely manages to live up yes the movie is good and is well made and produced with actors doing their job and the cgi doing the rest but its just that a flashy action film sure to be fun for the entire family that has lots of flair but not as much substance i would say that this film is indeed good and serves its purpose but is it a spectacular one i liked it but i didnt love it as so many of you do and i certainly dont crown it with incredibly incredibly biased praise like most of the reviews i see below
Jan 15 2013,positive,another great hero movie well made
Jan 14 2013,neutral,i know i am going to get scathing responses from many fans here but i have to be honest about this film  the avengers was good but definitely not the masterpiece that so many people say it is  it hurts me to say this because everyone was clearly having fun joss whedon was a perfect pick for director and some of the humor was hilarious but it becomes more and more manipulative every time i watch it  ironman was a clever science fiction film about an egotistical genius who turns his life around following a lifethreatening incident  the sequel did a relatively decent job of following suit despite practically coming to a stop to make room for a sneak peek of the avengers  the incredible hulk was a very characterdriven tale about a man trying to tame the monster within  thor felt very much like the classic myths depicting the interactions between men and gods  captain america was practically a living homage to the classic adventure films of the 40s  then the avengers came along and seemed to discard all of those elements to combine all these characters together for a liveaction version of a typical saturday morning cartoon  while the film does contain each distinct personality the only characters who truly feel at home are thor loki and bruce banner to a certain extent  i will admit that i had fun watching these characters interact with one another but most of the fun was gone by the time the third act battle sequence kicked in  it just feels very strange to me that after all the chances that the franchise took to stay true to the comics within the realms of liveaction that it would all come down to an explosion of nearly everything we have seen time and time again  maybe it is my decreasing interest in a lot of superhero and comic book fiction or maybe it is my distaste for teamup films but despite whedons obvious affection for the project i just cannot enjoy this film quite like everyone else
Jan 14 2013,positive,perhaps one of the quickest action movies to gain fame worldwide and make a killing at the box office the avengers has caught on like wildfire to the world of popular action movies and has officially kicked off the movie industry for summer businessas well as given upcoming releases including the dark knight rises and the amazing spiderman much to live up to uniting characters from four different marvel movies together for one blow out film and getting the original cast members save for hulk few will find a reason not to check this one out the first big summer flick of 2012 finds nick fury of shield played by a comical samuel l jackson uniting superheroes from various recent films to form a team known as the avengers to conquer the wicked loki a villain from thor and save the planet though all of them have their own agendas they come together solidly yet have no idea what they are up against through various trials with many fallen warriors along the way the supernatural powers each hero possesses bring them closer to creating world peace one step at a time though without the help of each of hero they may never succeed and lokis powers may rise to a level none of them are aware of a film many have anxiously awaited for prior to its april release this flick will surely exceed expectations of skeptical viewers and is entertainment to the max not only did director joss weldon successfully get the original actors to come together for one mega film but the script has something in it for all tastes including many welcomed jokes mostly from tony stark a definite winner with an open ending for a sequel anyone surprised stay tuned through the end credits for two clips of additional footage
Jan 14 2013,positive,joss whedon made of marvels the avengers what everyone was wanting this to be a quality superhero summer flick that leaves you flabbergasted the movie is funny and has nonstop action furthermore whedon knows how to handle a great cast and that is a very good quality for a filmmaker
Jan 14 2013,positive,this comic book fans dreams come to life on the big screen well almost stupid fox and sony holding back on a truely amazing movie universe
Jan 13 2013,positive,waiting for this movie since my first avengers comic book in 1996 and totally worth the wait
Jan 13 2013,positive,what makes this movie so good is the fact that they waited didnt just come out and make waited until all the characters were introduced and then did this perfect movie
Jan 13 2013,positive,its not a perfect film but it is a perfect summer blockbusterwith a sharp script great character interactions and big action the best comic book movie to date
Jan 13 2013,negative,ridiculously overrated and overhyped
Jan 13 2013,positive,the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because its a bit too busy i know its hard to combine 5 movies into one i guess this is the best outcome out of that scenario
Jan 13 2013,positive,i do understand why most loved this film and praised it i also do acknowledge that the film is good but i must also underline that the avengers is the most overrated movie of the year  the abundance of super heroes combining together certainly made it feel so since everybody loves at least one of these characters i personally always hated captain america and loved it when he was always bullied by stark and thor  marvel has certainly prepared this film by releasing during the last five years an origin story for captain america iron man the incredible hulk and thor the newcomers are basically black widow and hawkeye brilliantly portrayed by scarlet johansson and jeremy renner  however it is definitely the combination of downey jr iron man  ruffalo hulk that steals the show but even themselves couldnt prevent the unpersuasive scripting of intertwining planets even if we know about the 7 kingdoms it just felt absurd and totally unrealistic which killed the whole purpose why presenting us and persuading us with origin stories for a decade to come up with an unpersuasive script  im seriously baffled here however you will be entertained you will see your action heroes and you will certainly be eating a lot of popcorn in addition you will leave the theater smiling which is one of the reasons to go to see a movie
Jan 13 2013,negative,generic  im glad robert downey jr is cashing some massive checks these days but i sure wish hed go back to doing interesting movies
Jan 13 2013,positive,the avengers is epic  it successfully pulls six superheros into one film while giving each hero his own storyline and development until all six paths eventually intersect  some multihero films cough cough fantastic four dont properly develop the characters and just become a jumble of annoying personalities  but the avengers has even more challenges than character development  unlike the xmen films where all of the characters exist in the same world and have the same goal of protecting the mutants this film pulls characters from several comic worlds and has to make these worlds align  i like how the writers didnt suddenly throw all of the characters together in a room and say lets do this  the film has a believable quality because some of the characters show resistance to joining other characters pair up and try to find a solution but cant do it on their own and finally the necessity of the situation pulls them all together instead of their desire to be a team  all of the acting is incredible from robert downey jrs coolness as iron man to scarlett johanssons neverending kickbutt sexiness as black widow  outside of the superheros clark gregg reprises his role as agent coulson and really grabs the spotlight this time  also samuel l jackson  that is all  the action sequences are amazing the hulk is so cool as he destroys stuff the dialogue is great and the acting is even better however this movie falls short in one way for me and thats the inclusion of mythological enemies  the recent trend in superhero movies has placed these heroes into real world situations that makes it seem that they could be among us  the costumes and characteristics of these heroes have been altered so that their abilities can be logically explained and the characters appearance wouldnt be laughable if we saw them on the street  i understand that the plot of thor requires this mythical garb and even though he looks goofy standing next to hawkeye i could have been okay with it  but why did the conflict have to revolve around otherworldly beings instead of a realistic enemy like those in the iron man series  i just feel as if this film lost some of its potential by breaking the realism that has placed superheros into the real world  that being said the story special effects acting and script are awesome and make the avengers one of the best superhero films out there  i cant wait to see the disney corporations continued enhancement of the marvel universe
Jan 13 2013,positive,having a huge cast of both topnotch actors and topnotch supers can prove to be difficult but joss whedon and kevin fiege manage to bring the big 4 and more to the screen in collaboration that works wonders it may be long but it certainly doesnt feel that way and every moment is necessary to the story while the first act brings together the supers in an extraordinary way the second delivers a hard impact on the audience and the final act boasts some of the best action sequences ever scene in scifi and superhero movies alike the avengers rounds off phase one with the biggest bang ever and sets the bar for marvel and co
Jan 13 2013,positive,awesome film good story and amazing effects some funny one linershulk and iron man steal the show for me
Jan 13 2013,positive,a bit too cluttered and convoluted and the villain is a dud but its fun which this sort of thing should be
Jan 12 2013,positive,it was the perfect climax to all of the build up of the individual movies  which ranged from pretty good to really good  the individual movies provided the background and the avengers was the climax it works because you can take characters that might not have made the best movie thor for example and they all just come together and dont have to be the focal point and they can just be part of the collective movie thats why it works so well and thats why its the best super hero movie that doesnt have the word bat in it
Jan 12 2013,positive,that was great very wellrounded and wellwritten script
Jan 12 2013,positive,loved the movie much fun and worth while fun for kids and adults
Jan 12 2013,positive,good action but completely lacks a story
Jan 12 2013,positive,very good amazing how they combined all of the movies into one big one
Jan 12 2013,positive,the juggernaut superhero movie of the year âthe avengers is possibly the most ambitious and entertaining superhero film i have ever seen the concept started out as just a teaser after the credits of ironman marvel studious slowly crafted an intricately web of superhero films leading up to the avengers the film picks up by revealing the fate of thors brother loki loki has survived his climatic fate from his previous battle against thor and is now planning to invade and conquer earth with the world facing itâtms most dangerous threat ever nick furry the director of shield decides to get the greatest team of super heroes ever assembled to save the world usually what seems good on paper never turns out well in reality the problem with having a selfsacrificing hero is that they never want to sacrifice being center stage this issue is what works the best for the avengers from the heroes having to learn how to cope with their teammates to showing off to one another is the glue the keeps the film entertaining is it the best superhero film ever made i would leave that answer to selfinterpretation  standouts go to both robert downey jr and tom hiddleston robert downey jr will forever be recognized as the face of tony stark just like harrison ford will always be known as indiana jones he has that certain charm and arrogance that will always be a delight to watch as entertaining downey is as tony stark the star of the film belongs to tom hiddleston as loki he carries the best dialog and shines whenever heâtms onscreen you feel his torment and arrogance as the filmâtms main protagonist he is a shakespearian actor that never brings his character down to a campy style this helps the audience believe in the threat of earthâtms destruction the avengers is a solid opening to 2012âtms summer movie season
Jan 12 2013,positive,i love this movie robert downey jr was great for the part of iron man
Jan 12 2013,positive,worth every penny of the â3040 price tag for two tickets 3d imax strong cast fantastic story and amazing special effects come together in a two and a half hour spectacle if youve enjoyed the other marvel films then this one will not disappoint
Jan 12 2013,positive,i just finished watching the movies for the first timeand wow  i was very skeptible when the hero movies started coming out  i am in my late forties and i started being a comic hero fan in the late sixties  i lost most interest in the late eighties due to poor art and lousy stories    all of the movies that have come out follow the same boring themesomeone in a costume some action and a love story  the batman series had that but also gave us a good story  the spiderman group gave us too much of a love story and so did the fantastic four  the first hulk was horrible as was the green lantern fiasco  the second hulk was outstanding as was the iron man movies  captain america and thor were okbut i would rather have seen more of the hero than watch them stumble over a broken heartyawn     now the avengers    what i didnt like is small  i didnt care much for the new bruce bannersorry but ed norton was better and it was a shame that he could not have been there   as for captain america its not that the actor was a bad human torch its more the scripts were bad  i do like the more hard core cap   thor looks more like a sixties beach bum but thats passable  what did i likeeverything else   the action the humor the lack of another love story i was worried were the widow and hawkeye thing was heading tho  the hulk made my day when he finally came out and his interaction with thor and loki was fantastic    i honestly thought it was going to be a corny movieanother wannabe and i am very glad i was wrong  the action was great the interaction between the characters was true to the character and enjoyable  the story was refreshing a fun to watch  i was put off initially when i heard about the lineup including hawkeye and the black widow but it actually worked for the most part  and speaking of hawkeye i think they did a really good job with him  i hope the trend continues with the way the movie was created  keep good action and good stories with a good cast and we could see great movies for a long time  i for one am getting bored with the poor me and love is above all scripts  those two with the constant recreation movies that some directors feel the need to waste time on i hope is getting weeded out  keep the avengers going strong with a good cast and good writing  now if only dc would get the message
Jan 12 2013,positive,okay silly superhero movie but in the best way possibleso glad we went so see it opening week its so much better when the theatres full and everybody around you is as into it as you are
Jan 12 2013,positive,that was fun  especially robert downeyjust love his attitude 
Jan 12 2013,positive,if you like comic based action films this is definitely right up your street  i love it  action packed tongue in cheek genius
Jan 12 2013,neutral,a movie with a more than cliche story but the superheroes feel like real superheroes but the actors dont do a lot the only thing they do is try to anoy each other and tell bad jokes
Jan 11 2013,positive,mehh thats all i have to say through all the hype and stunning action one thing is overlooked the story or moreso the lack of story the lack of romance and drama the lack of everything except iron man and action the hulk mark ruffalo  puts on one of the greatest performances  of any of the actors and yet he has less screentime than most im not going to rant here but the non stop bombardment of action was really a turn off for me 87100
Jan 11 2013,positive,top marvel movie made so far  hope this one has set the bar
Jan 11 2013,positive,surpassed all my expectations it was better than i thought it could ever be
Jan 11 2013,positive,a very long very big budget blockbuster which didnt have a huge affect on me it was entertaining to see all these characters together and it was a mostly entertaining film but it could have been a lot shorter
Jan 11 2013,positive,a hugely fun experiencea childhood dream come to life  marvel gets it
Jan 11 2013,positive,an exciting thrill ride from start to finish with an array of characters who just work brilliantly together
Jan 11 2013,positive,love it best superhero film since spiderman 2
Jan 10 2013,positive,i had a blast with this film a true summer blockbuster now was i as crazy about this film as other people were not at all i thought it was a great summer film but as for people making it out as one of the greatest films of all time thats a bit much
Jan 10 2013,positive,the best superhero movie ive seen in a long time the film is filled with a great cast and has amazing action sequences joss whedon gave the fans what they wanted and now looking forward to avengers 2 a
Jan 10 2013,positive,totally worth a watch over and over again as predictable as comics are  full of action suspense and scifi thrills although some scenes and ideas seem familiar from others shows like transformers this is constant nail biting action and the thrill of the justice happens when loki tries to assert himself face to face with the hulk youll just have to see it to believe it looking forward to seeing it again and again
Jan 10 2013,positive,better than xmen only behind the dark kinght franchise for best superhero movie ever
Jan 10 2013,positive,the whole mcu has been leading to this and it is spectacular it delivers on every level and has a great rewatch appeal marvel studios joss whedon and the entire cast have crafted a marvelous masterpiece
Jan 10 2013,positive,awesome flick all the heroes are brought together brilliantly and the story is amazing
Jan 10 2013,negative,childish movie transformers 3 plot
Jan 10 2013,positive,group of superheroes  lots of destruction still cant convince me to like the movie
Jan 9 2013,positive,very entertaining and who could hate all these super heroes together in one movie epic
Jan 9 2013,neutral,fun seeing all of the heroes on the big screen but this was a pretty by the books action movie sit back and turn your brain off
Jan 9 2013,positive,outstanding  dialogue was fantastic so many in jokes  loved it hulk vs loki  hilarious
Jan 9 2013,positive,my main concern with the avengers was in encompassing all of the members the film would be spread too thinly between the characters resulting in a watered down attempt to integrate characters and personalities a little like the xmen films thankfully this is not the case although its interesting that cowriter zak penn was involved in two of the xmen group films penn and joss whedon find enough screentime for all the avengers and by introducing them gradually through the films opening third sufficient emphasis is placed on each character similarly i was disappointed when i discovered that the films antagonist would be loki as i was not overly impressed with him in thor again though due to hiddlestones improved performance this time around and with whedons direction i felt loki was a much more interesting villain and one more fitting of the collectives film    the team dynamic of between the superheroes is what really makes the film alongside the blockbuster action sequences thor and hulk clash captain america and tony stark routinely throw barbs at each other while stark shows a surprisingly sincere side when offering support to bruce banner mark ruffalo plays banner with a sense of fear and regret of his destructive uncontrollable power and i found him to be the most interesting character of the team theres a slightly contrived backstory thrown in to give hawkeye and black widow something of interest but its the funny moments between stark and co that gives the film its spark samuel l jacksons brings his usual dont mess with me cool factor and his larger role also benefits the movie being critical im not sure the plot gave enough explanation as to why banner returned to fight alongside the others after showing nothing but resistance to let the other guy appear or how he was able to control hulk more effectively in contrast with the films earlier events    the so called battle of new york finale is a really exciting welldirected battle especially when you consider its similarities to the frantic city battles michael bay treated us to in his transformer films    a genuine action blockbuster fit for its cast
Jan 9 2013,positive,awesome worked with all the characters lots of funny bits thor was incredibly sexy x
Jan 8 2013,negative,when i see movies like this i become terribly worried about the future of film  the avengers looks so digital that the people look fake and the set design makes it look like a made for tv power rangers movie from 1997 thats not all the dialogue is pathetic and any attempt at humor is painful to watch and listen to nothing in this movie ever gels there is no character developement  no sentiment so i really didnt care about any of the characters and the action sequences are boring and repetitive all i can really say is really this plastic dreck is considered an achievement this is the direction were going in
Jan 8 2013,positive,its good cudda use more fight scenes
Jan 8 2013,positive,the dialogues between stark and captain america are wonderful 
Jan 8 2013,negative,a complete waste of money all corny wittiness and no real story literally made me nauseous
Jan 8 2013,positive,one of the best hero shows of our time love the humor
Jan 8 2013,positive,the best superhero movie ever id say one of the best movies ever period its awesome
Jan 8 2013,positive,great popcorn movie
Jan 8 2013,positive,when it comes to modern superhero movies nolans batman trilogy has raised the bar much as i love joss whedon i dont think he quite hits the right note perhaps a shade too bombastic and empty
Jan 7 2013,positive,not as good as the dark night rises
Jan 7 2013,positive,downey jr carries the film with his super cool tony stark ruffalos hulk is great the rest of the cast is good and has grown into their characters whedon plays it way too safe and makes this rather bland with a loud and numbing ending that belongs in a michael bay film he is lucky to have such likeable characters
Jan 7 2013,neutral,as much as i respect this team for what they have managed to do with combining 4 existing franchises i cant help but feel disappointed with the end result here we have the greatest assembly of marvel superheroes ever to appear on the silver screen and yet i never once felt captivated ebay the action or plot loki as the main villain bears nowhere near enough of a threat i understand that this is the first installment which is meant to introduce the team but i felt like that was the only thing really going here is it cool to see such a massive idea accumulate yes but once the novelty of it wears off were left with a very mediocre film the writing is serviceable if not above average the ending does conjure excitement toward future films where the threat will be massive and hopefully well adapted thanos of course ruffalos bruce banner is a welcome addition and this is likely the best version of hulk on the big screen yet as a huge comic fan i look forward to where things are heading but i do hope that future installments have stronger intros and more of an impact
Jan 7 2013,positive,joss whedon manages the high caliber actors and established canon laid before him wondrously this is not surprising seeing his track record on screens  both big and small great performances in a film where they could have been lacking and fantastic direction by whedon
Jan 7 2013,positive,the story in a nutshell just seems so simple and not innovative at all but marvels the avengers stands out in its direction and a good solid cast
Jan 6 2013,positive,a movie on steroids
Jan 6 2013,positive,josh whedon knows how to make a movie the avengers is the definition of popcorn entertainment theres little in the way of weighty themes or ideas to stick with a viewer after leaving the theater but ill be damned if this isnt the most entertaining superhero film ive ever seen 2012 was a bit on the weaker side as far as superheroism was concerned chronicle notwithstanding so its always nice to go into a big budget action movie watch some glorious spectacle and hear some witty banter and not feel as if my iq is dropping as a result of viewing thank you joss whedon for understanding that having explosions does not excuse a writer from having to put in well drawn characters and great dialog
Jan 6 2013,positive,i enjoyed this one i like jos whedons style i also loved the coming together of all these characters from other films
Jan 6 2013,positive,i just hope they kill off hawkeye blonde guy with bow and arrows before the next one
Jan 6 2013,positive,the avengers was absolutely incredible amazing special effects allstar cast and tons of humor throughout this movie is definitely one of my favorites and it is easily the best superhero movie i have ever seen
Jan 6 2013,positive,as superhero movies go there isnt much better
Jan 6 2013,neutral,i did rather enjoy this film but then it got a little boring and in the end i just gave up and didnt watch it anymore its highly overrated i was a little dissapointed
Jan 6 2013,positive,its a pretty good movie ill give it that but i dont get all the hype see my full review at 
Jan 6 2013,positive,once again tom hiddlestons perfect portrayal of loki laufeyson has made me burst into fangirly angsty tears gorgeous
Jan 6 2013,positive,i think no superhero film is much better than this this was amazing this was great unfantastic four was the opposite but that does not matter there scenes were brilliant but i gave it a 5 and a half stars because loki is extremely annoying and the talking scenes were ridiculously long
Jan 5 2013,positive,most people actually start getting angry when i say that i prefer the avengers over the dark knight rises they say that the avengers was nothing more than a dumb popcorn flick and that the dark knight rises actually tells a story the plot for the avengers may be pretty basic but joss whedon succeeds in making you actually pay attention and be enamored the whole time whedon has once again achieved the feat of taking 7 or 8 main characters and making giving them enough development to both make them relevant to the plot and making you care about them combine that with amazing performances some of the best action ever shot and a lot of laughs and that makes the avengers the new standard for not just comic book movies but for action films in general
Jan 5 2013,positive,a good mix of all of the movie threads marvels been cultivating probably too focused on iron man but still solid
Jan 5 2013,positive,my review is here 
Jan 5 2013,positive,ever since we heard sam jacksons word at the end of 2008s iron man five years ago of what was merely an idea we have grown with anticipation throughout every film  what was truly great about the avengers was not the great acting effects characters although they do come close its the build up  thank you joss whedon
Jan 5 2013,positive,awesome movie one of the best i have seen
Jan 4 2013,positive,loved it fun from beginning to end but i am a sucker for comic book hero movies
Jan 4 2013,positive,the first movie that has the hulk that didnt completely suck
Jan 4 2013,positive,best movie in the world
Jan 4 2013,positive,just awesome goodness
Jan 4 2013,positive,by far the best superhero films out there it never disappoints its emotional but not too emotional action packed funny and clever its as if were reading a comic book with a much better visual
Jan 4 2013,positive,this was so good i would have watched it again straight afterwards if it hadnt already been past my bed time absolutely brilliant such a shame my 6 year old boy cant watch it yet
Jan 4 2013,positive,joss whedon was great before but after directing this movie i just dont have the words to show my gratitude to the man
Jan 4 2013,positive,one of the best comic book movies ever
Jan 3 2013,positive,at the end of the day this is a really really good transformers film i have a really bad feeling that this will inspire the next generation of michael bay adaptions which scares the hell out of me   rating a for effort
Jan 3 2013,positive,very stylish superhero action during many of the fight scenes in the film the action feels like true superhero teamwork and the camera techniques used during fight scenes are superb it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat with the explosive action and interesting fight choreography
Jan 3 2013,positive,this is a fantastic movie  it has it allgreat effects good acting gripping storyeverything  the moral of how we have to work together against evil is fittingly embodied by captain america the ultimate great generation hero leading the postmodern heroes who lack the captains moral fiber and unselfish dedication  it is rollicking good fun for kids of all ages
Jan 3 2013,positive,perfect popcorn film that you wont get bored of 
Jan 3 2013,positive,perfect popcorn film that you wont get bored of 
Jan 3 2013,positive,pulls all the superheroes together a great action flick but still full of fun good chemistry among the varied characters
Jan 3 2013,positive,as i said with halo 4 forward unto dawn giving this a full score is just cutting it a little short for me i had a hard time deciding what my favorite movie ever was and now i know why my true alltime favorite took almost 20 years to come out for every movie made after this and the people who made them the bar has been raised
Jan 3 2013,positive,a very entertaining and overall solid super hero movie
Jan 3 2013,positive,the first time i saw this film i was left speechless deteriorates the second time
Jan 2 2013,positive,hilarious and awesome
Jan 2 2013,negative,after seeing thor which i loved i was just disappointed in this constant over the top affects sensory overload
Jan 2 2013,positive,stellar acting and scores give way to an even more impressive script that does allows the moviegoer to forget the seemingly basic superhero story and indulge themselves in a truly incredible comedythriller
Jan 2 2013,positive,awsome marvel moviecomplete heroesawesome lokigo nick furyhe made the avengers assemblecool action
Jan 2 2013,positive,an amazing mash up of all the comic characters if you like this then you should definitely consider reading the comics of each or just the avengers comic in general 
Jan 2 2013,positive,just wow what else can i say
Jan 2 2013,positive,good movie worth an evening out
Jan 2 2013,positive,fun movie wish there was more on some of the characters but i guess thats why you watch the individual movies  mark ruffalo is amazing as the hulk so much better than the acting from the hulk movies
Jan 2 2013,positive,no a big marvel fan but this was a fun popcorn munching movie  action movies with super heroes  action movies on their lonesome
Jan 2 2013,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Jan 2 2013,positive,definitely a marvel fan here and i loved it
Jan 1 2013,positive,its hugely entertaining and is no doubly the perfect film for all marvel geeks and even for some people not fans of the universe a
Jan 1 2013,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in awhile
Jan 1 2013,positive,one of the few super hero movies to get it right focuses on the tried and true formula of heroes vs villains and doesnt get bogged down in backstory stays true to the characters which makes their interaction all the more enjoyable and believable
Jan 1 2013,positive,one of the best superhero movies made  the unique personalities and motivations of each of the characters molds together to create a satisfyingly unique comical and actionfilled production  i have to agree with wally pfister that some of the cinematography was clearly for the sake of showing off a fancy set piece rather than driving the story or telling something about a character  not only was the cinematography at times needless but much of the entire film is nothing but mindless entertainment with very little substance to support it  nonetheless it is a very thrilling and exciting movie sure to entertain everyone
Jan 1 2013,positive,i think this is one of the best movies ever made i wasnt a fan of every individual film but together these guys are amazing joss did a wonderful job as he always does and the script was near perfect it was funny suspenseful sad yes i cried and well executed
Jan 1 2013,positive,not only what i was expecting from an avengers movie but also everything i expected from a joss whedon movie as well  and the hulk gives us one of the best moments on film
Jan 1 2013,positive,an incredibly awesome all out action movie in my mind it is the greatest movie i have ever had the pleasure of viewing the characters are all solidother than hawkeye but he can develop over time the story has equal level comic book convolution and equal level awesomeness it is a very very good conclusion to an epic series of films and the good thing isthere are more to come
Jan 1 2013,positive,the biggest mustsee of 2012
Jan 1 2013,positive,one word to describe this movie epic

Dec 31 2012,negative,92 wtf for being far more interesting than the average super hero film ill grant it a 410 its still quite a predictable bore
Dec 31 2012,positive,love this movie also like how the others tie into this one
Dec 31 2012,neutral,its entertaining with its michael bay extravagance
Dec 31 2012,positive,best comic book tiein ever
Dec 31 2012,positive,brilliant story brilliant acting and the special effects are supreme top notch performances from the whole cast even if scarlett johansson is only in it for eye candy
Dec 31 2012,positive,banner aka hulk steals the show but stark and cpt america are fun to watch hating each other
Dec 31 2012,positive,this film was my first marvel movie since spiderman and i must say this film is awesome and made me a marvel fan again
Dec 31 2012,positive,it was a meh movie for me but im not a comic book fan at all  robert downy was pretty funny which lightened the mood of the movie still wouldnt watch the individual movies though but hey ho
Dec 31 2012,positive,lived up to the hype for me  great effects and nice development of the interactions between the members of the avengers  a couple of great tongueincheek momentstwo of my favorites involve the hulk  definitely worth the price of admission
Dec 31 2012,positive,fantastic movie but the death of the agent was unneed he has being in most pf the marvel movie and was sad to see him go
Dec 31 2012,positive,i had a total blast  the superhero nerd in me was more than satisfied
Dec 31 2012,positive,amazing film my faviroute out of any film i as seen i couldnt of been any better
Dec 31 2012,positive,fantastic thats the only word that can describe this movie excellent actors plot action and much more
Dec 31 2012,positive,good but thats all there is to it
Dec 31 2012,positive,film of the year and the film dark knight hoped it could be
Dec 30 2012,positive,not a bad action movie can said it is an best movie of 2012 
Dec 30 2012,positive,by zanele jiane  a bunch of superheroes are put together kicking and screaming in order to defend planet earth from an alien invasion superintended by thors step brother loki loki a norse god is cunning and has an ace up his sleeve all the time but in avengers he met more than his match  although there are many characters in the movie each character shines brilliantly nevertheless thor is dignified and poised as always iron man has his fun at the expense of others shakespeare in the park joke point break jokesall to thors humiliation the hulk revealing his secret hawkeye gets to play both sides of the fence and black widow handles the most challenging part of the gang and captain america taking charge and guiding the rest  avengers is full of energy and drama and has a clear cut premise that the audience will appreciate the effects are delicious and the camera placement during the final battle puts the viewers inside the carnage the visual effects are amazing and leaves nothing to be desired the score is lively the editing is tight enough and renders the movie full circle  highly recommended
Dec 30 2012,neutral,its not exactly the best superhero film of the year but a passable one after scrutinizing it the film has too much of everything yet lacks so other things as well too much visuals too much ridiculous and seemingly meaningless action feats too much cliched punchlines the film lacks plot and realism it seems to be a mere cinematic visual tour de force with nothing much to tell apart from the usual worktogether and goodvsevil aimed to only entertain in which it really did it was entertaining visually but theres nothing special in it for me to actually remember it at all overall its bland filmmaking with visuals and loud sound effects being forced right into your face and ears respectively as a consolation it did what it set out to do entertain
Dec 30 2012,positive,so good it hurts i have been dreaming of a movie like this ever since in was a little boy and it was everything i ever dreamed it would be and more seriously go see it
Dec 30 2012,positive,high on comedy and action lacking on plot and character development
Dec 30 2012,positive,dragged along for a fair bit at the start but livened up to be a great action flick with lots of funny bits
Dec 30 2012,positive,flows nicely and they finally got the hulk right
Dec 30 2012,positive,lots of action little plot i understand that sometimes it takes a movie to introduce all the characters and plot for sequels in the end i hope the next one is better
Dec 30 2012,positive,the avengers lacks nothing in terms of stunning visuals and well orchestrated action somehow i wanted to see more of bruce banner
Dec 30 2012,negative,i went to the movie theatre to see this film in 3d and i was surprised because i had expected something of a classic  based on the 9396  rating on rottentomatoes instead of a 45 star film what i witnessed was a childish spinoff for thor featuring appearances by robert downey jeremy renner samuel l jackson scarlett johansson and gwyneth paltrow  so why not such a blast the film is full of action scenes but it also has some tedious pointless dialogue which doesnt really help in building up excitement or the storyline for that matter abundance of action is an advantage lack of sensible dialogue is a disadvantage tedious slowdowns amidst flying people missiles monsters and airoplanes make it a mixture of fast action moments which are hollow of meaning slowed down by equally empty and meaningless moments of sluggishness  the acting is not bad but it is not anything to write about to the grandchildren either neither is the story which is oddly useless in the way of building the characters or interest even though the characters have a background its really only clear for the moviegoer who has seen thor iron man captain america and hulk the monsters are just a big unknown with no depth at all   the big problem of this movie is its emptiness like a big colorful canister of metal that makes lots of noice it failed to attract mean looks and one or two witty but silly lines with some cool special effects is not enough to save it from being lost in the midst of meaninglessness just a toy show certainly not worthly of over 90 ratings
Dec 30 2012,positive,the finale in this film is fantastic  the ultimate hulk smash 
Dec 29 2012,negative,this is a blockbuster in every sense of the world taking the levels of explosions action and villians to an extreme the avengers in theory has the right recipe for a hit movie but for me the avengers themselves come off as shallow onenote archetypes that never really go anywhere black widow and hawkeye are shoehorned into the story for reasons unclear to me as the film doesnt know what to do with them as the least extrememost human of the bunch i think thats the films biggest problem its so concerned with being super that it loses most of what makes it human
Dec 29 2012,positive,one of the coolest movies and ideas for a movie i think i have ever seen
Dec 29 2012,positive,watch until all the credits roll
Dec 29 2012,positive,action packed and it was great cant wait to see avengers 2
Dec 29 2012,positive,this was an awesome movie and for all comic book fans and movie fans in general its a must watch
Dec 29 2012,negative,worst movie ever there wasnt really a plot it was just screaming and fighting it kinda seemed like i was watching transformers it was too generic i wouldve liked it better if the superheroes actually got a specific power they all had the same fighting technique meh
Dec 29 2012,positive,the avengers is easily the best superhero movie i have ever seen in my life now before christopher nolan fans get mad at me let me clarify that im not counting the batman movies since they are almost a completely different genre and cant really be compared however the avengers was a fantastic film the only down side i can possibly think of is that it makes me not as eager to watch the previous films all of which pale in comparison 
Dec 29 2012,positive,greatly anticipated and absolutely loved it great start to hopefully a new series of comic movies
Dec 29 2012,positive,the avengers rules great movie great cast great effects
Dec 29 2012,positive,its awesome except for the main plot thor and loki are kind of boring
Dec 29 2012,positive,this is the best movie ever no dout about it
Dec 29 2012,positive,well written beautifully choreographed with amazing acting a must own
Dec 29 2012,positive,if you wanted xmen with 10 times the explosions watch avengers edward norton was missed the new guy wasnt bad but norton wouldve been better
Dec 29 2012,positive,if somebody told me 10 years ago that there would be a liveaction marvel avengers movie i would have thought they where insane finally at long last the fans got what they wanted and what they deserved a well thought out story backed up by 5 well done movies that have built up the premise that it was all leading to this movie honestly the best film of 2012 and a movie that not only the kids will enjoy but adults who where fans of the comics at a young age and newcomers to the franchise will still enjoy with open arms
Dec 29 2012,positive,the avengers is an epic motionpicture it has the comicbook atmosphere and great interpretations of marvels characters joss whedon did it extremely right
Dec 29 2012,positive,best film of 2012 period
Dec 29 2012,positive,it was amazing movie
Dec 28 2012,positive,awesome movie i loved it
Dec 28 2012,positive,awesome movie and it was even better in 3d i liked how no one out shined the other âcant wait to see more and this time with wolverine and spiderman toby maguires spiderman 
Dec 28 2012,positive,so good  definitely a great movie for a marvel fan  hulk was particularly funny in certain parts  captain america is fierce
Dec 28 2012,positive,great movie and great actors
Dec 28 2012,positive,a comic book fan s dream come true best action movie of 2012
Dec 28 2012,positive,awesome totally awesome great special effects and a good story line supported by great direction and snappy dialogue from joss whedon this is one of those films where almost every scene and oneliner can become a favorite sowe have a hulk  lol one of the few comic book films that lives up to the hype
Dec 28 2012,positive,best film of 2012 by far unless you hate superheroes
Dec 28 2012,neutral,i enjoyed it the first time around but it is not worth a second watch  if you want to keep thinking its good stop at the first view
Dec 28 2012,positive,unbelievable film just unbelievable the story the action and the sequel leadin
Dec 27 2012,positive,holy shit what a great movie
Dec 27 2012,positive,no doubt one of the best movies
Dec 27 2012,positive,the best mega film of 2012z
Dec 27 2012,positive,very good movie cant wait for the sequel
Dec 27 2012,positive,spectacular this was the culmination of several movies all coming together it was directed wonderfully it had great action and lots of comedic value i could watch this movie again and again must see
Dec 27 2012,positive,i was told this was kidfriendly maybe if your kid is 12
Dec 27 2012,positive,i wont say that this is the best film if the year i love superheroes and this blockbuster although silly is thoroughly enjoyable definitely the funniest comic romp made yet a little more hulk would have made it better but all in all a decent popcorn movie
Dec 27 2012,positive,thoroughly entertaining they pulled off the impossible this could have easily been a cluttered mess of characters doing explosions think transformers 3 but it had some heart and im a geek for comics while i do not agree that it was movie of the year it certainly was excellent and the build up from all the solo flicks was just brilliant unfortunately i fear this is the pinnacle and from here on out the movies will decline
Dec 27 2012,positive,so good entertainment value through the roof i especially love the hulk hammering loki puny godlol
Dec 27 2012,neutral,too much background history looks more like an iron man movie hulk is the movie best supporting character
Dec 27 2012,positive,joss whedon has done the unthinkable by not only making the first good marvel movie for half a decade but by devoting enough screen time to each of these iconic heroes the avengers is a funny action packed thrill ride that just flies by without a single hitch aside from the expendable alien antagonists downey jr deserves special praise but whedon is the star here for sure
Dec 27 2012,positive,this movie is off the fucking chain
Dec 26 2012,positive,really good watch got plenty of action in it  a few surprises loved it
Dec 26 2012,positive,love this movie  plenty of action comedy even and great feel good super hero movie
Dec 26 2012,positive,best super hero movie ever
Dec 26 2012,positive,directed by a nerd loved by everyone
Dec 26 2012,positive,pretty good for a super heroes movie
Dec 26 2012,positive,fun but not great someone needs to explain to chris evans that the cap does not remove his mask that often dude needs to watch dredd to understand its not the actor but the character that matters renner almost put me to sleep as hawk eye ruffalo is so depressing he makes everyone else want to kill themselves johansson is completely useless everyone else was cool and should return for the sequel at the end this was made too family friendly and not dark enough
Dec 26 2012,positive,i really like the avengers great acting great comedy great action but i thought the plot was a little thin ex how can the hulk now be controlled when it represents something that cant and i dont really call it the greatest superhero movie ever more like the most anticipated but everything else was great but i wont give it a 100 or a 90 a 70 or an 80 is a more accurate rating
Dec 26 2012,positive,good movie nicely set up by marvel
Dec 26 2012,positive,dc comics will do justice league way better than this crap
Dec 26 2012,positive,awsome movie but it ended to suddenly so it get 4 stars                                        
Dec 26 2012,positive,great movie for all ages it just took a little too long for the movie to come together
Dec 26 2012,positive,a lot of exposition and setting up before the big fights but it builds nicely and the end fight scene was awesome
Dec 26 2012,positive,great movie cant wait to see the next one
Dec 25 2012,positive,all the super hero action you need
Dec 25 2012,positive,i was surprised about this movie it was really good
Dec 25 2012,positive,they brought all the characters together in a great way and made it make sense
Dec 25 2012,positive,big time awesome
Dec 25 2012,positive,great movie a must see for any age group really brings the characters together without under demeaning any ones role
Dec 25 2012,positive,marvel has actually managed to make a live action interpretation of something that comic readers always have in mind and that is creating a universe from which each character can feed itself to the point where events of this magnitude need only so little to become a reality  avengers is a well made movie in a sense of the light nature of its script and plot in general it has comedy so many action to make your eyes explode and so much superhero fanservice that you wont be able to come out of it with a share of critics to the portrayal of some of them nevertheless it is the perfect overall construction of the movie that make the whole experience worthwhile you can see the whole idea behind it clearly as day and that is an unassuming movie with a lightweight plot and fast pace that only needs a little argumental thread to survive and can easily just focus on action and not any kind of it but superhero action the secret to sustain itself lies in the construction of the movieverse because for the first time the characters dont need to overindulge in mediocre growth thats what their own movies are for overall the movie is nothing exceptional but as i said it is so well made that its impossible to see common flaws only behind the flag of hardcore comic critics or hollywood artsy bullshit critics but as an average comic reader and a funtime looking spectator there was no other experiences like avengers during 2012 theres absolutely no doubt in my mind  in conclusion avengers is a well made movie where all the pieces fall exactly where they belong thus making it a enjoyable fun experience and has the great plus of proving that making a serious statement in comic book movies is totally possible and so avengers and the whole movieverse of marvel studios films have created a new world for comics adaptations and have achieved a new standard for the genre where quality movies come to terms with comics whole way of life
Dec 25 2012,positive,its alright but i kept getting the feeling that it was something i had already seen  maybe i just had high expectations because of everyone hyping it up  although i did especially love everything with the hulk  this might as well be the official hulk movie
Dec 24 2012,positive,i want to rate this movie an 11
Dec 24 2012,negative,with nothing but things blowing up the mains doing nothing but complaining to each other and loki doing nothing but bitch and whine the avengers was extremely disappointing in all aspects
Dec 24 2012,negative,i saw it and it sucked everybody said to watch it it sucked so much
Dec 24 2012,positive,great great movie d  best in 3d
Dec 24 2012,positive,hulk smash loki  fun superhero movie
Dec 24 2012,positive,the nerd in me was incredibly happy during the avengers
Dec 24 2012,positive,a simply fun action movie done well  my one criticism is that the heros invincibility renders pretty much all the action and fighting pointless  but turn your mind off to that and its a wild thrilling ride
Dec 23 2012,positive,wow had lots if fun
Dec 23 2012,positive,one of the best comic book movies ive ever seen
Dec 23 2012,positive,best movie of all time
Dec 23 2012,positive,thrills at every corner the looming threat of cosmic ultimatum and all our favorite heroes and villains colliding into a lot of onscreen brilliance makes the avengers the monumental movie going experience that it is great acting synergy brings the characters to life and the amazing effects and vision make this movie a must see
Dec 23 2012,positive,few films actually embody the acclaim that their hype foretold this is one of the chosen few a film that lacks nothing yet still leaves room for the story to progress is a lacking quality in most superhero movies any sequels to this has been gifted with a beautiful set up and the chancepotential to improve on perfect
Dec 23 2012,positive,this movie moves to number one in superhero movies must watch for everyone
Dec 23 2012,positive,the most anticipated movie of 2012 is definitely one of the best movies of 2012 joss whedons direction makes this an enjoyable film that is easy to follow the story has more than a few plot holes but the chemistry between all the actorscharacters makes up for it editing is top notch and the score fits perfectly with the movie i left the theatre satisfied and excited for the next phase of marvel movies
Dec 23 2012,positive,robert dj steals the show great pace action and laugh out loud gags throughout
Dec 23 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for 2
Dec 22 2012,positive,i really dont like superhero movies as a rule  i went to see this on the day it came out because i heard such insanely good buzz all over reddit  i wasnt disappointed  i didnt like most of the characters but that didnt matter because the screen time is divided up well so that no one obnoxious character is forced on your for an unbearable amount of time  then theres the whedon humor i love whedon humor  okay what really made this movie so good was tom hiddleston  that is some incredibly nuanced acting for a marvel villain  it was a pleasure just watching him do anything
Dec 22 2012,neutral,i suppose as far these movies go its ok but i wasnt interested
Dec 22 2012,positive,great overall comic base moviethe action dont stop from beginning to end
Dec 22 2012,positive,the avengers delivered an iconic blockbuster that surely is an unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre
Dec 22 2012,positive,its one of the best films adapted from a comic book yet
Dec 22 2012,positive,the tesseract has awakened it is on a little world a human world they would wield its power but our ally knows its workings as they never will he is ready to lead and our force our chitauri will follow the world will be his the universe yours and the humans what can they do but burn
Dec 22 2012,positive,this is definitely a whedon film but still very enjoyable the actors performances are good and the production quality is quite good even if the story is thin a great continuation of the recent rush of marvel films and a great summer blockbuster even if it is ultimately forgettable
Dec 22 2012,positive,oh wow  joss whedonrobert downey jreye candy chris evans  chris hemsworthperfect  throw in a shawarma joke and this goes on my keep it forever list
Dec 22 2012,positive,on first viewing i loved it thought it was awesome entertainment but then on repeat viewings the excitement was not there apart from some witty one liners from robert downey jr a visually stunning third act the first 2 thirds are quite bland and hollow  the whole movie itself rests heavily on cgi explosions and robert downey jr
Dec 22 2012,positive,took me 8 months but i finally saw it great movie
Dec 22 2012,positive,this was possibly the best super hero movie ever and it was just as amazing the second time
Dec 22 2012,positive,everybody take note the superhero film genre has just been ramped up a gear or two in fact someone has rammed the throttle into overdrive and that someone is joss whedon   for those of you who donâtmt know who this man is heâtms been around a while but not as famous as other directors first and foremost he is a writer we have him to thank for films like toy story titan ae atlantis and alien resurrection he is also the writing and directing genius behind tv shows like buffy the vampire slayer angel dollhouse and the short lived firefy among others and he is no stranger to directing big action movies he helmed the firefly spinoff movie serenity but this is whedonâtms first big feature film itâtms also his first blockbuster and there is a lot riding on the success of this film   the avengers is a long time coming there have been numerous directors attached to it a number of scripts and of course six other films preceding it i am including the original hulk making it work has been no easy task  each character has their own successful film franchise thor 2 and captain america 2 and iron man 3 are due out in the next two years with plots subplots and narratives that have loosely been tied together with short endofcredits scenes involving nick fury and the avengers initiative  the film has been on marvels radar since iron man first appeared on our screen on in 2008 for the uninitiated the avengers comic was released in 1963 and was titled âearths mightiest heroesâ and starred iron man ant man wasp hulk and thor as an interesting sidenote in issue 4 the avengers find captain america trapped in ice the comic has had a number of incarnations over the years and has spawned a couple of animated series gaining other popular marvel heroes along the way most notably and more recently spiderman and wolverine  in the first issue of the avengers the team are assembled to fight thorâtms brother loki who has used his power of illusion to persuade the hulk onto a part of destruction whedon has used these elements as his inspiration to create a strong script and storyline that successfully pulls together some of cinemas biggest personalities and egos and not only develops their characters further but broadens their appeal  the story is over the top but not enough that you find yourself scoffing the reality is that you need to suspend disbelief when dealing with characters from other worlds aliens and magic and considering the source material lends itself to be over the top anyway the beauty in whedonâtms script is that it never once takes itself seriously spoiler even when sheilds supersized aircraft carrier turns into a flying invisible fortress nick fury states âletâtms danceâ as reflectors cover the ships surface much like a mirrorball rendering it completely invisible to the naked eye over the top hell yes the first act sees the assembly of the avengers the cap and bruce banner are asked to find loki and the tesseract he has stolen from sheild later thor and iron man join the team with hawkeye and black widow what works well is that when the four superheroes and superegos come together each thinks they will save the day but as their egos compete against one another for attention the typical alphamale muchoness comes to the fore causing disunity and damage â a lot of damage  it is not until part the way through the second act that the team pulls together for the greater good which is to save humanity from total destruction at the hand of loki and his alien army  the script is what makes this film and is proof that studios should trust âfanboysâ with comic book adaptions whedon has used his extensive knowledge and passion to write a story that is appealing to all audiences while combining what we love from the original films there are plenty of references to the âprequelsâ and the character traits each has developed and bring with them and for the fans easter egg references to the comics to satiate their appetite it is film is funny very funny the hulk almost steals the show spoiler when he throws loki around like a ragdoll during his âi am a godâ speech but each character gets a few choice lines that will surely become part of our vernacular   at times i thought i was in transformers dark of the moon considering the scale and grandeur of the filmâtms final act â the near destruction of new york although there are hallmarks to dotm avengers is nothing like it in fact whedon proves he is the better director by piecing together huge battle sequences action explosions while ensuring that each character has plenty of screen time that not only makes sense but doesnâtmt get lost in the enormity and scale of it all  the production flawlessly merges cgi and live action together but the 3d conversion leaves little to be desired considering the success of tron legacy i am surprised disney who owns marvel didnâtmt pull out all the stops and have it filmed in 3d  i have long appreciated whedonâtms film making abilities and here he channels the work he made famous in serenity those fast zoom shots of ships exploding are used here but not overdone he also shoots action from interesting and random angles often panning through the back of destroyed cars and broken windows and styling shots that replicate comic book frames which many fans will appreciate but most will miss   the avengers proves that comic book adaptions can work in the right hands and that screenwriters and directors need to have some understanding of what they are working with  this is the best comic book â superhero â film i have seen and is the mark by which all future films will be judged by
Dec 22 2012,positive,awesome movie great storyline funny humor great action good action even girls like it people who are not into action movies would still like it a lot
Dec 21 2012,neutral,didnt quite get the hype
Dec 21 2012,negative,awful dreadful puerile lame stupid laughable the critics must have been paid to give raves for this dreck
Dec 21 2012,positive,amazing movie so worth the extra  to see it imax 3d i would totally pay to see it in the theatre again definitely a must own
Dec 21 2012,positive,very good movie but something stops me from loving it i think im just more of a broody dc guy
Dec 20 2012,positive,the hulk is the daddy
Dec 20 2012,negative,did not enjoy it all spoiler alert its retarded
Dec 19 2012,positive,a great popcorn flick that will satisfy every movie goer
Dec 19 2012,positive,just plain out awesome
Dec 19 2012,positive,refreshingly clever script great film see it
Dec 19 2012,positive,brofist to mr whedon
Dec 19 2012,positive,just great all around
Dec 19 2012,positive,ridiculous and fab at the same time
Dec 19 2012,positive,this movie was very well put together the story made sense and all the tie in elements were very well explained my 3 year old made watch this movie like 12 times
Dec 19 2012,positive,read my review more easily here as part of the summer 2012 series 
Dec 19 2012,positive,ironman and thor were my favorite
Dec 18 2012,positive,ive seen it and had to watch a couple more times the adrenaline rush during the action scenes are top notch and the underline theme of this movie is spot on it was excellent
Dec 18 2012,negative,visual and technological overkill way too long and zero emotional bonding with any personthing to care one bit who wins in the end it was visually appealing although the 3d was nothing special all the special effects were integrated perfectly but it lacks soulall the humans might just as well been machines right along with all the other animated metal special effects and explosions alone do not make for a memorable movie experience
Dec 18 2012,positive,its a beast of a movie when i say something is a beast its official in awesomeness
Dec 18 2012,positive,for someone who had directed just one film in his career joss whedon did himself credit in the spotlight as the man in charge of the avengers  if you have seen serenity or even his tv series firefly you know this guy can tell story and keep an audience interested  if i throw in that he wrote the screenplay for the original toy story that should get you involved even more    led by robert downey jr and the immaculate chris hemsworth the avengers is a phenomenal display of superhero power and finesse  with the spicy script great special effects and the favorite marvel characters coming together it hits the mark
Dec 18 2012,positive,ummm it was entertaining to watch at first but now that ive seen it multiple times its not that good the first hour is kinda boring  rest of it was entertaining  did anyone realize  that captain america never really did anything he was just sorta there hulk was kinda ehhhh no ok lets be honest this was just iron man 3 and friends its definitely not the best super hero movie ever that many people claim it to be im not saying it was a bad movie im not saying that at all it was good but it didnt live up to the hype looks good on bluray  though
Dec 18 2012,positive,best super hero movie wish capt america was real
Dec 18 2012,positive,this might have been the most entertaining and humorous movie of the summer its a pretentious movie and makes no excuses about some of the ridiculousness unlike battleship as usual robert downey jr carries the entire movie on his shoulders the rest of the cast is more of a supporting role the avengers are from the marvel comics of my childhood and joss whedon delivered 120 on those expectations cant wait for the next installment
Dec 17 2012,positive,great comic book film i couldnt have asked for a better supers team up movie
Dec 17 2012,positive,welcome to super hero madness where the beginning brings in a promising tale that no super hero will get along but in the end everything works out action is sorted out quite beautifully while emotions can play a great deal throughout the movie at the right places at the right times 
Dec 17 2012,positive,the whole time the movie was playing i felt like little progress was being made  the action sequences are top notch but forgettable  i cant say i was pleased with how this turned out  it was just ok in my opinion
Dec 17 2012,positive,the comic book flicks are showing viewers  theyre not a fad of the last decade the avengers is a great example of that  as long as they continue to be entertaining with a great storylines which marvel has countless amounts of then im gonna continue to pay to watch them
Dec 17 2012,neutral,as good as joss whedon movies get
Dec 17 2012,positive,love joss whedons work
Dec 17 2012,positive,the best superhero team up movie ever hopefully future hero group movies take notes from this one are ya listening fantastic four reboot
Dec 17 2012,positive,great movie joss wheaton is a genius
Dec 16 2012,neutral,a pretty shitty affair
Dec 16 2012,negative,i wasnt going to watch this film mainly because i my inner critic was already cautioning me against subjecting myself to the experience i should have listened to my inner critic this film gets one star for the awesome cgi and half a star for iron man the other half star goes to hulk for smashing loki and then at the very end punching thor hard i enjoyed iron mans wisecracks but as for the rest the dialogue made absolutely no sense and characters absolutely lacked any motivation im sorry i dont buy the im going to conquer the world because ive got problems with selfworth so yeah if you like lots of explosions and attempts at humour with witty oneliners this one will appeal to your inner twelveyearold i wont be watching the sequel and im going to bite the friend who suggested that the first was any good and that i watch it
Dec 16 2012,positive,solid solid excellent work this is one of those times where i want to give it a 90 because i know how difficult it to write an ensemble story line with multiple characters and give each character their due but they some how did it with this also the special effects and cgi were excellent one of the best moments in the film was when the hulk beat the living hell out of loki like he was a rag doll now while the film did all these things and did them well for me personally it was good but still typical which i hate to say it almost makes me feel pretentious maybe there is no way around that typical is typical and i feel like 90  100 films need to be special maybe part 2 will do that good movie good concept watch it
Dec 16 2012,positive,great superhero movie after watching all the buildup movies this one paid off pretty well badass fight scenes good writing loki getting smashed to a pulp by hulk all good
Dec 16 2012,positive,grew up with marvel and dc as a young kid and love seeing it now33 its so exciting seeing it from comic to real life
Dec 16 2012,positive,at its best when it lets the heroes bicker and banter among themselves though the surprisingly underdefined alien threat means it fails to live up to its full potential
Dec 16 2012,positive,great superhero film one of my favourite films the last 30 minutes especially is just epic
Dec 16 2012,positive,joss whedon gives us a 2 12 hour epic thats well deserved and wanted by fans whedon does an excellent job of making every character relevant and interesting which is a high point with so many larger than life characters on one title and leaves you yearning for more in the best of ways
Dec 16 2012,positive,amazing movie the hulk finally gets the true role he desrvespuny humans
Dec 16 2012,neutral,i am literally the only one on this planet that found the avengers such a huge disappointment
Dec 16 2012,positive,awesome movie hands down hulk smash
Dec 16 2012,positive,i thought this was a great movie knowing the back stories of the characters definitely helped but i really thought each characters were played very well and the movie really came together to become its own the action and visual effects were obviously a highlight and the comedic comments and personalities keeps you entertained throughout im surprised i didnt watch is sooner as it actually exceeded my expectations and i look forward to watching it again another day
Dec 16 2012,positive,marvel has finally done they have made the best comic book movie ever with a epic showdown
Dec 16 2012,positive,i have no words but an unstoppable force of awesomeness best super hero movie ever it is certainly deserve 10 out of 10
Dec 15 2012,positive,spectacular hands down for this masterpiece
Dec 15 2012,positive,one of my absolute favorite movies i seen it 3 times when it was in theaters
Dec 15 2012,negative,i was shocked at how average this movie was the fx where equally bad and inconsistant however it had a couple of good moments how on earth this is considered a good movie is beyond me
Dec 15 2012,negative,this movie is so ludicrous its not even funny its just another run of the mill superhero movie nothing new here
Dec 15 2012,positive,best of the marvel movies
Dec 15 2012,neutral,good job connecting the stories of all the heroes but come up with a more interesting plot i enjoyed the heroes more when iron man was fighting terrorists and captain america was fighting nazis you in my opinion didnt need to bring another overrated alienfighting movie into the mix sure the action scenes are cool but most of the time i sat there bored
Dec 15 2012,positive,too many loved or not comic characters together trying to fight evil and save the world its been a while i have seen it but i remember i liked it i really found usefull how hulk controls his anger
Dec 15 2012,positive,the thor is so sexy i watched this movie several times just to see him again
Dec 14 2012,positive,funny and intense but bordering on selfindulgent great film nonetheless
Dec 14 2012,positive,its about as close to a perfect superhero movie as were going to get fun selfaware nerdy fantastic special effects and full of basically the most attractive actors known to man the pacing never lets up and the avengers has single handledly made superheros cool again plus effectively pulling together several different standalone films is a genuinely cool cinematic task
Dec 14 2012,positive,fantastic film can not want for next
Dec 14 2012,positive,cant believe that our superheroes cant even maintain a moment of seriousness when the world is in trouble 
Dec 13 2012,positive,i have no idea how they could have made a better film other than a certain agents fate
Dec 13 2012,negative,this movie is insanely overrated it was exactly what i expected it to be a typical generic summer blockbuster with typical cheap laughs and boring action sequencesthe build up was dull just the avengers meeting up and angry at each other loki and his army were dull antagonists and the hulk easily crushing loki was lame too do yourself a favor and see dredd 3d the dark knight rises  or even the amazing spider man over this
Dec 13 2012,positive,when i first saw the trailer for the avengers my initial reaction was what in the world are they thinking  combining the recent marvel characters from their top blockbusting films into one 2  12 hour film  but marvel truly outdid itself with this one  all the characters get just enough screen time to pull off a believable mashup of power that left me wanting more  i caught this in 3d imax in nashville and even two weeks after the release it was a sold out audience  the 3d wasnt too bad but i wish the whole novelty of 3d would fade  the music score was breathtaking and fit perfectly with every scene  marvel knows exactly what they are doing with this franchise  i have to admit i wasnt a big fan of the thor or captain america films  however after watching the avengers i find myself hoping for future sequels individually as well as avengers 2  great film well worth your time
Dec 13 2012,positive,singing were in this together now
Dec 13 2012,positive,hulk and iron man completely stole the show but i loved it
Dec 12 2012,positive,waited for this film since 2008  they dd a great job combining all five films into one incredible action packed thrill ride  another big plus was the humor throughout it
Dec 12 2012,positive,suprised that i really loved it xd
Dec 12 2012,positive,the avengers is a popcorn movie full of oneliners cheesy jokes and little substance  but thats okay because the film knows exactly what it is and doesnt try to be anything else its just a load of fun  there is no complex storyline to follow there is very little character development and the premise is very cliché  yet in the end you are almost guaranteed to have a good time  the best thing about the film is that it established the marvel cinematic universe and opens more doors to new opportunities with other comic book characters  lets cross our fingers and hope that other heroes like spiderman or the fantastic four will get a chance to appear in one of these films someday
Dec 11 2012,positive,a great movie with great  charactersgood performances and very entertaininga must watch
Dec 11 2012,positive,holy heck what an amazing moviehas amazing superheroesgood graphics and good storylive even though its about rescuing the tessaractstillamazing
Dec 11 2012,positive,being a comic book geek this is one of my favourite films great cast superb acting and one hell of a story
Dec 11 2012,negative,lets face it watching mr indestructible 1 and mr indestructible 2 fighting for 2 hr 22 minutes isnt interesting
Dec 11 2012,positive,being a comic book geek this is one of my favourite films great cast superb acting and one hell of a story
Dec 11 2012,positive,a really great movie packed full of memorable scenes  and an awesome script 
Dec 11 2012,positive,i had no idea the avengers would be everything it was cracked up to be hollywood actually blew their wad on something definitely worthwhile this time theres not a boring moment in it thanks to genuine consideration for the contrasts and chemistry between all the heroes uniting to share the screen together some work well with others some dont and it always makes sense which is which its exciting long before the massdestruction climax as joss whedon treats us to an endlessly entertaining rendition of the seven samurai structure of introducing everybody and laying down the plot points without being lame or bythenumbers about it
Dec 11 2012,positive,lots of action some laughs lots of fun  one of the best super hero films ever
Dec 10 2012,positive,this is the perfect superhero movie because it brings the hulk iron man thor captain america black widow and hawk eye all together in one amazingly epic movie this is actually one of my favorite movies of all time
Dec 10 2012,positive,a good action movie with adequate humor in the right places that is sure to make just about anyone laugh
Dec 10 2012,positive,great visual effectsdecent storygreat fantasy charactersbit slow in places but overall a decent filmgood superhero movie not great but good
Dec 10 2012,positive,robert downey stole the film it was great summer movie
Dec 10 2012,positive,i really like joss whedon and superhero movies  but i just am not interested in any of the avengers really its really more that their particular superhero powers are weak compared to pretty much every other superhero ive seen in the genre and for that its hard for me to really dig this the way everyone else seemed to  xmen superman batman spiderman all so much better to me  i dont want to say it wasnt entertaining  just wasnt as epic as friends and the critics seemed to think it was
Dec 9 2012,positive,the ending was really entertaining but i thought it dragged on so long till the film reached the final battle there were moments were i was so bored with the film i found myself more entertained looking at the floor then at the screen
Dec 9 2012,positive,i so love this movie
Dec 9 2012,positive,this movie was undoubtedly awesome from the fantastic cast line up to the breath taking action scenes   audiences always love it when there favorite characters come from different films and merge into one kick ass movie and this film is not different the only reason this movie is not a 5 star movie for me is because of the way loki is bluntly portrayed  the film is lead by brilliant actors robert downey jr and samuel l jackson with supporting actors such as chris hemsworth and scarlette johanson with supporting actors as good as these you cant get much of a better movie than this
Dec 9 2012,negative,an overlong cheesy borefest choc full of cliches and bad dialog that fails to provide a single shining moment to back up how incredibly well received it was  it is the comic book movie equivalent of new years eve or valentines day  i cant wait to see which awesome superhero pops up next to save the scene  its mildly amusing at best laughable at worst but mostly just bland  at least it looks pretty
Dec 9 2012,positive,boring trite mostly humorless absentminded predictable tired cliched action sequences okay at best imo shawarma was probably the funniest scene
Dec 9 2012,positive,saw the avengers on saturday and the movie is well worth the wait its the greatest marvel movie all time and comes really close to being the greatest superhero movie ever the hulk truly steals the flick unexpectedly cant wait for round 2 now bring on batman
Dec 9 2012,positive,i admit to not being a fan of the superhero comics that said you can definitely appreciate the fact that i gave this movie for all its cheesy dialogue stupidpredictable plot points and onedimensional villains the high rating i did because despite all that it certainly became a rare guilty pleasure right alongside the first superman movie
Dec 9 2012,positive,the most awesome action superhero movie of all time
Dec 9 2012,positive,after being hinted at for quite some time and having been 4 years in the making the avengers delivers its a game being funny actionpacked and a pleasing superhero party that will please fans of all ages
Dec 9 2012,positive,one of the greatest super hero movies to date
Dec 9 2012,positive,aside from some impossibly bad dialogue and unthreatening antagonists the film manages to deliver in a way youre not likely to experience with wb it embraces the fact that its a super hero movie runs with the premise and leads to a conclusion all too satisfying to find fault with
Dec 9 2012,positive,frikkin awesome i watch it over and over 3
Dec 9 2012,positive,oh my jesus this movie was amazing great action and comedy all mixed into one couldnt be better
Dec 8 2012,positive,overstretched sequences seemed necessary in such a simplified story yet offered me no sense of connection care or intrigue as this movie is far from the epic youd want and expect theres a real hero who saved this production joss whedon this movie knows its not about the delivery of something pure powerful and viewers can use to reflect in our world its all about the entertainment quality and yes the direction of these hugely iconic superheroes was extremely engaging with fun witty dialog within the interactions and arguments of these characters but the movies tone pace and story is nothing more than averagely entertaining and if not sometimes dragging its simplicity in which people seem to be attracted to will give it its success yet for those many insightful ones nothing is here except brawny and brained superheroes clashing and fighting an exciting summer blockbuster however marvellous it is not
Dec 8 2012,positive,amazing  cant wait for the next one
Dec 8 2012,positive,who would have thought that the man behind buffy the vampire slayer would be chosen to both write and direct the avengers that man has delivered probably the most entertaining superhero movie of all time the fact that he was able to bring such big names and egos together and manages to fit in some clever lines laughs and action sequences is a testament to his skills the studio should beg him to return for the eventual sequels though i donâtmt see how you can beat this effort  the star of the show is the best actor in the movie robert downey jr his characterâtms comedic wit never gets old and few actors can match his charisma i also have to give a shout out to mark ruffalo who probably played bruce banner better than anyone in my opinion much to my surprise and when his character transforms into the hulk it brings forth the movieâtms best moments even the interaction between starkiron man and bannerhulk was extremely effective  moreover capt america and thor do fine in fact they were more effective here than in their solo movie efforts also i am glad they picked hiddleston who plays the villain loki the only good thing about the thor movie he is a good actor and is effective despite his cliche âtakeover the worldâtm objective  overall whedon has taken the simplest of plots good vs bad and infused it with clever lines and wellthought out action sequences yes itâtms possible to do that michael bay to deliver perhaps the most perfect entertainer imaginable
Dec 8 2012,positive,the greatest action film of all time it made othe action films after this quite dull in comparison this is one for the books and one that has a fantastic sence of humor
Dec 8 2012,positive,loved it i cant wait until the next one comes out
Dec 8 2012,positive,fun not sure it lives up to the hype but i did enjoy it fantastic 3d effects
Dec 8 2012,positive,ive deduction one half of a star for captain americas suit otherwise brilliantly executed
Dec 8 2012,positive,great movie the hulk stole the show powerful funny with an action packed adventure best two plus hours i had this weekend wow
Dec 8 2012,positive,heres a tip watch the movie thor and 50 percent of the movie will make more sense but this movie is a definite must see
Dec 8 2012,positive,very cool theres not one scene that bores you or doesnt have a taste of action
Dec 8 2012,negative,not that good the dark knight rises was way better this movie had a whole bunch of lame and corny jokes
Dec 8 2012,positive,awesome movie definitely a must see loved the hulk special effects were great all around good movie cast was great together cant wait for a sequel at least i hope theyll be 1 very pleased with this movie and audience really seemed to get into it at the theater myself included
Dec 8 2012,positive,a warm combination of marvel characters to produce something spectacular
Dec 8 2012,positive,smash bang kerpow a truly wonderful ensemble superhero movie it screams blockbuster and hits the spot
Dec 8 2012,negative,better than expected from the plot but still a essentially a kids movie if you were hoping for something different
Dec 8 2012,positive,100 of action and the world has never been full of heroes
Dec 8 2012,negative,muligvis den dårligste superhelte filmatisering de seneste par år der er en grund til at the avengers tegneserien aldrig blev rigtig populær uden for usa   possible the worst superhero movie adabtion in the last couple of years there is a reason for why the avengers comic newer really became popular outside the usa
Dec 7 2012,positive,though the movie is awesome  like really really awesome  its not perfect there are some yawnworthy bits of dialogue and the story is sometimes justmeh regardless the action sequences are fantastically directed and the visual effects are inspired to say the least 88510 depending on how i feel on the given day
Dec 7 2012,positive,good action ironman was the best
Dec 7 2012,positive,hey where was superman shouldnt he have been around to fight zod and his army a competent entertaining film following the old pattern of evil edward scissorhands bringing a mutant metal ghost army through a portal ripped by a very strong led with batman flying a nuke to safety you think im confused well apart from this being a glorification of smash everything using very impressive cgi  there was little substance to this film the avengers kinda assembled unnaturally doesnt come close to xmen in depth of character  iron man stole the show costumes were on the whole ropey apart from iron man captain americas costume was utterly ridiculous youll love this film but will come back feeling there was too much bang and needed a little more heart
Dec 7 2012,positive,avengers is a great action movie however while the action is good the comedy is what makes it a truly amazing flick i still laugh at the puny god scene
Dec 7 2012,positive,one of the greatest superhero films ever made the avengers is an awesome movie the plot may be a little thin but the script is well written the actors are brilliant in portraying our heroes in this superpowered epic this is a film that doesnt take itself too seriously and i think that we still havent seen the best that marvel has to offer with this franchise it is a wonderful time to be a comic book fan and i want to thank marvel studios for their attention to detail
Dec 7 2012,positive,im afraid it didnt do much for me after all the hype i think i expected too much there were a couple of good lines of dialogue but my overall impression was that it was just another action movie better than captain america but to be honest i enjoyed thor more
Dec 7 2012,positive,i wanted so much more from this movie it was a great movie but im left disappointed because it is still lacking for me the storyline is just underdeveloped it need an edge to because it just felt like one more superhero movie when it should have been the ultimate superhero film its the avengers for crying out loud
Dec 6 2012,positive,quite possibly the most entertaining superhero film ever made  so far yes it doesnt have the same depth of character as xmen first class or the visual artistry and  nuance of the dark knight but i had a great time watching it  breathtaking special effects the hulk was probably my favourite character in the film i was never a huge fan of the hulk but mark ruffalos interpretation and joss whedons script has produced the best version so far   speaking of script you have to be impressed with a movie with this amount of characters yet everyone always has something pertinent entertaining and often funny to say
Dec 6 2012,positive,could be the best movie of the year
Dec 6 2012,positive,action packed with great characters from start to finish
Dec 6 2012,positive,it is one of those rare blockbusters that actually work if only for its aesthetic or tied by its script that gives him the luxury of taking several comic relief
Dec 6 2012,positive,the avengers are fantastic  i thought it was so good  as close to perfection as a multiple superhero movie could be  i was a little worried going in that there wouldnt be a balance between all the heroes and their abilities that one would be the clear hero but joss whedon wrote a very well balanced script with a clear plot and a great threat to the earth that the heroes would have to be assembled to fight against  a good chunk of the script also dealt with the conflict within the group itself which lead to some really fun scenes  that is the other thing that made the movie great  the right amount of humour  i could certainly see joss whedons touch  somewhat reminiscent of josss buffy the vampire slayers humour  i could easily see this again and i imagine a lot of people will see it multiple times which will continue to gross even more money than it already has  crazy  but so worth it
Dec 6 2012,positive,this movie blew away my expectations and then some
Dec 6 2012,positive,it was good and a fun movie
Dec 6 2012,positive,joss whedon two on two
Dec 6 2012,positive,good special effects
Dec 5 2012,positive,for once i cannot describe the movie that i watched well almost twpo words do the movie justice epic nerdgasm
Dec 5 2012,positive,great idea executed wonderfully
Dec 5 2012,positive,ironman thor and hulk saving the world oh captian america helped too avengers done right great movie
Dec 5 2012,positive,this is the superhero movie that many didnt think could happen stays true to the characters and is great fun witty actionpacked fun awesome summer movie powerhouse
Dec 5 2012,positive,its fun but becomes another typical marvel superhero movie that doesnt do anything special aside from putting these characters together the middle drags down the movie and the final action scene doesnt make a lick of sense none of that is what matters and at the end of the day its exactly what it needed to be
Dec 5 2012,positive,great movie the total package  will see it for a 3rd time with my daughters this weekend
Dec 5 2012,positive,awesome really good movie got to watch it on bluray no way else
Dec 5 2012,positive,the best superhero movie of all time and was not broken by the hype everyone in the theater was cheering over this fine marvel of a movie pun intended
Dec 5 2012,positive,after watching with an antibiassed attitude a deserved block buster why cant dc makes movies like this one
Dec 4 2012,negative,the dialogue and storyline are so elementary that a five year old could think this up i actually got bored in the middle of the movie additionally it seems like every character is a form of tony starks sarcasm even the hulk  last time i checked bruce banner was a nerd not a cynical person in the comics and why the hell do you need to play acdc every time tony stark enters a scene
Dec 4 2012,neutral,i am a joss whedon fan so i could see a lot of him in it the effects were pretty awesome a little slow in the beginning but when it picks up it was great samuel l jackson is amazing
Dec 4 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
Dec 4 2012,positive,amazing movie the story is great the acting is top notch and the action is unrivaled better than i expected it to be
Dec 4 2012,positive,a well put together action packed flick a must see
Dec 4 2012,positive,entertaining but its a little overrated
Dec 4 2012,positive,slow beginning to middle in the eyes of one who isnt passionate about superhero movies but very entertaining afterwords
Dec 4 2012,positive,the avengers is indeed enjoyable as an entertainment it seems very funny i technically smirk when i watched this movie i think the movie concentrated way too much on the conflicts of the members of the avengers their fights made them look like idiots even though the world is going to end they still can think like kids and fight each other and i dont accept the excuse of the presence of lokis scepter instead to put every conflict down first and save the world only one word to express this seriously anyway if you are those dontreallylookdeepintomovies kind of person then this movie can be considered favourable
Dec 3 2012,positive,this movie shows all the famous superheroes fighting side to side i found it really exciting but funny at the same time the ending was a bit confusing but in the end good movie
Dec 3 2012,positive,amazing film  totally packed with action boy film loved it
Dec 3 2012,positive,film was fun to watch but didnt feel as though the characters in this had any real threat with the villains loki and aliens good but had the feeling of was that all by the end
Dec 3 2012,positive,expected it to be good but it was bloody brilliant to say the least
Dec 2 2012,positive,greatest movie ever period
Dec 2 2012,positive,mainly just action no real story to it they just came up with a shallow reason for all the action heroes to come together
Dec 2 2012,positive,just sheer epicness
Dec 2 2012,positive,great movie 5 stars in my book lots and lots of nostop action
Dec 1 2012,positive,fangirlboy heaven and just a really fun movie besides
Dec 1 2012,positive,kool as hell great family guy or kid movie
Dec 1 2012,positive,a perfect superhero movie with exciting characters  breathtaking action and some bad ass visuals  avengers is the best film of marvels phase one and probably the best superhero movie of all times
Dec 1 2012,positive,it takes its time to settle down but this seriously has one of  the best takeithome blowthefuckingroofoff ejaculateallovertheplace third acts ive ever seen in an actionadventure film crazy stupid hilarious fun with a perfect amount of fan service you crazy for this one joss whedon
Dec 1 2012,positive,the same cookie cutter underdeveloped oneliner heavy fare as every other marvel flick
Dec 1 2012,positive,not bad at all although they could have kept captain americas suit the same from before
Dec 1 2012,positive,if you are into super hero movies this will be a great pick great plot for the hulk
Dec 1 2012,positive,the avengers is driven by its strong character development and immaculate script ive never seen so many characters execute their purpose so well although a more colourful and fun superhero movie than chris nolans dark knight trilogy it never takes itself too seriously by offering a genuine humour in this already flawless script
Dec 1 2012,positive,amazing film everyone should watch it including mavel fans
Dec 1 2012,positive,the movie plays out like a comic book and has the same feel  theres some drama between the characters but ultimately the movie does what it promises to do  show a lot of really cool action scenes back dropped by a really expensive set
Dec 1 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Dec 1 2012,positive,now this is a superhero movie i now have a taste for some shwarma thanks tony
Dec 1 2012,positive,i liked it very much it had actionadventureand suspence it was nice to watch with family and friends
Dec 1 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Dec 1 2012,positive,a cinematic masterpiece no its not an art house film but it is a work of art and we know that its based on superheroes but its definitely got something for everyone this is marvels landmark film
Dec 1 2012,positive,marvel is the best if you havent seen it  u need to
Nov 30 2012,positive,i liked it but left a little to be desired in terms of a story
Nov 30 2012,positive,just lots of fun and entertainment the whole time
Nov 30 2012,neutral,dont get me wrong i liked iron man the incredible hulk and captain america the first avenger iron man 2 and thor were disappointing in my opinion but i was still anxiously awaiting the avengers now after having watched a couple of times i can soundly say that the avengers is a disappointment  while the avengers isnt all bad it fails in many departments for starters loki is a terrible villain he never felt like a threat and neither did the chitauri army which appears in the films final act without explanation there is lack of suspense and the film suffers as a result  meanwhile the plot is also contrived and clichéd the death of agent coulson kind of fails to evoke any emotion as he isnt fully developed as a character for some strange reason mark ruffalos bruce banner can now control his powers for the sake of the story the main heroes fight among themselves before finally realizing that theyre all being selfish the story here is nothing more than the good guys versus the bad guys something that has been seen countless times before  the performances meanwhile are passable but not commendable robert downey jr has the pleasure of saying some of the films best lines but at times it feels like the movie revolves around him mark ruffalo does an okay job as bruce banner but i dare say that i wouldve preferred edward norton meanwhile the two chrises do the best with what their given compared to scarlett johansson who merely serves as eye candy and jeremy renner who is largely forgotten as hawkeye  the movie ends with the same actionpacked explosionfest that has ended so many past hollywood blockbusters yet despite the caliber of the people involved with the avengers the finale feels like something out of the transformers movies which isnt really the best comparison  all in all the avengers is a disappointing entry in the marvel cinematic universe although it offers some witty dialogue every now and then along with the occasionally exciting action sequence it is bogged down by clichéd storytelling and a remarkably weak villain considering this film cost 225 million it couldve been much better  510
Nov 30 2012,positive,the best movie i have ever seen
Nov 30 2012,positive,funny as all get out
Nov 30 2012,positive,cant get any better
Nov 30 2012,negative,the hype about the avengers is merely justified by the action sequences the plot which was nonexistence none of the characters were developed my question is what about the characters the hulk whom we havent seen in a while was barely ever on screen he could control himself now we should have more of that
Nov 30 2012,positive,with all your favorite superheros jampacked into one film whats not to like about marvels the avengers an actionfilled experience with awesome special effects made it great to watch
Nov 30 2012,positive,great if you want to have some fun it s the perfect movie
Nov 30 2012,positive,ok well done but not for me
Nov 30 2012,positive,great movie for marvels and superheros fans starsstudded entertaining spectacular
Nov 30 2012,positive,review at 
Nov 30 2012,positive,the greatest superheroes movies of all time im glad it lived up to the expectations
Nov 30 2012,positive,well despite some bad casting choices namely chris hemsworth mark ruffalo seriously they should have brought back norton as the hulk as he made the character likable unlike ruffalo who gives off this creepy awkward pedo vibe throughout the film chris evans who needs to stop being in superhero movies already and of course sammuel l jackson as nick fury now all the actors mentioned above other than jackson were not good in the film and were all rather unlikable they have thor who just says his lines louder and hammier when he is trying to act all angry which honestly made me laugh when i saw this movie and when i saw that terrible thor movie i already explained ruffalo chris evans is just not a good actor he always comes off as a smarmy douche even when not in a fantastic 4 movie jackson was good but he was a bad casting choice for nick fury you need more like jeffrey dean morgan who would have been perfect for the roll jackson did a decent job with his role however this movie was really about loki and tony stark that is who people care about in this film now i was never an iron man fan as a kid and i used to actually hate loki and i liked thor however in this film they make loki in a way where you kind of want to root for him you feel bad for him if you saw the thor movie  he also has this onscreen presence that is just amazing no matter what the scene is he takes it and makes it his own his acting was so brilliant i was near convinced that he was less acting and more just living the character tony really steals the show from the rest of the avengers since most of them are less than likable so the movie felt like iron man 2 12 not that i am complaining about tony stealing the show as he and loki were what was so great about the film in the first place honestly they should just have dropped all the other avengers as no one with any taste likes them in this movie anyway
Nov 29 2012,negative,offers nothing newjust the same old predictable story showing a bunch of usa badasses saving the worldpoor character developmentthe movie doesnt make u feel for any of the charactersand the film is needlessly long i thinkbut there r some good action sequences and cgi are impressivebut that doesnt make up for the overall failure of the movie
Nov 29 2012,negative,pure entertainment and thats all to it i would have liked to see the director take a little bit more risks as to the characters and the story oh well i guess therell be another avengers movie where they can try it
Nov 29 2012,positive,great actionloved it
Nov 29 2012,positive,amazing epic must own
Nov 29 2012,positive,awsome movie cant waight for 2 to come out
Nov 29 2012,positive,really good very entertaining
Nov 29 2012,positive,the avengers was probably the best non realistic super hero film that ive ever seen logic tells me that these powers and capabilities are not possible but it did not stop me from enjoying the film any less well done guys
Nov 29 2012,positive,me and husband really enjoyed the film so many of them together in one film need i say more 
Nov 29 2012,positive,highly entertaining i still have an issue with the whole nordic mythology interacting with the more realistic superheroes but it didnt bother me as much as i expected while sitting in the cinema it puzzled me why a lot of the audience did a lot of giggling and laughing in the heroicpatrioticamericanized scenes what did they expect a serious realistic film its a marvel superhero film its suppose to be like that more please 
Nov 29 2012,positive,a worth watching
Nov 29 2012,positive,i cannot express how much i love the actor who plays loki
Nov 29 2012,positive,its just mostly fighting but good
Nov 29 2012,positive,best super hero movie yet i rented and watched it over and over
Nov 29 2012,positive,the avengers is the best superhero movie ive ever seen the movie is not boring this movie had a lot of action funny humour and fantastic and wellmaded actors the interesting thing in the movie is when the marvel superheros like iron man captain america thor the hulk hawkeye and black widow are working together to save the world see this film rankning four strong stars
Nov 28 2012,negative,a lot of smash mouth specaill effects and sappy one liners too long and boring
Nov 28 2012,positive,awesome action played the character roles well loved the brother like rivalry between hulk and thor hulk had attitude and rocks  iron man played the sarcastic billionaire that makes his character funny and witty
Nov 28 2012,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Nov 28 2012,neutral,i did not really care for this movie it was definitely bellow my expectations
Nov 28 2012,positive,great mindless action but im hugely disappointed that there isnt much of the dialogue and absolutely none of the deep story which i have come to expect from whedon films in fact there was no point in the story where i felt like whedon wrote that like there was with cabin in the woods which he didnt even direct still great mindless action
Nov 28 2012,positive,a fan boys dream this film is filled with so much eye candy and so many witty one liners that youll forget that it has virtually no plot  youll also not notice the lack of character development amongst the ridiculous amounts of action and fan service  its hard to laud the film for treating its audience with such cloaked contempt  then again its hard to condemn the film when so many will assuredly enjoy it
Nov 28 2012,positive,absolutely loved it
Nov 28 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies 
Nov 27 2012,positive,needed more robert downey jr and mark ruffalokind of a slow start but the ending was bombastic
Nov 27 2012,positive,amazing everything a super hero movie should be
Nov 27 2012,positive,i liked it but there were parts that made me start to snooze when the backstories of all the characters are so intricate and they have to explain them throughout the movie it just gets boring i also like a movie with comic relief and unfortunately iron man just couldnt hold it up all by himself that said im glad i saw it but its not on my list of movies i need to see again
Nov 27 2012,positive,pretty fun ride does everything its supposed to that said it isnt better than sliced bread  or free tacos ill only watch it again when the boy will want to
Nov 27 2012,positive,excellent movie definitely well done and worth seeing
Nov 27 2012,positive,possibly overhyped for me slow at first but picks up as it goes along enjoyed robert downey jr and the schwarma sp
Nov 27 2012,positive,although i was expecting more with the complexities of all the different characters this movie still did not disappoint high impact action wonderful story line excellent fight scenes one thing why samuel l jackson with his recent onslaught of terrible movies it kinda ruined the impactfulness of his role when they were in the zeppelin all i thought was snakes on a plane
Nov 27 2012,positive,awesome comic book movie
Nov 27 2012,positive,watched it like 5 xs great all the way
Nov 27 2012,positive,lives up to the hype thanks to the hulkbruce banner surprise
Nov 27 2012,positive,not what i expected two hours wasnt enough it seemed rushed
Nov 27 2012,positive,disney did a great job with this one best super hero movie i have seen in a loooong time
Nov 27 2012,negative,lacks a developed storyline meaning that it wasnt enjoyable however if youre just looking for a film with a bunch of explosions and fight scenes youll like this
Nov 27 2012,positive,simply one of the best comic book adaptations in a long while the high action and humor that holds the plot together as the characters become more integrated and the hulk ruffalo who becomes the films smartest addition and a surprising highlight as well as natashablack widow portrayed by scarlett johansson who after her role in iron man 2 exerts her force as one of the most brilliant and believable female superheroes and robert downey jr as always is exceptional as the iron man
Nov 26 2012,positive,cant wait for part two
Nov 26 2012,positive,3 stars for the action robert was funny as always scarlett was pretty cool hulk was insane
Nov 26 2012,positive,better than most superhero movies i have seen as of latea marvel to watch for action fans
Nov 26 2012,positive,hilarious and very entertaining
Nov 26 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever
Nov 26 2012,positive,awesome adventure endless laughter
Nov 26 2012,positive,saw this movie for the second time a few days ago  this is just a dang watchable movie  the character chemistry plot twists and humor is spot on  almost every character got massive amounts of screen time with the hawkeye exception and their stories were woven together very well  joss whedon can do very little wrong  i cant wait for the next installment
Nov 26 2012,positive,ill have to say one of the top super hero movies i have seen it has a ton of action and i love how they incorporated the comedy in the movie the storyline is great and this is definitely something to own
Nov 25 2012,positive,like an omelet it gets better and better with the more you throw in it
Nov 25 2012,positive,i dont think we should be focusing on loki that guys brain is a bag full of cats you can smell crazy on him
Nov 25 2012,positive,packed with action and fun
Nov 25 2012,positive,one of my alltime favorite movies a great summer blockbuster robert downey junior steals the whole show
Nov 25 2012,positive,the avengers is bursting at the seams with action but doesnt fail to address each character individually and learns from the weaknesses of some of its prequels  it gets rid of the overbearing cheesiness and nearmockery of science that thor presented primarily each of the four avengers is distinct and interesting from a man out of time who coping with a new era to starks perfect balance of wit and cockiness  except youll note that there are in fact more than four avengers lacking any real background that was granted to the other four by full feature films or two in the case of iron man black widow and hawkeye seem a little foreign to all but wellversed marvel fans while their stretch of the storyline is itself wellwritten i never really got the feeling that they were part of the larger story  other than that and a slight criticism on that overly bearing cheesiness put forth by the archvillainwhoisntloki that we dont really come to know i have few bad things to say about this film it is one of the few films that manages to balance a coherent and fresh plot intriguing characters and intense action and for that i can only recommend it
Nov 25 2012,positive,whats not to love especially since its a joss whedon project cant wait for the next one
Nov 25 2012,positive,one of the best movies of the year   what i found fascinating about this movie was how the director was able to give almost equal screen time to all the main stars   i bet if you broke down dialogue and screen time you would find all the characters pretty much dead even   maybe a bit more to robert downy jr but its close   many great scenes with different members of the cast interacting with each other   nobody is forgotten and each person is given the opportunity to shine   the story is a little weak in some places explaining why certain things are happening but over all a very well directed and scripted movie
Nov 25 2012,positive,would have been a three star if not for the hulk
Nov 25 2012,positive,lotta action great movie
Nov 25 2012,positive,fantastic movie now one of my favorites
Nov 25 2012,positive,good actions scenes the hulk steals the show followed by iron man not sure why an archer is so helpful this is a fun movie
Nov 25 2012,positive,the most awesomest movie ever
Nov 25 2012,positive,very funny and wellwritten could take the action down a notch though
Nov 25 2012,negative,i think im just out on superhero movies as a whole because despite all the acclaim this did absolutely nothing for me the dark knight returns will be my final shot i guess
Nov 25 2012,positive,i would give this movie 5 stars i really loved it
Nov 25 2012,positive,i loved seeing all my favorite characters from childhood there was actually a good plot and the action was great the charactersactors had good chemistry which helped the comedy relief
Nov 25 2012,neutral,sappy attempt of superhero action my avengers is watchmen
Nov 25 2012,negative,marvels the avengers is so bad
Nov 25 2012,positive,awesome grate movie a awesome thrilling movie awesome for all audience adults and children
Nov 24 2012,positive,great flick it was interesting and entertaining to see that the real villain of the film was the conflict between the heroes you dont often see that in the movie im not saying that tom hiddleston was bad but he didnt seem to be as significant loki did turn out to be a puny god and all  also the visual transitions were beautiful one of marvels best films i cant wait for them try to trump this in the sequel
Nov 24 2012,positive,great action movie  lots of fun
Nov 24 2012,positive,finally watched it and itwasawesome
Nov 24 2012,positive,looooong ladiesit may not be your cup of tea but it isnt painful to sit through either
Nov 24 2012,positive,entertaining  lots of great special effects  iron man  loki were my favourites
Nov 24 2012,positive,one of the greatest super hero movies of all time
Nov 24 2012,positive,i was entertained not great but decent and enjoyable
Nov 24 2012,positive,wow  this movie was amazing
Nov 24 2012,neutral,thought it was amazing how they brought all these historic icons together but the acting was not that good also did not like how easily lokis army was defeated
Nov 24 2012,positive,this movie is fine for what it is disneys greedy attempt to appeal to as many demographics as humanly possible this was the movie i could show my little brothers without having to worry about them 1 having nightmares 2 learning new bad words for me this was just something i watched during the summer to pass time until dark knight rises
Nov 24 2012,positive,when you take alot of the main superheroes of marvel and put them into one movie you get one of the best superhero movies ever
Nov 24 2012,positive,worth watching for the hulk  smashing the bad guy around the room
Nov 24 2012,positive,watched it 4 times already
Nov 24 2012,positive,liked it even if it was quite silly
Nov 24 2012,positive,its first act is nearly excruciating nonetheless once the shit hits the fan this is the best marvel and superhero movies in general really get
Nov 24 2012,positive,simply one of the best superhero movies ever made i expected a ton of action and got it but wasnt expecting the great humor oneliners  interplay between the heroes that left me laughing more than most comedies
Nov 24 2012,positive,this is how its done a rollercoaster ride worthy of many repeat viewings ruffalo downey and scarlett  bravo
Nov 24 2012,neutral,if you go with an expectancy to watch a cartoon film you will find it an epic all massive action set pieces with zero gravity
Nov 24 2012,positive,this movie is totally epic there were a lot of actionfilled sequences and the confrontation between the two adversaries being the avengers and loki which is what people often look for in superhero movies its a really awesome movie and i would definitely see it over and over again if i had the chance
Nov 24 2012,positive,this was much better than i thought it would be they finally did the hulk justice bringing his hulking character to life there are a few really good laughs along the way looking forward to more from this team
Nov 24 2012,positive,finally got to see this after months of waiting  i thought the ensemble casting was great and i thought the choice of central character very interesting but i have not seen the latest hulk movie after ang lees car crash  whilst it was superbly filmed i just didnt buy the whole mcguffin and the finale i thought was just a bit flaccid  i got bored of about 40 minutes of non stop action  which is a shame because the story telling up to that point was very good  i thought it was a good movie but not quite the bollox many have made out
Nov 24 2012,neutral,i missed what everyone else saw thats good
Nov 24 2012,positive,loved it and a must see
Nov 24 2012,positive,marvel never fails to disappoint i had seen all the individual movies prior to watching the avengers but im pretty sure someone who hadnt seen thor or iron man or captain america would have also sailed smoothly through this movie everyone is given equal amounts of the spotlight and the special effects are brilliant if you have seen this movie you obviously loved it if you havent seen it what the hell is wrong with you
Nov 23 2012,positive,i totally enjoyed this movie the eye candy doesnt hurt either
Nov 23 2012,positive,this is the best marvel super heroe movie of all time
Nov 23 2012,positive,from the man behind serenity and buffy the vampire slayer comes a remarkably actionpacked and limitlessly comical movie based on the comic book about a team of unlikely and reluctant superheroes fighting to keep mankind safe after the mischievous god loki inexplicably returns to earth to find an endless source of colossal power in the shape of a cube nick fury samuel l jackson director of a strategic military division called shield decides to pull through with a cancelled recruitment plan called the avengers initiative which was created to form an unconventional team of extraordinary people whose mission is to fight the foes no single man can withstand though not as sophisticated as other comic book films the avengers can still be a great popcorn flick for audience critics children and adults alike
Nov 23 2012,positive,the avengers is a fun action pop corn thrill ride but it isnt flawless like tdk it has a very boring first 7090 minutes and a few more nit pics but its fun
Nov 23 2012,positive,what can i say should i start by saying that this is going to go down as my favorite superhero movie of all time it indeed is now this film broke box office records for a reason  the movie itself started off slow but checking out the running time of the film that should be expected not to fear because that was the calm before the storm i love how even though sometimes movies with multiple characters in films like this it can be difficult to put together time and effort for as much equal playtime for everyonebut that indication paid off and the quality of the characterization was put together very well the story was intriguing and brilliant the action was solid and the effects were astonishing some people maybe could find flaws in this film but i simply couldnt this is the superhero film for the ages and every marvel fan should love this flick
Nov 23 2012,positive,its environment and chemistry on occasions is disappointing and generic but the avengers is a lot of fun
Nov 23 2012,positive,great action great characters great humor not so great plot
Nov 23 2012,positive,the 2nd best super hero movie i have ever seen the 1st being batman begins but that is besides the point almost everything about this movie was amazing the story was just soso but i was willing to ignore that because they did everything else right in a movie that did not have any room for screwing up the acting the special effects and the action all amazed me now you might be worried right now as to whether or not the action would be split up among all the avengers equally but do not worry everyone got their fair share and nobody was the center of attention the fight scenes were very well constructed and thought out it didnt matter if they were fighting alone against one another or alongside one another they each got their fair share the whole point of this movie was to show what it would be like if superheros were fighting as a team and director joss whedon pulled it off beautifullyi will be honest the main focus of the movie was to get the special effects as good as they possibly could and in any movie the more special effects that are used the more obvious it is that the movie would be nothing without them this is not to say that the plot or screenplay was ignored the avengers as most of the critics will say had a great sense of humor the story unfortunately was very generic not bad its just not something that introduced anything new to the world of cinema the character development was also very much lacking in alot of ways because these characters are so unchangeable that it was actually kind of annoying to watch as they never changed but after being blown away with all the awesome in the movie i really didnt careon one final note that i cant ignore the fact that my favorite actor edward norton was replaced by mark ruffalo a guy i know nothing about was just extremely annoying edward norton was my favorite portrayal of bruce banner but to be fair ive only seen two portrayals eric bana from the 2003 hulkwhich was terrible and edward nortons portrayal from the 2008 version which was absolutely phenomenal  and when i compare mark to ed i cant help but think ed would have done a much better job at this and at the same time would have had something really cool to say he was in and i dont even know what the hell he was thinking when he didnt want to be in the movie but i am willing to say that mark ruffalo did a decent job at the role of the hulkall in all a truly fantastic action movie topped off with a satisfying conclusion to the first avengers movie the next avengers movie needs to surpass this with a far better story and special effects if it wants to impress me and this movie is receiving a much deserved 5 stars 
Nov 23 2012,positive,favorite super hero movie by far
Nov 23 2012,positive,the avengers is nothing special really if anything it is fun for its time being
Nov 23 2012,positive,it did what it said on the tin
Nov 23 2012,positive,fun but not so smart
Nov 23 2012,positive,no one can ever tell joss no ever again
Nov 23 2012,positive,great movie filled with action and comedy
Nov 22 2012,negative,nothing special about it
Nov 22 2012,positive,this movie is just as fantastic as countless people say and im honestly not that certain i can say anything about it that hasnt been said before
Nov 22 2012,positive,best super hero movie cant wait for 2
Nov 22 2012,positive,made me feel like a little kid reading the comics
Nov 22 2012,positive,ive seen this movie like 6 times haha best ever
Nov 22 2012,positive,great movie to watch once or maybe twice
Nov 22 2012,positive,love it cant wait for guardians of the galaxy
Nov 22 2012,positive,amazing use of great talented actors
Nov 22 2012,neutral,the biggest letdown of 2012
Nov 22 2012,positive,pretty cool the acting and story was a bit corny at times but i guess that is to be expected from this genre of film
Nov 22 2012,positive,absolutely mind blowing of course im a marvel fan but the perfect balance of story humour gripping moments and heart
Nov 21 2012,positive,this has to be one of the best superheroes movies i have ever seen because of the assembly of great heroes and the balance of star power no one character seems to outshine the others there is a decently gripping story and it all culminates in great action sequences with the eye candy you come to expect with marvel this film built nicely off of all the individual films and i gather it is not the last we will see of marvel lets get shwarma everybody
Nov 21 2012,positive,this movie is amazing
Nov 21 2012,positive,most amazing movie ever great acting great lines great stroryline
Nov 21 2012,positive,92                     i have seen it swag                average rating 810        reviews counted 290        fresh 268  rotten 22
Nov 21 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever made nuff said
Nov 21 2012,neutral,if youre looking for lackluster plot countless inconsistencies but good dialogue you came to the right place though somewhat entertaining this movies lack of theme or direction makes it much of a letdown
Nov 21 2012,positive,impossible how can a movie that consist so many superheroes can be told awesomely and not a single character overshadowing the other well done joss whedon
Nov 21 2012,positive,i was not a huge fan of the humour saying that i think they pulled of the big trap of giving to much line light to one character and sharing it out fairly amongst the rest of the cast
Nov 21 2012,positive,will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end
Nov 21 2012,positive,could have been better
Nov 21 2012,positive,a all time great superhero films it doesnt quite compare to nolans batman series but its in a different ballpark to it the avengers combines not only some of our favorite marvel heros but combines massive action and humor to just make a pure enjoyable film
Nov 21 2012,positive,director and writer joss whedon spends his time wisely developing the superhero team as a whole and its heroes individually inserting the action to thrust the story forward to its tightly satisfying conclusion leaving room for a sequel which he will direct
Nov 21 2012,positive,on the surface borrows heavily from dark knight with joker as loki and batman as everyone else  underneath eye candy for women  confusing hierarchy of power  apparently everyone can kick everyone elses ass  im surprised scarlet johanssen didnt kick the hulks ass
Nov 21 2012,positive,the best movie that ive seen in this year  d its very interesting to see the mosts populars heroes from marvel make an incredible team  i hope there will a second movie 
Nov 21 2012,positive,a well written and well acted superhero film that sets new standards and forces other studios to rethink their property strategy as a comic fan i was pleased seeing all of my favorite characters except johanssons awful performance as the black widow in screen after it was over i wanted to view it again and i hoped to see more in the future
Nov 21 2012,positive,joss whedon did wonders incorporating all these different characters and not favoring anyone of them too heavily  he spent time reintroducing each character and didnt spend unnecessarily on non stop action  the action sequences were well though out and much detail placed into the choreagraphy  well timed placed humor lightened the mood and was not forced  cant wait for 2 as long as whedon and the principles return
Nov 21 2012,positive,an amazing superhero movie honoring the comics tradition and giving a gift to the nerd folks
Nov 21 2012,positive,great movie alot of action
Nov 21 2012,positive,action movie of the year
Nov 21 2012,positive,joss whedon we bow before you in thanks you have not destroyed our collective childhood for this we shall always love thee amazing in every way there is no reason not to see this movie
Nov 20 2012,positive,i have to admit that i was a bit nervous going into this movie despite the glowing reviews it had been getting for its characterization i hadnt really enjoyed captain america or thor the latter of which i watched in dull 3d souring my experience and leaving that taste in my mouth as i went into watch this one     but ive always been a great fan of joss whedon having watched and enjoyed most of his shows dollhouse was decidedly average in my honest opinion so i went in with great expectations     this movie fulfilled them well most of them     firstly as well as being action packed its also funny as hell it proudly displays what we all know josh whedon iswellknown for flashy banter great characters and a gripping storyline and its the first time since watching avatar in 3d where i havent been straining to see something on screen because its whizzed by too fast or been obscured by darkness     all the characters are right there fully realized on screen even characters that had no right to work hawkeye and black widow being two such examples but they do because of the time and care given to making all the heroes human yes it does have a problem with favoritism from joss robert downey jr as iron man sparkles and zaps with one liners that are hilariously droll whereas chris evans has to play the moralistic read boring straight man and comes across as the least interesting of the heroes even thor has a zinger that made me laugh out loud and he doth wear his mothers drapes     hulk is well rounded and not just a big green rage monster when played against iron man though he does suffer from a deus ex machina moment which looks cool but makes little sense from what we see of his development on screen    and loki already being fleshed out in thor is great although not enough screen time is given to him to reiterate his motivations and theumalien race is generic as anything weve seen before in alien invasion movies but are interesting enough and threatening enough that we care about our characters stuck in this blitzkrieg    did i mention the movies funny
Nov 20 2012,positive,it was a dream come true to see the avengers heroes team up in the big screen it was successful in making the audience look forward to the sequel and the heroess individual movies
Nov 20 2012,positive,not better than batman
Nov 20 2012,positive,i would give this 10 stars if it was possible on flixter never underestimate the entertainment value of the hulk smash
Nov 20 2012,positive,a very well done movie d love the small fun qoutes in the movie we laughed with tears in our eyes when we saw it great job 
Nov 20 2012,positive,this was a good movie i actually liked thor and captain america better as standalone movies though loki is a really awesome villain
Nov 20 2012,positive,awesomeness1
Nov 20 2012,positive,superhero movies usually arent my thing but this one was tight hulks a funny dude it wasnt all special effects and show as i had expected
Nov 20 2012,positive,just awesome one of the best movies of the year
Nov 20 2012,positive,possibly the best comic book movie ever
Nov 20 2012,positive,awesome  equal time to characters  puny god  i love that scene the best
Nov 19 2012,positive,large scale epicness  i think thats the best way to describe it and really thats the only decent way to describe a movie with so many superheroes in it i havent actually seen all the lead in movies and by lead in i mean the movies that starred our superheroes before they all came together for the avengers and this movie only made me want to see them all yes there are flaws but you dont really care about them  this movie is just that good
Nov 19 2012,positive,excellent movie exciting from beginning to end
Nov 19 2012,positive,perfect action movie
Nov 19 2012,positive,there is little doubt that anyone but joss whedon could have combined such levels of wit depth and spectacle to bring the avengers to such glorious life
Nov 19 2012,positive,after the surprise ending in iron man four years ago and all the build up by nerds and comic book fans and people who just love these movies for four years the avengers does not disapoint
Nov 19 2012,positive,of course this movie is good whoever thinks otherwise is an idiot
Nov 19 2012,positive,ever since firefly joss has been on my radar knowing only the basics of the avengers with my girlfriend being the comic specialist i loves the movies leading up to this and has high expectations this movie did not disappoint
Nov 19 2012,positive,great movie one of the best i have ever seen
Nov 19 2012,positive,whoever digs deep to find the faults of this film will also have to dig through an epic amount of fun in the process i thoroughly enjoyed this film for exactly what it is a super hero movie i wasnt overly convinced with some of the phase 1 films thor was average caption america was fairly poor and the hulk films where dreadful however i loved the iron man movies as robert downey jr is exceptional and hes even better in the avengers joss whedon is a genius for making this work as i was never convinced he would im also pleased hes over seeing the phase 2 projects as hes shown he understands the production values of what makes a perfect marvel movie  the cast is superb robert downey jr steals the show delving deeper into the complex character that is tony stark other than hugh jackmans wolverine and christopher reeves superman i think robert downey jr is the best casted actor to play a superhero to date theres been multiple incarnations of batman spiderman and the hulk but the thought of somebody else playing iron man other than rdj feels like having christmas day without a turkey it just would not work chris hemsworth and chris evans convincingly make the numbers up but neither of them stand out from the crowd scarlett johansson is brilliant again as natasha romanovblack widow her character deserves a stand alone movie and although shes more like tomb raider than a superhero a black widow film would be awesome the surprise of the film is mark ruffalo whos nailed the character of bruce banner third time lucky for marvel who tried eric bana and edward norton previously to play the hulk but they where both unconvincing and instantly forgettable i think what worked third time around was that producers focused more on getting the character of bruce banner perfect before they worried about the cg of the alterego the hulk to add to that the cg for the hulk in the avengers is the best to date im not a massive hulk fan but i would happily welcomes a hulk film if it casts ruffalo again theyve found a winning formula with ruffalo so i hope marvel stick with him  the biggest disappointment is jeremy renner hes a great actor playing the great character hawkeye but i think joss whedon presented this character wrong jeremy renners acting talent was wasted and he just seemed to be forgotten about i hope theres a hawkeye movie for jeremy renners sake as he deserves the chance to show everyone he can offer more to the role tom hiddleston does well to fill the big role of the villain considering hes competing alongside a huge array of talent his performance as loki however is by no means up there with the best of cinematic superhero villains for example gene hackmans lex luthor and both jack nicholsons and heath ledgers performances as the joker are timeless samuel l jackson is on form and has a larger input in this marvel film which is good i hope hes involved in the shield tv series but i doubt hell step down to tv last but not least without further a do clark greggs agent coulson deserves the last word i was gutted that he got killed off but hes apparently reappearing in the shield tv series hes consistently been brilliant in all the phase 1 films and its a shame to think he wont be involved in phase 2  overall avengers is a great film great visuals great choreography of action and great performances its the first super hero film to give christopher nolans dark knight trilogy a taste of competition but in a totally different way this is by no means award winning material but the avengers doesnt want awards it wants everyone to have an epic amount of fun joss whedon i salute you
Nov 19 2012,positive,the only negative is this movie involves alot of stupid mistakes that a viewer would only catch if they watch it again otherwise its a fun movie and deserves a second
Nov 19 2012,positive,a fun entertaining superhero epic robert downey jrs iron man steals the show
Nov 19 2012,positive,sure its shallow but do all movies have to have a higher purpose a spectacular and thrilling summer popcorn movie
Nov 19 2012,positive,the movie was overall great the action was intense every time a problem came up the problems that i had was the fact that the enemy was not as serious as it could have been i felt like one superhero would have been enough to take out all the bad guys iron man could have made a bunch of his suits since he has them at his disposal and distributed them to the army that would have been enough to take out loki and the army thor is demigod and they proved that heâtms much more powerful than loki thor could have just called in his friends from asgard that they showed in thorâtms movie the hulk seemed to have gone unscathed the entire time when he was facing the entire army the hulk could have dealt with everything by himself just by âsmashingâ not only did the movie have heroes with too much power for the threat but they also had heroes that seemed âoutgunnedâ for the job black widow is only skilled with a gun and interrogating and hawkeye was good with a bow these two should have been in a movie with a lot less serious of an enemy and the ending with the nuke why didnâtmt they toss a nuke into the warp hole when they saw it opened up why did sheild want to make weapons from the tesseractâtms energy when nuclear power did the job very  well as shown in the scene where everything blew up from the nuclear bomb all criticisms aside however the movie was definitely the movie of the summer it was action packed the entire time and the story was very well put i liked how they incorporated the avengers initiative in the other movies to build up to this one it definitely caught my attention as well as millions of others who watched this movie i would give the movie a solid 47 out of 5
Nov 19 2012,positive,the avengers is a movie that appeals to the senses no not touch or taste but with so many special effects  great sounds quality and so many different scene set ups it makes you feel like youâtmre actually there in the movie fighting alongside with the avengers hey you might even give yourself a super hero name to make you feel like one of the crew avengerâtms style is much different than many other super hero movies that there has been in the past marvel has struck gold with the concept that they have brought forth to the millions of fans of their superhero army  every child had that one super hero that they wanted to be as a kid while they were growing up yeah marvel has given each one of these heroes their fame separately but that way is a thing of the past whatâtms better to hit two birds with one stone you might ask how about ten birds with one stone thatâtms what the avengers creators did when they brought together all of your child hood heroes into one movie just the idea is pure genius yeah a single character may appeal to wide audience but having multiple characters with millions of followers that would want to see their movie all together equals big money so thatâtms why the concept of this movie as a whole is a win for the marvel company  the way that all of the characters in this film were brought together was a great way to bring the viewer up to date even if the viewer didnâtmt watch one marvel movie or pick up a comic book before this could comprehend what was going on marvel introduced one character at a time so that the viewer would not get all jumbled up and they would also show where the character has been of that time not just by plucking them from thin air  now on to the bad of the movie it was very hard to find the bad in this movie but there were a few things that could be pointed out the fact that marvel decided to only go with a select few of their characters and not bring all of them into this movie could have been heart breaking for all of those batman fans out there or even the little kid with his spiderman underwear but except for those few and very small details the avengers is a must see
Nov 19 2012,positive,from the opening scene to the final seconds marvelâtms âthe avengersâ is an action packed thrill ride thatâtmll leave you begging for more the overall storyline is nothing special bad guy wants to rule the world using and alien army but the true genius of avengers lies in its execution joss whedon moves the movie along at a pace that leaves the audience without a feeling of being rushed the threat is quickly established but a majority of the time is spent assembling the team  though at first one is quick to point out that this tactic would lengthen the movie and draw things out in a bore it is another credit to the directingwriting of whedon by slowly introducing each character we are better able to see each heroâtms personality bounce of the others in a sort of entertaining experiment that takes place right before our eyes a good super hero movie often hinges on its villain âthe dark knightâtmsâ joker and it isnâtmt an easy task to make the audience doubt the heroesâtm ability to come out on top especially when there are six of them but loki played by tom hiddleston acts the part to perfection and speaking of acting it would appear that the third time is in fact the charm as no one could have predicted the show stealing performance by mark ruffalo as the hulk who succeeded where eric bana and edward norton could not his role as the cool calculating scientist with a touch of emotional instability âiâtmm always angryâ was highly engaging as for the rest of the cast they benefited from the group dynamic each hero was the star of his own movie and when they come together their respective egos clash resulting in action such as the fight between robert downey jrâtms iron man and chris hemsworthâtms thor or hilarity in the case of iron man calling captain america played by chris evans âold manâ amongst all the stars of the movie there is still one more the special effects delivering one the best action movies of the year could not be possible without serious cgi and avengers delivers in outstanding fashion from the ascension of shieldâtms mother ship to the moment the alien armyâtms arrival in new york the art department shows it has what it takes to compete with the likes of michael bay and christopher nolan the hulk is brought to life in astounding realism as well as the character many forget isnâtmt real either iron man as a whole there is little that can be said against whedonâtms new masterpiece the expectations of every comic book fan and superhero movie buff must have hung heavy on his shoulders the buildup to this was unlike anything ever seen in hollywood  whedon in his magnum opus reveals himself to be the true hero of âthe avengersâ
Nov 19 2012,positive,a really enjoyable movie its not a dark knight style but it wasnt supposed to be it was supposed to be a amazing actionpacked blockbuster with beloved marvel characters and they deliver it in a almost flawless way
Nov 19 2012,positive,this is a good movie but completely overrated
Nov 19 2012,negative,the avengers one thing that can be said about joss whedonâtms âthe avengersâ is it stole from me the longest two and a half hours of my life  never having been a fan or should i say victim of the marvel comic character movies i found this to be very hard to follow  there is no back story  hell i didnâtmt even know that natasha romanoff was the black widow until the ending credits  itâtms all just a typical superhero movie  the bad guy takes something that is going to destroy earth as we know it and the heroes must band together to save the earth in time in the opening sequence we are introduced to samuel l jacksonâtms character nick fury  he has come to investigate why the tesseract has begun to take on a life of its own  as he is conducting his investigation a portal opens to release none other than the bad guy of the movie loki played by tom hiddleston  after an extremely short and unconvincing battle with security loki takes off with the tesseract  the rest of the two and a half hours is spent trying to get it back after the bad guy has taken the one thing that can destroy earth as we know it all the worldâtms superheroes must be found and brought together because only they teamed together have the power to destroy loki and recover the tesseract  fury scavenges the world afar to locate all of the players  he rounds up captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr the hulk mark ruffalo the black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner from places such as india russia and outer space  after a short and unconvincing battle between iron man and thor played by chris hemsworth thor all of a sudden becomes one of the good guys to help take down his brother loki the rest of the movie is spent trying to locate the tesseract before it can be used for evil  after the first two hours of unclimatic happenings the superheroes must come together as a team for a good versus evil battle in which they hope to regain control of the tesseract  in a clichã c filled ending battle ensues in which we get to see all the heroâtms exhibit their super strengths and powers  the whole thing is very predictable of whatâtms going to happen next  never having seen any of the other movies involving these characters i must say that i had a lot of expectations of this movie that went unfulfilled
Nov 18 2012,positive,best movie by a far shot this yesr amazing graphics great action they did an awesome job on this movie
Nov 18 2012,positive,the avengers is by no means just one of your average superhero movies if youâtmre a fan of comic books or superhero movies then the avengers by marvel will surely not disappoint you compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have came out in theaters in the summer of 2012 this movie seems to top spiderman and batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie  this movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie with the names of the incredible hulk thor iron man captain america hawkeye and black widow this movie compares to an allstar game of athletes in any given sport in comparing the movie to other movies by marvel this movie stands out in a good way this movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of in terms of putting the superheroes together the avengers does a marvelous job  the avengers is essentially a sequel to thor captain america iron man and the incredible hulk taking elements from each movie after loki gets exiled from his home planet of asgard as seen in thor after attempting to rule asgard he seeks out to rule again  after captain america gets unfrozen he is seen working out when nick fury stops by nick fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the avengers  at first things are shaky as the superheroesâtm egos clash rather than mesh together this is easily done by loki shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the avengers the constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience but it doesnâtmt diminish the movie as a whole in the movie the characters donâtmt seem to have changed from their own movies although iron man learns the value of working with others  joss whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions in my opinion this movie sets the bar for superhero movies itâtmll be a great challenge for dc and marvel to top the avengers
Nov 18 2012,positive,the avengers brings together the marvel superheroes iron man robert downy jr the incredible hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson joss whedon does a good job of bringing all six of these comic book characters together in one movie when loki tom hiddleston a villain from outer space threatens the safety of the world nick fury samuel l jackson the director of shield finds himself in a predicament and needs a team to help defeat him loki pairs up with an unknown alien who promises him reentry to earth in exchange for the âtesseractâ which is a cube of energy that creates a portal from his world to earth this portal is needed so the alien army can take over earth it is the avengers job to capture loki and defeat the alien army before it takes over earth the movie in general is pretty good the idea of taking the superhero characters of several other movies was unique on the other hand to understand the movie fully you have to know the original characters and their stories for a comic book buff or an action movie buff who have seen the movies âthe hulkâ or âcaptain americaâ the movie is easy to understand at the beginning but for a person who has never read the comics or seen the movies it can be rather confusing  looking at the actual movie the actors did a good job and the roles were believable whedon does a good job by bringing different emotions into the movie it is humorous thrilling by keeping you on your toes sad at some points and has a happy ending the bickering between the characters about who is the strongest or best superhero was comical along with the witty remarks by iron man the climatic last battle between the avengers and lokiâs alien battle fulfills the action and thrilling part this is the part where you do not want to take a bathroom break it will keep you on your toes the whole time the special effects during the whole movie really bring everything together  all in all this movie was good it ranges from funny to action filled and good for all ages it might be recommended to watch the movies that each avenger is in if you want to fully understand the movie but if you just want to watch a good action movie with your favorite superheroes this movie is for you
Nov 18 2012,positive,expensive work that paid off profit wise my trouble is the lackluster plot with the worst villian casted in a movie since the tomatoes from attack of the killer tomatoes  honestly without iron man it would have flopped in comparison
Nov 18 2012,positive,i laugh and scream hell yeah thru out the movie awesome
Nov 18 2012,positive,the avengers was a good movie but took a little while to get into at first i was very confused seeing as i have not watched any of the other marvel movies nothing was really explained as to who the characters were and what their importance was it was just assumed that you knew as i was watching the movie i asked many questions to my companions and needed things to be explained to me in order to understand everything that was going on without these people to clear things up i may not have understood a good portion of the movie which would have made it boring and uninteresting for me to watch as the movie began things jumped around a lot which made the storyline hard to follow characters were bouncing around from place to place and new people were being brought into the story without any real introduction or reason further into the movie everything came together and was more understandable but they could have done a better job writing the beginning again without explanations from the people i was with i would not have understood exactly where the character were coming from and why they were being brought it the only reason a person would not like the avengers in my opinion would be because they had not seen previous marvel movies in which these characters were featured once things were explained to me and i understood the role each character played it was a very good and entertaining movie the plot kept twisting and just when you thought something was under control it spiraled off into a huge mess things such as the villain freezing himself and collecting more and more power or such as the people he turned evil becoming good again just in time to help save the day it is an action packed movie with something new and unexpected going on at all times all of the superheroes come together in order to stop an ultrapowerful force from outer space but their ideas and morals clash in ways that could inhibit them from making clear decisions and in the end saving the world besides personality clashes the hulk is also unable to control his powers and becomes a threat to everyone when he morphs into his large green alter ego and begins to tear the place apart this nerve wrecking movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you watch hoping that everyone can get along in time to defeat the villain
Nov 18 2012,positive,loved it want it on digital copy
Nov 18 2012,positive,superb performances and jawdropping special effects the bar has been raised for superhero movies a
Nov 18 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever made brilliant use of every character josss screenplay is incredible and direction excellent a must see if your into marvel or superheroes  in general
Nov 18 2012,positive,was hoping for more actionbut good story line
Nov 18 2012,negative,joss whedons most recent film the avengers is more or less the generic superhero movie but with the twist of it being based on a team of marvel superheroes the team is comprised of iron man thor captain america the hulk black widow and to a varying degree hawkeye and nick fury notably the majority of the team has their own movies already and i think its safe to say that if youre unfamiliar with the marvel mythos or havent at least seen one or two of the other films you are at a complete disadvantage i say this because i personally have only seen iron man and am severely lacking in my understanding of marvel characters as a whole if it wasnt for my moderate knowledge of norse mythology i would have probably been even more lost so lets assume that going into this film the audience had never picked up a marvel comic before in their lives was completely in the dark in regards to the thorodinloki relationship and never saw iron man thor captain america or any of the hulk movies not only would they have no idea about who half the avengers were or their back stories but the several characters without movies of their own have literally no history given to the audience black widow nick fury and hawkeye are seemingly important characters to the film and yet i personally had no knowledge of them prior to seeing the movie and still next to nothing after seeing the movie in all actuality marvel knows who their target market is and knows that the average joe going to see and actually care about the avengers will undoubtedly have a greater understanding of it than myself but still if i was this lost there must have been others just as if not more confused now lets assume that backstory wasnt a key priority for mr whedon and the marvel people all right fair enough it was a superhero movie after all so itãtms more about the plot character development and of course the fight sequences well unfortunately the plot was weak beyond belief how many movies novels games etc have to lay waste to new york city before the audiences realizehey weve seen this dog and pony show before but i digress the films plot is simple good versus evil you cant really screw that up without trying but because it is so cliche it does take a certain prowess to present it in a new and unique fashion i cant say with a clear conscience that the avengers did that one does notice the world war ii undertones if they can be called undertones as opposed to slaps in the face for instance captain americas flashback and the scene in germany where loki forces the crowd to kneel before him and the brief dialogue between loki and captain america which follows that scene was less than necessary and seemed to only be used to fuel the connection between loki and hitler while the plot could certainly have been more avantgarde the character development was so slight and unrealistic that it may have not been there at all while all the characters in the film are for the most part static there are two points of revelation the first being when the team actually begins to act as a team and the second is toward the end once loki has come to understand he has done something very wrong this may be the lack of backstory but i find it rather farfetched that the previously squabbling and bickering team would rally around the death of agent coulson as the link to unite against loki when it comes to the fight scenes one cant help but feel that they occur quite often and are nearly always overly exaggerated and overdone i know its a superhero movie so it is to be expected that there be some intense battle sequences but the oneonone duels are sickening to say the least its almost as if those parts of the movie were made either to distract from the weak plot or used as entertainment for those of the audience that look for more brawn and less brain the avengers is a decent movie for avid fans of the marvel universe and those who enjoy a slugger film however it could have certainly been done differently and in a better way the plot could have been stronger and character development could have been more evident than it was after seeing the movie and writing this review all i have to say is i hope the avengers 2 can avenge the first movie
Nov 18 2012,positive,awesome full of action
Nov 18 2012,positive,better than i ever anticipated imo best superhero film ever created
Nov 18 2012,positive,amazing every aspect acting camerawork plot casting just everything one of my favorite movies
Nov 18 2012,positive,shield the strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division opens up the movie with an experimentation and activation of the tesseract it is said that the tesseract holds the key to unlimited power hence the experimentation however to the dismay of the humans the exiled norse god loki tom hiddleston steps out of a portal and proceeds with a killing spree in the base he then leaves the base with the tessearct in his procession and clint âhawkeyeâ barton and dr erik selvig jeremy renner and stellan skarsgãrd respectively under some sort of mind control the movie has a relatively generic plot introduction the antagonist enters by some unforeseen means and takes something vital to the protagonists a central theme seen throughout the whole movie is how the avengers have little to no trust in each other when nick fury samuel l jackson assembles the avengers initiative he sparks rivalries between each hero and there is frequent infighting one such example and my personal favorite is the fight between thor chris hemsworth and tony stark iron man robert downey jr after thor takes loki out of their procession this reveals the pent up aggression because of the highstress situation that each hero is facing due to the circumstances and gives whedon a good outlet to express some of the power and potential they hold in the grand 55minute finale fight that takes place in manhattan in and of itself something every american can resonate with being iconic to our culture loki brings forth an alien race called the chitauri with his use of the tesseract throughout the development of the storyline and each character they all learn to feed off of each otherâtms strengths and become all the more powerful the infighting stops and because of their teamwork the world is saved  simple things such as when captain america chris evans gives agent natasha romanov âthe black widowâ scarlett johannson a boost up to an alien spacecraft when she takes a running start at him and he launches her with his mighty shield exemplify teamwork this among other small things such as iron man flying hawkeye to the top of a building to provide a better vantage point that would complement his archery show teamwork and are easily relatable to the average moviegoer and produce a sense of connection with the heroes the theme that focuses on teamwork and exploiting one anotherâtms strengths is important to our society and i think often something we shy away from whedon uses this central idea to his advantage and draws in an entire audience that can benefit from this sort of like a moral at the end of a childhood storybook
Nov 18 2012,positive,great family movie saw it in the theaters and have rented it a few times since then great for the boys and the girls  ps anything with chris helmsworth in it is going to be amazing
Nov 18 2012,positive,little to add to the comments already made very good uptempo action movie which only pauses if you are lucky  for a good laugh maybe no brainbreaker and  the concept of superhero movie is really no novelty but plain good fun
Nov 18 2012,positive,amazing combination
Nov 18 2012,positive,as a fan of the comic book series i was pleased with the film my only disappointments were the lack of 2 of the founding members and the lack of the legendary battle cry avengers assemble that doesnt hinder the film from being enjoyable definitely one of my top favorite films
Nov 18 2012,positive,nothing not seen before stuff other than a lousy super villain overhyped will come down to moderate ratings in coming years i m sure
Nov 18 2012,positive,writers directors learning from dark knight trilogy that superhero movies could be so much more avengers has every thing going for it the pace dialogues comic timing tension and action story and above all the traditional sense of heroes overcoming all the odds to win
Nov 18 2012,positive,this film has it all plenty of actionhumor drama and visual effects it was well worth the 4 year wait
Nov 18 2012,positive,as a comic book geek as a child i longed for this movie to be created  and was not disappointed even the absence of avengers characters spiderman cause which one would they go with wolverine and blade cant really have an aged wesley snipes appearing as an apparent immortal can they coupled with the slightly stark centric storyline did not dampen what was a well placed movie with strong cgi and imaginative battle scenes   yes there was the inevitable corny lines  hulk smash comes to mind but the movie delivered entertainment from start to finish and provides good lead in to the next round of marvel movies
Nov 18 2012,positive,marvels the avengers gives us a terrific cast with great performances and brilliantly crafted set pieces to bring us the ultimate pay off after a string of solo films starring its heroes the story is humanized and balances the characters very well with each having their own time to shine and while the action is abundant and neverending it doesnt distract the amazing plot penned by joss whedon and zak penn the cast is charismatic and has great banter which produces memorable quotable lines and the action sequences are rather crafted masterfully with a great amount of fun marvels the avengers is a two and half our romp of endless fun giving it a high rewatch factor it might also be one of this decades most memorable films but it is definitely an impressively made popcorn flick that you might never get tired of    4 stars
Nov 17 2012,positive,absolutely perfect movie
Nov 17 2012,positive,absolutely loved it ruffalo was the best choice for the hulk and downey jr is always hilarious
Nov 17 2012,positive,definitely some cliches but theyre executed so well and on such a massive scale that its kind of hard not to enjoy it anyway joss whedon gets extra points for being the first director to successfully put the hulk in a movie that doesnt stink
Nov 17 2012,neutral,many people disagree with me critics and audiences alike its just not my kind of superhero film i find the plot to be messy the characters not having any dimension whatsoever the villians to be some of the worse excuses of villains ive ever seen too much flash too much flair and not much else to offer
Nov 17 2012,positive,all round great fun spectacular action scenes and the performances are spot on the only let down for me is that the plot is very predictable
Nov 17 2012,positive,unbelievable  i cant wait for the next one
Nov 17 2012,positive,good action movie i dont think it deserves a 96 by users though fun to watch on a saturday night with the family has a lot of action as well as some comedic relief worth a rent but no more than that
Nov 17 2012,positive,excellent film from start to finish the reason to own a 3d television
Nov 17 2012,negative,i enjoyed the special effects and iron man and the hulks bromance but for the most part i was bored and on the brick of falling asleep
Nov 17 2012,positive,a good movie needs a betty storyline
Nov 17 2012,positive,the avengers astonishingly amazing the avengers is a movie that is action packed and it made up of many different characters from former movies joss whedon the director decided that he would get all of the super heroes from the former movies to one location so they would be able to work together to complete an important task the super heroes captain america hawkeye hawk iron man black widdow and thor were brought together to defeat thorâs brother loki this was an important mission because loki had the tesseract which would be able to open the world to other worlds the tesseract was a source of energy that was stronger and more powerful than any other type of energy loki needed to be stopped because he was in charge of letting the world of asgard take over our world  the main action began in the movie right after nick fury made the announcement âas of right now we are at warâ this is when the heroes all got together to perform their mission to defeat loki joss whedon did a great job by showing all of the special affects throughout the movie whedon shows effects really well when the hawk is chasing after the black widdow right after the hawk turns into his green monster self for the first time in the movie the way that he was able to show the hawk running through and breaking everything in his path was phenomenal  humor is used in a very interesting but entertaining way throughout this film the way that joss whedon used humor was a dry sense and it was easy to understand the funny statements made by the character during the film agent coulson was talking to captain america when he told him that it was a pleasure to be able to meet him he kept going on about how big of a fan he was and how he collected all of captain americas cards after he was done describing to captain america on how much of a fan he was he told him that this was actually the second time he has met him âi watched you while you were sleepingâ agent coulson described to captain america this immediately came across a bit creepy to captain america and it was a way the joss whedon was able to pull of his sense of humor  joss whedon did a wonderful job casting this film and making it film that is put up to the top of my list of favorite movies i would recommend this film too many friends for it is worth your time to see all of the amazing special effects and the way joss whedon uses his humor throughout the film  danny liette
Nov 17 2012,positive,entertainment value8510 to 910 movie quality810 one damn overrated movie yes it is a great movie but it is short of amazingly awesometacular like everyone else says hawkeye and black widow are kindof completely useless and although i like archers green arrow ftw if he wasnt in this movie it wouldnt have changed  seriously overrated i mean its average here is technically a 9 really great movie though 810
Nov 17 2012,positive,when i first saw avengers i thought  damn i expected a lot more from a movie which has that great of a cast but i was let downits an average movie
Nov 17 2012,positive,loved it would like to have seen edward norton come back as the hulk
Nov 17 2012,positive,very cool hulk was incredible i want be him now haaaaa
Nov 17 2012,positive,well done best super hero movie do date on par with batman trilogy
Nov 16 2012,positive,love thor good flick
Nov 16 2012,positive,some superhero movies dont work this is not one of those action from begining to end awesome movie maybe the best superhero movie to date
Nov 16 2012,positive,amazing comic book movie one that is greater than its individual characters comic book fans have been craving live action depictions of their favorite stories for years and have gotten hit or miss results over the past decade this was the movie we have been waiting for hopefully its only the beginning   not saying that xmen iron man spiderman etc were not good movies its just we could find many faults there were not one complaint from many on this new film
Nov 16 2012,positive,one of the best action films ever made hands down  theres no reason why you shouldnt see this
Nov 16 2012,positive,avengers a 21st century masterpiece as film making progresses over time technology and cinematics help to amplify its brilliance in the theater joss whedonâs âthe avengersâ is no doubt an exemplary model of the advancements in modern film making but this is not all the movie offers from the very beginning the movie thrills and seeks to entertain justifiable in its cinematography and modern graphics viewers are offered a dark entering scene that stimulates questioning and suspense early on while acting and the plot line may be a little rudimentary at times i feel this can be disregarded as âthe avengersâ is after all a super hero movie solely set to entertain and thrill its very nature is set to be action packed and visually appealing to a widely diversified audience throughout âthe avengersâ the plot is thickened by revealing the superheroesâ pasts utilized to construct a complex array of relationships among the avengers as they assemble the charactersâ unique personality profiles create suspense as the viewer attempts to predict the means and terms of cooperation among the heroâs the overall building of tension in the movieâs plot is catalyzed by the tension that is built between heroes one such example of this is the rather heated confrontation concerning the atomic bomb between captain america and iron man aboard their airborne craft soon the other heroâs safety is put into jeopardy with the hulk on board and serenity returns for a brief moment as the heroâs put aside their ideological differences witty punch lines and sarcastic humor adds edginess to the characters amusing confrontations examples can be found littered throughout the movie witty punch lines and one liners fill practically every minute of âthe avengersâ pleasing to those critics who look for such literary keenness viewers who like deeper subject matter would also like âthe avengersâ as social commentary can also be found within the context of âthe avengersâ such as mans subservient duty to those in power lokiâs role in the avengers is to highlight this controversial aspect of human nature as well as the human condition loki notes of humans âyou lie and kill in the service of liars and killersâ in regards to war and the violence and greed found in human sociopolitical systems one prime example of this in the movie is when a group of societyâs social elites are thrown into chaos and shortly subdued thereafter by loki who has them kneel before them as the movie continues on the viewer is given a variety of epic superhero match ups who fight and further the plot such as the battle between iron man and captain america in the woods that leaves the movie attendee wanting more it is towards the end of the movie that an interesting end and ultimate conclusion result from the cooperation of heroâs who decide individual differences behind them for service of the greater good
Nov 16 2012,positive,outstanding flick not 100 true to the source material but still a cinematic masterpiece
Nov 16 2012,positive,fantastic movie kept u on the edge of your seat great concept and great to see all the superheroes we know and love fighting for the greater good
Nov 16 2012,negative,unbelievably overrated virtually  plotless badly cast boring sloppily directed missing a beginning a middle and an end im flabbergasted at how this could become so popular xmen eg is so much better in all respects the only one that escapes the below average misery of this caricature of a film is downey junior his zest makes some scenes worthwhile
Nov 16 2012,positive,few movies capture the fun of superheroes like the avengers i was in love with this movie from the start from witty oneliners to an interesting and twisted villain the avengers definitely is the most fun ive had in a theatre even after seeing it 3 times
Nov 16 2012,positive,a bit of bore at the beginning but its visually intense almost as good as prometheus when it comes to cg  when it does pick up it picks up well and its definitely a movie to own so far probably the best movie of the year but i havent seen batman or twilight yetget the 3d bluray set its worth every penny
Nov 16 2012,positive,great movie wish is was longer about another hour would have been good lol
Nov 16 2012,positive,very good for the type of movie
Nov 16 2012,negative,my rating for the avengers is poor i didnâtmt care for the movie because i am not into the whole action movies it doesnâtmt help when i didnâtmt know at first who each character was and what their super power was and used for i donâtmt like the fact that the place that it took place was new york city i feel that every movie that has disaster happens there i donâtmt get if they are trying to prove a point or if they use that city because itâtms a popular place  the visuals in the movie were not really good you have to watch the movie in a dark room in order to see the dark scenes due to the fact that the lighting was poor  the animation was not realistic with the cars flying the bombs exploding the big flying dragonsnail falling from the sky from the hole didnâtmt seem so real because you wouldnâtmt see that in an everyday life event with hulk throwing the loki around the room hitting the floors and walls in real life if someone did that the person would be dead from the impact the buildings getting smashed into and only some falling but the ones with the worst damage didnâtmt fall  the music i have to say was good in the movie it would follow the scenes when they were fighting it would have more intense music when the dragonsnail fell from the sky the acting was always good except i didnâtmt like how ironman acting was  a couple quotes that stood out to was âfreedom is lifeâtms great lieâloki âthere was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people so when we needed them they could fight the battles then we never couldânick fury i believe that you have to be interested in the whole comic book for superheroâtms to get the movie and know what each superhero powers are because if not then you will be confused in the movie and i think this movie is more towards the guy side of a movie if it had more scenes for the girls then it would have turned out better âalright hey alright good job guys letâtms not come in tomorrow letâtms just take a day offâ iron man if superheroes were supposed to save people every day then why would they need a day off i would not recommend this movie to anyone if they are not into the whole superhero nonreal creatures and if they are not in a dark room
Nov 16 2012,positive,unfortunately the avengers was not a good movie it was an amazing movie with my expectations high from the monumental amount of hype i was hesitant to jump on the bandwagon in fear of being disappointed however i was far from let down when the epic story unfolded before me bringing together iconic marvel characters the film flowed in an almost flawless manner fully developing each character in their own way joss whedon mostly known for titles such as buffy the vampire slayer and the cabin in the woods truly outdid himself in the action packed suspenseful flick  the cast was perfectly chosen and their roles were executed properly with an allstar cast consisting of robert downy jr reclaiming his role as the arrogant egotistical hero iron man chris evans played the fantastic classic captain america scarlet johansson played the mischievously dangerous black widow jeremy renner playing the part of the bow wielding hawkeye and mark ruffalo acting the part of the ingenious scientist who just happens to turn into a massive green monster that can destroy anything it comes in contact with while angry last but not least hammerwielding god of thunder thor played by chris hemsworth  each of them brought a unique and diverse talent to the table when forced to come together to save earth from total annihilation thanks to the brother of thor loki whom is played by tom hiddleston the acting was superb and the blend of each character really added to the overall effect of the plot  the visual effects of the avengers alone are enough to get you pumped for a fantastic movie from the breathtaking cgi to the integration of what is real and animated its inarguable that the budget must have been out of this world the music was professionally composed and suited each situation vastly the production quality was not lacking in any department and it greatly showed in the overall plot through the mood lighting and story progression the story behind the avengers is very interesting and easily one of the most action packed marvel films up to date a mostly action film incorporated with a comedic undertone it can leave you at the edge of your seat at one moment and laughing the next with all of these qualities the film has defiantly lived up to the comic series revealing its self through different means over all the avengers is a fantastic film and is definitely worth a watch i highly recommend it to anyone   austin barnett
Nov 16 2012,positive,a movie that fan boys like me have waited for and prayed for since the first movie poster and after credits teaser as a fan boy weve seen comic movies tank and suck but since thor moving the comic book movies back to awesome the avengers take it to another level to amazing
Nov 16 2012,positive,i was told it was a very good movie from the start but i really wasnt much to watching superhero flicks but everyone changes their opinion at times watching the beginning it was a little slow on what was happening and why they were there in the first place didnt take too long then it actually started to make sense on what the plot was going to be about for the entire as well why they tried to get the avengers all together i didnt know all of them who was in the group but probably a couple so seeing them all appear one by one was pretty good and helped out where they all came from before becoming a group the action was nicely done with a few times i wondered what was going to be around the cornor adding on to more of the suspense even when things were a little slow in the story there was still a slight excitement factor being portrayed on when the plot is going to turn the best part is that it wasnt just an all action packed and sealed movie but added on parts when it gets tense or funny at times those alone were put in the film very nicely as a sort of recovery from a scene of action switched to serious than a funny time here and there of all the movies i watched i was very impressed at the computer graphics they used in many of the fighting and chase scenes with some movies you are able to tell whether it looks real or fake for this movie it was very hard to tell at times what was computer graphic and what was actually done on the set that was what got me the most and most of the time i can tell when something has been added in to make a movie better in quality the acting cast was well picked for this movie because of the fact those who played the avenger characters before knew how the character acted and used it to their advantage on how they would react amongs eachother for the first time with some ending good while some ending badly which was funny to the audience along with the characters i liked how they brought in the character thor into the picture even though i thought it was odd he came from another world and all but then again i didnt know much about him except what i learned in norse mythology on thor and loki i knew they were brothers but from how they acted in the movie it was a perfect match to fables on those two overall i was surprised at the end that the movie was done very well this time around i would even watch it again just to get a better grip on the marvel characters a little more this was a pretty good movie and well recommended
Nov 16 2012,positive,not better that wreck it ralph
Nov 16 2012,positive,a nerdgasm for comic enthusiasts but informative while at the same time not delving too deep into comic myhtology to make sense for the casual moviegoer apart from the filler roles of black widow and hawkeye every avenger has been beautifully potrayed by their respective actors mark ruffalo as the only one not to have portrayed dr bruce banner in the past fits in perfectly with the rest of the team and is in this reviewers opinion the best incarnation of dr banner to date
Nov 15 2012,positive,way better than i thought itd be if this is what disney is doing for marvel than i cant wait for the new star wars movies
Nov 15 2012,positive,stunning this does the job complete with bangs hulk bashing aliens downey jr and shawarma
Nov 15 2012,positive,fun entertaining family action from start to finish a great array of characters and a film for everyone to enjoy
Nov 15 2012,negative,i remember when joss whedon was interesting for plot character subtle and interesting human themes sheer surprise and delight remember firefly what happened to the extraordinary talent that made that possible  meanwhile this avengers thing doubtless making lots of money for somebody but take away the costumes and explosions you got nothing just so much noise as comic movies go thor was way better
Nov 14 2012,positive,an awesomely fun ontheedgeofyourseat graphicsloaded festival for all five senses
Nov 14 2012,positive,amazing hulk is the best followed by ironman then thor
Nov 14 2012,positive,it should be acknowledged that putting this movie together is a historical feat never has a major crossover film with an enormous ensemble cast been pulled off so well   its been four years and five movies in the making and it delivered none of the lead up movies have ever really taken themselves too seriously the exception probably being incredible hulk to which we should fault edward norton   at times childish but still packing a lot of action the avengers was a great ride and no one should have wanted more then to be entertained the characters were at times monotone but the chemistry between the actors was there and you can sense they had a great time making the film because you have a great time watching the film
Nov 14 2012,positive,i think they spend a lot of money doing this movie and really is a good movie
Nov 14 2012,positive,well done this movie did not disappoint
Nov 14 2012,positive,better than i ever imagined marvel is kicking dc comics butts bigtime on the big screen
Nov 14 2012,positive,great addition and collaboration of the modern superheroes and very well done it is no surprise it has done so well
Nov 14 2012,positive,hulk steal the showbut overall brilliantly acted with great action and deeper character interaction than you might expect
Nov 14 2012,positive,i know im about 5 years late but i finally watched the avengers  hats off to joss whedon not only on the directing but classic joss writing the interspersed hilarious comedic moments within the heavy drama of the moment all of the action was great there was not a dull moment the cast did an amazing job comic book lovers will love this movie
Nov 14 2012,positive,the avengers suffers from one major problem it has absolutely no story and is completely style over substance it feels more like a fan service and a showoff of special effects than it does an actual movie with an arc its also full of cliché and it plays everything safe a little too safe which makes it all feel like wasted potential for more substantial sequels   another glaring problem is the extremely underdeveloped and uninteresting side characters the movie obviously tries to make the audience care about the characters but with so little development put into them it is hard to take seriously a lot of the supposedly serious and emotional moments come off as laughable instead of genuine the screenplay also ignores a lot of the character traits and abilities for the sake of bad jokes and fights between the main characters obviously to please all fans in every way the other problem is loki the main villain his motivations are what makes him an uninteresting character as he really does not have anything special to do as a villain he is pretty bad the only saving grace is tom hiddleston who is undeniably charismatic and entertaining as loki   but with all those problems one simply cannot deny the extreme entertainment value there is to be found the last 30 minutes or so are a complete joy to watch and there is an undeniable chemistry between the actors who all fit their role very well it is an excellent movie to watch purely for entertainment even if it sacrifices what could have made it great for cheap jokes and forced fanservice  the avengers is more of a guilty pleasure than a genuinely good movie its not a bad movie per sé as there is a lot of great action which doesnt feel as poorly directed as michael bays films its the direction of the action sequences that really makes this movie stand a little above stuff like transformers and gi joe
Nov 14 2012,positive,absolute top class what a film
Nov 13 2012,positive,frikn love this movie
Nov 13 2012,positive,absolutely love this movie i will see it again
Nov 13 2012,positive,one of the best action films made this decade
Nov 13 2012,positive,i saw this movie and it was epic
Nov 13 2012,positive,rocks  the only thing missing was batman
Nov 13 2012,positive,for an action  comic book flick this is very enjoyable not much depth to the plot but highly enjoyable on all counts
Nov 13 2012,positive,very good movie even if you havent watched the individual movies that go along
Nov 13 2012,positive,one of the best movies of 2012
Nov 13 2012,positive,out of all marvel movies that have been produced the avengers is the best one yet it is a great movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next not only is it a great action movie but the conflict and sarcasm between the characters definitely make you laugh at the same time this is a great movie to watch with family and friends marvel has been making movies about different heroes like iron man thor captain america and the hulk for many years now and they have finally joined together to make the avengers the avengers consists of iron man the hulk captain america thor the black widow and hawkeye their commander is nick fury each one of these characters has a specific set of skills which is why they were selected to be on the team  from the beginning all the way to the end of the movie it throws twists within the first 5 minutes a member that is on the avengerâtms gets mind washed to the bad side the twists in this movie kept my attention the entire time there was so many different wars going on as one massive war was about to break out there was brother against brother selfishness vs teamwork world vs world and also friends vs friends as i watched this i could see all the different conflicts arising the best part was watching the conflicts be resolved through different ways some was fighting and some was talking  this made this movie even better there was never a moment when something wasnâtmt going on every hero had their own fight in this movie it showed who they really are  in my personal opinion iron man is my favorite character he is funny throughout the movie but also selfish he is a one man type of guy and he doesnâtmt like teamwork as i watched the movie i noticed iron mans attitude changes he becomes more of a team player as the movie goes on he also encourages other members if it was not for iron man aka tony stark the hulk would not of found out his key on how he can control the monster inside of him if the hulk didnâtmt find this out the whole world could have been destroyed as he was a key part in the final battle this movie is a fantastic movie with many details that keep you entertained throughout the entire movie i highly recommend that you take the time to watch this movie because i would give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars the only negative to the movie is it would help to watch the movies of the heroes separately before jumping in to them becoming the avengers i say this because if you donâtmt have any background on any of the characters you may be confused on who is who and the role they play in the movie for example if you never watched thor or read a comic about him you would have no idea who loci was thors adopted brother who is trying to take over earth if you didnâtmt know who loci was then you would not understand the entire evil vibe the movie gives off other than the one and only one negative about the movie this is a must watch movie itâtms an intense action that involves comedy that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie  take the time to watch this movie and i can almost guarantee that you will love it as you sit and watch the movie all that keeps going through your head is what is going to happen next the movie grabs the viewersâtm attention right till the beginning all the way to the end they play the music perfectly so it keeps you thinking and puts you in a mood but it doesnâtmt overpower the movie everything about this movie is amazing and i would definitely take the time to watch it if you have not seen it yet
Nov 13 2012,positive,truly best action movie made
Nov 13 2012,positive,its super amazing to see all of these characters on the screen at the same time
Nov 13 2012,positive,great movieloved it
Nov 13 2012,positive,ugh its joss whedon and the avengers   i need say no more if you like the idea youll love it
Nov 12 2012,positive,i really like this movie
Nov 12 2012,positive,best comic book adaptation i ever seen so far great character driven and storyline plus special effects
Nov 12 2012,positive,it was nicely made and surprisingly funny it got a little to chaotic and i was slightly confused on black widows background but still a fun movie for everyone in my opinion
Nov 12 2012,positive,intense and actionpacked as expected what you think this movie is it is
Nov 12 2012,positive,joss whedon is amazing ill just start out by saying that as a fan of his tragically cut short tv series firefly as well as its whedon film adaptation serenity i knew this was going to be good but my problem going into the film was that i had only seen iron man and its sequel i only knew who 3 of these charcaters were and i was slightly worried i wouldnt be able to follow understand or care about the other avengers but whedon worked his magic with being able to handle an ensemble cast and make sure you know and care about each one of these guys just only seeing this film i was able to pick up on and understand each one of these characters and their stories who i hadnt seen anything of until this film that in itself is feat but you take that and have an awesome story filled with excitment excellent humor epic action and scarlett johansson it was awesome i dont know anyone who didnt like this film and its definitely one of the best superhero films ever to date 55 go see it
Nov 12 2012,positive,clearly the best superhero movie thats been made the character depth was incredible and whedon was genius with knowing how and when to use each hero without 1 overpowering everyone else a must buy
Nov 12 2012,positive,six superheroes in one movie  what more could you ask for except for fine screenplay with loads of action and humor quaranteed
Nov 12 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is actionpacked star studded film was completely and utterly awesome  the action scenes were very detailed they went and followed the individual heroes and showed their adventures together and alone  i really liked that and how they would throw little funny skits in the middle of a serious event  the entire movie was great and i dont think that i would change a thing if i could  i just hope that they will come out with sequel just as great one of the most thrilling action sequences in my opinion was the city under attack by lokis alien army  this whole section of scenes was zooming in on each character and showing their awesomeness and their ability to work as a true team  hulk and thor took down the flying whale blimp things and hawk eye went for the alien fliers  captain america black widow and iron man took control of the ground  other than that i believe that most of the other action revolved around black widow  first time you see her she takes out over four men while tied to a chair it was spectacular  she also gets chased by the hulk fights her friend hawk eye and gets into a psychological argument with loki    all this action needs some time to laugh  iron man was probably the majority of my laughter in this show  his sarcastic comments aimed at captain america intriguing prodding to dr banner and joking towards thor iron man says dr banner your work is unparalleled and im a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster to thor he says shakespeare in the park doth mother know you weareth her drapes   other funny scenes that really left a impact on me was hulk  hulk and thor took down the flying blimp monster and then hulk randomly punched thor into the wall  later hulk started throwing loki around like a rag doll and walks away saying puny god thor says when he first arrives on the flying battleship hes my brother black widow was hes killed 80 people in 3 days hes adopted says thor  this movie was beautiful  it had plenty of thrilling action good humor and fullfilled my expectations  i give this movie the best rating possible  i was a great combination of actors coming together to make an amazing family film
Nov 12 2012,positive,awesome in pretty much every way everybody can find a character to love in this movie and the fact that so many heroes are involved doesnt really detract too much from the story development the action scenes are the best and the humor is what puts the movie over the top for a 5 out 5
Nov 12 2012,positive,avengers assemble is truly a blockbuster epic that deserves the billion gross it managed to get in box office   the film is colourful and fun and is not weighed down with exposition as the universe has already been established and we have already met the characters so we arealready emotionally invested in the story the movie manages to allow each character to shine in the 2 hours of running time that it has each character makes a valuable contribution and all the actors rise to the challenge of embodying these larger than life characters   tom hiddleston wows again as the emotionally conflicted loki although i do feel that loki doesnt have enough depth to the character which made him so endearing in thor however with what he is given hiddleston portrays the character with charisma as he embarks on his plan for world domination   avengers doesnt disappoint in the action department and there is explosions aplenty throughout the film   avengers assemble is a superhero film accomplishment as it seeks to higher the stakes and push comic book movies from being grounded in realism ala the dark knight or the xmen movies into being larger than life and ultimately more comic bookish whilst not being so overt the top that audiences cannot suspend their disbelief for the films duration   a wonderful epic that weaves an exciting tale   455  stars
Nov 12 2012,positive,the avengers was a great well thought out movie i would have to say it was the best movie of the summer i didnãtmt really have any negative thoughts towards it and it never ceased to grab my attention i was a little worried about how all the main characters were going to interact with each other for meeting for the first time as super heroes and very well known talented actors that are used to having their own movies i was quickly surprised at how well all the characters performed together throughout the movie i enjoyed watching them size one another up the whole movie whether itãtms iron man and thor ripping each other apart as loki is watching from above or the hulk and thor destroying the badass invisible hover command center testing their immortality i am also very happy to see that for once a movie follows the comic booksmark ruffalo did a great job at being the new hulk and he better be in the next movie the hulk is my favorite character by far in the marvel world as he is invincible ridiculously strong and only becomes stronger when pissed off his strength is practically unlimited and i loved the part when the hulk slammed lokiãtms body on the ground repeatedly leaving him practically shell shocked on the ground whimpering  while when the hulk walked away he called loki a ãpuny godã though the movie is very action packed there is a few hilarious parts like when the hulk punches thor out of nowhere right after they took down one of the alien ship thing together another was when the hulk tried picking up thorãtms hammer and couldnãtmt succeed then of course you have iron man whose random quirky comments are always funny but it breaks up all the seriousness in the scene scarlett does a great job at being the black widow because she is a smart and hot fighter she was able to outwit loki in their very hateful conversation to find out what heãtms planning on doing with the hulk to bring down the command center  after watching this very awesome movie i can say i am highly anticipating a sequel that blows this one out of the water they could have amped up the story in some ways like give more on how thor got to earth and explain more about the tesseract
Nov 12 2012,positive,fun action packed great fit with the individual films
Nov 12 2012,positive,when you mix things up usually things get messy yet this movie shows at times it can be a nonstop roller coaster too
Nov 12 2012,neutral,to put it simply marvels the avengers does exactly what its supposed to do  if you are looking for a big fun comic book movie then you will most likely be delivered exactly what you are looking for  i give it only a fair rating because i found that after i had seen this flick it quickly faded from my memory and doesnt stand out as anything special despite how well it does its job  it is however a faithful adaptation of the franchise and plenty of good fun
Nov 12 2012,positive,love this movie hands down one of the best action movies i have seen this year it was worth the wait good acting funny with a good but of drama
Nov 12 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Nov 11 2012,positive,hands down the best super hero team up movie  dc comics now have their work cut out for them with the man of steel followed by a justice league movie  the bar has been set extremely high
Nov 11 2012,positive,i feel that joss whedon has done an excellent job in creating a film that is the culmination of some of marvelâtms biggest heroes the film does a great job of combining a quality superhero story line with whedonâtms witty humor the way six big super heroes are brought together to fight in order to defend planet earth was masterful from this movie we get a feel of the previous marvel movies while bringing something entirely new to the table this is definitely a standalone movie in my mind but it does not hurt to have seen some of the other recent marvel movies to have an even stronger connection to the characters itâtms tough trying to fit six story lines into just over two hours of film but in my eyes it could not have been done much better the fact that the half a dozen heroes were not just fighting to save the earth but also battling each other at the same time gave much more depth to the story as well as the characters  robert downey jr chris hemsworth and all the other stars do a great job in performing as their respected characters and though the storyline is great they each bring something different to the table to add to the films entertainment and quality joss whedon has outdone his previous very popular marvel movies with a movie that is not only filled with the action and thrill that youd expect from a super hero movie but also depth and strong characters who we really start to root for even when they are at odds with each other although two hours and 23 minutes may sound like a long time this films fastpaced witty entertainment makes time fly this movie will satisfy action movie fans as well as die hard superhero movies fans it has a little bit of something for everyone and thats really what makes this movie so popular all in all when you see this movie you dont have to analyze it to know it is a greatly entertaining movie but it doesnt hurt that behind its popularity it is a solid story with strong protagonists and amusing humor  whedon has done well for the franchise with his renditions of marvel heroes and i am looking forward to more iconic films like this one in the future keep up the good work joss whedon
Nov 11 2012,positive,this movie runs an average of seven to eleven times a week at my house since its been out posted 111112
Nov 11 2012,positive,it was ok i suppose but i left the cinema with the feeling of yeahand  downey jr is true to form at speaking too quickly and being irritating as stark johanssen and renner are pointless characters
Nov 11 2012,positive,this movie is purepopcorn entertainment it boasts two of the longest sustained action sequences that i can recall for any film one on the hellicarrier and one in new york though i like the villain loki i think his emotional arc was better played out in the movie thor thus making him a slightly silly villain in this movie the most impressive thing about this film is joss whedons script and direction juggling so many big characters while still keeping the movie comprehendible and entertaining
Nov 11 2012,positive,movie doesnt disappoint in any phase masterful
Nov 11 2012,positive,sfx galore mixed with good balance of comedy and story very glad to have seen thor and captain america relatively closely to  watching this though
Nov 11 2012,positive,the cherry on that marvel film cake fun at the movies returns
Nov 11 2012,positive,was better than i thought it would be
Nov 11 2012,positive,funny and entertaining good action
Nov 11 2012,positive,simply amazing well paced decent backstory filler without over whelming easily one of the best
Nov 11 2012,positive,i loved this film so much however that does not make me blind to its flaws   sticking quite close to the comics it was pretty much what most people were expecting and was enjoyable however trying to equally split up a couple of hours between six protagonists is never easy especially when a large chunk of your target audience want effects effects violence effects violence violence and effects as such i really saw no point in captain america in this film i mean seriously what did he actually do the same can be said for black widow and hawkeye   downey jr as always was hilarious but also as always the centre of attention every time he was on screen i can understand why they did it iron man was the most successful of the films and at the moment is the most popular of the avengers but it made a job that was always going to be difficult even harder loki was acted convincingly except for the mewling quim remark which although amused me greatly that it was allowed into a 12 seemed completely out of nowhere yes yes they were trying to set him up as the bad guy but it seemed out of place  thor lets be honest was only there to give loki a reason to attack and to look pretty which he does very well but hey at least there was no annoying and pointless romance between portman and him this time round   on to my main point you do not put samuel l jackson in a movie and then give him so little screen time   on the whole i watched the film seven times in the cinema and loved it every time however it was a thoroughly flawed film that hid behind its visual effects and relied on most of its audience knowing enough about the original comics and films to fill in some emotional attachment to the characters
Nov 11 2012,positive,currently the greatest superhero movie to date
Nov 11 2012,positive,this is definatly my favourite film of all time excluding the predictable ending its a marvel movie and lets not forget more kids are into marvel than dc so there not actually gonna kill off an important character like on of the avengersthey might do in the sequel not a single bit failed to meet my expectations it was fantastic
Nov 11 2012,positive,a fun movie to watch because providing more comedic approach to superhero movies unlike movies like the dark knight rises its worth watching if you do not like a comedy superhero movie then it isnt for you  action fills the gaps left by the story and the acting is great one of the reasons to watch this movie are the hulk scenes no questions asked  i decided to rate it 455 because even though i like action story still is a big part of a movie which this lacked
Nov 11 2012,positive,excellent film all character interactions were well played
Nov 11 2012,positive,awesome flick i wanna grow up and throw people around like the hulk but seriously the avengers is a good movie very well put together awesome action and some humor
Nov 11 2012,positive,if dc can get a justice league movie this good i might die happy
Nov 11 2012,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen pure class little slow at start as builds up story and the rest of film is just great entertainment
Nov 11 2012,positive,it was the perfect movie it felt like you dont want it to end comedydramaaction etc all in one in this one of a kind masterpiece
Nov 11 2012,positive,this movie set a new standard for superhero movies fun exciting dramatic and attentive to portraying each hero with depth avengers is a superb action flick
Nov 10 2012,positive,so good even my 3 yr old loved it
Nov 10 2012,positive,this was freaking amazing the cast the story the music everything loved every minute of it it was one of those movies that left me feeling all amped up  ready to save the world its always a good sign when you leave the theater with the message  mood of the movie super super awesome
Nov 10 2012,positive,iron mans the bomb
Nov 10 2012,positive,well now see id have loved this movie to the moon and back if it hadnt been for 1 the hulk sulk throughout the movie yes you have a problem yes its not exactly fun and crackers but geez get over yourself already 2 black widow and hawkeye were in the film for what reason 3 captain america  sanctimonious much 4 i thought they were meant to be action scenes not action epic dramas cut those battles to a third of their length and theyd still have been a tad too long look he hit a monster oh and another one and another and another and another and suddenly a colon irrigation sounds more fun   so a good movie some nice laughs but not as awesomely wow as it was made out to be
Nov 10 2012,positive,a great crossover film marvel has done a really great job with this years blockbuster
Nov 10 2012,positive,eith the complex cast and player joss whedon is able to direct them effectively the plot is simple every character developed effectivelycant wait for the sequel
Nov 10 2012,positive,my ultimate confession i saw this entertaining garbage at the theater whedon is an overrated douchebag but i wont neglect his intelligence at establishing a specific fan base with stupidities like firefly and serenity and adding it to the enthusiasm that the already hyped world audiences were feeling its michael bay with better orchestrated cgi wow thats just the perfect homoeconomicus strategy go back to final fantasy advent children and see how this business is really run  66100
Nov 10 2012,negative,boring boring boring my brain cells stopped working for low activity required on this shitty movie i never slept so good in a movie theater i will recommend this movie to my enemies
Nov 10 2012,positive,one graet action packed movie loved this movie id see it again and again
Nov 10 2012,positive,this was very entertaining  enjoyed it alot
Nov 10 2012,positive,great actions set pieces but it lacks a strong story
Nov 10 2012,positive,i thought that one movie with this many unique character stories and personalities and stories would try and do too much and in turn fail miserably i was pleasantly surprised to see i was completely wrong this has a wellconstructed story that successfully brings together all of these superheroes in an effective manner and offers a nice dynamic as they struggle with their egos to come together and work as a team the villain is good and is actually formidable enough and merit putting this dream team together it is a long movie but it never feels like it drags or seems overly long it successfully avoids stepping on itself by contradicting earlier set ups and pervious movies a task that was not as easy as it sounds we were familiar with most of the loaded cast from previous movies but they work even better when they share the stage as a team this movie has a great soundtrack a strong cast good direction quality special effects and a solid story to make it stand out as a special superhero movie
Nov 10 2012,neutral,the avengers is not told by an idiot but it is full of sound and fury signifying nothing but that nothing is nonetheless everything what marvel and joss whedons grandiose overstuffed airborne beast of a superhero urmovie signifies is the feverish daydream of an american mass culture entirely unmoored from the necessitous advantages of signification it is epochal in its way for its times but that is not to say that it is in the narrowest sense good or bad it stamps such distinctions into the dirty earth as a film it does not seduce or persuade or convince it tramples  to kvetch so about the avengerss lack of underlying meaning is to be a hopeless bore so lets be hopeless though hopefully not boring for all there is to recommend it i cannot or rather there isnt any point in recommending it or not which is the exact problem the avengers is not merely postcriticism this concept might sound like a good thing to many but then it sounded pretty good to stalin too it is  in its elaborate allencompassing inevitable dominance  postideology slavoj zizek said in a recent television appearance that ideology functions even if you dont believe in it but even this gnomic inverteddonut slovenian marxistlacanian logic is no match for the avengers thought crumbles in the face of its enormity faith is not even in the conversation its pointless to even criticize it as a simple overblown corporate product although it is one its fundamental commodification explodes reconstitutes itself from the energy of the blast then implodes until nothing is left to grasp onto it is a mystery wrapped loosely in an enigma reclining on a bed of money oysters and looted art inviting us puny mortals to lick its toes and who are we to say no  if these issues seem tenuously drawn or overly theoretical its because a traditional critical dissection of the films cinematic parts cannot avail us in comprehending the excessive lack before our eyes by all the terms by which we ought to understand the movies the avengers is a wild success presaged by no less than five previous superhero films it represents an ambitious culmination of the translation of comicbook storytelling form into motion pictures for good or for ill if whedon has no particular style worth pointing out as a filmmaker then he gladly indulges in destructive visual fantasies of gigantic scope like a good hollywood sport and a wellversed comics fanatic in particular extended action and battle sequences aboard a secret security agencys flying aircraft carrier your tax dollars at work america and in midtown manhattan are grand and exhausting exercises in violent vision  additionally because this is joss whedon working from his own script every character banters fluently in whedonspeak which is sometimes amusing in its witty inertia but just as frequently oddly defamiliarizing and capable of pulling us out of the moment and the avengers exists in nothing but the moment ultimately so allowing the audience to be yanked out of it doesnt work out in its favour very often whedons cadre of actors are happy to meld into the larger picture and grab at their own moments here and there robert downey jr and mark ruffalo have some nice beats together as tony iron man stark and bruce banner the incredible hulk may never catch on with audiences in his own flick but is compelling in small doses here and gets one of the best gratuitous violence gags with tom hiddlestons villainous loki and chris hemsworths buff thor is a magnetic laconic delight again most of the other actors fill the eyecandy role although jeremy renner needs a nonaction role or two but quick to avoid career stagnation and serve some useful function in the plot which for all of its reliance on a shiny macguffin the tesseract or something is very much constructed with interlocking intetionality  by any measure then the avengers was a triumphant commercial success and is perhaps an aesthetic one as well at least in its given context of cryogenicallypreserved eternal male adolescence but if this exquisitelymounted pile of absorbing emptiness qualifies as a success of what use can the term be to us anymore this movie represents success in the postmillenial sense that has given us hedgefund billionaires and realityshow debutants and very nearly president mitt romney its not that the avengers itself is terrible its just that in its undeniable accomplishment it embodies a particular economic cultural and social context that is terrible terrible in the anachronistic meaning of great imposing and irresistible alternately one could employ awesome and not in the sense that the word was used by the movies fanboy target audience which it seems to have thoroughly conquered the avengers as its smug snobbish demigod villain does at one point in germany of all places invites us to bow down to its superiority because that is our nature as pathetic humanoids unable to fathom disappointing the film in all its impressive glory we obeyed and perhaps that says as much about us as it does about the movie
Nov 10 2012,positive,totally good casting great special effects and a neat story make this a powerhouse and it doesnt ruin the effect joss wanted
Nov 10 2012,positive,mark ruffalo as the hulk was incredible   rdj was his usual weirdly funnycomical iron man postrehab hopefully the last  final one i feel that he plays the same character in multiple rolescostumes imagine iron man with a british accent like sherlock  sherlock wearing an iron manand it fit perfectly d  the nobromancebromance between the hulk  thor was hilarious   blockbuster with high repeatvalue must watch
Nov 10 2012,negative,over hyped dullness
Nov 10 2012,positive,hands down one of the best superhero movies made  with an excellent ensemble cast the avengers is everything you want in a blockbuster movie  the performances by downey  ruffalo were very good and the story did a good job of focusing on the individual characters and they became marvels best team  check it out
Nov 10 2012,positive,why is captain america in this movie alsothormmmmm
Nov 10 2012,positive,fantastically brilliant
Nov 10 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies
Nov 10 2012,positive,surprisingly good minus one point though because samuel l jackson is in it
Nov 10 2012,positive,boring at first but from mid to the end they make you dont want to blink even for a secd
Nov 10 2012,positive,only supplanted by the dark knight rises as top movie of 2012 in my opinion this film had my attention from the start i was curious to see how each character was going to be handled and if each would receive a fair amount of screen time this aspect was handled flawlessly bring on thanos
Nov 9 2012,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever made
Nov 9 2012,positive,awesome  enjoyed it immensely  best quote puny god  the hulk
Nov 9 2012,positive,best superhero movie combination
Nov 9 2012,positive,moral super heros must cooperate excellent action and special effects
Nov 9 2012,positive,whedon captures lighting in a bottle with a movie that blends action humor good character development and wit in such a perfect way that it seems irreplicable
Nov 9 2012,neutral,nothing compared to the dark knight the avengers takes a different approach to the adaption of comics it brings a humorous side of ironman and the action of captain america a fun and explosive blockbuster but in terms of cinematic pleasure the avengers is in no way an amazement its full of unneeded blasts of huge buildings and needless action overall a great blockbuster to see that brings respect back to the hulk
Nov 9 2012,positive,great cant wait for the rest of the marvel movies
Nov 9 2012,positive,it was an outstanding film i have seen it 3 times and want it for christmas
Nov 9 2012,positive,this movie has everything a summer blockbuster should have great characters dialogue that is great when it takes itself seriously or lightly and of course plenty of action
Nov 9 2012,positive,this was entertaining as shiznitz i loved everything about it and didnt even have to use my brain once theres some avesome laughs too
Nov 8 2012,positive,just watched obviously was majorly hyped up thought the story was food considering they had to combine a bunch of characters and develop new ones some of the humor was funny some was cheesy i just wish there was more action scenes
Nov 8 2012,neutral,its confusing joss whedon is touted as a writer with ingenuity after making firefly and cabin in the woods so why is the avengers so awfully predictable
Nov 8 2012,positive,starts off slow but once all the gang come together take a deep breath because the action never stops great effects mixed with good humour
Nov 8 2012,positive,im not that big on avengers but i must say this movie was great  and well put together  kept me entertained through out  its must see for all you marval fans
Nov 8 2012,positive,its hard to make a more entertaining movie super in 3d
Nov 8 2012,positive,loads of action more to come i hope
Nov 8 2012,positive,very good not transformery and actually very funny
Nov 8 2012,positive,really enjoy this movie
Nov 8 2012,positive,a big collection of the heros
Nov 8 2012,positive,i was expecting it to be an absolute perfect film knowing that i love these types of films but unfortunately i was not met with that overall an incredible superhero film though
Nov 8 2012,neutral,the film has it all wits action superheroes visual effects villain a kickass robin himym and a cameo of stan lee sum it all up and youll find yourself a boxoffice hit action film    but the usual kind where the film comes off as overrated and foreseeable
Nov 8 2012,positive,love the battle fight scenes the ending where all 7 fight as one to fight off enemies is my best part of the movie
Nov 7 2012,positive,good movielove thor
Nov 7 2012,positive,good movie gets a little slow for having so many superheroes for me the best parts were the ones with the hulk
Nov 7 2012,positive,my brother loved it i felt it was pretty good but i would have liked it if they would have already had the storys for hawk eye and black widow out before they put this movie out
Nov 7 2012,positive,first thing im gonna say about this movie it is a mustsee in the theater this movie was actually a lot bigger than i thought it would be they actually had lines for it it was crazy going in i will admit i had some doubts about this one after all hollywood sure aint what it used to be but i was very pleased with this film and pleasantly surprised as it turned to be far better than i expected lots and lots of good action throughout along with a good storyline awesome characters that clash when they are all put together at first and then later learn to work together as a team to fight one of the baddest villains ive seen in a while you cant get much more epic than this group of superheroes i never read the comics or saw the tv shows but this is one epic movie lots of humor in this one too but not too much to overshadow the film itself all around great movie if you somehow missed seeing this in the theater then am i ever sorry
Nov 7 2012,positive,if your a fan of marvel comics or superhero comics in general then this is your wet dream this year however if like me your not that fussed on marvelcomics then it is an enjoyable hioctane action movie with the usual predictable action film plot i wouldnt pay to watch it again but i would watch if it was on the television
Nov 7 2012,positive,i thought the avengers was probably one of the best superhero movies ever made good effects the acting was amazing and the plot was spectacualer
Nov 7 2012,positive,one word magnafuckingriffic
Nov 7 2012,positive,glad to see they got the hulk right
Nov 7 2012,positive,not bad film cant wait for the nxt one
Nov 7 2012,neutral,the most that the avengers manages to get off the ground is their falling base which i must confess was a wonderfully executed and exciting scene one of the few praises i can give this film my problems the preestablished characters are the same as in undeveloped or in some cases just plain unlikable whedons tendency to use snark instead of development doesnt help the new characters are put aside making it very hard to connect with them the climax which was hyped up prior to release is disappointing and plain predictable youve established most of these characters with other films now that you have them all in one place do something with them
Nov 6 2012,negative,couldnt get past the first scene what is a tesseract who are these people what is going on what is this place why why why et al basically breaks every rule of filmmaking and storytelling that i hold dear
Nov 6 2012,positive,more than i could have hoped for this is the film that brought back my hope in group superhero movies after the disappointment that was the xmen franchise
Nov 6 2012,positive,love it seen it 3 times in 2 days
Nov 6 2012,positive,not only thrilling and intriguing but so hilarious at all the right moments
Nov 6 2012,positive,very entertaining movie i like lots hero unite in one movie its like u collect lots dvd and play it at oncegood story too good effect i think the scene are flawless
Nov 6 2012,positive,loved it put it together really well exept one thing the person that did the hulk should still be the guy from the original film
Nov 6 2012,positive,96 of the audience liked it the other 4 need to go watch christian bale climb out of a hole for a hour again
Nov 6 2012,positive,as a whole the film fulfils almost every expectation that any fan could have had it is a magnificent spectacle with an enviable cast and it fully delivers unfortunately the story is hardly revolutionary but did we ever want it to be
Nov 6 2012,positive,as a whole the film fulfils almost every expectation that any fan could have had it is a magnificent spectacle with an enviable cast and it fully delivers unfortunately the story is hardly revolutionary but did we ever want it to be
Nov 6 2012,positive,awesome movie if you havent seen it do i love the whole story and how it connects to captain america the only down side is i think they push to hard for comedy they dont need other than that i love it
Nov 6 2012,positive,the avengers delivers the film is solid and the characters although are depicted more as squabbling complacent heroes up at the front still entertains the audience the only problem is avengers did not tug at my heart i received a simple moral message from it but i derived nothing else that really impacted
Nov 6 2012,positive,this movie had some of my favourite marvel characters everyone interacted with the others the way you think they actually would this movie was just amazing
Nov 6 2012,positive,oh so thats what all the hype was about
Nov 5 2012,positive,great action from beginning till end  amazing special effects and a great mix of super hero characters  only thing not too attractive was the addition of scarlett johanssen as a superassassin  otherwise very smart and genuine  great super hero action film
Nov 5 2012,positive,marvel did a good job of making the individual movies leading up to the avengers that it was pretty hard to fuck up even if it meant getting critical darling but commercially unsuccessful joss whedon to direct the gettogether extravaganza the dialogue may be campy and the story is utterly predictable as well but it is a lot of fun and youll get a lot more out of it by watching all the previous films newcomers will be scratching their heads a lot but the explosions and fights make up for it very well
Nov 5 2012,positive,beefy hot super heros and good acting cant go wrong 
Nov 5 2012,positive,i really enjoyed the movie some of the lines were corny comedy but they really made it work because it balanced out all the intense action scenes robert downey jr was phenomenal in his role as iron man and i believe this will be one of the top films of the year 2012
Nov 5 2012,positive,a fun and highly energetic superhero flick that although i had great doubts works surprisingly well  given by now that almost everyone has seen this superb blockbuster i wont go into any plot details but i will say this the avengers is one of the most tightly scripted and enthusiastically produced films that i have ever seen  the production value was high but it was obviously put to good use as every cent shows up on the screen of this ambitious action extravaganza  those looking for intense action grande visuals and a thrilling ride will have to look no further  all the superheros play off each other superbly the signature humor of the past marvel iterations is bumped up a few notches but not so much so that the film becomes a silly testing grounds and the creativity that whedon brings is on full effect here taking the crown of summer blockbuster with ease  with that said the film holds little to no emotional context as one would come to expect and there are a few holes within the films plot that are noticeable after two showings  still the avengers is one of the funnest times ive had as a movie goer in quite some time  definitely one of the greatest superhero flicks to ever grace the screens  a heroic spectacle of the largest measures
Nov 5 2012,positive,going in skeptical of another heartless actionsaturated hero flick i was blown away by the reach and resonance of the film it has all the elements of a typical superhero story but its execution took me by surprise even at the expected plot points
Nov 5 2012,positive,great movie now i see why everyone raved about it
Nov 5 2012,positive,best movie i have seen in my life but i am sure avengers 2 will be better
Nov 5 2012,positive,awesome movie ill will be watching it again soon
Nov 5 2012,positive,they must have had a ball making this make a big jug of margaritas grab a slab of chocolate a couple of friends whack this on and crank up the volume
Nov 5 2012,positive,waited years for this movie and it exceeded every expectation and then some fantastic performances especially from its lead villain if there ever was a movie you had to see this is it
Nov 5 2012,positive,a familiar superhero film with visual effects ensemble castbut the avengers delivers some more laughter and a great cast
Nov 5 2012,positive,reflecting over the blockbuster season of 2012  despite the release of the forthcoming the hobbit  its safe to say that marvels the avengers will take the crown for the biggest and most successful film of the year besides the likes of the dark knight rises the hype for the first assemble of marvels beloved heroes was unparalleled beginning with the success of iron man and nick furys final comments im here to talk to you about the avenger initiative the hype began to build with the additional efforts of thor captain america and the continual drip feeding provided from the after credit sequences all that was left to do was to assemble each individual into one juggernaut in terms of blockbuster the film ultimately succeeds in providing the balance of entertainment and laughter while still containing the essence of the marvel universe despite such virtues the film is all formula not even attempting to challenge the generics and continually injecting comic relief to the point that the characters actions becomes tedious and robotic  explosion laughter explosion laughter but maybe i am being too harsh well what i mean say is that i dont think the avengers wants challenge the generics and maybe it doesnt have to the film simply wants to display a universe that does not crumble around the structure and accumulation of such grandeur characters thankfully due to joss whedons screenplay the film juggles six separate superheroes with a sense of exhilarating ease which is an achievement in itself
Nov 4 2012,positive,awesome entertainment
Nov 4 2012,positive,this has to be one of the best superhero films of all time hands down  the fantastic performance from the whole cast is quite incredible with none of the characters felling minor or major respectively the new cast member of jeremy renners hawkeeye is probably the weakest of all of the characters but still dose not feel to weak that he comes boring so to speak  this is defiantly the credit of the director joss whedon who blends all of the characters to perfect balance and also proves that the team is not tony stark and co all of the characters have there moment as the hero of the moment which is great to seealthough full off plenty of plot holes the film is a whirlwind ride while watching it and once leaving the cinema you can only ask for more more and more
Nov 4 2012,positive,hilarious witty and on key all the way
Nov 4 2012,positive,loved it also got it dvd
Nov 4 2012,positive,this movie is flatoutfun it is one of the best super hero movies i have ever seen the film moves along at a quick clip as the back stories of the characters have already been addressed in previous films we move right into witty dialogue and action there is rarely a dull moment big super hero flicks tend to have a fair amount of cheese but this one manages to keep it minimal the writer and director manage to give the impression that the characters might actually be in real danger  you arent always certain any one of them is going to make it to the next scene there is suspense comedy and action by the bucketloads if you are a fan of action or super hero flicks then your money and time will be well spent
Nov 4 2012,positive,my favourite part is when hulk smashes loggy in the ground a bunch of times
Nov 4 2012,positive,and then there was this
Nov 4 2012,positive,flat out awesome incredible wrap in of so many characters the dynamic of all these guys together is off the charts then they throw in a few extras a revisioning of the hulk and hawkeye it has been the best film i have seen in the theatres since lord of the rings it is clean and funny and definitly woth seeing
Nov 4 2012,positive,one of the most fun action packed movies i have  ever seen got to watch it
Nov 4 2012,negative,i have no idea why everyo loves this movie  i thought it sucked
Nov 4 2012,positive,would like to see it again
Nov 4 2012,positive,along with the 1st iron man a shining example of what a fun superhero movie should be
Nov 4 2012,positive,theres no scenario where joss whedon gets the credit he deserves for the avengers certainly hell be lauded for the cash this boxoffice bogart is already piling up and critics seem impressed enough with the film to plant it firmly in the upper echelon of comic book movies but the success whedon has achieved is far loftier than that encompassing years of marvel canon hoards of characters beloved to fans and unparalleled expectations put another way making this movie was an unprecedented challenge and the avengers isnt perfect though that was never really an option in the first place there are far too many elements that would have to be handled flawlessly far too much scrutiny from far too many directions to ever truly be called perfect it is however as good as it was ever going to be and considering the circumstances thats pretty damn good  the avengers kicks off with the villanous loki tom hiddlestonlast seen falling through a wormhole at the end of thorstealing the arcane and apparently dangerous tesseract shield director nick fury samuel l jackson appreciating the threat this combination poses to the planet sets in motion the avengers initiative calling together earths mightiest heroes to protect her tony starkiron man robert downey jr steve rogerscaptain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth bruce bannerthe hulk mark ruffalo along with shield agents natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson and clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner not surprisingly this collection of superpowered personalities struggles to fuse resulting in a variety of heated discourse sharptongued invectives and punching  what fans of the comic book ideally fans everywhere are going to appreciate most is whedons ability to maintain these characters personalities its not overstating anything to reiterate just how wildly difficult this movie was to make there are frankly an absurd number of characters to keep track of and thats just in making sure the audience knows whats going on the task of building these characters and their relationships and their ability to work as a cohesive and believable unit in battle coupled with the inevitable heat that comes when you reprocess cherished source material that is a job very very few individuals could handle yet whedon in his first stint with a feature marvel production does the job quite well certainly avengers will be remembered for its bombast as it should which ill get to momentarily but theres no shortage of subtlety in the characters and relationships whether its caps oldschool patriotism vs iron mans contemporary egoism or hawkeyes brash militarism contrasting widows expert manipulation whedon makes it startlingly clear just how deeply he understands the characters hes wielding and that deep understanding isnt just apparent in the discourse but the action as well which brings us to the climax of the avengers  at a basic level all of these marvel films are about the liveaction portrayal of characters who while built around visual dynamism are generally restricted to the static twodimensionality of a comic book page and please dont let that read as slander for i am now and always will be a huge comic book fan seeing iron man fly for the first time is thrilling in a way that cant really be matched and if you can add to that some strong character moments and a despicable villain youre set but this is a collection of unique characters with unique abilities the clear challenge then for whedonspecifically in approaching the avengers from an action standpointis how to maintain these characters unique personalities within a battle well rest assured as joss proves more than equal to this task as well in the films 40 minute climax the role each of these characters plays as a member of a team is beautifully articulated iron man is the mind hulk and thor the big guns hawkeye the steadyhanded vet widow the sly warrior and cap quite crucially as the leader and not only do whedon and cowriter zak penn clearly define these roles within perhaps one of the best extended action sequences ever put to film but they somehow do it organically allowing the characters to develop and grow together as the world crumbles around them while theres never any fear that the earth will actually be destroyed there is nonetheless a reasonable question mark surrounding how six individualsand three of them plain ol humanscould possibly save it yet when its all said and done nothing about the films conclusion or the way this team comes together feels false in fact the final set piece of the avengers is probably marvels best cinematic moment to date  as i said the films not perfect theres some awkward dialogue and squeaky exchanges mark ruffalo is great but its hard not to imagine ed norton being just as good if not better and for whatever reason samuel l seems to be mailing this one in which is a shame nick fury could have been a fantastic character but besides these smallish misstepswhich weve frankly grown accustomed to in our summer movies anywaythe avengers is a thoroughly successful achievement on a grand scale it is wellwritten wellacted and breathtaking from a visual standpoint but more than all that its just a lot of fun its the sort of film you want to watch over and over again because of all the stuff you know you missed and while joss whedon seems destined to always fly just a little under the radar his name is going to get quite a bit more mileage than hes used to in the coming months
Nov 4 2012,positive,a fun popcorn movie but people need to settle down about this movie
Nov 4 2012,positive,greatest superhero movie ever
Nov 4 2012,positive,well done  iron man continues to steal the show  we just need thor to toughen up a little captain america to stay frozen and lou ferigno to come back because he always gives 110
Nov 4 2012,positive,loved this movie i could watch it over and over again
Nov 4 2012,neutral,definitely not a chick flick
Nov 4 2012,positive,actionpacked and full to the brim with alist stars avengers assemble is a great summer blockbuster which would be perfect if it werent for a collection of tedious scenes  act 2 is where the film suffers yet act 3 is where it picks itself back up again delivering an exceptional climax justice league of america watch out
Nov 4 2012,negative,why is one supposed to write a rational logical review on an illogical irrational movie with no connection to human beings this movie is utter rubbish special effects are interesting but can be incorporated into any movie why not make an incoherent movie with disconnected sequence of special effects
Nov 4 2012,positive,by far the best superhero movie i have ever seen and was super funny cant wait to watch it again and again
Nov 3 2012,positive,ill admit i was pleasantly surprised by just how well this movie played out never before had i been so overwhelmed with such good plot twists
Nov 3 2012,positive,best movie the hulk is beast in it
Nov 3 2012,positive,casta scripta real funny like other marvel films actiona special effectsa some of the best ive seen villainb probally the lowest part loki is kinda getting old but hiddleston still was great anough to keep me feeling like he is a threat to them the alien army was like useless pawns
Nov 3 2012,positive,nonstop thrill ride
Nov 3 2012,positive,simply one of the best movies in 2012 it has amzing graphics and breathtaking special effects
Nov 3 2012,positive,awesome action packed w some funny bits added to it really great entertaining movie
Nov 3 2012,positive,although i am giving this 4 12 stars i am still more with batman  dc comics i am very disappointed that warner bros  dc comics could have released a justice league liveaction film at least five years before walt disney motion pictures  marvel released this film i am sure they and i are having the sputnik syndrome
Nov 3 2012,positive,a has everything comedy action and story
Nov 3 2012,positive,after seeing a couple of disapointing marvel movies i finally got to see not only one of favorite film of 2012 but my favorite superhero movie of all time  almost all the marvel heroes are finally together in this epic film  its funny and its one heck of a rollar coaster ride  sure its a really long film but i never got bored of it  when the movie was over i wanted to see more of it
Nov 3 2012,positive,loved this was right up my street
Nov 3 2012,positive,this was more than a decent romp and well worth a watch if youre a scifi or comic book fan i would say its a must watch enjoyed it so much im sorry i didnt get round to watching captain america
Nov 3 2012,positive,mildly entertaining would not watch again
Nov 3 2012,positive,not a bad popcorn flick but it lacks the substance to make it truly great maybe iron man 3s darker tone will have influence on the avengers second outing
Nov 3 2012,positive,the hulk basically made that movie
Nov 3 2012,positive,it was a good ok movie it was more of an iron man hulk movie but i cant wait for the sequel
Nov 3 2012,positive,what a visual treat best marvel movie so far

Nov 3 2012,positive,joss whedon did an excellent job great one liners  action sequences
Nov 3 2012,positive,simplistic a doubleedged sword which works out for character development plot and the moviegoing experience  and yet after watching the film still lacks an unknown element but a great film nonetheless
Nov 2 2012,positive,this movie is awesome  its kept from being epic by lack of a worthwhile enemy but believe me its awesome
Nov 2 2012,neutral,the film has a bad history but a good development
Nov 2 2012,positive,good action movie 92 not way
Nov 2 2012,positive,despite suffering from a slow start the avengers delivers excellently as soon as it gets into its groove whedon has created a wonderful script that never fails to underdeliver on humour action or excitement the best thing is the fact that whedon makes superheroes appealing and relatable to everyone definitely no mean feat
Nov 2 2012,positive,es una pelicula spectacularrrrrrr of course not of the 250 best films in the world but a quality action flick also the avengers eating shoarma is the best final shot of a an action film ive ever seen
Nov 2 2012,positive,just about everything you could want in a film and a bonus for having no cheesy dialogue and a bunch of actorsactresses all eager to recite every line as if the academy is considering them for an oscar  awesome flick  cant wait for more
Nov 2 2012,positive,awesome movie marcel did a great job with iron man leading the way i would like a better cap but oh well he dont really seem like the leadership guy
Nov 2 2012,negative,1 minute of trite dialogue 30 mins of trite fight scenes sam jackson is given one line dialogue probably because thats all he can handle such as hey we dont come to your planet and blow stuff up talk to me  lame from start to finish
Nov 2 2012,positive,it was decent took a while to build up overall good movie

Nov 2 2012,positive,the movie that marvel has been building up to several films in advance  and it does not let you down it seems marvel has actually aimed to perfect its art through the dismal fantastic four series and the mediochre xmen and spiderman franchises to the positive surprises of iron man and captain america  and this this is how comic book adaptations should be made while the movie might drag slightly when each hero is dutifully given hiser due screen time the overall result is near flawless in its genre one of the best super hero movies out there
Nov 2 2012,positive,i dont get the hype yeah the action is great but most the characters are so unlikeable and this is brought over from their solo films too to me capt is the only one to cheer for ever
Nov 2 2012,positive,this is officially atop my all time favorites list solid story superb acting nonstop action a pure action flick

Nov 1 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this far more than i expected to it has a lot of fast paced action an interesting storyline and some great comedic moments robert downey jr totally ruled the movie as iron man however mark ruffalos hulk has some terrific moments the two extra clips at the end were funone dramatic and one hilarious
Nov 1 2012,positive,probably the most fun  action movie ive ever seen loved it

Nov 1 2012,positive,a fantastic superhero film that will have you laughing out loud one moment and staring in awe the next the sequel will have a lot to live up to
Nov 1 2012,positive,one of the best comic movies ever made although the story had its holes it was just what it needed to be the acting was great the script and dialogue was fun and witty and the climax was just great and too fun to disappoint great job joss whedon this was the most fun in the movies ive had for a long time
Nov 1 2012,negative,it does nothing new felt like they were just recycling from all the characters original movies
Nov 1 2012,positive,enjoyable movie with characters that actually have personalities for the most part instead of relying solely on the audience just knowing them as superheroes they actually made the hulk an interesting character that said i have literally no idea why this movie made everybody crap their pants
Nov 1 2012,positive,this was my favorite movie of the year so far i actually watched this first before any of the individual movies so once i saw this in theaters i had to go home and watch all the ones before
Nov 1 2012,positive,oh man dont get me startedits one movie every last person on earth should watch
Nov 1 2012,positive,kaboom kaboom kaboom and pretty haired norse guys

Nov 1 2012,positive,it doesnt quite bring the awesome like it should but its decent entertainment nonetheless
Nov 1 2012,positive,it was a good film  wish thered been a story in there somewhere  i miss the heart of thor and the wit of the original iron man  this one felt more like the explosionfest that was iron man 2 with better writing
Nov 1 2012,negative,a get together of superheroes should have been set more entertainingly when you dont have a story good enough even a lot of superheroes fail to keep you hooked the aviator might have sounded exciting on paper but what i watched was a letdown i take consolation in knowing that it worked out for the majority of its audience purely going by the ratings shown here cant wait for the sequel with all due respect 15 sounds fair enough for the experience miss the good old days wherein i can picture myself enjoying this sort of movie
Nov 1 2012,positive,marvel studioâtms action packed superhero film the avengers summerâtms biggest movie premiere lives up to the expectations that were placed on the movie but misses in terms of a great central plot while the movie was a huge success especially at putting multiple heroes into one movie the movie lacked a strong plot when watching an action movie we suspect that things will be blown up which is exactly what happens for a good part of the movie the plot of the superheroes unwilling to come together to fight an alien race from taking over the world could have been expanded rather than spending half of the movie destroying new york city the plot of the avengers may have been weaker than expected but in no way does it disappoint movie goers with its starstudded cast and action packed pace not only is the movie a must watch but a must have on dvd bluray may be a better choice where the sounds of the action is intensified and the quality of the movie is better detailed the cast composed of robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo scarlett johansson samuel l jackson jeremy renner and tom hiddleston was a bunch of actors and an actress brought together to make this superhero movie a success usually superhero movies focus on one character with the exception of the xmen series another marvel studio production because the stage time is not enough to suitably cover more what makes it different is that while  xmen is consider a team in the marvel comic series the avengers is more of a handful of individual superheroes forced to come together it makes the avengers a little more difficult to give each superhero the time needed to tell the story of the character joss whedon the director of the film brilliantly makes sure that each character shares the screen time and he puts the characters in a situation that would fit the person of the character while i felt that the chemistry of the cast showed throughout the film as the acting was very well rounded they seemed to play the part of the character very well and each complimented one another each actor and actress played a huge role in the film but i felt that loki played by tom hiddleston did not completely live up to the role i had imagined and which the movie demanded him to play while lokiâtms character in marvelâtms earlier film thor was more mild mannered the avengers demanded him to be more dark even though tom hiddleston for the most part played the character well i thought that he could have made the character loki someone to fear which we all had imagined he would do though tom hiddlestonâtms performance was mediocre the wellrounded cast was more than enough to enable the superhero movie to be a success marvelâtms the avengers comic series was a common backbone of the reference for the avengers in the comic series the main characters based upon were the four main characters of the avengers movie the comparison was strengthened by the fact that the first villain faced by the avengers was loki while the comic book series and movie had plenty of commonalities in the movie it definitely missed on some parts in the comic book series the avengers consisted of a few more superheroes that werenâtmt included in the movie antman and wasp when the movie was in production it was speculated that they would introduce the last two characters during the film after marvel announced that they wouldnâtmt be in the movie the avengers team didnâtmt seem as complete as it should have been as many were hoping to see the complete team while the addition could have made the movie much better the effort to introduce such characters would have dragged out the showing time which could have had the audience sit through another hour of the film while sitting through the film i couldnâtmt help but notice the bland plot that surrounded the movie the plot focused too much time on its action packed scenes rather than on character development the explanation provided for the creation of the avengers team is espionage organization known as shield the leader or director of shield nick fury played by samuel l jackson brings the team together in hopes that they will be able to put aside their differences of working together and defend the earth from the incoming alien invasion the antagonist and leader of the alien invasion is loki the brother of thor who was exiled from his home and is now working with an alien race to invade earth and become its ruler the avengers had to somehow put their egos aside and work together for example iron man played by robert downey jr always works alone there is a brief conversation in the film where iron man states âi thought i didnâtmt qualify i was considered what was it volatile selfobsessed and that i donâtmt play well with othersâ the avengers 2320 it is well evident that in the first hour of the movie that the conflict was how the superheroes would be able to work together they rally behind the death of one of their comrades and finally set aside their differences as one might predict they destroy the alien fleet along with loki and save the earth from destruction while the plot seemed very interesting i thought that it was not strong enough to support the movie the audience should be compelled or moved by the climax twists and turns in the film while the action scenes were very entertaining focusing more on the characters would have made the movie a lot better for example christopher nolanâtms the dark knight rises another summer hit about the comic book character batman focuses on the world of batman and his surroundings giving the plot of the film not only a good side but a dark side nolan based the plot around the character of batman while the avengers at times moved away from characters and emphasized action a lot more while the action was mainly the talk of the movie and how the superheroes work together i think if the movie focused more on the team then we would be talking about the superheroes rather than the action nevertheless the avengers serves as a stepping stone for superhero movies the avengers did not disappoint in pure entertainment from the movie goerâtms point of view who wouldnâtmt love to see stuff blow up with your favorite superheroes itâtms like a comic book readerâtms fantasy if you havenâtmt seen the avengers you should due to its success the film has become the third highest grossing movie of all time and a hit with the new generation even though it may not be in your genre of movies you will still be entertained by the filmâtms explosive action scenes
Nov 1 2012,positive,recommended to at least rent it and check this hero movie out but for super hero fans like me its an easy choice to pick up the blu ray
Oct 31 2012,positive,great absolutely great

Oct 31 2012,positive,thoroughly entertaining excellent special effects and a great storyline that really helps in the continual development of the characters
Oct 31 2012,positive,i must have been the last person on earth to see this so it had a lot to live up to i wasnt disappointing though it was real comic book brilliance the hulk steels the show and captain america is still a bit of a ponce but the film as a whole was fast and fantastic
Oct 31 2012,positive,doesnt get much better than this film right here one of the few films to have a star studded cast actually live up to expectations awesome special effects and storyline is easy to follow
Oct 31 2012,positive,great movie but a bit too lomg
Oct 31 2012,positive,if avengers is not the best or richest superhero movie ever made that honor goes to dark knight spiderman 2 if you want the traditional comic style it may be the ultimate expression of the form credit to this is surely whedons who juggles seven lead characters and seven super screen presences through a clever script and one of the best destructions of manhattan ever huge and hugely entertaining
Oct 31 2012,positive,i friggin love this flick  ok so for the two of you that didnt see it yet i will not spoil itbut as comic bookgraphic novel fan this had a great story great visuals and it was just an overall fun film  not a well paced film or a film that has substance to stand as a oscar or hollywood caliber best film but for sure one of the best straight action films made  check it out if you hadnt already
Oct 31 2012,positive,definitely a jampacked superhero movie not highfalutin just simply awesome
Oct 31 2012,positive,for all its bluster and action i found this a rather dull affair  it had some flashes of subversive humour which should have been brought out a little more
Oct 31 2012,positive,geekdream come true only a true native of the marvel universe could have made this movie with no wish list fanmoment wink wink left unsatiated whedonassembled
Oct 30 2012,negative,legitimately the worst movie i have seen this year there are no plot and no characters and whats left is the action scenes are they fun at least the answer is no im clearly in the minority here but i really hated this movie
Oct 30 2012,positive,awesome movie best hero flick by far
Oct 30 2012,positive,you figure with all these characters mixed into one flick it would be a disaster but they all tied in fantastically well
Oct 30 2012,positive,this movie will definetly give marvel fans huge boners the rest of the audience though most likely wont think much more about it than a fun superhero beating
Oct 30 2012,neutral,would have been much better without all the cgi work
Oct 30 2012,positive,excellent movie one of the most shamelessly enjoyable movies of the decade
Oct 30 2012,positive,youve already seen iteveryone has
Oct 30 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever  all characters are fully developed and its actionpacked suspenseful and fun  only thing  unclear how hulk can all of a sudden control the green monster at the end
Oct 30 2012,positive,great action sequences and some surprising laugh out loud moments keep the avengers from being totally generic  but not enough of a plot for those who havent followed all the previous films very closely to latch onto
Oct 30 2012,negative,the avengers although an uppertier marvel film is nothing more than a feast of dry wit and egotistical characters
Oct 30 2012,positive,really good movie had me laughing several times
Oct 30 2012,positive,best movie in the world i was worried that all of the characters would clash but they dont  they all stay true to who they are
Oct 29 2012,positive,loved this movie and would definatly add to the collection
Oct 29 2012,positive,unfortunately all the hype and great reviews for this film slightly raised my expectations but still overall a great collab of the classic marvel avengers
Oct 29 2012,positive,best superhero movie so far bring us more
Oct 29 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ever i actually watch it once a day during the summer
Oct 29 2012,positive,such a great movie mark ruffalo did an amazing job playing hulk a very well done movie you wont be disappointed especially if you are a fan of the avengers comics well done joss whedon didnt expect anything less
Oct 29 2012,positive,a triumph ive never seen anything like it before marvel sets the bar extremely high on a super grand scale
Oct 29 2012,positive,epic joss wheadon never ceases to impress
Oct 29 2012,positive,one of my favorite crossover films and one of my favorite films of all time
Oct 29 2012,positive,the avengers is a grand superhero movie which excels due to its engaging effects and director joss whedons powerful script
Oct 29 2012,positive,alright if youve nothing better to do in an evening
Oct 29 2012,positive,bam kapow bonk â as they say in comic books while thats not really what the superheroes of the avengers have to say they are much more articulate their actions are fairly true to their comic book roots kids first youth film critics julianna noone age 12 and talia rashba age 11 each give the film a full 5 out of 5 stars and are quite articulate themselves on their reasons for the top rating  this actionpacked and comedyfilled film is a movie that not only will appeal to comic book fans but all moviegoers as it has a great storyline and a strong cast to support it says julianna and talia is equally enthusiastic this movie was absolutely fantastic it is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad  the avengers reviewed by talia rashba age 11 video review here   this movie was absolutely fantastic it is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad   the story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil loki who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world the superheroes include iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye each one has a unique and special supernatural power that they use to help them do their job at first the superheroes fight about being a team but eventually they work together to complete the mission   the avengers could have ended up being a typical superhero movie but it isnt because there are so many heroes it is much more creative and entertaining the avengers is packed with fabulous actors robert downey jr plays tony stark also known as iron man just like he was in the iron man movie he thinks he is better than everyone else but luckily he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot captain america chris evans is strong and serious and he is always ready to get the job done actor mark ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the incredible hulk he really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in superhero thor chris hemsworth has some of the most incredible battle scenes and black widow portrayed by the beautiful scarlett johansson is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other   an interesting fact is that actor lou ferrigno who has played the hulk in almost every film since 1978 is actually the hulks voice in the movie   the avengers is written and directed by joss whedon who does an amazing job he makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention the special effects were incredible the superheroes change from their everyday selves into their supernatural selves in an interesting and fun way the fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable also there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself   even though it is rated pg13 i think kids ages 11 as well as all adults will love this movie especially if action is their thing i am giving this film a 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away   the avengers reviewed by julianna noone  video review here   looking for a hero well look no further because the avengers is in theaters everywhere this actionpacked and comedyfilled film is a movie that not only will appeal to comic book fans but all moviegoers as it has a great storyline and a strong cast to support it this movie will attract all demographics and has already set many box office records   the basis of this movie is the world is under threat from another world chitauri and there is a need for more than just all the worldâtms defenses to save it the world needs the âavenger initiativeâ which is a plan put together by shield an international peacekeeping agency which calls for shield to bring together some of the worldâtms greatest heroes iron mantony stark played by robert downey jr thor played by chris hemsworth captain americasteve rogers played by chris evans the hulkdr bruce banner played by mark ruffalo black widownatasha romanoff  played by scarlett johansson and hawkeyeclint barton played by jeremy renner nick fury played by the always intense samuel l jackson leads the shield agency there is a great supporting cast as well that rounds out a starstudded cast   now i have watched all of the individual movie releases of the hulk both movies thor captain america and both iron man movies and loved them all but as most was concerned whether they would work together to create a great movie well they have done that and more with a storyline that allows the main characters to at times shine on their own but at other times pairs them up perfectly to bring great balance to the story    josh whedon the director and cowriter and zach penn cowriter do a great job in blending the action sequences in with very welltimed comedic moments i also love how they bring so many different levels of conflict into the movie there is brother vs brother between thor and his evil brother loki played brilliantly by tom hiddleston the films antagonist there is internal conflict each of the main characters has with themselves as we watch dr banner trying to control his inner demons and there is the overall conflict of our world vs the other world called chitauri   there is also the conflict between the heroes themselves which leads to many of the funniest parts of the film two of my favorite scenes are these parts of the movie first when the heroes first come together on the shield aircraft they are discussing the devastation that loki has brought to earth thor jumps to lokis defense and states âheâtms my brotherâ to which the black widow responds âhe has killed 80 people in two daysâ thor responds âheâtms adoptedâ and itâtms one of the many laughoutloud moments   my favorite characters would be the avengers as a whole as they each have their own unique and likable traits i love the special effects particularly the touch screen computers that float in the air and the use of cgi in this film as it was worked into the liveaction sequences the cgi hulk was especially well done and was much more humanlike in this film and funny as well   this movie is great for all ages and i rate it 5 out of 5 stars itâtms a mustsee movie for comic book and noncomic book fans and i think many will see it more than once as i know i plan to
Oct 29 2012,positive,great acting paired with excellent special effects what more could one ask for
Oct 29 2012,positive,whedon comes through again with interesting character interpretation and use  he ties the story together and slams the whole thing into an action roller coaster thankfully he also redeems the appearance of the hulk in movies twice maligned in his two previous appearances on screen  mark ruffalo did a great job playing banner as well  as a publication the avengers has a very long history and dedicated fan base  you can please them all but the vast majority should feel pretty good about dropping ticket money on this movie  definitely worth seeing
Oct 29 2012,positive,its just like a christmas feast
Oct 29 2012,positive,big budget excellent effects good vs evil quite entertaining great scenes in new york
Oct 29 2012,positive,fight scenes in this film were magnificent to see how far technology has gone in the past decade a group of avengers a team who fight for their citizens battle against loki tom hiddleston turns against everyone on earth to make it his own
Oct 29 2012,positive,love it own it in 3d 
Oct 28 2012,positive,whats not to like this movie was awesome action packed
Oct 28 2012,positive,this is extremely overrated the dialogue is top notch but the story and conflict leave a lot to be desired theres way too much exposition and the whole thing just kind of pales in comparison to even the potential of a justice league movie but the last third of the movie sure was colorful and explosive so that was kind of purty
Oct 28 2012,positive,this is the only movie i have gone back to see in the movie theaters consecutively it would be far too long to explain why this movie is in fact so very awesome  but i can say it was worth every nickle i spent  
Oct 28 2012,positive,wow dont get why this was so popular absolutely terrible until the end hulk and the big finale is the only reason it gets the 3rd star
Oct 28 2012,positive,loved it it was just a great movie
Oct 28 2012,positive,anything joss whedon touches is gold this film is no exception boasting a powerhouse cast of superheroes a fastpaced comicbook style story and some truely awe inspiring action sequences marvels the avengers delivers on all the hype it built for itself
Oct 28 2012,positive,love this movie hawkeyes my favorite
Oct 28 2012,positive,it was amazing movie
Oct 28 2012,positive,one of the best films out there its incredibly epic and makes it any other superhero movie look far less impressive
Oct 28 2012,positive,top film will watch lots
Oct 28 2012,positive,holy hell did this movie live up to the hype
Oct 28 2012,positive,great great movie i couldâtmve watched it again and again at the theater the action is so much fun and the special effects are really good and who doesnâtmt like thor or iron man 
Oct 28 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this film and yes a large part of this is due to a hawkeyes arms b captain americas butt and c thor in general but aside from drooling over unattainable fantasy superhero men i also enjoyed the film for its sensible and uncomplicated save the world plot its large cast of interesting characters and its moments of genuine comedy just great fun
Oct 28 2012,positive,although i did not see many of the movies leading up to the avengers it was easy to follow and fun there was a great cast and it was humorous and fun to watch
Oct 28 2012,positive,great but disappointing hulk made the movie
Oct 28 2012,positive,action packed
Oct 28 2012,positive,this is a movie with great character development awesome fight scenes and great visual effects
Oct 28 2012,positive,i happen to love joss whedon movies i love that they kept the same actors as the individual movies
Oct 28 2012,positive,great fun movie thankfully robert downey jr doesnt overtake all the scenes as the rest of the cast manage to hold their ends up well the hulk sequences are great fun it may be a touch long but its not an arsenumbing borefest by a long chalk
Oct 28 2012,positive,best movie of the summer
Oct 28 2012,positive,they assembled flawlessly
Oct 28 2012,positive,this needs 20 more rating stars
Oct 28 2012,positive,hot guys thor or tony hmmm yum hot action
Oct 28 2012,positive,spectacular movie  unlike any superhero movie i have ever saw
Oct 27 2012,positive,yeah the hulk scenes are cool but loki is not a villian worth the films time and it creaks along for too long before any fun happens the first 45 minutes is a recap basically of how the characters are for the one note they will carry for the rest of the film
Oct 27 2012,positive,hilarious and awesome
Oct 27 2012,positive,totally awesome saw it several times in theatre love it
Oct 27 2012,positive,good marvel movie but vastly overrated predictable ending with not enough thrills to last the duration of the film
Oct 27 2012,positive,pleasant experience  coherent story which is no guaranty in a comic book based movie  fabulous special effect which is a guarantee in a comic book based movie  definitely worth seeing
Oct 27 2012,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time
Oct 27 2012,positive,great movie was exilarating the whole time
Oct 27 2012,positive,i am not a huge fan of the marvel movies but the avengers was awesome  action packed  loved it
Oct 27 2012,positive,although a very classic action movie in its directing and plot the avengers has a badass side thanks to the costumes and visual effects that will get you stuck on screen
Oct 27 2012,positive,best film of the year easily
Oct 27 2012,positive,legendary superheroes at their best
Oct 27 2012,positive,okglad i watched some of the previous ones and it was worth a watch
Oct 27 2012,positive,so much fun  great action scenes and special effects but more importantly great oneliners that undercut these scenes  great job of not taking this kind of movie too seriously
Oct 27 2012,positive,a lot of superhero action within 25 hours time frame seems a bit forced but it is adequately entertaining
Oct 27 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
Oct 27 2012,positive,that movie was amazing everything was spot on action humor drama even thor hulk and captain america were funny at times they were also very serious unlike iron man every character was exciting and interesting they all deserve a separate movie we are missing two hulk was not disappointing at all even with another actor  the actors did a wonderful job and every single member of the whole team behind the movie is a hero to me the special effects the sound effects costumes and design make up script editing filming all baffling
Oct 27 2012,positive,action movies do not come any better than this incredible  even after everyone hyping it up for me it still did not disappoint  i would have to say that anyone giving this a poor review is stupid and just trying their best to be different  do not listen to these miserable numpties  joss whedon masterfully brings together some already fantastic characters there was always the worry that they may loose their edge that they had from their own individual movies but they all work so well together and all play their part  even captain america who was probably the weaker of the single movies ups his game and plays a very important leadership role  as always stark brings the best entertainment value but the big surprise is just how the hulk steels the show  this movie has a big heart the humour combined with jaw dropping action and alan silvestris thumpingly dramatic score makes for pure entertainment it may not be oscar worthy but it could and should go down as one of the best action movies of all time  the last time i felt this way after a movie was probably when i first saw jurassic park i was buzzing like a kid the night before christmas  bring on the sequel quick
Oct 27 2012,positive,purely awesome ride from start to finish visually stunning and the story is really engaging cool characters and excellent character development as usual by joss whedon
Oct 27 2012,positive,while i dont enjoy super hero movies like i used to joss whedon writes a good script and knows the genre
Oct 27 2012,negative,immensely overrated and overhyped i doubt the dialogues would even exist without samuel l jackson and robert downey jr a huge let down for die hard comic fans
Oct 27 2012,positive,it was well packaged its not easy to put all these superhero in one movie altogether as a main role well done
Oct 27 2012,negative,aweful  if this is truly 96 i shudder to think what the future of cinema holds  lame humourless predictable  no sense of peril  no characters  nuff said
Oct 27 2012,positive,entertaining value 90 the movie is very pleasant and teasingly inflicts some character and dialogue that is not unfitting the atmosphere of the avengers though is sometimes mechanic where it should be heroic
Oct 27 2012,positive,the coming of together of marvels best except for spiderman absolutely loved it
Oct 27 2012,positive,great action fun to watch
Oct 26 2012,positive,the best adrenaline rush that i have ever had while watching a movie
Oct 26 2012,positive,its like when you were little and youre playing with action figures they are all over the place causing so much damage joss whedon is that kid and the actors are the toys this is a phenomenal action film that is just so much fun to watch it really makes you feel like a little kid again augh its just so awesome words cant even describe
Oct 26 2012,positive,best marvel movie yet
Oct 26 2012,positive,this movie is great to watch as a super hero fan but watching in on bluray makes it seem like home movie
Oct 26 2012,positive,what is all the fuss about the avengers is pretty good but nuthing really special
Oct 26 2012,positive,what is the avengers a sequel a spinoff its own franchise does it really matter marvel is going into unchartered territories with this behemoth and the world is following  hiring joss whedon was the smartest direction to go with in terms of script he gets characters and is great at writingmaintaining the right balance between humor adventure and dialogue he isnt the strongest visual director but he knows when to pull the hulk punches and make the audience cheer and thats exactly what the avengers is a film all about spectacle and the fun of the movies
Oct 26 2012,positive,i loved this movie especially iron man and captian america
Oct 26 2012,positive,the avengers sets the bar for future superhero movies  it successfully blends iron man thor hulk captain america and more  not to mention joss whedon is rather skilled at bringing the whole thing together with a script that more speaks character drama than big exploding things
Oct 26 2012,positive,the perfect balance between comedy and super action
Oct 26 2012,positive,magnificent movie special effect over the top will buy it for the home
Oct 26 2012,negative,it was cliched and the storyline was thinner than air this is an overrated piece of junk
Oct 26 2012,positive,marvels pg friendly universe just works  flat out entertaining with great character interaction  a lack of a great villain keeps this away from being the perfect superhero flick
Oct 26 2012,positive,good family movie keeps your attention  my boys loved it for me it was ok not something is watch again but one i would buy on dvd for my kids
Oct 26 2012,positive,not wat i thought it would be
Oct 26 2012,positive,you can not not like this
Oct 25 2012,positive,one of the best comic book films yet super fun and often hilarious a rollicking good time
Oct 25 2012,positive,the standard of marvel movies has been set good job joss
Oct 25 2012,positive,wow what a long wait and it didnt dissapoint
Oct 25 2012,positive,good but may improve
Oct 25 2012,positive,hilarious intense heartful entertaining and never boring the avengers is everything a suphero movie should be and it marks for the best superhero and action movie ever known to man
Oct 25 2012,positive,how can captain america find fault in this pitch perfect film the hulk was great in this one the story was excellent and the pacing was super
Oct 25 2012,positive,really enjoy that movie great story super cast and lot of action a must to see
Oct 25 2012,positive,i wouldve given this movie a full 5 stars but there wasnt a great variety of camera angles that im used to seeing in a super hero movie it wouldve been better if the friendly neighborhood spiderman wouldve made an appearance in this movie to give it something more special overall this is a great movie and a feat for joss whedon
Oct 25 2012,positive,best movie out at the time fo sho
Oct 25 2012,positive,enjoyed this film and it really helped to have gotten familiar with the characters from thier own films first which added more depth to the film nice
Oct 25 2012,positive,amazayn movie hilarious especially when hulk punches that evil person hah
Oct 25 2012,positive,just amazing to think wb just announced they are releasing justice league against this movies sequel
Oct 25 2012,positive,awesome film bought it on bluray special edition a musthave for geeks like me
Oct 25 2012,positive,the wait for this movie was definitely worth it was speechless after watching it joss whedon portrayed this comic book adaptation perfectely the sound and visual effects were amazing not to mention a great storyline that doesnt insult your intelligencea must see for any comic book fan or just anyone a fan of this genre you wont be disappointed
Oct 24 2012,positive,my grade  a 92marvel studios presents marvels the avengersthe super hero team up of a lifetime featuring iconic marvel super heroes iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow when an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security nick fury director of the international peacekeeping agency known as shield finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster spanning the globe a daring recruitment effort begins
Oct 24 2012,positive,dont really like the hulk but he was awesome
Oct 24 2012,positive,never to old for comic loved all the charters  a must have
Oct 24 2012,positive,very enjoyable it does help to have seen the related movies to understand the background of the characters so not entirely a standalone some slow bits but overall funny and worth watching
Oct 24 2012,positive,loved this if i had my hands on it and i could editchange anything about it i wouldnt ill not say perfect because i do not think a perfect movie exists but this is a great effort at a comic based action movie far more fun and friendly than the nolan batman franchise joss whedon will be sought after a lot after this
Oct 24 2012,positive,marvels fans should be craving to get their hands on this humorous action scifi movie its very well structured plot makes the viewer feel like their in the movie
Oct 24 2012,negative,if you are a kid or comic geek then this is for you movie for most part pretty stupid
Oct 24 2012,positive,my son took me to see this movie he explained the back story which helped me enjoy the story it was really fun seeing it on a huge screen i didnt fall asleep nailbiting intense
Oct 24 2012,positive,if you like the comic book heroes then you will love this
Oct 24 2012,positive,best superhero movie out of iron man captain america thor hulk
Oct 24 2012,positive,film was great saw it twice the hulk was my fav
Oct 24 2012,positive,loved this movie a great movie and i especially liked to see all the superheros working together to save nyc i wish they were around for sandy
Oct 24 2012,positive,uh what should i say maybe nothing not what i thought weaker than any of the constituents proof being its ironman centredness just to save appearances not a complete failure with hulks remastering a good idea but pulling hairs with an annoying loki unfortunately with captain yankee doodle not my favourite i might never bother pulling it out of rack again maybe my kids forcing me maybe
Oct 24 2012,positive,joss whedon has found his super hero stride  well done blend of comedy and super hero action  ready for round 2
Oct 24 2012,positive,an excuse just to get a bunch of superhereos together in a shambles of bang bangs and take that what really fails here is the flimsy storyline and irony that the reunion of all the superheros is far from it
Oct 24 2012,positive,very entertaining  better than all of the previous films that lead up to this one  i always had something bother me in each film  iron mans were too anticlimatic  hulks was boring  captain americans was unconnected and seemed like a b movie  thor was the best of each characters but it still had a lot of flaws  avenger was funny and i never was bored  i connected to the characters and wasnt disappointed  not sure if i could watch it over and over since the non action scenes  weigh too heavily on punch lines and comedy but the first time was awesome
Oct 24 2012,positive,big shiny and amusing shame about the quickly glossed over offpanel moments and constant feeling of it being a setup film i miss ed norton johansson and smulders surprisingly weak roles from what i expected and the overly cartoony tone stop me from giving another half star
Oct 23 2012,positive,hulk amazing what a wonderful movie complete taste of actions and explosions and captain america still the most handsome superhero and the sexy black widow thor was soo cute here and the annoying attitude of iron man hawkeye was pretty cool too a perfect movie for superhero avid fans
Oct 23 2012,positive,best movie i watched in 2012
Oct 23 2012,positive,74 as time passes this becomes less and less memorable and the sequel is an improvement it has some eye candy but the story and the action scenes are copied from transformers 3 the villain loki is bad and the film ruins the character of any depth that kenneth branagh so effectively created in thor however mark ruffalo fives it his best
Oct 23 2012,positive,best marvel movie hands down
Oct 23 2012,positive,the avengers shows glimpses of brilliant character development and a few good plot elements the action scenes are awesome and something to watch over and over again but the other hour and a half all leading up to the big fight in nyc is just kind of there cause there has to be some plot around the action scenes in the end a great popcorn flick with a huge payoff from the 5 medicore films that lead up to this except iron man of course to many things that when given a second thought just really seems like there forcing alot of the things that happen in the end if avengers 2 is going to play out with how a think it will that will be the 5 star movie of the marvel cinematic universe but i just cant give this action movie that 5 stars i for sure thought it would get
Oct 23 2012,positive,much more hype than actually enjoyable content but nonetheless a fun film
Oct 23 2012,positive,great movie extremely entertaining
Oct 23 2012,positive,mildly entertaining with a few really funny moments but for me the whole thing unravels with yet another alien invasion force that proves less formidable than your average national guard detachment there is never a sense that the world or its superhero defenders are in any real danger hence a complete lack of emotional weight  in this regard avengers is light and largely lifeless blockbuster movie fare
Oct 23 2012,positive,this movie was a nonstop action thrill ride but not only that it actually had a very deep plot i can see why the critics loved it and why it made a killing at the box office
Oct 23 2012,positive,this flick is awesome
Oct 23 2012,positive,best movie in the whole comic genre
Oct 23 2012,positive,the avengers is a good movie i did see an exciting encounter but i saw it more as a story of thor and lucky
Oct 23 2012,positive,this is another nearly perfect movie by marvel the action sequences are so realistic that you can see it like a new superhero classic the performances of the great cast are excellent
Oct 23 2012,positive,it was alright but if you like a bunch of convoluted action with a slightly thought out storythis is your movie
Oct 23 2012,positive,all right if no one else is going to say it the casting of mark ruffalo for banner was a stroke of unparalleled genius in so agonizingly few scenes ruffalo brings a new deeply human side to the hulk we didnt see in the first two movies for once we see the apology the regret the anxiety and painful resolution of a man who has accepted this as his permanent fate but nonetheless tries in vain to be part of society anyone who has dealt with anger can finally relate to this mans interpretation of emotional instability which i feel is what the hulk is really about quite an accomplishment for someone not in the center of the movie i was dying to see more of him and hawkeye too as a side note which is what movies and actors are supposed to bring an aching need to see more bravo man
Oct 23 2012,positive,normally this isnt my type of movie but i really enjoyed this one id even watch it again
Oct 23 2012,positive,for the first hour nothing at all happens then its chaos i hate the new hulk story line tony stark was really the only one who could put up any fight and well if it wasnt for robert downey jr this movie would have gotten two stars
Oct 23 2012,positive,i really didnt think this movie would be as good as it was i expected an enjoyable superhero mashup but it amazed me how they were able to balance all of these strong characters and create one awesome blockbuster
Oct 23 2012,positive,this movie provides the most monumental summer movie that anyone could ask for but can be slow in a few parts
Oct 23 2012,positive,a geeks dream but was it too soon the characters of the avengers each have their own movie except for hawkeye the movies were shot out there like no tomorrow not that it was a bad thingi believe that the avengers was a fine film and it was packed with enough comedic puns and juicy action scenes a teenager would be more than excited to see it although the movie couldnt be more formulated the blue cube is all powerful and the bad guy wants it good guys have to stop him the budget was more invested towards the action rather than plot for those who disagree look at batman and now look at the upcoming superman dc seems to take there time with these fragile tales  i give this film 3 and a half stars
Oct 23 2012,positive,this has to be one of the greatest superhero movies ever im not lying i went to see this at the midnight release at my local theater and i loved every minute of it i admit it has flaws mainly hawkeye doesnt really do anything but all in all it was vastly enjoyable i loved the butting of heads between cap and tony stark mark ruffalo did an excellent job as bruce banner though my personal favorite will always be edward norton and chris was amazing as thor once again a must see and even a must own d
Oct 23 2012,positive,this film is undeniable fun great casting all the characters bring the humor and the action once the ball gets rolling it doesnt stop a very enjoyable film from beginning to end the film has a meta feel as most of whedons outings usually does and it definitely works
Oct 23 2012,positive,one of the best super hero film ive seen in my life
Oct 23 2012,positive,amazing best superhero movie yet
Oct 23 2012,positive,full of action humour a decent plot and excellent visuals this movie was fun but never takes itself too seriously i was pleasantly surprised by this film and expected it to be overly complicated or nothing but action and yet it holds things together pretty well despite covering the brief but well told backstories of all of its main characters
Oct 23 2012,positive,haters gonna hate this is how big summer blockbusters should be done theres enough fun going on and snappy dialogue and character realisation that the sfx work as an added greatness and dont drown the film michael bay beaten at his own game
Oct 23 2012,positive,best of movie of 2011 best cast setup great storyline just an amazing action packed marvel film teammarvel forever
Oct 23 2012,positive,this is definitely a must see film it has a way of introducing comedy even in the middle of the most suspenseful serious situations this is one of the best films ive seen in a long time
Oct 23 2012,positive,the action gets a bit repetitive the dialogue is trite and it lacks a strongcompelling villain sorry loki but its still pretty fun to watch if not overrated
Oct 22 2012,positive,great movie a must see
Oct 22 2012,neutral,it was ok  disappointing but ok
Oct 22 2012,positive,most epic comic book movie ever
Oct 22 2012,positive,the hulk was finally given the credit he deserved
Oct 22 2012,positive,best super hero movie ever
Oct 22 2012,positive,this movie is possibly one of the best superhero movies ive seen yet i loved it i live it i loved it
Oct 22 2012,positive,brilliant on any level waited a long time to see it after seeing hints for over 5 yearswas worth the wait
Oct 22 2012,positive,the script packs enough action humor and heart and everybody gets enough screentime  but lets face it in the end this is a pretty conventional superhero flick
Oct 22 2012,positive,wow my respect for the writers of this epic piece of entertainment they were able to pull off a movie with multiple main characters without one of them overshadowing the others even though robert downey jr tends to steal the show as well as the movie poster well done joss whedon
Oct 22 2012,positive,as a kid i loved the avengers and collected the comics  as an adult ive kind of shifted away from exploding action movies but the kid in me loved this film and with the small beef i take that hank pym was inexplicably taken out i think this was a great movie
Oct 22 2012,positive,it was good but confusing and that was only covered up by the jokes and action robert was hilarious as always but he never went serious except for one moment and that lasted for 5 minutes
Oct 22 2012,positive,the best and most entertaining superhero movie i have ever seen
Oct 22 2012,positive,the movie is a little over hyped  its not that awesome the script spends more time developing the characters more that the plot itself which is really annoying  the movie still has its high octane action that keeps it interesting despite having one of the worst and poorly madeout villains ive ever seem secret its loki still marvels the avengers is one of the most entertaining  movies youll watch  during summer 2012
Oct 22 2012,positive,the performances are topnotch across the board particularly from mark ruffalo who plays the hulk far more sympathetically than in the two previous films that starred eric bana and edward norton as the angry green fellow ruffalo nails the almost precarious relationship between dr banner and his alter ego and delivers plenty spontaneous laughs in the end the avengers isnt just an ultimate spectacle but also incredibly smart and surprisingly humorous
Oct 22 2012,positive,its a film full of supermans so theres no tension i dont know what it is with hollywood recently but ive seen about 15 films recently that use a zoomlense including this one well acted well written and entertaining it has its flaws and certainly doesnt deserve a 92
Oct 22 2012,positive,the avengers and dark knight were the best action movies this year thus far
Oct 22 2012,positive,what do you expect by grouping a lot of superheroes and giving them a chance to blow up some aliens an amazing movie
Oct 22 2012,positive,superb culmination to an extensive hollywood experiment by seamlessly bringing together individual film franchises this action feature succeeds as the comic books it was inspired by did almost fifty years earlier illuminating those same characters on the grandest scale imaginable
Oct 22 2012,positive,best marvel movie ever it was outstanding action packed funny great
Oct 21 2012,positive,awesome movie definitely will watch again
Oct 21 2012,positive,awesome movie  action packed throughout the entire movie
Oct 21 2012,positive,the best super hero movie ever made
Oct 21 2012,positive,awesome best movie ever so cool
Oct 21 2012,positive,love joss whedon and super heroes see firefly
Oct 21 2012,positive,the idea of bringing a combination of super heroes into one movie is an idea that i could never have thought of but the result was very satisfying the avengers was funny the combat was intense and had a lot of great moments its not the best story plot wise but  the action set it apart
Oct 21 2012,positive,fantastic one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen the hulk totally steals the show
Oct 21 2012,positive,this was an amazing movie fantastic fantastic acting writing directing everything
Oct 21 2012,positive,its hard to describe this as anything other than fun excellent character balance acting thats anywhere from good to excellent and exhilarating special effects definitely worth seeing though its nothing revolutionary
Oct 21 2012,positive,awww hell yeah  joss whedon proves his worth i was a huge fan of buffy the vampire slayer and angel and to see him get to direct this high budget movie was great  whedon has always been good at juggling multiple characters so i was not worried about this movie watch it
Oct 21 2012,positive,awesome love this movie
Oct 21 2012,positive,while the avengers stands strong on its own prior knowledge of the marvel film universe makes this an adventure like any other whedon juggles a cast full of strong characters with the greatest of ease and adds in his trademark touches to create an adventure full of heart the film captures the essence of the comics while creating its own space
Oct 21 2012,positive,full of action good movie
Oct 21 2012,positive,my 4yr old son and i love it
Oct 21 2012,positive,the avengers is a hell of a ride all the way through very few things hold this powerhouse of a movie back one thing was  the hulk as a fan of the avengers for a long time i know that the hulk is in fact not an avenger but a neutral faction they fight with him and the reason he cant be an avenger is because hes uncontrollable thats what makes him awesome another thing is the portrayal of thor as a demigod in his own movie he was a god but he cant be one in the avengers because of political reasons overall the avengers is a thrill all the way through with an appeal for everyone
Oct 21 2012,positive,it was a great movie
Oct 21 2012,positive,the villain felt really flat and boringother than that this movie was good
Oct 21 2012,positive,you already saw it everybody saw it the avengers was as good as it could have been so good that nobody even noticed all the glaring mistakes that occurred the entire movie
Oct 21 2012,positive,this was more enjoyable than i thought i am not a fan of superhero collaborations but this movie balances some of the bestknown marvel super heroes    samuel jackson plays nick fury the director of shield an international peacekeeping agency featuring several marvel heroes like iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow they all need to work together to stop loki yes thors adopted brother from destroying the earth of course they eventually do just that and they look good doing it    somehow the script works some of the heroes complement each other in several scenes it just works well together i was waiting for a well batman could have done it alonemoment but didnt experience any while watching in hindsight maybe batman could have well ill leave that for another time    i felt entertained for 140 minutes
Oct 21 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Oct 21 2012,positive,a movie me and my kids enjoyed
Oct 21 2012,positive,everything a good superhero film should be
Oct 21 2012,positive,this movie rocks very good job
Oct 21 2012,negative,boy am i in trouble because i hated it  i think my problem is that i havent seen thor because i found tom hiddleston so ludicrously miscast as loki that i could no longer maintain suspension of disbelief  first this deity who arrives in an awesome burst of netherworld energy has to escape sitting awkwardly in the back of a pickup truck for gods sake but then when he stands up in his silly horned costume and tells a crowd of people to kneel to him his complete lack of gravitas in the role just set me laughing  i couldnt watch it after that
Oct 21 2012,positive,a well executed three act super hero popcorn muncher that balances characters action and story that practically anyone can enjoy but offers little depth and meaning
Oct 20 2012,positive,wasnt really into seeing it but it turned out to be very good with some very talented actors
Oct 20 2012,positive,2012 a great movie but hulk should of had more of the actions best quote in the movie hulk smash
Oct 20 2012,positive,a super hero movie thats done right with the drama action and humor avengers ranks up as one of the best
Oct 20 2012,positive,seriously 10x better than i couldve ever imagined
Oct 20 2012,positive,was a great movieit had just the right type of elements for everyonei like most how each heros attitude was differentits a type of movie i think any person would love
Oct 20 2012,positive,one of the best hero shows of our time love the humor
Oct 20 2012,positive,ive been underwhelmed by a lot of these superhero movies lately but this one was near the top of the genre
Oct 20 2012,positive,fantastic movie worth the wait to see all of them together
Oct 20 2012,positive,top notch entertainment but xmen 2 is still the winner in this genre for me
Oct 20 2012,negative,only watch this movie if you read all the marvel comic books because you will be confused
Oct 20 2012,positive,in my view its the biggest movie ever made nothing like has ever been done before and the movie wasnt too bad its a shame that too many kids watch it
Oct 20 2012,positive,best super hero movie ever
Oct 20 2012,positive,the best damn thing you will ever watch
Oct 20 2012,positive,this movie was fantastic it instantly is one of my favorite comic book movies as well as one of my favorite action movies i think jeremy renner is a bit overrated and one dimensional as an actor as is scarlett johansson but the rest of the actors play their parts beautifully huge props to downey jr whos tony starkironman is iconic and a surprising result from mark ruffalo as hulk the acting was terrific the story was acceptable the pacing was well done the dialogue fantastic bordering on perfect just loved this movie i cant give it 5 stars because i havent watched it again well see how it stands up but i sat in my seat demanding to be entertained and i found myself laughing cheering and having a fantastic time at the movies because of this film so thats pretty much as good as it gets for me
Oct 20 2012,positive,great for comic book fans
Oct 20 2012,positive,i thought the action was good the acting was decent and the overall movie received 4 12 stars
Oct 20 2012,positive,kind of a little bit too much  action movie with old ideas invasion from another planet group of freaks saving the earth all characters are well known none of them is really controversial the main evil counterpart is a god which seems to have some untold mother complex who isnt the best evil character at all seems only to be an preparation for a new chapter  watched it three times all in all nice action best seen after the other marvel comic adaptions
Oct 20 2012,positive,whats not to like love the trending comic hero movies
Oct 20 2012,negative,continuum of ongoing hollywood trend of churning out a new marvel superhero film yearly the avengers is either a great or a very bad thing depending on whether superhero films appeal to you   after having depicted most of the marvel superheroes in their own tittle films the natural next step is to gather the most famous superheroes under single tittle and predictably the avengers turns out to be like a huge melting pot combining all known block buster elements into one single mega action film   story wise the avengers is simple and unimaginative as i have come to expect from marvel films a team of superheroes are gathered together to defend earth from the norse mythology character loki and his army of alien henchmen seriously there is not much else to it and the viewer is up for 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of sense bombardment and brainless entertainment    even if the avengers did not manage to impress me much it must be given that the film is quite stunning visually never before have i seen so fluent and well made special effects and its integration with live actors but other than great visuals the avengers did have much to offer and managed to keep me interested only barely through the running time
Oct 19 2012,positive,a dream come true for loyal marvel fans few things are better than a 3d screening of a film that has audience member erupting like fans at a football game the hulk stole the show and its safe to say this is in the top 3 most epic movies ever made an instant classic
Oct 19 2012,positive,this movie blows me away wow
Oct 19 2012,positive,i hope this lives up to the trailers all of the heroes movies have not been great
Oct 19 2012,positive,me and the kiddo laughed the whole way through
Oct 19 2012,positive,excellent movie i love marvel if you havent seen it yet you need to
Oct 19 2012,positive,great movie like always i wished i could have more characters
Oct 19 2012,negative,boring and not believable
Oct 19 2012,positive,this is probably the best comic book movie out there by comic book movie i mean it does the best making you feel like you are inside a comic book while christopher nolans dark knight trilogy may be better films they are taking the characters from the comic and placing them in the real world joss whedons avengers takes the audience and places them in the comic book world
Oct 19 2012,positive,possibly the best movie theater experience that ive had in a long time good film for the whole family and has left me anticipating all the upcoming films in the marvel universe
Oct 19 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever made a
Oct 19 2012,positive,enjoyable a good bit of fun parts were just a bit too cheesy to bear but some good humour adored robert downey jr and mark ruffalo just wished it delved a bit deeper not easy when hollywood try and market it for children though 
Oct 19 2012,positive,words can not describe how good this movie is just go and watch it right now if you havent already seen it
Oct 19 2012,positive,awesome is the one word in my head while watching this film
Oct 19 2012,positive,i had a ball watching this multihunked cast   very rarely can downey do any wrong in my book and he excelled here  i even like ruffalo better as the hulk this time around  not much else to say but its a perfect weekend film to enjoy with your popcorn   this film should be watched big and loud
Oct 19 2012,positive,its not often that after im done watching a movie i want to start it over only con for the whole movie was that the hulk was really annoying for the first half of the movie but overall it was an all star performance by all star actors in all star roles
Oct 19 2012,positive,i watched this in 3d there was more action and 3d effects that it was a total sensory overload
Oct 19 2012,positive,everything i hoped it would be
Oct 19 2012,neutral,pretty run of the mill in its genre with a terrific cglast 40 minutes or so
Oct 19 2012,positive,best super hero team up movie ever
Oct 19 2012,positive,crash bang wallop  possibly would have been better in 3d  please flixster stop posting this shit to my facebook
Oct 19 2012,positive,loved the movie cant wait for the next
Oct 18 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen literally
Oct 18 2012,negative,fell asleep boringâ
Oct 18 2012,positive,see it own it live it humorous in just all the right places with enough action to make it entertaining for me it was just hulktastic

Oct 18 2012,neutral,not bad but greatest superhero movie evernot even closesorry downey but you will never b the actor ledger was
Oct 18 2012,positive,joss whedon did the highly anticipated series the justice it deserved it is a lot of fun there are mistakes but it is so fun that you can overlook those mistakes and just enjoy the movie loki kinda annoyed me he was a good villain but he is just so childish and not scary well he looks exremelllllllly creepy in the first scene hes in but after that he is kinda just like an annoying brat i am excited for thanos next time and hope that maybe the red skull could come back into one of the stories or avengers two because hugo weaving was awesome as red skull the movie isnt the best movie of the year but it is one of the funnest

Oct 17 2012,positive,totally love this movie  great action
Oct 17 2012,positive,great superhero movie one of the best marvel films yet
Oct 17 2012,negative,im really surprised to see this many people really liked it  i thought it was meh  the plot was impossibly weird the heroes fought amongst themselves far too much and the deus ex machina ending was contrived  who the bleep would nuke new york while heroes are still fighting to contain the threat and they dont know if that would stop the tesseract anyway  i actually found myself laughing out loud when they started to talk in hollywood science jargonnonsense  i was expecting good but was sorely disappointed
Oct 17 2012,positive,great movie it kept my attention the whole time and i never got bored 2 thumbs up

Oct 17 2012,positive,the hulk is the only one with any damn sense
Oct 17 2012,positive,this movie was the underdog i thought that it would be too much but it was just right amazing movie really really funny you dont have to watch all the movies to understand everything and anybody who likes action or superheroes would love this movie
Oct 17 2012,positive,this movie is the pinnacle of movies for the year sorry but batman did not beat this this was too well written acted and carried out its a must see
Oct 17 2012,positive,it was cute it was clever it could have been better then again its a chore bringing the avengers to screen dull plotline silly oneliners poor integration of each characters individual story
Oct 17 2012,positive,awesome movie best marvel yet
Oct 17 2012,positive,just an entertaining movie nothing more nothing less iron man robert owns the whole freaking movie while hulk gets to shine at the end rest of the casemeh didnt really care about them its all visuals and not really a substancedriven fare and yes scarlett was bloody hot thats all
Oct 17 2012,positive,getting old can only enjoy the back story half of these epics and then about 13 of the giant confusing cgi battle scenethen i get bored its good if youre like me if you live for giant confusing cgi battle scene its great
Oct 17 2012,positive,a good movie the smaller actions scenes worked better then the samller ones like the one between thor and stark great humour like always especially from stark a few shots that shoot at angles and didnt need to be also a couple scenes in the city the cinematography was off killing off coulson wasnt necessary cant wait for the next set of individual movies
Oct 17 2012,positive,huge amount of fun better watched after the previous marvel films which have all been a lot of fun too finally the hulk finds a home in movie land the way he deals with loki is genius 0
Oct 17 2012,positive,i totally love the hulk smash
Oct 17 2012,positive,it had to be a tough movie to make but it ended up an amazing movie to watch i have no idea of how whedon juggled all those main characters but what can i say he nailed it the main story is little more than an excuse to showcase the avengers but can we really complain about that the action is clever and well shot the characters work well together and the whole movie is a long fun ride
Oct 16 2012,positive,what a fantastic film period
Oct 16 2012,positive,with a tight well structured script that features excellent dialogue and doesnt undermine its wellfleshedout characters as well as some great performances enthralling action sequences and some excellently timing and execution courtesy of joss whedon this movie is a perfect example of a good comictoscreen adaptation
Oct 16 2012,positive,joss whedon knows how to make something that is so outrageous and subjectively comical into a grand piece  though at times its fan service and lack of gravity stop this film from being truly exceptional it is nevertheless the epitome of hardsuperhero movies
Oct 16 2012,positive,not as intelligent and self aware as the iron man films the avengers suffers from a by the numbers formula that said its an entertaining popcorn movie
Oct 16 2012,positive,everything you love about the other marvel films but bigger and better 
Oct 16 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
Oct 16 2012,positive,comic book movies dont get much better than this

Oct 15 2012,positive,awesome movie very well made  graphics storyline and music was wonderful  kept me going the entire time i didnt feel bored but couldnt wait to see what happened next im looking forward to the next movie 
Oct 15 2012,positive,for me was ok but didnt really see what all the fuss was about
Oct 15 2012,positive,the true hero of the avengers joss whedon there was no better person for the job
Oct 15 2012,positive,when i heard this movie was going to be made i thought it would be terrible  then they made iron man and thor and hired joss whedon  this movie was entertaining and while a bit silly and predictable at points is about the best it could possibly be expected to be
Oct 15 2012,positive,absolutely amazing  one of the best live action comic book movies of all time hands down
Oct 15 2012,positive,it was a good movie but its not as amazing as its hyped up to be
Oct 15 2012,positive,could have been longer and better
Oct 15 2012,positive,a movie that has action and adventure and great for marvel fans 
Oct 15 2012,positive,marvelâtms the avengers is a two and a half hour thrill ride that will entertain whether youâtmre  young or old a fanboy or casual viewer  from start to finish the action only stops temporarily and the  thrills will stick with you for years to come one would think that an eyecandy filled superhero film would be lacking plot and character development but i found that not to be the case here  the phenom writerdirector joss whedon has found a way to balance story and action so that they do not conflict with each other  of course it helped that two thirds of the main characters have had their own character developing feature films recently  there are critics who have taken jabs at the lack of character development in this film which i find to be without merit for many reasons  first of all as said before the main characters have already been developed in their own individual movies which frees whedon up to spend more time elsewhere  so in place of character development he develops the relationships between these characters  in this he excels masterfully spoiler alert  from this point on readers will be subjected to blatant spoilers  beware the villain in the avengers is loki  he is thorâtms demigod brother and villain of the movie which bears his brotherâtms name  a quick look at loki will tell the observer that he does not compare physically to the heroes  in fact the villain is more of a side note as far as the conflict in this movie goes for the avengers conflict is found within themselves more so than from loki  when looking at the team of heroes as individuals it is easy to see where the conflict will emerge  of the six avengers one is a king and a god of norse myth  one was a captain in the us army during world war 2 and possesses superhuman strength  one the most arrogant of the group is a selfproclaimed billionaire playboy philanthropist superhero  of the remaining three avengers one the hulk avoids conflict at all costs and the other two are card carrying members of shield the founding organization of the avengers and view the others as newcomers  with three chiefs and only three indians the avengers find working together to be difficult at first  iron man robert downey jr is a born leader who prefers to work alone in most cases barking orders and holding all the reigns  to work with him is to submit to his arrogance and dominance  something captain america finds especially hard to swallow  thor while willing to work together with the others barely accepts them as equals   the relationship between captain america chris evans and iron man is of particular interest as it encapsulates the difference between following authority blindly and questioning authority constantly  at first the two argue about attacking a problem head on or waiting to develop a plan  later they argue about accepting authority blindly  and then their differences spill over to iron manâtms inability to sacrifice for others  âyou donâtmt know what itâtms like to lay down on a wire to let the next man crossâ accuses cap  âi think iâtmd just cut the wireâ retorts iron man  this interaction totally captures the underlying differences in style of leadership between the two men among the notsosuper heroes black widow scarlett johansen uses less physical prowess and more intellectual combat to disarm her opponents  this caters to the female audience and probably to the males in a dominatrix role as well   when it comes time to fight a common enemy the avengers are a little slow out of the gate  this is precisely what the villain loki is hoping for and he uses it to his advantage  during this fight the hulk takes on the black widow as well as thor  iron man works to repair their broken airship and captain america fights off enemies to buy iron man time to make his repairs  when iron man sacrifices himself to keep the airship aloft captain america realizes he was wrong about the eccentric billionaire when the film draws down to its final climactic end battle iron man chooses to relinquish command of the tactical side of the fight to captain america  his ability to acknowledge capâtms experience and expertise in battle shows his true leadership as well as his acceptance of captain america as an equal and a colleague   the hulk is a bright spot in this film as the previous two hulk films have fallen short in creating a good hero to look up to  he really steals the scene when in hulk form and is a marvel to behold no pun intended  whedon portrays him as a mild mannered scientist when in bruce banner form afraid of nothing but his own ability to harm others unintentionally  but in hulk form it is nonstop smashing time which young viewers especially children will enjoy    in short the avengers is an excellent film with lots of action and a lot of hulk
Oct 15 2012,positive,exciting fun and innovative the avengers is definitely a bigger better superhero movie but i think id prefer a different mix of heroes
Oct 15 2012,negative,movie night with iris  god another geek superhero film really ive seen captain america alright and ive seen thor pretty good but i havent seen iron man im not a geek virgin sorry and whos the black widow oh shes hot in leather thatll do and is the guy with a bow and arrow important and the guy with the trading cards help and its 2hrs 25mins really  but wait a minute it rumbles along ok and is actually quite funny the action is boring it always is i should just ff those bits so hoorah but wait a minute there might be avengers 2 stress
Oct 15 2012,positive,great movie action packed
Oct 15 2012,positive,a very nice movie with a great plot not that shallow
Oct 15 2012,positive,awesome movie one of the best marvel made movies yet
Oct 15 2012,positive,surprisingly i just could not get interested in it think if i watched it again i would but watching action films during the day is always hard to get into it
Oct 15 2012,positive,i dont know how to review this  it is not great cinema  but it is a perfect homage to the comics it is trying to portray  if you enjoy marvels mythology and enjoy a romp this film will not disappoint nor will it challenge you in any way
Oct 15 2012,positive,the movie one of the most expected for me in the year can be summary in one sentence  leave your brain in home and go there with your friends  in my opinion the movie has some mistakes in the sequence that the things happen and the focus gave for some characters who i dont care about a person who doesnt read the comic books in the few years the interest that involv the construction of all super hero movies what intelligent and makes this movie be bigger than actually is after a lot of funny scenes great gc and good action scenes 35 stars was a good punctuation and i think that the next movie can be better and bigger than it already was
Oct 15 2012,positive,one of the best films of 2012
Oct 15 2012,positive,a triumph fantastic character pieces amazing action no single hero tries to outshine another a pleasure to watch

Oct 14 2012,positive,great movie no doubt if it wins an award thor iron man and maybe more people have new movies coming out soon
Oct 14 2012,negative,this was basically just a two and a half hour sequence of fight scenes
Oct 14 2012,negative,i already knew i wasnt a fan of super hero films but i did love green hornet batman and iron man but for me uneventful
Oct 14 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever and one of the best action movies ever  fanboys dream
Oct 14 2012,positive,doesnt aim to be anything more than it actually is which is perfect
Oct 14 2012,positive,very good movie action packed
Oct 14 2012,positive,this is the best hit film ever i didnt see thor or captain america the movie i just went out for a birthday party and saw the best movie ever
Oct 14 2012,positive,yeah i finally watched avengers
Oct 14 2012,neutral,eh would it have been that hard to shoot in real nyc and not green screen nyc i mean really wtf
Oct 14 2012,positive,action funny character driven awesome doesnt get much better than this and family fun too
Oct 14 2012,neutral,seriously this was the film that people were wetting their pants over this summer i guess i should have known really by the level of box office grosses this film attained that it wasnt going to be my cup of tea practically no plot whatsoever and apart from some sharp dialogue with downey jnr and the ever reliable mark ruffalo as the new banner the script was very poor i will say theyve lucked out with ruffalo his casting hes easily the best fit for the role of bannerhulk yet  i found myself checking the time quite a bit and the climatic ggi soaked finale just went on forever hiddleston is ok as loki but his computer generated army were just visually and physically underwhelming i actually thought i was going to watch this and feel like i really should have seen this on the big screen but you know what im glad i saved my money  despite liking a certain character very much in previous films when it came to their fate being the catalyst of the superheroes being bought together as a cohesive unit to fight the enemy i never felt any great sense of loss that the film intended or it grabbed emotionally at any point there is some rare moments that raised a smile but from the very beginning its all over the place maybe i need more of a background to these characters and to have read the comics but i had no problem with the xmen or batman maybe its too grounded in those universes for me nolan was criticised for his stories not being like the literary version and upsetting many a purist but i found his batman films far more compelling and entertaining than this meandering mess of a film whedons involvement might have made the fans get excited but for me hes got far too much going on and its just confusing most of the time jacksons nick fury ambiguous motives hint at something intriguing but are never really given much room to breathe and character development is pretty much zero   i dont think the dark knight rises was the second coming and my favourite film of the summer is still the raid but really i wasnt expecting such a bloated uninteresting film as this its clearly far too long and could have been under 2 hours easily i just think ive come to the end of the line with these marvel films i though captain america was utter garbage and while i dont think its as bad as cap its about on par with iron man 2 i enjoyed the incredible hulk and thor much more and the first iron man still remains my favourite from this franchise as these films have gone on theyve got bigger but dumber  im sure this franchise will go on to gross billions but with nolans bat trilogy now over i very much doubt bar the new superman film next year that ill be paying to watch any more comic book films again with dark knight rises slightly disappointing me and this mess of a film i say its all still to play for when it comes to the most impressive blockbuster of the year especially when we have the hobbit and the return of a certain british secret agent to come
Oct 14 2012,positive,just a perfect blockbuster
Oct 14 2012,positive,of course it was awesome
Oct 14 2012,positive,a big gamble that hits the jackpot with a perfect balance of comedy action and fan service possibly the best comic book movie ever certainly is for me
Oct 14 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies
Oct 14 2012,positive,loved this movie enjoyed stark and everything they did with the hulk

Oct 13 2012,positive,awesome tons of action
Oct 13 2012,positive,i guess im just not a huge fan of this genre not bad i certainly dont get the hype about it though

Oct 13 2012,positive,one of the 2 best movies of 2012
Oct 13 2012,positive,amazing film joss whedon doing what he does best making kickass films for the fans not the bucks
Oct 13 2012,positive,one of my top 5 super hero movies
Oct 13 2012,positive,the movie is off the chart worth watching again and again
Oct 13 2012,positive,very few movies make me as undeniably happy as this one scene after scene line after line of memorable stuff that is full of what we go to the movies for big action genius dialogue a killer villain perfect humor and just the right amount of selfawareness i recognize it has problems but when those issues are overshadowed by the sheer size of what might be the best comic booksuperhero movie of all time they pale under the greatness
Oct 13 2012,positive,typical summer action flick
Oct 13 2012,positive,it shts awesomeness
Oct 13 2012,positive,best action movie ever
Oct 13 2012,positive,will go down as one of the best comic book movies to date it has it all and then some humor action and good acting from 3 of them the avengers is a great popcorn flick and is one of marvels best movies

Oct 13 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever was a great action ride from start to finish
Oct 12 2012,positive,the avengers is a spectacular action epic gathering marvels best superheroes and putting them together the result is action film bliss with many great action scenes a hilarious sense of humor and great acting while i wish the story had more depth i had a great time watching this film and i cant wait to see what the future holds for another installment
Oct 12 2012,neutral,wow not really my thing great effects lacked script dont understand all the high ratings  the first 34 snooze fest
Oct 12 2012,positive,warning this movie may cause but not included to high addiction to marvel the want to watch time after time after time and all around serious badassness but kidding aside this has become my third favorite movie yet it doesnt matter what type of gene you are you will love this money even haters were like damn
Oct 12 2012,positive,even the hardest cynics would have a difficult time finding fault in a movie with just the right amount of action humor and character development
Oct 12 2012,positive,they all came together after one agent dies and loki goes back to asgard
Oct 12 2012,negative,stupid loud shallow paintbynumbers cliche studio summer film with the emotional depth as a cardboard box and zero reason to care literally just a child with action figures and someone hit record on the camera nothing is ever at stake and no reason to believe the good guys wont win
Oct 12 2012,positive,director and writer joss whedon takes what has been established in terms of the character development in the other marvel films and makes it his own he gives everyone in this movie their own moment to shine whedon also uses his ability to write humorous and witty dialogue to inject this movie with some good humor the best part about watching the avengers is seeing the superheroes squabble with one another as they throw insults and fists to each other in topnotch fight scenes which leads to the ultimate smackdown between two characters that have had history with one another in the comics the hulk and thor the third act featuring loki leading his army of aliens to attack new york city is a fantastic action sequence that shows the avengers uniting and working as a team
Oct 12 2012,positive,instant classic best modern superhero movie
Oct 12 2012,positive,awesome movie wish i can buy it
Oct 12 2012,positive,awesome  flawless

Oct 12 2012,positive,booorrriinnnggg how can you have so many good superheros in a movie and make it completely boring and insignificant this should have been transformers 3 on crack and instead just plain sucked
Oct 12 2012,positive,way too many puns for a superhero movie i kept wondering if they all remembered that they were supposed to be saving the planet they didnt seem to take it seriously but in the end how could i not like it
Oct 12 2012,positive,special effects 55
Oct 12 2012,positive,what can i saysmashing
Oct 12 2012,positive,bought the four disc set and a 3d blu ray player i never get tired of watching hulk punch thor in grand central station and sending him flying
Oct 11 2012,positive,awesome combination of good actors good story line great dialog at many moments outstanding special effects and a near perfect amount of screen time and timing keep it up marvel studios
Oct 11 2012,positive,avengers assemble marvel hits it big with this epic and terrific comic book film which is one of 2012s two great comic book films the other being the dark knight rises joss whedon creator of firefly and buffy the vampire slayer was the perfect choice to bring this superhero assemble film to the screen the main members iron man captain america the hulk and thor are brought together after loki arrives to earth with a threat to take it over with the help from a dangerous extraterrestrial force     all of the actors are superb and get a good amount of screentime robert downey jr and mark ruffalo steal most scenes with ruffalo being the best actor to tackle eric banner since eric bana and edward norton loki is also a superb villain with tom hiddleston once again bringing a terrific sense of malice to the character a few scenes featuring lokin bring a feel of comedy to the film especially his confrontation with the hulk which is another great addition to the film samuel l jackson also gets a larger role in this film than he did in the earlier marvel universe films which include iron man in the postcredit scene iron man 2 thor another postcredit scene and captain america the first avenger the film ends on a high note with two great postcredits scenes one of them making hints to who the possible villain could be in a future installment undoubtedly marvels best film to date
Oct 11 2012,positive,better than most super hero movies i thought the dialogue between the various superheroes was very interesting and the plot was at least slightly better than some others in this genre  all in all it was an entertaining movie worth watching
Oct 11 2012,positive,im not a big fan of marvel superhero type movies but this one pretty good 
Oct 11 2012,positive,the best superhero movie of all time period
Oct 11 2012,positive,bothe me  my son loved it
Oct 11 2012,positive,just superb the first of this kind where im not saying enough already at the final fight very well made
Oct 11 2012,positive,great action  comedy mix
Oct 11 2012,positive,the last scene was about half an hour too long some nice joss whedon oneliners but theyre too few and far between to save this film
Oct 11 2012,positive,this was so good i would have watched it again straight afterwards if it hadnt already been past my bed time absolutely brilliant such a shame my 6 year old boy cant watch it yet
Oct 11 2012,positive,was funny but you know more special effects and less script but it was funny no doubt
Oct 11 2012,positive,epic need anyone say more
Oct 11 2012,positive,im a marvels fan so this movie was right up my alleyall my favorite characters and villainsscar joehhmovie would have been just as good without her but this movie does not disappoint its just longbut action filled non the less so all you marvel nerdsget your underoos ready
Oct 11 2012,positive,just nearly the ending i think this flick is good enough in the beginning its typical hehe
Oct 11 2012,positive,finally missed it in the theater avoided conversations about it and waited until i could quietly enjoy it  yes i did enjoy it but i think i built myself up for a slight letdown  not sure i am feeling ruffalo in place of norton as the hulk but there have been so many bruce banners at this point who really cares  i find that it seams to be hard to findcreate amazing original special effects anymore  the flying carrier was cool but didnt knock me outta my seats  the fight seens between the characters were ok but the aliens wernt impressive  perhaps a couple of detailed closeups  anyway i still loved it but wanted to love it more

Oct 11 2012,positive,loved it ill admit i was rather bored towards the beginning but it picked up quick
Oct 11 2012,positive,lovely lovely movie i saw it twice the actors work so well with each other ironman makes it 
Oct 11 2012,positive,one to watch with friends a notch above the usual superhero fare but the more i think about it the lesser its sheen becomes everybody gets a smart line or two and hulk almost runs away with it not something i would watch again though
Oct 10 2012,positive,hulk and iron man  instant classic
Oct 10 2012,positive,entertaining but mindless where superhero movies are concerned this is of the more uninspiring variety visually topnotch though with some thoroughly epic sequences the dynamic between the avengers was a highlight also the banter being quite cleverly written
Oct 10 2012,positive,one of the best marvel films yet
Oct 10 2012,positive,i hadnt seen thor so it was kind of confusing but after i saw it i understood it a lot more 
Oct 10 2012,positive,a great action movie liked the fight scenes and like the modernized outfit for hawkeye compared to the old comic book definitely liked those few funny scenes in the movie
Oct 10 2012,positive,i didnt expect to laugh so much one of the best comic book movies ever
Oct 10 2012,positive,a dazzling surprisingly cinematic adaption of the the most epic proportions marvel has yet to craft until now
Oct 10 2012,negative,loki vs avengers one man with a stick vs countless superheroes this movie looked more like a great advertisement for a toy line than a movie
Oct 10 2012,positive,thor and iron man in the same movie d
Oct 10 2012,positive,standard blockbuster style movie not mentally taxing always enjoy robert downey jnr as stark
Oct 10 2012,positive,fun and entertaining great fx good comic book adaptation
Oct 10 2012,positive,found it to be a little long but overall good i love joss whedon and he rarely disappoints
Oct 10 2012,positive,love the action the humor and just seeing the avengers come together great movie
Oct 10 2012,positive,best super hero movie of all time just go watch it now
Oct 10 2012,positive,i was expecting more short but worth watching feels like an animated marvel comics plot
Oct 10 2012,positive,typical marvel movie never read the comics but all i gotta say is better than the spiderman trilogy
Oct 10 2012,positive,mmmm chris helmsworth is yummy
Oct 10 2012,positive,very well made movie  all characters have great interactions with one another  the movie will keep you on your feet the entire time
Oct 10 2012,positive,good movie but was expecting a lot more
Oct 10 2012,positive,manthis has got to be the most successful films in history it has crazy sound effects and it fits just perfectly for the film i never noticed that marvel would actually make a better job in the year of 2012 i gave this rating a 5 out of 5 it was amazing
Oct 10 2012,positive,fun movie lots of cgi eye candy the villain is actually interesting while the story isnt particularly deep but generally awesome aside from ironman the hulk and thor the other 3 heroes hawkeye the chick and captain america seem fairly redundant but i guess thats just stating the obvious watch it for the fun experience
Oct 10 2012,positive,best movie ive seen in years the cast works great together and i cant wait for part 2 if you have not yet seen the movie  dont stop at the end  watch all the way through the credits for something special best hulk ive ever seen
Oct 9 2012,positive,honestly is there anything else that needs to be said about this movie it is amazing in each and every way
Oct 9 2012,positive,by far the most entertaining film ive seen all year many have been waiting for this kind of movie for a long long time now and i am glad to say that it was worth the wait  for those who have seen all of the movies leading up to this one you will be rewarded and much more involved in the story for all of those who havent seen the other movies i ask why not the movie starts where the others left off specifically thor loki is involved with some space kind of evildoers to put in basic terms and he uses the tesseract to come to earth it doesnt take too long for loki to begin starting his plan as he manipulates shield personnel to do his dirty work that ishe is creating some sort of device to create a portal so that tons of alienlike creatures can invade earth it doesnt take too long after that for mr fury played by good ol samuel l jackson to start working on contacting all of the superheroes from the past films after all they are heroes so who needs the army sure this movie is filled with huge action setpieces with good vs evil but the real joy in this movie is how the heroes interact with each other ever wonder what it would be like with thor captain america iron man bruce banner and black widow all talking to each other well now youll get to find out but ill take it a step further and this is what i truly loved did you ever wonder what a fight would be like between iron man and thor hulk and thor black widow and hawkeye well youre in luck  its truly a nerds paradise watching this film the actors are better than ever as their superhero counterparts the action scenes are welldone and the movie has a great sense of humor that keeps the movie fun at all times is this movie technically a perfect movie well not really how does hawkeye carry all those arrows with him how come hulk can seem to perfectly control his rage near the end answer who the f cares as far as entertainment value goes you cant get much better than this its the most fun youll have at the movies all year guaranteed
Oct 9 2012,positive,great movie  absolutely loved it
Oct 9 2012,positive,best superhero movie yet
Oct 9 2012,positive,its the type of movie you plan to watch again even while you are watching it worth multiple cinema views
Oct 9 2012,positive,security guard harry dean stanton are you an alien  bruce banner mark ruffalo what  security guard harry dean stanton from outer space an alien  bruce banner mark ruffalo no  security guard harry dean stanton well then son youve got a condition  to me this movie was just alright i guess because i had seen all the awesome parts online ie black widow interrogation scene the hulk punching thor the hulks scene with loki etc so in a way it spoiled the movie for me i do like shawarma scene that was hilarious and robert downey tony starkiron man was the higlight of the whole film followed closely by mark ruffalo who imho may have portrayed the best bruce bannerhulk ive seen since bill bixby chris evans captain america was cute chris hemsworth thor was hawt scarjo black widownatasha romanoff was wellvery scarjo and jeremy renner hawkeyeclint barton was kinda cool but there was just too much of him maybe it wouldve been better if there was a little less of him and a wee bit more of tony also lose pepper aka gweneth boring the film started off a little slow going over the backstories for each of the heroes for those who have not seen the other films solely dedicated to iron man thor the hulk or captain america but imho they shouldve harry potter and the deathly hallows it which basically employs the ifyourenotfamiliarwiththebackstorybythispointwerenotexplainingittoyousogoseetheotherfilms first mentalitybut thats just me anyhow the film was enjoyable and fairly entertaining the cast were awesome and did a splendid job sharing the spotlight with the other actors they had good chemistry as an ensemble and i cant wait for the next installment although next time i think ill steer clear of the tidbits they show online  
Oct 9 2012,positive,one time where the quotes on the package actually mean what they say in the marvel universe this is the best superhero film to come out of that mess thus far a great blend of onscreen acting and action sequences that will blow you away some great cinematography on the heroes during their escapades and well written dialogue to keep you entertained
Oct 9 2012,positive,the avengers is an entertaining movie it has plenty of action and destruction
Oct 9 2012,negative,ruffalo is good the action entertains and the visuals are amazing everything else is an unmitigated disaster of futility joss where are you
Oct 9 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies
Oct 9 2012,positive,this movie is great
Oct 9 2012,positive,wow you are in the comics
Oct 9 2012,positive,giving all of its heroes moments in the sun a intelligent humorous script and fantastic action and special effects make this installment in the marvel film universe a cut way above its predecessors
Oct 9 2012,positive,some of the individual films iron man hulk are much better than this amalgamation that gets a little too caught up in its own making  its still incredibly thrilling but not nearly as all the fanboys are making it seem
Oct 9 2012,positive,movie had plenty of action throughout to the end but the rivalry between all of the heros was needless and that alone took up over half of the movie although i think that they were just trying to captivate viewers of the power the heros had just incase everyone forgot
Oct 9 2012,positive,absolutely awesome
Oct 9 2012,positive,a lot of action great movie
Oct 9 2012,positive,my nephew loved this movie
Oct 9 2012,positive,the most epic movie of super heroes
Oct 9 2012,positive,very enjoyable  featuring my alterego bruce banner 
Oct 9 2012,positive,best movie in a long hulk smash
Oct 9 2012,positive,im really not a big comic book superhero fan  got this movie for connor cuz he loves the hulk but after watching it i want to see all the rest
Oct 9 2012,positive,it played up to all the hype
Oct 9 2012,positive,certainly one of the greatest movies ive seen what impresses me most how the directory managed to let every single actor shine
Oct 9 2012,positive,not the best comic hero movie i have wet seen the dark knight but definitely in the much larger 2nd tier group if you like action and or comic movies then this is a must see
Oct 9 2012,negative,i never get it from the moment ive watched the beginning
Oct 9 2012,positive,the story keeps you glued to the screen with not even a single moment of  dullness most of all the weaving of characters from all the legendary creations of marvel is truly commendable by far the best movie in its genre till date looking forward to the sequel
Oct 9 2012,positive,another piece of good ol family entertainment i felt this one was more comical than the rest example hulk smashing the crap out of loki
Oct 8 2012,positive,joss whedon needs to be given more projects
Oct 8 2012,positive,for pure entertainment value this is the best super hero movie ever made  such a good time
Oct 8 2012,positive,this movie was incredible i havent even seen the previous individual character movies but after seeing this i am officially an avengers fan
Oct 8 2012,positive,this is how superhero movies should be made  the future of marvel movies is lookin bright
Oct 8 2012,positive,excellent loved it
Oct 8 2012,positive,as good as the second film was the xmen movies made me skeptical about how good a team movie can be with plenty of attention and wellcrafted one liners given to each central character the avengers successfully makes even xmen look like something ed wood filmed in his basement without a script this is a fun ridiculous movie and also a good one
Oct 8 2012,neutral,this movie was good but i dont understand using two people without super powers that was a bit point less this was a good movie
Oct 8 2012,positive,the best of any movie marvel has put out to date
Oct 8 2012,positive,superlative superhero action flickno question the best marvel flick to date plot characters action special effects and humor all hit the mark really nothing to nitpick  the only problem i see is marvel living up to mark this one has made
Oct 8 2012,positive,loved it very fun movie
Oct 8 2012,positive,fantastic flick with incredible action and i think many woudl agree that the best part is the onscreen chemistry downy and the crew work great together and the dialogue is great mark ruffalo get this man a hulk movie restart i dont care what you have to do do it the avengers is right there with the batman trilogy as the greatest superhero movie ever made
Oct 8 2012,positive,one awesome movie if you read marvel growing up youll love it
Oct 8 2012,positive,the avengers is perfect summer blockbuster entertainment the experienced joss whedon and his very firm vision on the superhero world is tightly scripted and full of spectacular action
Oct 8 2012,positive,think that maybe i lack the background to appreciate what most see in this adaptation as someone not moved by ironman1 and less so by 2 and moderately entertained by thor the avengers was better but nothing more than thatbetter
Oct 8 2012,positive,good misses my rewind button felt like i was missing stuff wired ending anyone understand it
Oct 8 2012,positive,great movie satisfied my expectation
Oct 8 2012,negative,slightly visually entertaining however it was extremely unoriginal and actionpacked a transformers film disguised as something greater by the occasional use of bad jokes
Oct 8 2012,positive,hulk stole the movie a little long to get to the action but an awesome movie
Oct 8 2012,neutral,while the movie does the action you crave from a superhero movie the trailer for the movie is better than the real thing you get all the best moments minus one moment with the lokidoll fling but dont have to pay attention for the whole two and a half hours the action was great the execution of a fullscale movie not so much it was flashy that was all the substance was akin to eating a rice cake my fix for men and women in spandex was barely satisfied after watching i feel like i need another two hours of something better   will i buy it yes because i have a superhero movie collection will this movie be forgotten in the bottom corner of my dvd case yep maybe in a few years itll be slightly more interesting   not once was avengers assemble uttered by the captain and that made me die a little inside even moreso than the exclusion of wasp and ant man in the lineup but that could just be fangirl nerd rage speaking ill stick with the earths mightiest heroes cartoon series which was more hardhitting and visceral than this thing
Oct 8 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever
Oct 8 2012,positive,the movie seemed to just fall short of the hype the effects were interesting but i felt there could have been more dynamic characters the plot was predictable but the humor was still enjoyable  of course its still a fun movie and if people take it as that they will probably enjoy it
Oct 8 2012,positive,really slow and boring annoyed that scar jo wouldnt even attempt a russian accent
Oct 8 2012,positive,when was the last time you had this much fun at the movies honestly
Oct 8 2012,positive,they all look great in the screen
Oct 8 2012,positive,best movie of this decade
Oct 8 2012,positive,perfection  two and a half hours of superhero bliss  loved it
Oct 7 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever a stunning achievement by marvel that surpasses previous greats like iron man and thor jose whedon has done an amazing job not only bringing all the superheroes together but also the execution was perfect the way that he incorporates all the heroes in it giving all of them plenty of camera time and serving an important function in the movie was vital in this movie coming together properly the cineomatography was great and you can really tell that whedon is not only a great director but also a fan of the franchise and being a fan he knows what other fans want to see which i believe is a big reason the movie was near perfect
Oct 7 2012,positive,awesome movie where was spider man
Oct 7 2012,neutral,i have to be honest and admit that the first time i saw the avengers i thought it was one of the greatest movies ever made  i was so pumped coming out of it i was extremely impressed  but then i saw it two more times  the second time my thoughts were okay hurry up hurry up  lets get to the climax  but coming out of it i was still thinking it was a good movie  then the third time came around  and after knowing everything that was coming and giving the movie in whole a more indepth look i hate the avengers  im one of few to say this    this movie is by far one of the most overrated movies i will ever see in my life  its boxoffice numbers and records will say otherwise but i do believe that the avengers sucked  i know that when i saw it the first time i came out like holy crap  well that was just awe at the magnitude of the final 30 minutes  maybe i am a little bias seeing im such a dc fan and i will never say there was a marvel movie better than the tdk trilogy  yes there were exciting parts to this movie and it was impressive how joss whedon was able to create this film  but this movie was nothing special  now for me to get to what my personal problems were with this movie  the two biggest problems i had were the length and the main focus on characters  while making my complaints im going to do a lot of comparing to the dark knight rises because that was the other huge superhero movie being released in 2012 no offense to the amazing spiderman but id consider that a big movie not huge    the most annoying problem for me was the length of the movie  only 142 minutes long i know that still 20 minutes less than the dark knight rises  but the avengers problem is that no one cares about mark ruffalo chris hemsworth and chris evans  its all about downey jr  no one came to the avengers to see scarlett johansson or jeremy renner  no one really cares much about tom hiddleston either  if you thought loki was a good bad guy youre crazy  dude we get it youre still mad about the whole adoption thing  these characters are the reason why this movie moves so slow  i dont care about seeing all of the avengers talking to each other  i dont care about their problems with each other or what their inner demons are  or do i necessarily know where some of their inner problems even come from  i mean why mention black widows past if we have no clue anything about her  whedon tries to make every character matter when they really dont  everyone just wants to see massive battles and huge explosions  thats why its too long  too little fighting and too much talking  yes he does make up for it at the end  but save the audience the pain of listening all of the avengers bitch and moan at each other  cut out most of the flying ship scenes and youve got a quicker pacing movie which would have probably been more enjoyable  my second biggest problem goes off something i mentioned in my first complaint  its all about robert downey jr  no one cares about the others and why should they  youve got chris evans coming off the weakest of all the avenger movies with captain america the first avenger  there is chris hemsworth and his eh thor  and theres mark ruffalo who is making his debut as hulk  but then theres the face of marvel rdj  with two huge iron man movies hes the man of the hour  or the man of two and a half hours  this movie might as well have been called iron man and friends  he is by far the biggest focus of this movie and for me it takes away from the whole the avengers concept  whedon is lucky to have such a star save what could have possibly been a disaster  i could not stand how much this movie relied off of tony stark  yes hes the most famous  and yes hes by far the most humorous and complex character in the movie  but this isnt iron man  this is the avengers  quit kissing up to rdj and give the other actors a little more attention  i would like to see how this movie would have turned out had there been no downey jr  so to sum it up i have a big distaste for this movie  maybe its just the fact that i hate so much humor in a superhero movie  maybe that all the humor comes from one actor  maybe its how thin this plot is  whatever way may be i was thoroughly disappointed with the highest grossing movie of the year
Oct 7 2012,negative,another marvel movie that is ok with an average save the world plot and use of cgi makes it the ending fell very unbelievable  my other complaint is that there was a lack of story for nighthawk  and dont say that just beacuase he was mind controlled that lets him have more wiggle room than any of the other characters and also black widow  who also is useless most of the movie and the only attention she really gets is in the beginning of the movie
Oct 7 2012,positive,loved it action filled good portrayal of the marvel characters didnt care for the actor changes from movie to movie but was still a great movie
Oct 7 2012,positive,just another hightec movie
Oct 7 2012,positive,the best marvel movie ever  overall pretty messed up but very entertaining
Oct 7 2012,positive,very good entertaing movie
Oct 7 2012,positive,the best superhero film ever made  no loose ends a highly entertaining story line with a strong dose of visual ecstasy and unexpected witty humor the summer perfect flick
Oct 7 2012,positive,i enjoyed the avengers was amazed that they were able to pull off this big of a cast with this many back stories  while somewhat cheesy at times still entertaining
Oct 7 2012,negative,after years of buildup and anticipation its disappointing to think that the avengers is just average if you have not seen all the previous films you dont know whats going on the film is over bloated and looks like a messed up rainbow
Oct 7 2012,positive,it stood there but didnt try to jump higher i had to sit and wait for it to be over it wasnt a failure just average
Oct 7 2012,negative,i will never understand the hype about superhero movies theyre all the same this one is no exception since it was such a huge blockbuster i almost caved to the peer pressure and saw it in theaters and now im exceptionally glad i didnt i imagine its probably well made and i guess i can almost understand why it appeals to its target audience but it was not for me at all
Oct 7 2012,negative,for the action lovers that dislike real story bring on the fire works and leave your brain at the door
Oct 7 2012,positive,hulk is a bad ass really good movie great effects and seeing super heroes in tiff with one and other is really cool if they can keep the cast together they can keep making these indefinitely and i will watch them
Oct 7 2012,positive,absolutely love this movie thought i was going to be disappointed but ive been proven wrong right amount of humor right amount of action right amount of everything love love love
Oct 7 2012,negative,sorry comic book fans typical comic book movie lots of exhausting cg lots of predicable action sequences and a very predictable and lackluster ending these movies will continue to be produced and make lots of money but that doesnt mean they are good the avengers will be productive in the box office but its trilogy will not hold up to the dark knight trilogy
Oct 7 2012,positive,omg this was an amazing movie and hilarious
Oct 7 2012,positive,i actually own this movie and loved every second of it i love ironman and lokie
Oct 7 2012,positive,most amazing superhero film ever
Oct 7 2012,positive,awesome film love the avengers
Oct 7 2012,positive,another awesome marvel movie 
Oct 7 2012,positive,its so awesome and action packed
Oct 7 2012,positive,whilst it was good the story didnt particularly follow smoothly from the independent avengers films iron man captain america etc nor did the characters entice the level of emotion needed to watch the film however it was incredibly funny
Oct 7 2012,positive,great movie perfect blend of action and comedy robert downey jr makes this movie hilarious as tony stark not as good as nolans batman trilogy but a great comic book movie cant wait to see what happens next
Oct 7 2012,positive,if ya like ironman etc you need to watch this
Oct 7 2012,positive,awesome on blu ray love rdj and mark ruffalo
Oct 7 2012,positive,perfect comic book action movie blending cheesy oneliners with fantastic battle scenes it ranks among the best super hero movies
Oct 7 2012,positive,easily the best film of the year marvels the avengers follows the members of the avengers initative tony starkiron man played by robert downey jr steve rogerscaptain america played by chris evans bruce bannerthe incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo thor played by chris hemsworth hawkeyeclint barton played by jeremy renner and black widownatasha romanoff played by scarlett johanson as they try to fight thors adopted brother loki played by tom hiddleston with help from nick fury played by samuel l jackson the last half an hour of this movie is easily the best fight of the last decade maybe aside from harry vs voldemort in dh part 2 with some great character development and a lot of hype due to the individual films leading up to this masterpiece this film really knocked by socks off i own it on dvd and bluray and im proud to have it great film to watch when your bored or if you just want to get yourself into an action mood rating 455
Oct 7 2012,positive,very good and solid movie in my opinion the hulk stole the movie thor and him had some really good scences that were funny iron man and captain america were really good too black widow and jeremy renner were outstanding in their characters saw it at the movies and bought thed dvd and will continue to enjoy it more
Oct 7 2012,positive,the beginning is just awful a god escaping by truck and all shield can throw at him is pistols boy i feel safe throw in a mysterious energy source and you have a small bang  fortunately it picks up quickly as the special effects are grand the one liners are quick and the fight between thor and iron man is fun  but right after that all the ruminations among the cast and an arrow can take out the helicarrier is another low point  the large flying aliens have a definite shadow of the colossus look to them which are spectacular  once the attack on the helicarrier happens the film moves along very fast with tons of action and lots of fighting  at times the dialogue is witty other times just plain bad especially when the superheroes get reflective  this is perhaps the only superhero movie that looks and feels like it came from an actual comic book this is due to all the characters are developed and the massive budget was well used  the only time i could say they skimped on the budget was at the end when iron man is down and the hulk screams at him  i am sure that initially that thor was supposed to hit him with lightening like he did in their fight to boost the suit to 400 to jump start him but they went with a scream  the other obvious budget choices were hawkeye and black widow who have no superpowers and with the extensive lineup in the avenger universe to choose from most of whom are far more interesting than these two it can only be deduced that these two were picked for budget  but i am only complaining about two scenes and a continuity oddity as this is a highly enjoyable movie where the end battle with the invading army is very satisfying
Oct 7 2012,positive,marvelous entertaining suspense best movie of the year love the combination of all hero cant wait to watch them again
Oct 7 2012,positive,action from start to finish i laughed out loud a bunch of times the humor was very well done and timed the story was a little too much but that is to be expected a great popcorn movie
Oct 7 2012,positive,joss whedon balances the story with the fims starpower and characterstrong front to create a oneofakind comic bookbased film
Oct 7 2012,positive,saw this last night with kristinaenjoyable movie robert downey steals every scene hes in lots of action and if youre a marvel comic fan or just love the super hero movies then this movie is for you the special effects are awesome and there really is a story  line behind it  all the other characters  hulk blackwidow capt americathor and hawkeye all get their chance to shine looking forward to the next one
Oct 7 2012,negative,with such high praise for this movie i was excited to see it myself hoping it would be the one to finally revive this increasingly trite genre disappointingly this was nothing but repurposed scraps of meat ripped from preceding marvel carrion calculatedly sewn together with strings of transparent dialog and repackaged in a shiny new cgi facade
Oct 7 2012,positive,iron man captain america and thor all in one movie nuff said
Oct 7 2012,positive,action action action almost as if i had adhd
Oct 7 2012,positive,awesome movie hope there is a sequel
Oct 7 2012,positive,the best movie ever besides some others joss whedon knows his stuff he lets loose everything fanboys and girls wanted and then some i had high expectations and this blew them away i dont know how finding nemo got a better rating on rotten tomatoes because this is the better film good humor action clever characters and writing wow what a movie it redefines the superhero movie and sets the bar very high for any sequels or other blockbuster films to come
Oct 7 2012,positive,theres not much to say about this movieexcept it is awesome nuff said
Oct 6 2012,positive,great way combo of super heros just like the comic book
Oct 6 2012,positive,joss whedon continues his trend of highquality works with the avengers which is easily one of the best superhero films of all time
Oct 6 2012,positive,very good super hero blockbuster that just fell short of amazing top notch special effects including all your favorite heroes packed into one equals a unmissable two hour plus eye candy
Oct 6 2012,positive,really funny and i love the action in it  awsome movie to watch 
Oct 6 2012,positive,when you have an allstar cast you are begging to have something good marvels the avengers or something bad grown ups its a good thing that is was a good movie it has all the things an action movie needs all the things that make good comedy great performances for the cast a lot of energy etc if theres only one fault of the movie it would be the fact that you may need to see like 4 or 5 other movies to be ready for this but you wont care once you get to this film it more than lives up to the hype and it sets the bar higher for action and comic book movies
Oct 6 2012,positive,good movie about what youd expect
Oct 6 2012,positive,was alot of fun enjoyed it
Oct 6 2012,positive,great film keeps you engaged
Oct 6 2012,positive,this one is a lot of fun
Oct 6 2012,positive,honestly it was just okay   you can completely tell that there was so much interest and hard work into making this film especially the screenplay the screenplay is the strongest aspect of the film the special effects are a marvel the acting was solid at best the drive was surprising from the director joss whedon   my only complaint would be the empty tragedy of the film i never felt what the characters were feeling when they lost a member of their team okay i get it its an action film  but it doesnt mean that it has to be the only factor  side note although a tad overhyped it was still the best action film that ive ever seen from marvel would truly be a wonder how joss whedon can outdo himself again for the sequel  from daniel v
Oct 6 2012,positive,hands down best super hero action movie ive ever seen amazing visual effects with great dialogue i actually want to watch it again
Oct 6 2012,positive,great movie  i loved robert downey jr  he plays a great iron man

Oct 6 2012,positive,how in the world can you not like this movie avengers rule
Oct 6 2012,positive,quite possible the best marvel film so far hulk was awesomeabout time mark ruffalo made him his own should of play banner in last hulk movie
Oct 6 2012,neutral,boring  the end was ok the only good actors were downey and ruffalo as the hulk
Oct 6 2012,positive,an excellent movie of its time i love how they blend all the characters together after their own movies
Oct 6 2012,positive,i absolutely loved this movie witty good one liners explosive action throughout and first class special effects utterly brilliant
Oct 6 2012,positive,the movie was pretty good the action was great was pretty funny at times as well some of the scenes were a bit too cartoonish for me but it didnt take away from the movie overall its the best film i have ever seen but its up there
Oct 6 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies ive seen in a very long time
Oct 6 2012,negative,uggg  i could barely get through it  the plot was atrocious  robert downey is still a treat though
Oct 6 2012,positive,fantastic super hero film and a great joy to watch would whole heartedly recommend this film to anyone and everyone

Oct 6 2012,positive,very high expectations very low encounters
Oct 6 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever  bar none
Oct 6 2012,positive,absolutely brilliant its just a damn shame that the uk release did not get triple play or at least a digital download so i like others could add to their digital collection
Oct 6 2012,positive,best movie ever absolutely awesome
Oct 6 2012,positive,fun to watch marvel super heros
Oct 6 2012,positive,best part hulk smash btw how do hulks pants stay on
Oct 6 2012,positive,almost near prefect score the way the characters were brought together was great spoiler alert just did not like how loki was able to turn other against the avengers
Oct 6 2012,positive,i like iron man the most
Oct 6 2012,positive,it was good but these marvel movies are all the same to meexcept thor but that had a great shakespearean slant
Oct 6 2012,positive,really cool seeing so many superheroes in one movie we even get to see them beat each other up good plot good plot development although i was expecting it to be a little more epic gets close to the boundary of being awesome without being cheesy and there were a lot of man you really should have seen that coming moments
Oct 6 2012,positive,surprisingly entertaining
Oct 6 2012,positive,this movie was action packed had a great storyline and kept you on the edge of your chair
Oct 5 2012,positive,its so cool to see them together a funny movie though not a comedy i just expected more from this 
Oct 5 2012,positive,while the action and the cgi are all fine and dandy what makes the movie really pop is the humor and the humanity given to these larger than life characters even though they are superheroes out saving the world you get the feeling that after they defeat the bad guy they would meet you to grab a beer at the bar
Oct 5 2012,negative,bleak senseless over hyped not even joss wheadon could save this though downey tried
Oct 5 2012,positive,love it gotta see it now
Oct 5 2012,positive,robert downey jr elevates the material
Oct 5 2012,positive,the one disadvantage that this movie has is that if you dont watch all the other movies prior to this one it wont make any sense nonetheless the avengers is a great film all the way through by the end youll be laughing crying and cheering for these heros this is without a doubt one of the best comic book movies ever made
Oct 5 2012,positive,fantastic movie i was thrilled through out the entire movie loved every second of it and as soon as it came out on dvd i immediately bought it great group of actors and actresses each playing their role to perfection i would absolutely recommend this movie please watch this is how every movie should be the perfect amount of action the perfect storyline the perfect humor the perfect amount of incredible sexy actors highly recommended
Oct 5 2012,positive,awesome movie an so funny
Oct 5 2012,positive,awesome superhero movie
Oct 5 2012,positive,puny god  nuff said  but seriously i didnt think they could ever do an avengers film right  first of all unlike the justice league these characters come from such diverse backgrounds that are completely in conflict with each other  well color me wrong marvel  you did it  it was an extremely smart move for marvel studios to create links to each other within the main heroes films  but at the same time you dont have to see any of the individual films to understand marvels the avengers  i think i can honestly say that this was the best superhero film to date
Oct 5 2012,positive,there were some funny moments but there were a lot more moments where i knew the line was supposed to be a joke but i wasnt laughing there were big fabulous explosions and fight scenes and everything you would expect  i though the characters were all giving a fair amount of time overall a well made movie but not one i fell in love with
Oct 5 2012,positive,awesome movie a few flaws but who cares it has the hulk  hulk smash
Oct 5 2012,positive,favorite movie off the entire movie moviemake anther asap
Oct 5 2012,negative,zzzzzwhat the heckwhat was this movie even about
Oct 5 2012,positive,perfect superhero movie there isnt a single flaw in it that i can find
Oct 5 2012,positive,awsome hulk smashed irion man rocked thor brought the thunder black widow and hawk eye were pure coolness and captain america ruled this movie was fantastic
Oct 5 2012,positive,a fun film that brings a story line and great acting all around with a crew like this what could go wrong except for the unnecessary bow preparation every time you see bullseye funny and exciting with great cgi
Oct 5 2012,positive,one of marvels best movies yet
Oct 5 2012,positive,the assembly complete on what turns out to be the strongest movie of all the entries this is down to a lot of things including whedons skill as a director and love of the source material the fully formed characters that we have grown to know in the individual moviesall getting equal screen time and action action action hiddlestone is great as loki but the movie needs a bigger villain and because of this by no fault of his own there is never really any doubt who will triumph superhero films dont all have to be dark like the burtonnolan batman saga and can achieve greatness with a great director fully formed characters and care for the comic material
Oct 5 2012,positive,this is just my kind of movie
Oct 5 2012,positive,what a visual thrill and delight the avengers delivers big time especially when watched in bluray on a big screen i just wish i had an 80 inch screen because the fxs on this one were spectacular nick fury samuel jackson of shield brings together a team of super humans to form the avengers to help save the earth from loki tom hiddleston and his army ironman is my favorite because of the remarkable gadgets and super cool mansion he has he is quite arrogant but so smart and his ironman suit is amazing so marvels heroes are back incredible hulk captain america ironman thor lokis brother black widow hawkeye for the battle of their lives against loki and his minions excellent special effects battle sequences and frankly the last hour and 20 minutes was my favorite part highly recommended in bluray splendor
Oct 5 2012,neutral,nice but nothing more
Oct 5 2012,positive,great funny entertaining had great time watching it superb sense of humour gonna watch it again
Oct 5 2012,negative,aimed towards boys in their lower teens boring seen it all before nice special effects though
Oct 5 2012,positive,very fun  good super hero movie  lots of playful cheesy goodness and awesome special affects
Oct 4 2012,positive,suddenly i care a lot about comic book super heroes i never got it before this movie tom hiddleston is the highlight
Oct 4 2012,positive,ultimately the greatest super hero flick ive seen extremely badass  out of this world action seen
Oct 4 2012,positive,great movie for any marvel fan
Oct 4 2012,positive,marvel has indeed set the bar up high the question is whether or not they can top it in the avengers 2
Oct 4 2012,negative,big scenes with big machines
Oct 4 2012,positive,its remarkable how well they did and how easy they made seem the task of bringing all of these characters together everything feels so well assembled you wonder how any of these guys are going to work as individuals again after this this is quality superhero movie making
Oct 4 2012,positive,awesome ending was cool too watch all of it till the very end
Oct 4 2012,positive,i am a mom of boys so i have to like superheroes this was a good superhero movie
Oct 4 2012,negative,crappy movie totally disliked it 
Oct 4 2012,positive,great movie saw it twice
Oct 4 2012,positive,okay if you like super hero style movies this is as good as it gets worth it for the hulk scenes alone story acting and cinematography are all actually very good of course the special effects rock
Oct 4 2012,negative,too boring i just couldnt get in to it took an hour and a half just to get to the action and the previews are the last half hour of the movie its a waste of money
Oct 4 2012,positive,best movie movie of the year
Oct 4 2012,positive,perfect superhero movie by marvel probably the best part is the surprising depth and the welcomed comic relief along with the crossing of ideas from previous movies
Oct 4 2012,positive,      free shipping  accept the credit card and other  jordan shoes 32  sunglass 12  coachnecklace 18  handbag 33  more products     
Oct 4 2012,positive,amazing i didnt even read the marvel comics but i loved that movie
Oct 4 2012,neutral,not a bad film the idea of using gods from norse mythology as villains was a disappointment
Oct 4 2012,positive,this movie was great
Oct 4 2012,positive,dug it maybe joss will take his loot and make a firefly sequal  please 
Oct 4 2012,positive,best movie this summer
Oct 4 2012,positive,very good live action interpretation from the animations version good act good actors i love robert downey jr as stark and mark rufallos banner is perfect satisfying enough plot fury its about him pointing at thor little details jokes here and there hulk riding the motorcycle anyone its so good i will definitely buy the originals dvd or blueray and i rarely does that
Oct 4 2012,positive,i was doubtful this film would be successful as i am with any comic book movie as they are a hit and miss genre but wow the avengers was awesome it was so much fun and i cant wait to see what joss whedon does next with his new franchise oh and im sorry for doubting you joss i know i shouldnt have as everything youve done is brilliant except dollhouse  i wasnt into that
Oct 4 2012,positive,is def a good movie i can watch it over and over again and still be entertained every time i watch it
Oct 4 2012,positive,ive seen bits and pieces cant wait to see it
Oct 4 2012,negative,joss whedons widely influenced summer spectacular offers 130 minutes of popcornfriendly fun yet fails to deliver anything more than runofthemill escapist entertainment tom hiddleston is superb as shakespearian villain loki and mark ruffallo gives the hulk some heart yet the films character development is minimal its plot slow and formulaic and its screenplay drizzled in gooey oneliners and excessive fanboy cream things pick up a little during the final act but even a swooping snarling manhattan skybattle isnt enough to save the avengers from feeling bloated and underwhelming
Oct 4 2012,positive,the story is great the acting is great the action is great im glad this movie is in my dvd collection
Oct 4 2012,positive,the avengers is a perfect example of what a large ensemble superhero movie should be all the characters are well rounded and their motivations are also not lost in the shuffle with real drama comedy and great dialog the avengers delivers on multiple levels and will likely be the measuring stick by which future nonbatman superhero films will be judged by  marvel did a brilliant job of marketing this film by releasing origin films about almost all of the characters you can certainly watch and enjoy the avengers without seeing the other marvel films that came out in the last few years but your enjoyment and understanding of the plot and its subtext will be far better understood if you watch the other films like thor prior to seeing the avengers  definitely a must see for anyone who loves comic books andor superhero movies you wont be disappointed by the avengers
Oct 4 2012,positive,this was an incredibly fun film which rarely takes itself seriously but with such a witty script and great action along with some good performances why should it its not a perfect film by any means and some of the jokes are a bit too silly but you will still have loads of fun and despite the pace slowing at times it makes up for it with the huge fight at the end
Oct 4 2012,positive,love to watch it again and again excellent movie for all
Oct 4 2012,positive,it was funny and action packed great movie
Oct 4 2012,positive,i dont think that this movie couldve been better it was really confusing in the start but youre really in it in the end it hat some really funny moments in the movie and specially mr banner hulk did a really funny entrence i look forward to the next movie coming
Oct 4 2012,positive,perfect just perfect wouldnt change anything
Oct 4 2012,positive,whedon impressively manages to give attention to 8 primary characters when the movie deals with humor and interpersonal banter its fun and enjoyable when it deals with action and emotion it is uninteresting and false
Oct 4 2012,positive,this movie is awesome
Oct 4 2012,positive,nice action scenes  i like this movie
Oct 4 2012,positive,one of the best marvel movies everi loved it
Oct 4 2012,positive,in 2008 audiences everywhere were thrilled by iron man a smart funny and exciting superhero film that knew exactly what its audience wanted but what really made audiences go wild was samuel l jacksons appearance in the end credits as nick fury talking about the avenger initiative since then marvel has released a slew of films that all tie in to the same universe including captain america thor the incredible hulk and iron man 2 while all of those films were good none was able to match the charisma of the first iron man when the avengers was inevitably announced two possibilities arose either marvel films would return to iron man glory or the steady decline of quality mixed with the excess of characters would create an absolute train wreck  the avengers doesnt waste time bringing you in to the story and it makes no effort to introduce the main characters to you it assumes youve already seen the origin films and chances are if you are seeing the avengers you have still for a new viewer this may make the first 20 minutes of the film awkward and confusing in the first five minutes we meet an alien race called the chitauri are shown the tesseract which is an energy cube that is capable of destroying the entire planet and meet the villain loki who has come to earth via portal if you arent marvel savvy these are the kinds of things that will confound you in the beginning    read the full review at 
Oct 4 2012,positive,tom hiddleston is an enticing loki robert downey jr doesnt just play tony stark he is tony stark mark ruffalo takes the hulk to a new level scarlett johansson returns as a badass black widow i love this movie the actors are completely invested and i cant think of any weak links joss whedon king of nerds does not disappoint this is quite frankly the best movie ive ever seen
Oct 4 2012,positive,great but too much drama
Oct 4 2012,positive,great action and plot i cant blink or i will miss something type of movie
Oct 4 2012,positive,fan boy dream come true
Oct 4 2012,positive,im sorry but this film is but a action movie that failed in the narrative section for me i was hoping for a marvel story that took itself a lot more seriously a lot of the humor in this film was misplaced and some of the plot items did not really settle well with me overall a mediocre action movie for me
Oct 3 2012,positive,this is my favorite movie it has everything action comedy drama everything anybody could want
Oct 3 2012,positive,can watch this movie over and over 
Oct 3 2012,positive,possible the best superhero mash up of all time if not then it is one of the first it is very hard not to like this film you got the following heroes     iron man my favorite   black widow girl in leather like all the other girls  captain america cough nerd sorry i meant to say nerd  the incredible hulk smash  hawkeye wouldnt even survive the hunger games  thor hes a demigod here    great writing plot and action with very stunning visuals marvels the avengers is one heck of a ride i really enjoyed watching this film and hope the sequel obviously is great and not just thrown to cash in the success
Oct 3 2012,positive,its testament to joss whedons talents that he was able to inject more character development  into a single movie containing four superheroes than any of the four individual movies about one of those superheroes the avengers greatness lies in the relative simplicity of its story and the reliance on the heroes to move that story along in an entertaining but emotional  and often humourous  way the film has three very distinct acts  1 lokis threat is revealed and the avengers are assembled 2 loki makes his move and 3 all hell breaks loose literally all the main heroes get equal screen time and equal chance to shine  bringing their unique talents to the fight  and even the two side heroes hawkeye and black widow get a nice little substory each the avengers really is the payoff the four individual movies promised and it doesnt disappoint  amping the action up to 11 in a finale that the transformers franchise attempted three times and failed at three times awesome
Oct 3 2012,positive,one of my new favs
Oct 3 2012,positive,best superhero movie period
Oct 3 2012,positive,while i enjoyed the avengers i still think it is very overrated a good but definitely not great superhero blockbuster filled with many flaws and dumb dialogue
Oct 3 2012,positive,wish hawkeye and the girl got more screen time but it is a big cast of heros so i understand
Oct 3 2012,positive,an entertaining movie that has nothing going on beneath the surface
Oct 3 2012,positive,loved this moviebut not as much as batman
Oct 3 2012,positive,loved it and funny never watched the other characters besides iron man now i want to see the other movies
Oct 3 2012,positive,a fresh rating wellearned iron man and cap are the best
Oct 3 2012,positive,a great movie compendium deriving from previous multiple marvel films a great movie for all
Oct 3 2012,positive,really good really funny  i didnt have high expectations because i thought it would be too much but it couldve been a better balance really fun and awesome
Oct 3 2012,positive,best superhero movie yet
Oct 3 2012,positive,great super hero movie
Oct 3 2012,positive,best action super hero movie of all time 
Oct 3 2012,positive,ok this worked especially the ending
Oct 3 2012,positive,would have been a very better movie if the talks werent so exausting final scenes are really really good worth the long waiting 
Oct 3 2012,positive,in my taste of action movies the theme is off though some of the details arent so bas
Oct 3 2012,positive,a fun summer movie loved the pairings of the leads
Oct 3 2012,positive,by far my favourite super hero movie
Oct 3 2012,positive,proper enjoyed this film it was gripping i bought the box set which included thor  captain america and im glad i didnt watch avengers before watching them two first as it wouldve been a waste of time was a brilliant storyline though and having it bring back characters from the previous films which werent quite as good is what made the film and brought the characters together  cant quite understand how thor got back to earth though since they blew the bridge in thor  marvels best character has to be iron man though i think cobie smulders did a fantastic job especially if your a follower of himym then its good to see her in something else doing something quite different to the norm    was disappointed to see that ed norto wasnt the hulk but mark ruffalo did a good job of it  a must see 
Oct 3 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever it has an unforgettable story and suprising humor
Oct 3 2012,negative,crap brilliant effects and sound but still crap
Oct 3 2012,positive,this movie is a comedy superhero rock starthe amazing visual effects the awesome attitude of tony stark the awesome hulkand the funnylooking villain these all things make this an awesome movieand a billionaire
Oct 3 2012,positive,great movie for a sequel to all of them
Oct 3 2012,positive,this movie is nothing short of satisfactory awesome cast i love how they brought back almost all the original cast members from their own movies into one great movie only con about it is they changed hulks character again
Oct 3 2012,positive,full of actioneffects are awesome
Oct 3 2012,positive,exhilarating visually superb thoroughly acted and actionpacked the avengers is one of the greatest actionhero films in recent years
Oct 2 2012,neutral,weak weak weak  havent seen thor but captain america was a weak movie as in keeping your interest  story doesnt flow smoothly  avenger is just a loud exploding mess of superheroes  like transformers 2  iron man 1 and 2 are the best of the group  rdjr is the only thing saving this movie
Oct 2 2012,positive,the hulks oneliners and iron mans snarkyness make the movie  the action sequences are very well done but drag on a bit  per usual samuel l jackson is so foul
Oct 2 2012,positive,one of my favorites why great cinematography especially the plan style scene during the invasion acting was fantastic with even better chemistry with the characters the film just pulled together so well in all areas yes the story can be predictable but usually a heros journey structure is also the movie has explosions and people assume it is a michael bay film what else do you want when a city is being invaded puppies some need to get off the high horse and realize how films are made
Oct 2 2012,positive,good a lot of action and fighting
Oct 2 2012,positive,awesome action packed  definetly lives up to hype also a comic relief
Oct 2 2012,positive,probably the best movie ever  it
Oct 2 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Oct 2 2012,positive,liked it but didnt love it robert downey jr and mark ruffalo were the best but i like them in anything a fun mindless superhero movie

Oct 2 2012,positive,pewny god awesome movie
Oct 2 2012,positive,loved this movie can watch this a zillion times over
Oct 2 2012,positive,a really good marvel film it is a action packed blast
Oct 2 2012,positive,great but not brilliant  there was no real point in the film being in 3d ive seen it in both 2 and 3  a good start to an avengers franchise so ill look forward to the followup
Oct 2 2012,positive,this was great i have watched it three times so far i am going to watch it again
Oct 2 2012,positive,at least half an hour too long and the avengers fighting as one are underused but that aside and youve got a visual treat with tom hiddlestons performance to steel the show
Oct 2 2012,neutral,in order to understand the situation of my review ill clear some things up i saw this on a regular movie screen no 3d and no imax so maybe i wasnt fully engrossed in this film due to the medium i chose to view it in but lets cut the crap if a movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and imax sized screens to be totally awesome bruh it was never that solid to begin with that being said lets analyze the film shall we so here is the main problems with the avengers as a whole it relies too much action with too little meaning what did i expect though right well i expected something a little less cookie cutter than this  if transformers is a bad movie which it is and far worse than this for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to the avengers is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason god bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service there is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much star wars prequelsequse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as a team its just an obvious film  the avengers isnt irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly colby slomders of how i met your mother fame proves she can probably take a stab at being an action heroine on her own project and mark ruffalos take on the hulk impressed me the action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the film  at the end of the day i think the film was too much bang and not enough buck as i was leaving a gentlemen was talking to his wife and said i thought there would be a lot less talking my inner monologue rebutted wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched but this is what it is if you are a fan of superhero movies youll probably love this if you are fan of things that blow up and implode youll probably love this too fans of focused films with a little more story and character development maybe a risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way i do about it  my one sentence summary of the avengers 2 and half hours of nonspecific escapism i that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then i recommend it if not id pass or wait for a rental
Oct 2 2012,positive,as much as everybody said they loved this movie i still would only watch it once
Oct 2 2012,positive,great superhero flick good storyline and special effects  two thumbs up
Oct 2 2012,positive,brought all those super heroes into one giant movie and it didnt fall apart job well done
Oct 2 2012,positive,if you saw the trailer you know what the last 20 minutes of the this movie is  if you want to see a better movie watch iron man thor or captain america
Oct 2 2012,positive,sooo much fun to watch watching all the prequels is a must though
Oct 2 2012,positive,awesome movie  keeps you on the edge of your seat

Oct 1 2012,positive,the best movie ever
Oct 1 2012,positive,simply put the best superhero movie of all time hands down
Oct 1 2012,positive,i saw this movie with my 13 year old daughter and was pleasantly surprised im more of a drama movie person but there was so much going on that it held my attention great flick
Oct 1 2012,positive,absolutely awesome movie from start to finish could watch this 1000 times and never get tired of it
Oct 1 2012,positive,i loved seeing all those characters
Oct 1 2012,positive,hands down one of the greatest movies i have ever watched  characters nailed story terrific nonstop action  joss wheadon youve done it again  serenitynow
Oct 1 2012,negative,i did not enjoy this very much i usually like these kind of movies but this one was just beyond lame archery is not a super power scarlett johansson is not special either it was weird and stupid that there were like 0 casualties there should have been lots of bloody dying screaming people im amazed by how many people really liked this for real amazed
Oct 1 2012,positive,not only is this the best superhero movie ever but this is one of the best action movies ever
Oct 1 2012,positive,awesome funny and brilliant cast
Oct 1 2012,positive,awesome especially when hulk slings lokey around lokey i think is thors adopted bro
Oct 1 2012,neutral,i really liked thor and with all the good reviews i was really looking forward to seeing this movie too   the villain in avengers was loci from thor a character i liked  maybe not the best character in thor but i thought the conflict in him whether he wanted to be a villain by wiping out the frostgiants or whether he wanted to be a good guy like when he killed the leader of the frostgiants after he invited him to kill his sleeping father was fascinating  however what we got in avengers was a loci that was the stereotypical villain only  the plot was very boring and predictable too  i am only marginally reccommending this movie because the action is good and robert downey jr gives his usual strong performance as iron man
Oct 1 2012,positive,great shootitup fun with a stellar cast makes this marvels best film to date
Oct 1 2012,positive,absolutely brilliant great comedy but still able to be taken seriously storyline absolutely well done
Oct 1 2012,positive,its everything a superhero movie should be and so much more
Oct 1 2012,positive,you have to suspend disbelief for a superhero movie anyhow but the flying aircraft carrier is jumping the shark a little too muchotherwise good movie
Oct 1 2012,positive,good movie but hunger games was better
Oct 1 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seena must c
Oct 1 2012,positive,nothing new here guys lots of shit blowing up lots of iron man lots of the same ol stuff over and over again
Oct 1 2012,neutral,very mediocrenot a great story or action
Oct 1 2012,positive,an amazing movie great lead up linking up with all the separate movies  im glad they didnt rush the story awesome movie if you havent seen it go watch it 
Oct 1 2012,positive,absolutely love the hulk puny god lmao
Oct 1 2012,positive,this movie was one of those rare instances of piling a bunch of standalone characters together in one movie and still being able to make each and every one of them shine with a coherent plot i might add
Oct 1 2012,neutral,heroheros boombooms there it ok
Oct 1 2012,positive,in itself this is a fantastic film but it manages this because of its past the movies that followed before help set up much of the backstory so there isnt any real time wasted on explaining things its a luxury most movies do not have  and being the first film to really have a team of superheroes avengers gets an automatic induction into awesomeness helped by some spectacular setpieces   but dont be fooled its actually pretty hollow and there are numerous strange plotholes the films sheer momentum gloss over these and it deserves all the praise it got yet a sequel will expose these shortfalls and the avengers might be the highwater mark for this franchise
Oct 1 2012,positive,hilarious exciting and a lot of fun the avengers goes above and beyond the average blockbuster
Oct 1 2012,negative,terrible i dont understand why superhero movies are so popular this movie sucked big time
Oct 1 2012,positive,loved every party action comedy love the movie literally has every thing you could ever want from a movie
Oct 1 2012,positive,avengers not a good a the hype a bit to long saved by the hulk
Oct 1 2012,positive,i love this movie
Sep 30 2012,positive,love love love this
Sep 30 2012,positive,loved this movie full of action
Sep 30 2012,positive,after taking some time away from the movie  revisiting it on dvdbluray  it has first act pacing issues there is friction between characters for no reason they just start off that way lame alien bad guys are a macguffin that never actually feel that threatening were just told they want to conquer earth  thor was excellent but his journey in the first movie is useless and completely wasted because his relationship in this movie with loki is incredibly different they dont feel like brothers they feel like james bond  blofeld   i could go on but the thing is this movie dispite all of its flaws is fucking fun its pretty clever as far as dialogue play is concerned  the camera work is awesome the characters are great and loveable driven by a very strong cast  id watch a 2nd avengers i just hope we spend more time with the characters battling a worthy opponent
Sep 30 2012,positive,some apparent weaknesses in the plot but the witty dialogue and the well directed action scenes still make this a worthwhile watch 85100
Sep 30 2012,positive,awesome movie must own
Sep 30 2012,positive,great movie one i will buy
Sep 30 2012,positive,best movie of the year

Sep 30 2012,negative,lost interest in this kiddy film very quickly
Sep 30 2012,positive,a pretty good movie  the action and effects were amazing but the story line wasnt that great it almost seemed like they tried to jam everything in there

Sep 30 2012,positive,it was ok better than the franchise films the characters are assembled from enjoyable couple of hours had
Sep 30 2012,positive,my bros and my childhood crush the marvels super heroes 
Sep 30 2012,positive,this movie is what it is i have heard people say they hated and and being over critical of it but the reasons they presented for hating it were ridiculous mostly being points about plots and dialouge the movie puts together a fantastic cast of   rober downey junior ironman chris hemsworth thor chris evans captain america mark ruffalo the hulk jeremy rennor hawkeye and scarlett johansson black widow ie eye candy that doesnt have to be saved every five minutes michael bay im looking at you  it sets itself up quite early were your ineveitably going to end up with a big face off between good and evil and as the action in this film goes top notch so if you enjoy action superheroes and a bit of comedy it is a fantastic watch if your going to question the dialouge essentially witty banter among all of the superheroes dont bother go read a book ensure its not a graphic novel as you may fall into the same pitfall
Sep 30 2012,positive,oh yes vengeance is indeed oh so sweet in the second half granted these people arent entirely clear on who in the world theyre actually exacting vengeance for though its a safe bet that theyre avenging the poor victims of sick evildoers like jeremiah chechik sure other than the title and having a redhead in a cat suit chechiks the avengers has pretty much nothing in common with this film though it nevertheless pretty much tainted this films name which is probably why the brits the people who did the tv show upon which checkniks flop is based titled this film avengers assemble and why plenty of people including rotten tomatoes in the states make good and sure to distinguish this film by suddenly refering to it as umarvelsu the avengers personally i think that this films title probably should have been wwe presents the real world marvel ultimate universe and for all i know that may very well have been the original title shoot forget crossover between some of the latest marvel films with all of the brawling and bickering going on this film is more like a crossover between reality tv and professional wrestling only much better not just because everyones likable or because so much is welldone but because this film doesnt mess around and lets you know that its world isnt real were talking about aliens a super solider a god of thunder some dude who turns into a green muscle monster when stressed then evidently subsequently changes into a different person seriously how many people are they gonna get to play bruce banner and a as tony stark himself put it genius billionaire playboy philanthropist in an armored battle suit and last time i checked the titluar leadss exhusband from the new adventures of old christine and robin scherbatsky from how i met your mother wow these films casting director must love cbs sitcoms as highranking agents for a highly advanced peacekeeping organization is farfetched enough though at least all of this overthetop stuff have sure made for some enjoyable films both by their own rights except ang lees hulk and when theyre all together still as good as this film is its not quite umarveluous get it being unable to avenge the bite that it should have had and goes struck down by quite a few factors    clocking in at 143 minutes the film provides more than enough time to flesh itself out yet the problem is that when i say that this film provides more than enough time i mean more than enough as this film goes excessively padded out not by filler but by way too much material and material thats often rather bland the films expository aspects and by extension the film itself are at their most flawed during the immediate development segment which has occasions in which it slapdashes certrain crucial pieces of story establishment and exposition thors means of arrival to earth is ever so briefly mentioned and the point in which thor comes to fully recognize the avengers as his allies is hardly even touched upon it gets that messy thus creating an awkwardness that goes bested only by the awkwardness found within the early acts much more prominent flaw of ironically providing too much exposition to where things drag on and on and get to be repetitious as well as even a bit bland and its made all the worse by the films taking on a dry atmosphere that all but dulls things down dont get me wrong with all of its having spots that hit lower than others this film is ceaselessly at worst quite good so of course the early act isnt too terribly problematic or bland yet the damage that it deals to the momentum of the film still stands and firmly enough to where after a while the film nearly lost me only to quickly pick up at its body though not take off too far for although the body of the film is particularly strong and grows more so as it progresses it all too often continues to be nearblandly overexpository and excessively overdrawn not to where the film falls too short yet to where just about every particularly high if not allout excellent spot in the film finds itself undercut by the more prevalent extended periods of relative blandness that both slow down momentum and remind you of this storys not having as much sweep as the film would like something that goes underemphasized is the fact that this films scope is surprisingly minimalist isolating all of the many things that it has to cover within a timeframe of just barely over 48 hours and in that timeframe and with subject matter such as this you cant do much so this film was always doomed to fall short of truly marvelous marvel pun not intended that time which isnt to say that the it doesnt try tackling its limited subject matter with inspiration and depth though perhaps too much as ive said time and again this film delivers on too much exposition for its own good and before you know it a film that should clock in at just under two hours clocks in at just under twoandahalf hours and goes overblown with too much ambitiondriven depth that contradicts the intentions of the minimalist subject matter to where you really do see the fine line between depth and mere blockbuster entertainment and to where the film often gets to be almost awkwardly overambitious thus pronouncing the limitations in bite within the story even more im not gonna lie i was going in with not simply high hopes but high expectations and at times this film does in fact meet expectations yet those truly remarkable moments stand few and far between and divided by long periods in which this film finds itself limping along until the final product finally falls short of its potential for excellence that being said this film doesnt fall too short of its potential for although the film has its shortcomings and just enough for it to be not much more than adequately rewarding the fact of the matter is that it does reward delivering more often than not on what it should while never ceasing to deliver on a stylistic level    seamus mcgarveys photography is handomely defined in its lighting and color to where it breathes both livliness and even a degree of grit the atmosphere of the film while quite a few nifty or even grand shots supplement a sense of sweep that nearly takes your breath away at times much like the films more technical aspects yet another highly intricate and seamless testament to the magic of modern filmmaking technology this films visual effects range from phenomenal to something youve to see to believe fitting into this environment very convincingly to where it helps you in buying into this world while boasting dynamicity and livliness that dazzles especially during the action sequences during which this film particularly accels the photography visual effects and other production and technical aspects are all remarkable by their own individual rights yet when it all comes together in the heat of battle the film is nothing short of golden as each action sequence is so brilliantly dynamic and grandly wellexecuted being quite wellconcieved and very wellstaged in a fashion thats nothing short of spectacular which isnt to say that there arent pieces of action that are more phenomenal than others when action comes into play it goes on and on until by the time we come to this films final act we are left facing ceaseless action and really i wouldnt have it any other way because by that point the film fulfills its duties as an upstanding piece of blockbuster spectacle as youd be hard pressed to not find yourself hooting and hollering during well any action sequence especially the one that occupies this films lengthy climax the film is a blockbuster and a generally entertaining one going held back by its problematic thematic unevenness and even then its not like the substance that all too often blands up this stylish film of only so much conceptual bite is too problematic for although the story isnt especially powerful it remains generally strong as joss whedon reminds you through his screenplay alone delivering on sparkling dialogue and sharp humor as well as many a colorful set piece as for the depth within this film i feel as though the flaws within its incorporation lay more within whedons direction than his screenplay for although the script provides perhaps too much exposition to where things get to be a bit exhaustingly overblown and disconcertingly contradictory to this story concepts limited weight the fact of the matter is that there is plenty of depth within this film something that you cant say as much as you should about too many films of this type and while i wish this film had more scope to it to back up that depth whedon provides inspired characterization and story fleshout that establishes intrigue and yes even emotional resonance whedons script has its faults yet keeps consistently colorful with wit and lively set pieces that supplement entertainment value as well as much fleshout and resonance that supplement the story with more substance than it probably should have yet either way just enough substance for you to find yourself intrigued while what leaves this films substance to not simply intrigue but compel is the execution of joss whedons script by well joss whedon as director    joss whedon goes into this project with ambition and too much of it to where he taints his worthy vision overambition to make worse the awkwardness spawned from certain flaws in whedons direction which regardless of how i make it sound really isnt too terribly flawed in the long run or at least not when you compare upon weighing in the strengths within whedons direction for although the strengths within whedons direction all too often go undercut by the films natural and directorial shortcomings whedon generally backs up his ambitions with a colorful atmosphere that breathes life into the consistent if not nearceaseless entertainment value of this film yet not at the expense of an inspired atmosphere that goes primarily powered by depth and intrigue a problem that has held back  occasionally to the state of underwhelmingness  the precursors to this film as well as other superhero films of this type is a lack of depth yet with this film theres too much depth to where the final products thematic intentions are rendered a bit fuzzy and to where things get to be a bit too bland at times and that is what keeps this film from being truly excellent and yet at the same time this films depth  a bit overbearing at times though it may  is a large part of why the final product comes close to excellence as whedon crafts a generally compelling atmosphere to make all the sharper the entertaining story and of course the characterization which goes sharpened further by the performers behind the characters tom hiddleston stands out among this cast for although his loki character is lacking in the depth that made him a sympathetic antagonist in thor hiddleston compensates by portraying the dark depths within loki with such slick charisma and effectiveness that he earns your investment in him as a highly effective antagonist just as if not more sharply than he did in thor still although hiddlestone stands out most everyone has his or her time in the sun with former secondary characters returning in bigger roles and therefore with more material that the performers behind them play up sharply with clark gregg jeremy renner and especially samuel l jackson charming immensely while the always stunning scarlett johansson now a bonafide lead rather than the justthere secondary that she was in iron man 2 relies on more than just her darn good look delivering on charisma and at times even emotional range and depth that defines the mysterious natasha black widow romanoff and leaves johansson to also stand out though not quite as much as her other leads the people we have seen deliver before and are really here to see which isnt to say that all of the faces were eager to see are familiar edward norton may have had little to work with in the incredible hulk but mark ruffalo is still stepping into the shoes of one of the greatest actors alive so of course theres a sense of longing for norton to go with the initial shock towards the offputting recast yet it doesnt take long at all before ruffalo comes into his own and becomes bruce banner through his assured capturing of the distinct colorful and emotional depths that define the character thus leaving ruffalo to as predicted comfortably fall right into the crowd and stand as worthy in the presence of the more experienced primary members of this starstudded cast of transformative talents all of whom are as sharp as they were when we were first introduced to them as the characters they so effortlessly became the thor character returns as a more relatively human and both literally and figuratively downtoearth yet still powerful force that chris hemsworth once again nails with a powerfully charming yet still somewhat emotionallyinvolved presence and steve captain america rogers returns as a tainted yet noble and more authoritative force that chris evans nails with a charismatic and confident presence while tony iron man stark returns as the sameoldsameold which is just the way i like it seeing as how robert downey jr once again portrays the character with such effortlessly explosive charisma by their own rights each performer is as if not more engaging than youd expect and make their charisma all the sharper through crackling chemistry that helps perhaps the most in making this ensemble as sharp as it is and goes into the big batch of strengths that sadly dont have enough momentum behind them to punch this film out of shortcomings and into genuine excellence yet still power this film enough to bring it close to excellence because when its all said and done this film hits much more often than not and ultimately rewards as a strong blockbuster experience even if it does stand to have a bit more bite to it    to assemble get it a wrapup the film is blandly overexpository and disconcertingly overambitious with excessive material that doesnt quite gel with this minimalist subject matter thus creating a kind of awkward thematic unevenness and drag factor that sadly stand as just prevalent enough to leave this final product to fall short of bonafide excellence though just barely as this film is rarely if ever any worse than quite good with quite a few truly remarkable high points backed up by incredible action  complimented by fine photography and phenomenal visual effects  and a script that delivers on clever color and intriguing if not rather resonant depth brought to life by joss whedons inspired direction and a sparklingly charismatic cast from which effective antagonist tom hiddlestone and leads scarlett johansson mark ruffalo chris hemsworth chris evans there are more chrises than bruce banners and chrisi mean robert downey jr stand out and  with the help of crackling chemistry  go into making wwe presents the real wori mean marvels the avengers evidently marvels is part of the title an often entertaining sometimes resonant and thoroughly enjoyable ensemble blockbuster    35  good

Sep 29 2012,positive,the best movie of all time hopefully they can top it on the 2nd go around
Sep 29 2012,positive,what a great movie  totally fun
Sep 29 2012,positive,yes the avengers is fun and epic but its story is a bit too cartoonish and simple for me to ever consider it the greatest superhero movie of all time though i had a ton of blast seeing all of those superheroes come together and fight to save the earth
Sep 29 2012,positive,when im old this will be a classic
Sep 29 2012,positive,havent  seen a film ive enjoyed that much for a long long time  if youve not seem it watch it

Sep 29 2012,positive,much better than i expected
Sep 29 2012,positive,wow they over did there self on this movie well ploted and great action best action hero movie to date
Sep 29 2012,positive, such an entertaining film just as good the 3rd time around   very entertainingenjoyed it just as much the 2nd time and really got a kick out of loki   this one was very entertaining whedon did a good job of balancing the multiple characters  ruffalohulk0 and downey jr were the standouts  check it out
Sep 29 2012,positive,not bad but not as good as iron man 1  rdjr is as good as always with hulk getting the other good bits
Sep 29 2012,positive,love it it was funny and cool
Sep 29 2012,positive,i love the great comedy and exciting action in this movie i know i will watch it several times
Sep 29 2012,neutral,watch the film for its sensational special effects certainly not for the embarrassing performances of the cast the actors dont even make an attempt to act with any sort of human realism at all its horribly overacted and like every other major blockbuster has to have sexual implications on an attractive female role johansson it seems like very few people with real respect for film would by into this nonsense other for the admittedly great progress in special effects department but honestly it seems that sexual implications and over the top special effects are taking over the role of storytelling in films more and more and worrying about the future of cinema is a reasonable response
Sep 29 2012,positive,i liked it but it was to long if they could have cut at least almost an hour out of it it would have been better but the action sequences were really entertaining and imaginative
Sep 29 2012,positive,a thoroughly enjoyable and humorous blockbuster that richly gathers from both its source material and previous cinematic incantations to full audiencedragging affect
Sep 29 2012,positive,while thoroughly enjoyable and exactly what you would expect from a whedon film the writing deviates from the build up of characters from previous movies and thus detracts from the whole story still much fun and humor throughout to make it enjoyable for anyone will be interesting to see how the characters develop throughout the future films
Sep 29 2012,positive,gods from the norse mythology and the american superheros weird combination 
Sep 29 2012,positive,great movie the hulk stole the show powerful funny with an action packed adventure best two plus hours i had this weekend wow
Sep 29 2012,positive,honestly the best movie of 2012 probably in 20 years it may become something of a cult scifi clasic
Sep 29 2012,positive,with the avengers i had a simple request for marvel dont reinvent the wheel just give us the biggest boldest and possible best superhero movie ever id say marvel lived up to that request    joss whedon was given the responsibility of a lifetime to write and direct this pinnacle of marvels first stage all things being considered he did an unbelievable job while the story follows a very familiar arc its the writing and the action that boost this movie    the movie is at its very best in the dialogue scenes here whedons talents as a writer shine like the scenes between loki and all the separate members of the avengers whedon writes a good amount of wit into the movie spicing up to the dialogue    the story is mostly about the fight for the tesseract shild has the tesseract and want to use it to make sustainable energy all until loki comes back to earth and takes the tesseract for himself with it he will reopen the portal to space and bring in his chitauri army he plans to conquer the earth because we were made to be ruled nick fury will have none of it though and assembles a team iron man captain america thor hulk hawkeye and black widow the movie runs to a sensational climax from there    robert downey jr reprises his role as tony starkiron man in this movie full of big names downey is clearly the star his tony stark is an amazing character and downey plays him to perfection this movie also allows for some of the drama with the character that we saw in the first iron man movie    chris evens plays steve rogerscaptain america he may be my favorite avenger steve is good to the core and a man determined to serve his country evens plays the manoutoftime and he is terrific taking the character to new places    chris hemsworth returns as thor of course every member of the cast nails their part but hemsworth is just without question thor i couldnt imagine anyone else playing this character as well as he does he has some great moments    mark ruffalo takes over the role of bruce bannerhulk his version of the character is just fine ruffalo actually plays banner very well but one of the things i really hate about sequels is when they replace actors we had a whole movie to form an attachment to ed nortons banner when you replace him with a different actor you lose that attachment everything ruffalo does in this movie could have been done by norton wish he stayed with the franchise but ruffalo fills his shoes well    jeremy renner and scarlett johansson play the shield assassins hawkeye and black widow renner is sadly underused but when he does show up he makes a good impression black widow is much better in this movie then she was in iron man 2 she has a purpose johansson shows how good she can be with the character    and lastly tom hiddleston knocks it out of the park as loki as good as he was in thor he is even better here hiddleston brings it all to the table menace intelligence immaturity and even humor    as for the action it keeps getting better and better the opening actions scene is not impressive at all and lokis entrance falls flat but as the movie goes along the action matures the helicarrier scene is amazing followed by the showstopping new york fight scene this finale fight is far too easy for our heros though but i think of it like this all the avengers fought their match in their separate movies so this final scene was like a reward for sticking with these characters for so long it shows just how good these heros can work together sure i would have like the stakes to be higher but im not complaining    overall this team of heros almost pulls off the perfect movie they wouldve if the ending wasnt so tidy but the movie gives fans a whole lot of good things i mean who didnt want to see thor fight hulk or thor iron man and captain america fight i am extremely excited for stage two of marvels universe and definitely for the avengers 2 thankfully being directed once again by joss whedon    theres only one god maam and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that 9510
Sep 29 2012,positive,the star wars of a new generation
Sep 29 2012,positive,spoilers whether you enjoyed it or not and judging by its percentage most people did its hard to argue that the avengers was probably the most ambitious superhero movie ever dkr a close second since it broke the 3rd movie trend of sucking with 5 movies leading up to this ensemble movie of superheroes i was very concerned about the films ability to balance its characters story and action but with joss whedon at the wheel this massive undertaking of a project navigated through dangerous waters with ease with a simple enough story  but large enough threat plenty of time was spent on these characters and their interactions and many fanboys got to enjoy them fighting one another also we also finally got the perfect hulk in the form of mark ruffalo who managed to play bruce banner as awkward and geeky yes it was disappointing that hawkeye was evil for half of the movie and that all of the aliens conveniently died when the mother ship was blown up but these are only small problems for me in the long run i really couldnt have asked for a better vehicle movie for all of these characters to be in  and it was also funny as hell
Sep 29 2012,positive,best movie of 2012 so far havent watched batman yet though
Sep 29 2012,positive,this movie is awesome
Sep 29 2012,positive,best comic booksuperhero movie ever made joss whedon showed how it should be done and exactly where chris nolan can stick his gritty realism and movies that arent truly batman movies joss is the most talented person ever in the filmtv industry glad to see hes finally getting his due in a large scale instead of merely a cult one
Sep 29 2012,positive,yeah as some of you guys know im obsessed with this movie
Sep 29 2012,positive,exciting epic fun great action characters acting writing and mindblowing visuals all of which is in the avengers
Sep 29 2012,positive,a cracking superhero film that makes great use of all its characters and comes across as one of the best american action films let alone superhero films of the last decade alone from the mesmerizing opening shot to the pictureperfect performances of mark ruffalo and robert downey jr to the climactic and brilliant ensemble action sequence this is an example of how a summer blockbuster should be done and if there is a sequel it has a job topping this one
Sep 29 2012,positive,really liked the hulk in this film the witty exchange between stark and banner is classic good action cannot wait to see avengers 2
Sep 29 2012,positive,i cant really make up my mind about this id read the reviews so was prepared for it to have more humour i saw that it had an xmen feel to it although id suggest it was more of an iron man 3 i had 2 big problems with it 1st all the technology etc where is the human link its like the whole movie was set onboard a spaceship consisting of superheros and super villains in the end they did come down to earth but i do miss that superman style helicopter in one arm and a civilian in the other with a crowd below gasping in disbelief instead i was treated to some pretty absorbing action scenes that make use of all the superheros for effect of variation my 2nd problem is with the hulk his series of movies are not running smoothly its like the character of the hulk changes with every movie he is in and in this one he has more control over his abilities and can change into the hulk any time he chooses and has more awareness as to who are freinds and who are foes i prefer the sadder more lonely hulk
Sep 29 2012,positive,the super flick of the year it amazes me on how joss whedon managed to strike balance among the likes of loki nick fury thor captain america iron man black widow hawkeye and hulk the best ensemble superhero movie yet
Sep 29 2012,positive,excellent movie loved it so much i watched it again
Sep 29 2012,positive,good movie overall slow story to develop in the beginning and the story line wasnt the best but i enjoyed the idea of all the superheros coming together to save the earth why is it always ny city that we save
Sep 29 2012,positive,was really really good
Sep 29 2012,positive,if youre a comicstrip fan then its your party and if not still the movie can entertain you with all its superheros and the good point is you dont have to sit and watch a lot of each hero overall the action scenes are fascinating i wish i could watch it on imax or 3d and the dialogues between the superheros are wellwritten and funny kind of cheap humor but still laughable
Sep 29 2012,positive,if you see a splat in the reviews for this movie its simply because that person was watching a genre that theyre not interested in and really has no business critiquing it whatsoever  it would be like me watching yentl and complaining that it lacked normally proportioned noses and kunffu fight scenes this film rocked
Sep 29 2012,positive,funny at times acting is fair some original action sequences and some weve seen before but the uninspired resurrection of an already bvillain and then tacking on some lame alien horde for 15mins during the climax felt forced not to mention the overall lack of depth or heart in any of the characters left the film feeling hollow avengers take note of chris nolan and his dark knight trilogy
Sep 28 2012,positive,sheer perfection xd
Sep 28 2012,positive,the rare superhero movie where the dialogue and character development match if not surpass its action setpieces if nothing else whedon gets credit for making a movie featuring the hulk that is actually enjoyable to watch
Sep 28 2012,positive,extremely well handled and well written
Sep 28 2012,positive,a good movie that is nonstop action half way through the movie on
Sep 28 2012,positive,the avengersflat out rocks all the stars from marvels past movies including iron man captain america thor and hulk as well as all of their allies are here for one of the biggest fights since optimus prime and his team took on the decepticons in the third transformers its an awesome and hilarious thrill ride every marvel fan needs to see
Sep 28 2012,negative,i had a hard time getting into this when all of the characters are seemingly invincible
Sep 28 2012,positive,what can i say this is the quintessential superhero that fanboys and fangirls have been waiting for from beginning to end this movie delivered great action sequences a couple funny moments and a stellar cast really made the avengers arguably the best superhero movie of 2012 hats off to joss whedon for creating a masterpiece for millions of people to enjoy
Sep 28 2012,positive,a good film  good effect  good actor and funny   all the best
Sep 28 2012,positive,it was a pretty good movie
Sep 28 2012,positive,comic book geeks stand tall this movie is for you earths mightiest heroes unite as the evil loki invades earth with alien army joss whedon does a very good job to bring the comic book legends to the big screen plenty of story and great action you dont want to miss this
Sep 28 2012,positive,soooo dope truly it is a 910 that seems so much better than 455  the personalities clashing in various scenes as well as coming together for battle utter perfection lokis character is surprisingly awesome and well done iron man is clearly the majority favorite and always entertains but hulk steals the show you are a pitiful creature i am a god aaand smash smash smash smash hahaha by far one of my most favorite movie moments of all time  the movie would have perfect with less black widow  scarlett johansons acting always makes me itch outside of chick flicks  this movie is fantastic now we wait for im3 avengers 2  many other treats ant man
Sep 28 2012,positive,love when hulk hits thor
Sep 28 2012,positive,a highly intense comic book film bringing forth four very renown super heroes into one actionpacked movie ends with a bang and keeps the humor to the least bit fresh
Sep 28 2012,negative,for me is badvery bad muy aburrida
Sep 28 2012,positive,unreal i got chills spoiler alert sorta when they teamed up towards the end i am not a comic book guy but have grown up watching all the shows and movies this was perfect
Sep 28 2012,positive,finally took this one in and it was pretty entertaining definitely some great action sequences and robert downey doesnt disappoint check it out if you havent already
Sep 28 2012,negative,im giviing this 1 star even though its about a 4 star moviemarvel once again gives us a budget cut film ann cheap skates us out of what should have been an epic fightthor vs hulk avengers vs hulkhopefully they stop budget cutting and make the next one longergood movie that  could have been greatmarvelstop pulling punches the 1 star is because marvel is getting praised on half ass movies geared towards the main stream fans more than the hardcore ones
Sep 28 2012,positive,wonderful my boyfriend is obsessed with it and now so am i
Sep 28 2012,positive,brest movie awesome effects  a must see

Sep 28 2012,positive,best action movie of all time  as in all marvel movies it is filled with high intensity scenes humor and a great plot that is very detail oriented
Sep 28 2012,neutral,the beginning started slow and the only parts i liked was when the hulk my fav punches thor and then when the hulk picked up loki and smashed him like he was literally a rag doll
Sep 28 2012,positive,superb special fx  heart pounding action  wonderfully acted and all joined together with brilliant screenwriting  a must see for all
Sep 28 2012,positive,pure awesome ironman is the best
Sep 28 2012,positive,i agree a spectacle in the grandest sense of the word compelling well written engaging action and likable characters however the two assassins seemed to take away the credibility of the whole group just because they were what they were did not give them enough credibility to live and fight a vastly superior alien army i needed more of a background to support their involvement samuel jackson also seemed an unimportant side plot i could have done without  but i even enjoyed the hulk despite my avoiding him as much as possible as always downey jr was great and as feisty as ever evans as patriotic and a true hero and thor was the power blind god the combination of all them seemed strong since they all held their own rather well and did not lose their individuality during the team work   i was disappointed in the ending where they killed the mother ship and the aliens all died that seemed to have been stolen from enders game   i only wonder if this movie will stand the test of time and become a true classic
Sep 28 2012,positive,this flick was fantastic the diverse characters brilliant fx and witty dialogue were blended perfectly resulting in a classic comic book film
Sep 28 2012,positive,an awesome movie for anyone to see i loved them as a child as i do now and now my children get to enjoy them add much as i did what a fun way to bond with your kids
Sep 28 2012,positive,it was pretty good the problem i had with it was that it was a little too long and drug out but other than that it was a good movie
Sep 28 2012,positive,awesome movie the 3d in this movie was spectacular
Sep 28 2012,positive,mindblowing action sequences
Sep 28 2012,positive,everything u could ever want from an action filmoh and the brilliant robert downey jr to top it off
Sep 28 2012,positive,just superball the heroes were greatespecially iron man
Sep 28 2012,positive,well built action movie for the comic book geek and those who are not into comics cool storyline and good band of heros cant wait till the next one comes out
Sep 28 2012,positive,not as good as i thought it would be
Sep 27 2012,positive,a really really solid attempt at mediocrity the cast is great but everything else is subpar
Sep 27 2012,positive,i saw it in theaters 3 times once was in 3d but i have to say this will never get old i feel like a little kid when i watch this the rush of energy that you feel is so catchy you just cant help cheering the characters on i fell in love with captain america in his own film and this made me love him even more i just love his lines in the movie and his comebacks but i have to say by far the funniest was the hulk in the end beating up loki i watched it first time in the drive in and second at the theater so it was funny to actually hear the audience laugh i knew what was coming and hearing them laugh made it even better the second time finally i cant leave without mentioning loki i know hes the bad guy but i cant help loving him hes so smooth and so charming so confident actor wise he has come a long way i just cant say enough good things about this movie if you love super hero movies then youll love this one
Sep 27 2012,positive,it was ok  the plot was senseless  is the hulk dumb smart  i dont get it  why does captain america look like a gay porn star  i liked the guy with the bow whoever he was
Sep 27 2012,positive,great movie good to see all the super hero in one movie
Sep 27 2012,positive,great movie a must see good for all ages

Sep 27 2012,positive,very good movie cant wait for the next one
Sep 27 2012,positive,very good show need to see it again
Sep 27 2012,positive,this is the insane well acted intelligently written film we superhero fans have been waiting for do not question the power of whedon
Sep 27 2012,neutral,shipments of rough action and visual and sound effects but basically the same predictable story with good ones and bad ones nothing new nothing thrilling
Sep 27 2012,positive,awesome what more could you ask for in a movie i really had my doubts that this would work with all the super heroes but it does quite well actually the hulk has to be the star you actually start to drool in anticipation of his on screen presence okmaybe not but still a real to treat to see some hulk smash the fight scene between hulk and thorepic cast is great all around would like to have seen more of hawkeye but maybe part 2 my only small complaint is the woman shield agent agent hill horrible actress cobie smulders i cringe at her every spoken word my wife said she has a nice body so just mute the television when she speaks and you have yourself a purely entertaining film experience
Sep 27 2012,positive,you get two hours and throw them in a bucket of awesome you pull out the avengers nice one by whedon this one
Sep 27 2012,positive,good movie ready for the next one
Sep 27 2012,positive,overrated  great fun and action but acting except the great robert downey writing and story dumber than the hulk
Sep 27 2012,positive,excellently paced and remarkable action topped off with iron mans sarcasm each character does justice to hisher role making this movie not only one worth seeing but one worth seeing over and over till youve memorized every bit and detail of its existence
Sep 27 2012,positive,really good movie watched it like 3 times at edwards
Sep 27 2012,positive,in this culmination of four years of marvelous pun implied action movies the team of egotist tony starkiron man robert downey jr mighty thor chris hemsworth soldier steve rogerscaptain america chris evans and the laid back until he gets angry bruce bannerthe incredible hulk mark ruffalo have to set aside their differences however many they have and band together to defeat loki tom hiddleston thors revengeriddled brother who has a weapon with the energy to wipe out the whole earth helping the avengers out are natasha romanoffblack widow scarlett johansson clint bartonhawkeye jeremy renner and the alwayscool shield director with only one eye nick fury samuel l jackson    lets get one thing straight to those of you who read this review how few you are i love superhero movies i love marvel always have starting in 2002 when the first spiderman was released and then the marvel universe opened up in 2008 with the tremendous iron man movie which was really impressive cinema including robert downey jr in one of his greatest roles of his career and one of the best roles of 2008 then two later with the iron man sequel another good rendition of action and the whole reason i watch iron man rob downey jrs terrific performance thor came by last year and i must say it was a really great movie a truly underrated movie that has action to spare but however the marvel universe proved it was human when captain america the first avenger came and it was horrible i know many people will disagree with me but i think this was the most boring action movie ever    now with the avengers and three out of four franchises having my approval i was stoked when i heard about the box office records this set and if it werent for jimmy camerons movie about the ten foot tall smurfs from another planet this wouldve been the highest grossing movie oh well    when i watch these movies i watch the acting as i said exclusively on this and other reviews robert downey jr pulls off with a stellar performance as the egomaniacal iron man who is a delight to see onscreen and i for one am stoked for iron man 3 the two chrises hemsworth and evans are both good but i prefer hemsworth myself because i am a fan of heroes with british accents mark ruffalo is surprising as the laid back relaxed calm doctor bruce banner until that is he gets pissed off then he goes apecrap on everything its always nice to see hulk kick some loki butt in the movie oops mild spoilers    i love villains on superhero movies and in this case the familiar loki played by tom hiddleston may not be as amazing as doc ock or the joker or even bane but i must say hiddleston does a good job playing him    director joss whedon is becoming a bit of a rising star in the directorial world he of course cowrote one of my alltime favourite movies toy story he also worked on shows like buffy the vampire slayer and glee for avengers whedon directs this feature with care he doesnt just string a much of action scenes and sexualized images together like another director whom shall not be named cough michael bay cough whedons script is filled with humor and action but he also makes these characters have humanity and real compassion to be thinkingbreathing things instead of just getting their lines from an offscreen prompter like so many action films    the avengers boasts spectacular special effects and ill be happy if come oscar time that a movie like this finally wins visual effects    with fun action a great ensemble cast good score by alan silvestri and spectaular visual effects while this film isnt perfect it boasts great fun for everyone even if you are not a marvelsuperhero fan    12 out of   final verdict 94
Sep 27 2012,positive,one of the best superhero films not because of the action but because whedon manages to take six heroes who have their own personalities and egos and makes it work the avengers blends action and humor into an extremely fun and entertaining movie
Sep 27 2012,positive,i expect nothing less from joss whedon excellence as usual
Sep 27 2012,positive,better than expected they keep it simple which is a good thing when involving so many characters i also liked it how a lot of them didnt get along as this is how youd expect it to be for once the hulk doesnt come out looking like a damp squib and iron man is very funny for me just on pure entertainment value this edges out the dark knight as my fav summer blockbuster from this year
Sep 27 2012,positive,its probably one the movies that when i finished watching it the first time id want to watch it again the avengers humane heroic and humorous dialogues plus all the almostrelentless explosive and jawdropping action scenes gained itself audiences that some might consider it the best action movie ever made whedon as a comic fan himself truly committed himself to this film but i dont see any part of it that he had to take a few risk maybe he doesnt have to maybe he played it safe maybe he just have to give what the fans wanted to see but anyway at the end of the day to wait for the day that the avengers had to finally come together in one film has indeed payedoff
Sep 27 2012,positive,whenever my friends ask me whats the best comic book film release this year i gladly tell them the dark knight rises than later they then ask whats the star studded movie that delivered i answer with the expendables 2 which makes my friends ask did you even like the avenger which of course i did for several reasons but didnt leave a huge impact on me like it did on others    the avenger is about nick fury bringing together a team of superheroes to save earth from loki and his army first the good the plot is very well written and surprisingly balanced each character enough to be developed every character has their moments to shine whether it s with a witty comedic line or an action scene its also allot more comedic than anyone expected filled with very funny jokes though everybody favorite seems to be when hulk smash loki before he gets to finished his line aside from the well done the comedy aspect it retains the fun and characteristics that you would expect from these kinds of movies with more superheroes added to the mix the writers did a great job keeping the viewer invested even when there wasnt any violence on screen the action scenes are done very well and nice to look at but i personally do think it did look more like a video game than an actual movie at times the cast themselves were great in their roles scarlett johansson character should get her own movie and the special effects were pretty good at alltime despite the all craziness on screen overall it didnt disappoint and is one of the better movies release this year    now there are elements i didnt like about the plot one of them being they fight aliens this was a letdown for me simply because we already seen people fight aliens will smith did it arnold schwarzenegger did it sigourney weaver did it the idea has be done to death no matter who you put in the position why not have the avengers fight against a team of super villain which is something we havent seen on the big screen yet my second issue with the aliens is that theyre really stupid so instead of you know doing something stupid like spreading out to other states or continents with valuable resources to separate the avengers they go with the intelligent plan of staying in one location and allowing the avengers to stick together which turned out so well for them my last problem with the plot is theres no tension of any kind did anyone actually believe the avengers were going to lose at any point did anyone expect any of our heroes to die no this is a marvel movie where the heroes always come out on top no matter the obstacle while it might sound like im completely trashing the plot its actually allot better than anyone expected and delivered on not only good storytelling but it deliver huge on entertainment as for the final battle which many praise to death as one of cinema greatest action set piece i liked it but it didnt have any emotional values nor suspense behind it like warriors of the rainbow which was also release this year with a smaller budget    the avengers successfully balances its huge line up of superheroes and delivers entertainment whether it plot or violence while not as good as some of marvel other efforts this is a welcome addition to marvel comic book adaptations    note this debate between the avengers and the dark knight rises is ridiculous both are good movies and depending on your taste of movies will determine which one you like better the avengers is aim towards a crowd who want big spectacles without a serious plot while the dark knight rises which i liked better is more aim towards the crowd who like dark gritty complex storytelling in the end though you cant go wrong with either of them
Sep 27 2012,positive,pretty cool love marvel iron man is a laugh
Sep 27 2012,positive,im a big marvel fan and this one is the best i mean best superhero movies ever take a back seat batman
Sep 27 2012,positive,wonderful can watch it over and over bits lost their way but over all a great film
Sep 27 2012,positive,the avengers is a big ridiculous multi lead disaster potential  but thankfully the potential is not met and joss whedon does an excellent job of providing a great story with humour and chemistry that is very entertaining its a popcorn munching rock fuelled action packed thrill ride its everything transformers wanted to be but wasnt its big so it cannot go too deep into any one story but the good part about that is that it sets itself up for a sequel that i am looking forward to   rating avengence is sweeeet
Sep 27 2012,positive,cant stop loving this movie
Sep 27 2012,positive,as a longtime connoisseur of super heroes and comic books i can stand comfortably with the fanboys who hail the avengers as a watershed success that will singlehandedly add life and vigor to a genre that has otherwise suffered some recent failures and setbacks    it was a high stakes gamble a massive undertaking a movie culminating the strands of a story and characters from several disparate movies movies written and directed by different artists  and yet joss whedon legendary comic bookscifi scion of buffy and firefly fame masterfully pulls it together  in fact id argue whedon has made the characters all the better fornot despitetheir interplay  exactly the element of an ensemble movie that is usually the hardest and most awkward to actualize is what whedon has managed to do best  depict a sense of genuine growth cooperation and burgeoning respect from which a team of avengers could naturally emerge  and in a super hero genre that is too often burdened with the laborious work of laying the origin story foundation usually to the detriment of otherwise compelling narrative that is no small victory and its one that will have you alternately laughing out loud or yelling hell yeah   of course you dont need to be a comic book fanboy to enjoy this ride  you dont need to know what an improvement over the nonrelationship between the hulk and ironman is whedons crafty interplay between the two brilliant men who become those aforementioned quasiheroes  and you dont need to remember how stilted the comic book versions of second tier characters like black widow and hawkeye actually seem compared to whedons reimagining of characters whose lack of super powers suddenly makes them arguably the most interesting among a sweeping cast it would be easy to get lost in    but you do have to appreciate just how good a script has to be and how sharp pacing must remain to make sure that silly horned costumes and clunky pseudoscience dont weigh down or distract us from an utterly joyful and unmitigated success of a movie    joss whedon has recently announced that hes agreed to write and direct another avengers movie  thats great news  because this is a fragile difficult franchise that could easily have gone badly  but just like the most poignant moments of sacrifice and redemption for the characters in the movie whedon used grace and heart to deliver a story that takes itself seriously and treats it audience and its source material with respect and genuine enthusiasm  thats as rare and as inspiring as a super hero
Sep 27 2012,positive,what a fun movie 
Sep 27 2012,positive,youd think that putting all these characters together would make it better than their individual films unfortunately i thought a couple of their own were better ie iron man it is a good film but like many cgi heavy films it overdoes it on some of the fightaction scenes to show what they can do with cgi rather than getting on with the film
Sep 27 2012,positive,fucking awesome flick  cant wait til part 2
Sep 27 2012,negative,its got special effects alright but youd be hard pressed to find a story line in this lots of eye candy and thats all it should be taken for totally over rated but will fill the needs of the brainless
Sep 27 2012,positive,good one liked the iron man action a lot
Sep 26 2012,positive,it was a fun movie with a decent story line what really made it interesting was that it was well cast and played by the leads
Sep 26 2012,positive,what should be most appreciated about marvels the avengers is the special effects or the role they play in the film  the fx serve the story  the story is nothing from shakespeare nor should it be  it is a comic book movie that like most of whedons past work revels in what it is  it is the opposite and superior of the latest batman installment  the tdkr is about making a myth out of a man but just a man  mta takes the myth really rolls in the butter of it and then humanizes them  it is a superhero movie through and through it denies no trope dodges no stereotype and yet feels fresh because of its straightforward honesty and professional execution  back on the fx there is no special effect shot that would stand out from any of the regular blockbusters churned out year after year  remove the characters this is the green lantern  on the other hand if this movie had effects of a decade ago or even two decades ago the movie might have been stronger because whedon could have written more face time in for each character  each character was so well drawn relative for the genre obviously that i was left wishing that they played a more prominent role  the plot was nothing original and never ever tried to be  there is something to say about a writer who knows their audience and knows that all deconstructions must acknowledge the standard  plots are simply cuts of every story in real life  a plot simply selects the events in a history which signify an arc that lends importance to everyday life  mta uses its standard plot the simplicity of the genre the honesty of the characters and the skill of its direction to create a supremely enjoyable blockbuster  i hope to see more like it  for those who liked mta but have not seen other joss whedon films and tv shows do yourself a favor and get to it  best genre writer of the last two decades
Sep 26 2012,negative,all of hollywoods liberal elite are in this cast same old same old nothing here to see move along
Sep 26 2012,positive,with nearperfect acting and scripting marvels superhero teamup is everything moviegoers wanted and then some
Sep 26 2012,positive,easily one of the best movies i have ever seen
Sep 26 2012,positive,this movie was the highlight of my summer i saw it about 4 times and it never got boring just kept getting better and better stark was hilarious as usual thor was hot and its just a must see
Sep 26 2012,positive,best super hero movie to date
Sep 26 2012,positive,you cant go wrong with such cast and quality of production
Sep 26 2012,positive,thats my secretim always angry  the hulk 
Sep 26 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive seen the story lines of all the sh came together well cant wait for the next part to come out
Sep 26 2012,positive,obviously this was awesome
Sep 26 2012,positive,seriously jeremy renner chris hemsworth mark ruffalo robert downey jr  chris evans all in one movie hello mr sexypants x5
Sep 26 2012,positive,perfect mix of humor and action
Sep 26 2012,neutral,fun bit of escapism with lots of good moments at times eclipsed by excessive cliche and bad acting diluting the franchise to an extent  chris hemsworth is a joke but an entertaining one
Sep 26 2012,positive,good movie for fun
Sep 26 2012,positive,exciting yes great well no
Sep 26 2012,positive,awesome movie and the best marvel movie of all time
Sep 26 2012,negative,forget the story its traditional comics schlock lacking any wit but feast your eyes on some great sfx so if you put your brain in energysaver mode before watching this you should be safe
Sep 26 2012,positive,high octane excitement a great fun flick
Sep 26 2012,positive,overhyped movie  great effects  mark ruffalo great actor bad bruce banner  thor and capt america are probably the most annoying superheros  bring on dark knight anyday
Sep 26 2012,positive,its a great movie with action and some funny parts 
Sep 26 2012,positive,my favorite film of 2012 and arguably one of the best comicbook adaptations of all time
Sep 26 2012,positive,solid super hero movie one of the best yet
Sep 26 2012,positive,wot can i say love love loved it
Sep 26 2012,positive,one of the few films in which i can see why its successful and well liked
Sep 26 2012,positive,it can be better than that
Sep 26 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Sep 26 2012,positive,this is not only a satisfying movie to watch but its really really well done to compliment the awesome cast
Sep 26 2012,positive,this was the bombz way better than that turd batman movie i dont care what simon says
Sep 26 2012,positive,entertaining enough but  forgettable
Sep 26 2012,positive,four movie franchises and more than five years work culminate in avengers assemble a movie with a lot to live up to  does it succeed  mostly yes  its not the best film of the bunch but it fulfils its meagre aims  the story such as it is exists to get all four superheroes iron man the hulk captain america and thor plus support acts black widow and hawkeye fighting side by side against something  anything would do i suppose so long as theres room for all the good guys to make their mark  and its in that spirit that we have the chitauri a bunch of totally interchangeable cgi aliens who apparently came all this way to shoot at cars  theyre not a memorable threat so it doesnt feel particularly momentous that the avengers fight and defeat them  what a pity given all the iconic superheroes vying for our attention is marvel truly this short on decent nemeses  okay we do at least have loki  tom hiddleston was already the highlight of the thor movie and to his credit he does a lot more than just show up again  this is a darker loki a demonic bad guy with a lust for destruction and in joss whedons hands a believable quick wit  but his hearts never really in it and he basically lets the good guys win  this is at the same time kind of disappointing and interesting suggesting both a scary patience for round 2 and the possibility of redemption  and heck hes mostly just appeasing the chitauri until he get them off his back anyway so who can blame him  in short he rocks  the best thing you can say about his brother though  hes in this one less  lets face it in a movie starring four other movie protagonists not all of them will appeal to everybody  thor is only slightly less lunkheaded and dull than he was the first time and captain america  robbed of the novelty of the 1940s where he also happened to be the only superhero going  seems commonplace  i wonder if whedon agrees as both characters are maginalised as much as possible with only the usual whedonesque everybody gets a quip even if theyve never quipped before flavouring to perk them up  black widow and hawkeye are watchable enough but be serious did we need them  much better predictably enough is iron man  robert downey jrs 2008 film made all of this possible and a big part of that is his natural charisma  hes comfortably at home with whedons dialogue and effortlessly if unofficially takes up the leader mantle from the other three and the lions share of the action  also spectacularly good mark ruffalo finally a bruce banner you really believe is also the hulk  ruffalo takes the character to exciting new places and isnt overused  clearly the hulk works best in an ensemble which is a shame as id much rather another ruffalo hulk film than revisit cap or thor  what else is there really other than the goodies and the baddies  the plot is a list of excuses for the finale to happen and there are annoying holes such as lokis dumb plan to tear the avengers apart by killing someone they all really like  still at least whedon went to the trouble of giving a reason to the name  the story takes a while to get going and the pacing is off with a hefty airborne scrap occurring just before the muchpromised finale  still samuel l jackson makes a brilliant go of nick fury now hes finally got something to do and clark gregg proves hes the only interesting member of shield which makes it all the more infuriating that he wont be back  who else have we got  cobie smulders as the personalityshaped hole that is agent hill  you get what you paid to see and whedon  handling action and dialogue with aplomb  ensures that its a fun ride  the movies rapturous reception is an overstatement however a runamok sense of relief that it wasnt just the dumb eyesore we were all expecting  in every other respect it amounts to little more than what was expected of it
Sep 26 2012,positive,action packed great on bluray 3d
Sep 26 2012,positive,great movie better then expected
Sep 26 2012,positive,as a fanboy i was worried about this one this was outstanding the makes of this film aimed to please as they pitted hero against hero and then added some of the best action sequences ever made the cast was great even with a replacement if you like comics or action must see
Sep 26 2012,positive,breath taking graphics loved this movie 
Sep 26 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever
Sep 26 2012,positive,not a terrible film but its not the best marvel film ive ever seen either honestly i think it was a bit doomed from the start i had a feeling even before the film was released that this film would have a major problem i had a feeling it would lack the ability to focus on a character therefore making it difficult to put yourself in any characters position making the film more personal i knew they wouldnt be able to do this due to the fact that its about a team and not any specific character story wise i was unimpressed however in terms of action interesting scenes and whimsical scenarios i enjoyed it i would definitely see it again but the story left me unimpressed especially when you take into mind how long theyd been building and hinting at it
Sep 26 2012,positive,my boyfriend asked me to go with him to see this movie and i wouldnt i just got done watching it and all i can say is wow this movie is by far the best i have seen in a while cant wait till we get our 3d tv
Sep 25 2012,positive,the only problem i had with this movie is how can you have a battle in the middle of manhattan without inviting spiderman
Sep 25 2012,negative,was i supposed to see a prequel
Sep 25 2012,positive,great movie with action some laugh  suspense
Sep 25 2012,positive,first of many kind highly recommended
Sep 25 2012,positive,so awesome leaves you wanting to know whats next
Sep 25 2012,negative,belabored plot took forever to go absolutely nowhere
Sep 25 2012,positive,actionpacked thrilling and often funny marvels the avengers under joss whedons guidance becomes greater than the sum of its parts robert downey jr reprises his role as genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark and marvel newcomer mark ruffalo gives an amazing performance as twosided bruce banner also joining the cast is jeremy renner becoming legendary archer hawkeye and the newly revealed history between him and super spy black widow is intense and adds another story within a story
Sep 25 2012,positive,extremely entertaining hulk is awesome
Sep 25 2012,positive,the ending is what did it for me  great flick
Sep 25 2012,positive,i bought the 3d version on vudu since the 3d version is not available on flixster i never knew 3d could be done so well on a tv at home i cant believe how well it was done unlike most 3d movies at home where 3d flickers at different times during the movie the 3d was crisp when it should have been crisp a little blurry when it should be a little blurry and it fit the feel of the movie i found myself forgetting that i was watching a 3d movie but rather found myself being more deeply emersed in the experience of the movie i just thought that 3d was limited by the economic technology being used in most homeconsumer tvs and this movie showed me the importance of the level of effort and knowhow put into a 3d movie and how much it can drastically effect the quality of the 3d experience i now see that there is a very large scale of quality that is possible for 3d movies using current consumer technology if it were not for this movie i would still have no idea how good 3d can be   this movie has set the new standard to which i will be comparing all upcoming 3d movies before this 3d was a gimmick but now it may be a deciding factor in future movie purchases rentals and passes since i would much prefer to watch a movie in 2d than in poorly done 3d i may have to start renting 3d movies to determine the quality of the 3d before i make my decision whether to buy in 2d buy in 3d or pass on the movie altogether
Sep 25 2012,positive,this was pretty great im not a giant fan of the movies leading up to this but this one was pretty damn fun
Sep 25 2012,positive,b a great idea that ended up with a case of action overload in the last hour the end was an overlylong action sequence that simply became boring
Sep 25 2012,positive,possibly the best superhero movie to date
Sep 25 2012,positive,best movie of the year if youre looking for full on family fun this is the one
Sep 25 2012,positive,loved the action parts of the movie throw in a little tony stark sass and it was an extremely entertaining movie overall
Sep 25 2012,positive,ive seen this twice in the theaters and i would say i liked it a lot more the second time around i think the reason for this is that i was in the mindset the second time though i was more able to just watch it for the comic book movie it was instead of anticipating a more real comic book experience that the batman series has provided i pretty much piggybacked the avengers and dark knight rises within a few days of each other the writing i would say was freaking amazing joss was able to give particular attention to each of the characters instead of just letting larger personalities like ironman and thor take the spotlight the downplayed personality of the doctor with the backandforth with stark makes for a great intro to this hulk version who has yet to get his own origin movie as played by mark ruffalo much like the dialogue and smart oneliners action plays well with longer battles which display each avenger with equal yet varying skill this feels like a film made by a fan and i feel true fans of which i dont claim to be have gotten a kick out of it vewy vewy fun
Sep 25 2012,positive,fantastic a funny well scripted and actionpacked movie
Sep 25 2012,positive,this was one of my favorite movies of the year it was freakin amazing if you hated this movie then there is something wrong with you
Sep 25 2012,positive,great movie i believe that the writersdirectors got it right  
Sep 25 2012,positive,amazing movie  loves it in 3d and in 2d  cant wait for my blue ray to come in so we can watch it again  great movie
Sep 25 2012,positive,joss whedon thank you for not fing this up amazing
Sep 25 2012,positive,all of yall need to go get this its too dope straight up
Sep 25 2012,positive,loved it some scenes had too much action going on but in all it was a good movie
Sep 25 2012,negative,ok so lets start this of with a huge snore  the only thing the us can think of to stop an army of alien invaders coming from a portal in space is to nuke new york  how the hell would that stop them    we have several loosely related good guys who spend the first part of the film pointlessly bickering over a villain they dont really understand or know  to hell with why loki would want this backwater planet lets just see thor hit iron man with his hammer again   if you sit up late at night wondering if the hulk could sodomize captain  america if he was angry enough  then this is the film for you  because its chalk full of polt holes lack of consistency and random points where the hulk smashes or refuses to smash someone for no reason at all    in the end we are left with a film that could have been solved by just launching the hulk at the aliens and having iron man and the others run sideline commentary  oh wait  that is how the film went    lame
Sep 25 2012,positive,the avengers is a colossal potent action movie with enough wit humor and drama to evoke fanboy cries of excitement out of the most sour movie curmudgeon even though the story could have been a bit more original
Sep 25 2012,positive,this film is great enjoyed it immensely and thought it was visually entertaining the story is quite fun and interesting and the effects are wicked and the action is top notch the story isinteresting and a little cliche in the idea of lokithors brother coming back to earth and unleashing a hell with aliensthis was where i was a little weird ed out and the avengers being the only ones who can stop it  the action in the film is top notchwhich is no surprise and is well executed but the humor in this film is spectacular its able to nicely and seamlessly mush top notch action with great one liners and 1 not over use them and two make them feel like they where just added in for show in other words the oneliners appear more as improve lines then scripted lines which makes it funnier and more interesting   the story is pretty impressive and fun it tells the story of the earth being under attack by lokithors brother and the othera mystical alien race and that sheild must form a team to help them battle this threat with this the avengers initiative is formed comprising of captian americathoriron manhawk eye and the hulk the team must battle loki and his minions to save earth    thatsbasically the story its pretty straight forward and is lots of fun its also got some interesting side plot with captain americabut its only briefly seen and  really doesnt expand on the story a lot sadly and also with thor but theyre all brief and not much else but the action is great the humor is awesomemy alltime favorite line is when hulk takes loki and smashes the crap out of him and then says punny god hahaha i loved the way they seamlessly got them both in there really isnt a hell of a lot in this film that isbad the effects are great and the story is impressive and right to the point and the humor is nicely added i guess if i was to nitpick in the film it would be maybe the fact that it doesnt really flesh out the characters that much butat the same time thats what all the prequels where about soyou cant really complain about that either all in all this is a great super hero film and really has set the bench mark high for all other super hero films to follow i dont even know if the sequels to the other marvel films or even avengers 2 will live up to this film but if they do way to go
Sep 25 2012,positive,wish it came with an ultraviolet code so i could add to my collection

Sep 24 2012,positive,hands down the best movie of 2012 and the greatest superherocomic book movie ever made
Sep 24 2012,positive,this movie was awesome
Sep 24 2012,positive,the action and the humor was typical whedon and done in a way that he knows the acting was top notch with the cast the effects helped drive the story at times but over all the movie is a work of modern mythology done to the mans standard stan should be proud of the way that joss whedon has moved these beloved characters to the next level in this movie
Sep 24 2012,positive,the avengers finds just the right balance of action humor and storyline
Sep 24 2012,positive,great movie put together well with decent dialogue hopefully more from the avengers throughout the years
Sep 24 2012,positive,fun and entertaining
Sep 24 2012,positive,perfect comic book movie
Sep 24 2012,positive,just about the best comic action movie you can ask for great story graphics action and acting
Sep 24 2012,positive,the best super heroes movie ever
Sep 24 2012,positive,good fun action movie story can be confusing if you have not seen the heroes individual movies that explains it mainly thor
Sep 24 2012,positive,entertaining from beginning to end with brilliant action superb dialogue and a perfect cast this is the film that every marvel fan has been having wet dreams about for years
Sep 24 2012,positive,good but by no means epic
Sep 24 2012,positive,it was packed with action loved it
Sep 24 2012,positive,this is what every family friendly super hero movie should be you nailed it joss whedon
Sep 24 2012,positive,this movie is the definition of summer fun really amazing movie
Sep 24 2012,positive,despite horribly uneaven pacing at times the avengers manages to fit in all the awesome character moments and massive set pieces to create a perfect beggining to the end of the marvel cinematic universe
Sep 24 2012,positive,joss whedon orchestrates these characters into an entertaining composition that builds into a very rewarding crescendo this is marvels benchmark
Sep 24 2012,positive,i liked it when the hulk hit thor
Sep 24 2012,positive,what a blockbuster movie should be witty  clever movie money well spent
Sep 24 2012,positive,all the characters were done right the story loosely follows the comic the ultimates a very good avengers plot it was funny action packed and had its share of drama plus its about superheroes so thats awesome
Sep 24 2012,positive,both superhero amazing and lacklustre stupid it creates what we love  good vs evil on epic proportions with cgi acting weve come to adore robert downey jr and an entertaining watch but terrible in its portrayal of the audience the director mocks you with the too frequent gags overused punches and nondramatic themes entertaining but at a stupidifying price
Sep 24 2012,positive,fantastic filmmanages to recreate the visuals of the comics and the characters are treated with the subtlety that we expect from whedon  well done
Sep 24 2012,positive,the avengers is some of the most fun dazzling often touching and wildly energized bit of spectacle yet offered to the endless string of new superhero films  the swarm of leading men miraculously never overload the screen and are all able to maintain the charming characters they crafted in each precursing film  the writing is witty the direction is sharp and the visual effects will surely contend for 2012s oscar in that category  my chief complaint with the avengers as with most of the latest comic book adaptations is that beyond the usual superhero archetypes and excessive action theres little more to digest  now that weve seen superheroes save the earth again again and again from monsters and beings that only seem to arrive in conjunction with the arrival of our fantastic protagonists when will we see them try to conquer some of earths real problems  though the chris nolan batman films the first iron man and most notably zack snyders watchmen have dipped their toes in this territory very few other comic book films seem to ask much more of their audience and the avengers is unfortunately no exception  that being said its still one of the best popcorn superhero action flicks youll see the execution is irrefutably topnotch
Sep 24 2012,positive,feels like actual marvel comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream its simply jawdropping but hulk does steal the show
Sep 24 2012,positive,amazing this movie makes dreams come true an unforgettable blockbuster
Sep 24 2012,positive,excellent film one of the best this year
Sep 24 2012,negative,probably the worst film ever seen you should go kill yourself if you think this film is good seriously some handicapped childeren would find this amusing d  jks its an epic film
Sep 23 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Sep 23 2012,positive,one of the top comic book movies of all time
Sep 23 2012,negative,awful grotesque sophomoric and cheesy dont waste your time

Sep 23 2012,neutral,all that hype for nothing but the scenes with the hulk were pretty awesome
Sep 23 2012,positive,good old fashioned super hero action but with joss wheedon in charge and a smoking hot robert downey jrwhats not to like 
Sep 23 2012,positive,this isnt a film you have to think about this is a film where you sit back adopt a vegetative state and stare at awe at the coolest superhero film ever
Sep 23 2012,positive,was a slow to get going  the bickering was annoying but i have to say the hulk stole the showhe was hilarious
Sep 23 2012,positive,the perfect popcorn flick fans will not be disappointed
Sep 23 2012,positive,one of the best actionhero movies i have ever seen i hope in the future they add the bat girl known as anne hathaway batman and spider man next i love action movies that involves different heroes in one movie such as expendables i loved how this movie had a lot of humor too it was hilarious there was a lot of intense action so much thrilling adventures coming from this movie
Sep 22 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ive seen the graphics are flawless the story is fast moving even at two and a half hours you dont feel a second of it its hilarious and keeps you on the edge of your seat it also keeps a lighthearted tone which is refreshing a must for anyone and everyone
Sep 22 2012,positive,took my youngest to see in 3d imax  great movie and will buy the blu ray tuesday
Sep 22 2012,positive,saw this in a packed theatre even though its been out since april  great cast  characters story filming wonderful sense of humour to it it was great fun 
Sep 22 2012,positive,great movie for the genre i loved it
Sep 22 2012,positive,the action was unrelenting and brought in multiple story lines quite exciting if not a little contrived
Sep 22 2012,positive,best movie ever it had a bunch of action the heros were amazing
Sep 22 2012,positive,there should 10 stars for this movie
Sep 22 2012,negative,hated every moment of this
Sep 22 2012,positive,whats all the hype seems like a cashin to me
Sep 22 2012,positive,great flick ended up with some awesome action
Sep 22 2012,positive,its perfectly blended together adjoining worlds and great heroes
Sep 22 2012,positive,the movies the hulk and modern super hero films are loki hulk smash
Sep 22 2012,positive,they had no reason to do 4 films before done that one but hulk and tony kept the entertaining
Sep 22 2012,positive,very enjoyable although some of the battles went on a bit too long good solid marvel movie and the hulk humour was fun
Sep 22 2012,positive,awesome action packed with tons of comedy
Sep 22 2012,positive,awesome epic movie
Sep 22 2012,positive,as is expected in an action film plot is slightly lacking but i would have to say that overall this is one of the best if not the best action film ive seen
Sep 22 2012,positive,pretty good movie i didnt think i would like it not really into the whole superhero thing but it was really good
Sep 22 2012,positive,very few movies love up to the hype but the avengers exceeds all expectations i loved it my kids loved it  my girlfriend liked it says volumes
Sep 22 2012,positive,i was sceptical when i first watched this as i have watched many a marvel film and apart from the iron man series with robert downey jr they havent been for me entertainment  but this film blew that perception out the water its was the perfect mixture of both humour action which kept you on your seat through either laughter or suspense   robert downey jr is the main actor in making his film and with the person who plays the hulk make this film a 4 12 star not a 4 star  the humour is fantastic as previously mentioned especially a scene with the hulk and the baddie when he just mimics what te hulk is about  now out on dvd and well worth a tenner to buy you wont regret it
Sep 22 2012,positive,fantastic movie did a very good job at giving each character their moment
Sep 22 2012,positive,best movie we have seen in a while it has it all comedy special effects and a decent storyline
Sep 22 2012,positive,perhaps the avengers greatest accomplishment is that any other film of its type would fail for having too many characters miraculously joss whedon moves us to care about every single oneand still manages to include several doses of awesomeness
Sep 22 2012,positive,a visual effects spectacle entertaining if youre not in a thoughtful mood
Sep 22 2012,positive,one of the best movies and a must see
Sep 22 2012,neutral,contrary to popular belief this is not the best movie ever  it is just a very good movie  it is well made and well marketed  it has a good plotvery understandable but it does not make you think or feel so therefore it is not that memorable  i think the problem i had most with this movie was that the superheroes presented here are all equal in a way  they have equal degrees of power and intelligence when in the comics that certainly is not so the fight scenes were very well done and worth watching  the majority of the film had these heroes fighting among themselves instead of one lone villain who is presented at the beginning of the film had these heroes put aside their differences early on the film wouldve lasted fortyfive minutes you dont have to like them you just have to work with them i know im not the only one whos heard this quote the rest of the film felt bloated up with downey as iron manstarks egoridden one liners and forced sentimental scenes where the dialogue was clearly not made for emotion but attempted to run that way anyway it also felt as if the one villain couldve been handled by any one of the heroes instead for some odd reason they needed to take him on collectively as a group  the most underwhelming part of the film was the scene in downtown where all the heroes gather and the camera pans around them it looked better in the trailer than in the film i liked this film but it is not something i would remember for years to come  it all comes back to the plotstoryline for me if you have to hours to spare and like action loud noises explosions etc then by all means watch the film also i just want to point out that this film is not an unexpected hit  look at the way it was marketed  it was obviously set up to be a boxoffice success  however just because its a success doesnt make it memorable  it lacked depth it lacked development what it did excel in was a more than its fair share of highprofile celebrities
Sep 22 2012,positive,jaw dropping mind bending ridiculously over the top superheroness some expected avengers to be short on important aspects with regard to charaters  script  plot but its not its completely awesome
Sep 22 2012,positive,the movie features iconic marvel super heroes iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow and seems like marvels allstar game  i am not familiar with all of  the super heroes but i believe the more i know them the more fun i will have performing as black widow scarlett is the only girl in the team and her presence harmonizes other strong characters it must be an important role for this kind of allstar movies the post credit scene is also mustwatch
Sep 21 2012,positive,filled with lots of humor sarcasm and of course the billionaire playboy philanthropist genius or whatever of tony stark the avengers gives viewers an easy to watch super hero flick though i feel like not every superhero movie needs the humor kick to succeed at the box office the avengers does it justice and well at that with a team that isnt much a team at first we see them grow and smash evil in its way to save the city was well done for the most part
Sep 21 2012,positive,this movie rocks and hope another one follows ironman the hulk and thor characters were awesome and funny plan to buy dvd when it is out in the store
Sep 21 2012,positive,this could very well be the greatest comic book movie ever made
Sep 21 2012,positive,awesome film highly entertaining  well done to joss whedon for some brilliant directing   ill even ignore things like if thor can rip off iron mans faceplate so easily after he fell from the portal how did he manage to have a brawl with him in woods in the first place  thor wouldnt have even flinched if iron man flew into him in fact tony stark should be a crushed bake bean can lol how can you fight a god because its a film thats meant to entertain thats why  however still not an avengers purist film  lets see how they do with justice league 
Sep 21 2012,positive,phenomenal movie this is how you do ensemble action movies
Sep 21 2012,positive,disappointing i expected more no depth and the humor is awkward
Sep 21 2012,positive,great fun and surely contains the greatest horny helmet in movie history
Sep 21 2012,positive,hulk steals the show in my opinion plot and pacing were a little too tv showy for my liking but the way they rehabilitated one of my favorite characters more than makes up for it
Sep 21 2012,positive,best movie of the year hands down
Sep 21 2012,positive,the best movie of the year amazingly done and brilliantly written the perfect amounts of action and humor make the avengers something you can watch over and over again
Sep 21 2012,positive,they did a really good job of developing each of the main characters despite having so many
Sep 21 2012,positive,i wached and hatred iteverywhere is dark in a movieand there is no much action
Sep 21 2012,negative,painfully boring ruined the magnificence of the avengers
Sep 21 2012,positive,really liked this movie its on the short list of ones i would buy
Sep 21 2012,negative,what a huge waste of money talent and my time the avengers turned out to be i dont understand this cult that surrounds mr whedon as if he is the bergman of shitty teen television and subpar scifi dribble for his take on marvels comic is boring too much action too long too much of making scarlett just a sex symbol too much cgi  not enough downey or ruffalo who are the only two shining stars in this mess and its a shame their time had to be spent on the avengers when both actors couldve used their enormous talents elsewhere
Sep 21 2012,positive,the avengers is epic on every scale imaginable incredibly exciting action scenes great charismatic performances and overall a deliriously satisfying superhero film
Sep 21 2012,positive,action packed and funny a great movie to watch
Sep 21 2012,positive,one of this years best movies ever made lookin foward to part two
Sep 21 2012,positive,seen it the day it came out and we all loved it bought the bluray and its even better the second time around if u love action movies andor super heroes get this flick
Sep 21 2012,negative,pure shite good actors burying themselves up to their necks in silage hope the kids like it or itll be a waste of a fiver
Sep 21 2012,positive,pure awesomeness what is better than a group of superheroes fighting together to defeat 1 enemy nothing right i rest my case you honor
Sep 21 2012,positive,wish i could give it more than 5 stars
Sep 21 2012,positive,epicness of superheroes
Sep 21 2012,negative,i really liked the first half of the movie but then when starting to watch the second half it started to bore me still i would recommend it to people who really i mean really like superheroes like them also i really do like the characters although it bored me afterwards i certainly wouldnt say it was horrible but to me its a no
Sep 20 2012,positive,my  favorite  marvel film to date  kik ass action all the way   its a very grounded film   its for marvel  fans  and geeks alike  its   the best to date  i   love it    its   comic  to film  in a literal   sense   with cliche and funny dialoge  its  great fun 
Sep 20 2012,positive,couldnt ask anything for of this film definitely a solid and successful action flick excellent cast
Sep 20 2012,positive,whedon does it again the right balance of action and story with barely barely a plothole in sight the script is witty and poignant and the characters are dynamic and true to the movies before this one you cant do much better than that
Sep 20 2012,positive,i likes this and im getting it to keep
Sep 20 2012,positive,1010 not made out to be anything its not fun from beginning to end cfx are excellent and none stop action
Sep 20 2012,positive,excellent   it looks amazing on my 3d tv also
Sep 20 2012,positive,now the best comic movie ever
Sep 20 2012,positive,i loved this movie i thought it might be cheesy with there being so many heroes but it was great
Sep 20 2012,positive,thats the shit right there
Sep 20 2012,positive,awesome movie  simple plot line full of thrills and great visual effects i wish hans zimmer would have done the score
Sep 20 2012,positive,i saw it twice while in theatres great movie im waiting for the dvd now
Sep 20 2012,positive,just fantastically made great film with heroes
Sep 20 2012,positive,very good movie best out of them all
Sep 20 2012,positive,one of the best action heros films of the year worth watching
Sep 20 2012,positive,great movie in every way superb acting funny and packed with action highly recommend this film
Sep 20 2012,positive,easily both my favorite movie of the year saw it 6 times in theaters  best superhero movie ever  it was well worth the wait   it was genius work that i was prepared to be dissapointed in but instead i was blown away  fanfreakintastic
Sep 20 2012,positive,the movie was enjoyable but did not live up to the hype  at all  when the first iron man came out i was shocked i had low expectations and it blew me away  the avengers seems like just a way to throw all the marvel wheres spiderman characters together in one movie  the story was nothing special
Sep 19 2012,positive,a very well thought out cast selection which contributed to this epic movies success heads up for this one
Sep 19 2012,positive,the avengers is by no means a masterpiece but in its own limits its a firstrate spectacle the story in itself is familiar and worn the film is slightly too long and the final battle is elongated but the film is redeemed by its wellconstructed screenplay terrific sense of humor and adventure massive action and entertaining performances joss whedon manages to balance the screen time of each hero masterfully when theres a scene concerning iron man its all about iron man when theres a scene about captain america its all about captain america and so forth the chemistry between the actors works very well and robert downey jr and mark ruffalo steal the show the amount of hype built for the film was ridiculous but the end result is very satisfying but if you havent seen the films that were building up to it you wont get all the enjoyment out of it and because this is a marvel superhero film the warning is needed if youre looking for a film with brains go watch stanley kubrick the avengers is a blockbuster with a b just leave the logic and sense at the door
Sep 19 2012,positive,unbelievably good i expected this movie to be good like most marvel movies but it wasnt just good it took the expected bar of superhero movies and set it at a new high that hasnt been seen since the first dark knight
Sep 19 2012,positive,i wish there would have been more from black widow we need more strong female leads but iron man thor and captain america did not disappoint
Sep 19 2012,positive,this is probably the best superhero movie of all time that is until the sequel comes out
Sep 19 2012,positive,its the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life
Sep 19 2012,positive,love every minute of this film i dont mind if they had to change the title or one scene has been altered its still an awesome movie
Sep 19 2012,positive,i love this movie
Sep 19 2012,positive,best movie so far i wonder if there well be a second one
Sep 19 2012,positive,it is a triumph in fulfilling the dreams of fanboys everywhere
Sep 19 2012,positive,great fun love the bad guy
Sep 19 2012,positive,i knew what was going to happen with the good guy struggle but they managed to make it an interesting movie anyway
Sep 19 2012,positive,expected a lot more after all the hype but 4 me it was just average robert downey junior is defo the best thing about this movie
Sep 19 2012,negative,ruined my super hero movie experience total waste of time couldnt find two things i liked about this movie 90 liking is way off base and you give city of god 88 bs
Sep 19 2012,positive,this is not my thing but i enjoyed the comradery  sense of humour amongst all the superheroes  the action was overkill plot convoluted but thats not why people check these films out  best surprise was mark ruffalo as the hulk  far superior to the previous hulk characterizationsfilms  heres hoping joss whedon can provide a reboot for him  i enjoyed the final shot of the film too  you know the oneafter everybodys left the theater expect fanboys  not a set up for a sequel just a bit of normalcy after so much chaos
Sep 19 2012,positive,surviving largely on the spectacle of icons this is boisterous and empty and offers little to move its characters forward by its end hawkeye is as insubstantial as his brief appearance in thor and only banner seems to have developed  albeit in the space between his previous movie and this the impending doom that eventually brings the avengers together is a vaguely defined generic alien menace with no discernable motive or plan and the films big bad is quickly dispatched in a moment of comedy violence that utterly nullifies his credentials as a serious threat its watchable as an event its ephemeral as a story and avengers films are only going to get bigger and louder which puts them at risk of becoming less and less
Sep 19 2012,positive,awesome movie will be buying this one 
Sep 19 2012,positive,a slapstick comedic superheroes movie do not watch it for the plot just enjoy the laughs and the coolness
Sep 19 2012,positive,need more comic hero movies where the heroes doesnt speak like a possessed duck better than batman easy
Sep 19 2012,positive,this will be classic for decades
Sep 18 2012,positive,four years and five movies later and it has finally arrived the avengers had the daunting task of bringing together five franchises giving each character enough screen time while delivering more than a beat em up superhero flick does it deliver yes for 2 hours and 15 minutes youre given everything any superhero fan could dream of the perfect characterization of hulk a true show stealer the hero vs hero battles the tragic losses and a nifty little midcredit scene that sets up the sequel beautifully ive always been a sucker for superhero films and when i first heard the rumor that there was a special cameo after the credits of iron man i waited i wasnt sure if there was anything but i stuck around to make sure then it happened samuel l jackson walks out of the shadows and introduces both himself as nick fury and the avengers initiative not a person on this planet knew that four years later we would be treated to a superhero flick so grand in its execution if youre a fan of superhero movies or you just like to have a good time when watching a movie the avengers is for you
Sep 18 2012,positive,awesome idea a few laughs too
Sep 18 2012,positive,a thoroughly enjoyable mess whedon sets about the task of uniting several relatively uninteresting superheros for a cgi bashup and smashup session with varied results away from their separate franchises if they even have one each of marvels avengers are generally undersold  iron man 2 was truly awful captain america was terrible all the hulk films were severely compromised  in fact only thor was a capable movie in its own right which is probably why those superiorly drawn characters take centre stage in the assembly otherwise save for a few excellent shots and sequences whedons direction is anonymous whilst mcgarvey has little to do amongst all the glittering chrome visuals and grotesquely unconvincing cgi the script swings from being pathetic to brilliant within a heartbeat and mark ruffalo manages to achieve more in his 10 minutes of screen time than any of the other hulk screen adaptations put together
Sep 18 2012,positive,joss whedon does it again only a couple weeks later and again he steals the show coupled with anticipation and a compelling story the avengers definitely pulls the individual superhero movies together they did a great job of spotlighting individual characters and also their teamwork which is core highly recommend actionpacked and full of laughs youll come out satisfied
Sep 18 2012,positive,amazing film and heart pounding climax
Sep 18 2012,positive,the best heroic film of heroes in this world that need heroes
Sep 18 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time  i dont think ill ever get tired of watching it
Sep 18 2012,positive,by far the best action film this year the avengers has it all love it a lot
Sep 18 2012,positive,could not have been better
Sep 18 2012,positive,i dont think i need to say how perfect this movie was you all get the point
Sep 18 2012,negative,really are movies about one superhero just not stupid enough anymore
Sep 18 2012,positive,cant believe i forgot to rate this lol sooo deliciously good whats not to like hulk smash
Sep 18 2012,positive,what a fantastic movie it was such a pleasant surprise to see the ensemble cast meld together so well  i think we are going to see many great movies to come out with these great marvel characters
Sep 18 2012,positive,slightly disappointing
Sep 18 2012,positive,great movie cant want for 2
Sep 17 2012,positive,i just watched the bootleg dvd version of los vengadores the avengers for the 7th time that i got in tj and it gets better everytime best 1500 pesos i ever spent will definitely buy it on  bluray when it comes out
Sep 17 2012,positive,this is how you get a whole bunch of superheros together in one movie
Sep 17 2012,positive,hulk steals the show  and what a show
Sep 17 2012,positive,loved it and cant wait for number two
Sep 17 2012,positive,the avengers is like an amusement park ride  you probably already know how its going to play out but its still a lot of fun
Sep 17 2012,positive,i think i must have been one of the few people to not catch this at the cinema when it was released earlier in the year but all good things come to those who wait so they say and ive now got a nice shiny bluray to watch  i must admit that im not that much of a fan of marvel superhero comics and the movie spinoffs and the avengers does have that comic book feel to it quite different in tone to that other big superhero film the dark knight rises but i thought it was much better than i expected and really enjoyed it  it looks like marvel releasing the iron man captain america and thor movies previously worked as it removed the need to introduce each of the heroes and just get straight to the action and lots of action there is too right from the off it doesnt really slow down much throughout especially when the other guy goes green  i was also really loving the soundtrack from alan silvestri very rousing and fit the film perfectly for me thought it was up there with his back to future scores   all in all this is very much a funfilled action packed superhero film that definitely pays tribute to previous superhero films and to comic books as with marvel films these days dont forget to watch until the end of the closing credits
Sep 17 2012,positive,one of the finest examples of bringing the perfect team together this has smashed its way through all of my favourite movies to become the pinnacle of superhero prowess samuel l jackson is great as nick fury and its so good to finally see plenty of him after all his cameos scarlett johansson is so impressive as natasha and i really really like mark ruffalo as bruce banner who has greatly improved my feelings regarding the hulk chris evans does excellent work getting cap up to speed and robert downey jr ups his game as stark and lives up to the word hero and has many of the best lines chris hemsworth absolutely nails his performance as thor and i could happily watch him and tom hiddlestons loki talk to each other forever it really is like shakespeare in the park and it gives such weight to the movie and this along with caps old fashioned inherent goodness theres so much to enjoy there are lovely supporting performances from clark greggs agent phil coulson and cobie smulders as agent hill and jeremy renner also does well as clint and is very cool to watch as the action heats up towards the end as much as i love all of the avengers loki completely steals it tom hiddleston gives such a dramatically malicious performance that i think he tops every bad guy before him and loki vs the hulk is something i will never forget this has bucketloads of humour and incredible action and considering that this is just the beginning i cannot wait to see where joss whedon takes this funny menacing and truly heroic this demands repeat viewings and a lot of respect
Sep 17 2012,positive,transformers 3 with the robots replaced by superheroes
Sep 17 2012,positive,a truly exceptional film
Sep 17 2012,positive,this was the best superhero movie ive ever seen by far action packed funny and good plot
Sep 17 2012,neutral,personally i thought it was pretty average i proffered just iron man
Sep 17 2012,positive,loved it had a laugh gonna watch it again sooniron man seemed the most prevalent in this film so expect that type of humour though the best quip was between loki and thor when thor says you listen well brother i if youve seen it you will know what i mean if not watch it to find out
Sep 17 2012,positive,theres only one god maam huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue
Sep 17 2012,positive,awesome new favourite movie
Sep 17 2012,positive,just fantastic do not read into it to much grab a coke other fizzy drinks available and some popcorn and enjoy  the only question is how do you raise the bar now
Sep 17 2012,positive,hulk is the only thing that i like about this movie
Sep 17 2012,positive,super movie i loved it
Sep 17 2012,positive,holy shit awesome movie
Sep 17 2012,positive,love love love this movie i had a blast watching it
Sep 16 2012,positive,very real and very fun hulk smash
Sep 16 2012,positive,while it may not have the depth of some of the best marvel films the ensemble performances and visual universe make for a great ride
Sep 16 2012,positive,this is what a comic book movie should be like
Sep 16 2012,positive,excellent acting you can almost feel their doubts and struggle very humerous  action packed leaving you wanting to see it again or want more if your a superheroe fanatic definitely worth watching
Sep 16 2012,positive,pure spectacle love the banter with banner and stark they really did pull off the impossible by making a really great movie by tying together a bunch of just good movies most rewatchable movie of the year
Sep 16 2012,positive,i loved this movie but in 3d it is awesome
Sep 16 2012,positive,i waited my whole life for a great comic book movie and avengers delivered
Sep 16 2012,positive,best josh whedon movie ever he stayed true to the comics ive seen almost all of josss works been a fan forever  usually not a fan of scarlett johansson but loved her in this movie loved robert and jeremy too
Sep 16 2012,positive,fun and action packed
Sep 16 2012,positive,this could have gone soo wrong generally when they bring superheroes the balance is well off but it seems that most of the heroes got their chance to shine many memorable and funny moments so much fun only criticism is that captain america was a little outshone by ironman
Sep 16 2012,positive,superhero extravaganza with a few special effects  lol the hulk has 2b my favourite 
Sep 16 2012,positive,i dont often give movies top ratings but avengers surely earned it it was directed brilliantly by joss whedon and was an actionpacked film with a very good plot and the 3d was really good for not being filmed in 3d excellent movie seeing it again when i rent it
Sep 16 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Sep 16 2012,positive,very cool very cool indeed
Sep 16 2012,positive,best film ever if you havent seen it watch it
Sep 16 2012,positive,these movies always set the bar higher for the next and i cant wait for whatever that may be
Sep 16 2012,positive,it was great worth the wait
Sep 16 2012,positive,this was the best concoction of superheroes ever lokid
Sep 15 2012,positive,absolutely wonderful  funny loads of action entertaining
Sep 15 2012,positive,a terrific cast and bangup dialogue make the first two hours gripping enough to forgive the final yes another one battle to save the earth or maybe just midtown manhattan
Sep 15 2012,positive,entertaining from start to finish
Sep 15 2012,positive,what a superhero movie should be action comedy scifi and the hulk smashing everything in sight
Sep 15 2012,negative,avengers 92 fresh dark night rises 87 not cannot be right some men just want to watch the world burn avengers is your typical watered down action movie for the unintelligent masses
Sep 15 2012,positive,a good movie for what it is a mindless comedy no real psychological value
Sep 15 2012,positive,normally not a fan of superhero movie but i find this movie exciting and entertaining i guess i would have enjoyed it more if i had known more about the superheroes beforehand thor and hawkeye are awesome 
Sep 15 2012,positive,a joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick
Sep 15 2012,positive,this film makes me happy
Sep 15 2012,positive,great cast good story awesome special effects five stars hands down
Sep 15 2012,positive,i have been waiting for this movie since the end of 2008 and it just about surpassed my expectations it was flat out awesome
Sep 15 2012,positive,did a good job of balancing the characters without letting any one character dominate though you could argue stark got just a we bit more than the rest  very good on screen interaction between the various main characters and it even gave a breakout opportunity to the background characters i so want to see a black widow or hawkeye movie now not to mention the shield agents doing a great job  excellent writing and balance
Sep 15 2012,positive,in a time of cinematic repetition the avengers introduces a new type of film that infuses both humor and action in sequences of pure awesomeness
Sep 15 2012,neutral,dont understand really why its rated 92 on rottentomatoescom   for me just an average movie which probably cost too much regarding the result
Sep 15 2012,positive,yet another very well executed marvel movie very entertaining and well done
Sep 15 2012,positive,love this movie its funny and has a great plot iron man is my favorite but i think loki is very interesting too
Sep 15 2012,neutral,meh cool action and funny lines but predictable and formulaic advise you watch the incredibles instead
Sep 15 2012,positive,i have been waiting for a movie like this since i was a little kid and it did not disappoint
Sep 15 2012,positive,its like a dream come true to watch this movie although it is a robert downey jr centric
Sep 15 2012,negative,410 the avengers is one of those kind of blockbusters which is all glitter and no substance though all the character personalities portrayed in the movie have been true to the source material the storyline itself however lacked complexity and the affinity to be taken seriously at all 410
Sep 15 2012,positive,the avengers is one of my favorite movies of all time it has lots of action and i would love to own it
Sep 15 2012,positive,severely dissapointed not that funny way too much action and too many characters i have no idea why it has a 96 rating
Sep 15 2012,positive,the avengers displays joss whedons flawless comedic timing and his ability to balance fun among somber circumstances flawlessly one can see why buffy  angel were a huge success  fireflyserenity a huge cult hit welcome to the big leagues mr whedon as for the movie i enjoyed this movies hulk more than the two standalone movies this movie showcases why the hulk work best as a supporting character instead of the lead hawkeye in my opinion was an eccentric character to addthe movie could have done just as fine without him the other characters perform their parts well although downeys tony stark filches the spotlight each stretch he was onscreen the chemistry between the casts is seamless the only downsides are the sometimescheesy dialoguesmostly by jacksons nick fury and the loose usage of technical slang every now and then other than that here is a toast to the avengers for having a superb job done
Sep 15 2012,positive,robert downey jr is awesome as usual pairs up really well with mark ruffalo hulk chris evans and jeremy renner are really not awesome captain america is the party pooper and generally sucks as a super hero the action scenes are too tame in contrast to the darker batman movies and more suited to kids however there are enough special effects and witty one liners from downey jr to keep you entertained
Sep 15 2012,positive,an amazing movie  well written amazingly directed  joss whedon 3
Sep 14 2012,positive,entertaining as hell after getting the avengers on motion picture i have started dreaming to see the justice league in action too
Sep 14 2012,positive,awesome best movie of the year  simply outstanding blend of talent i dong think any of the actors overshadowed each other
Sep 14 2012,positive,despite the slow start this movie is chock full of action excitement and fun its absolutely a blast and succeeds at everything it tries to be the perfect example of a summer flick
Sep 14 2012,positive,i really loved this movie
Sep 14 2012,positive,cant wait to own it on bluraydvd  exciting movie
Sep 14 2012,positive,exceeded my expectations  seriously  how easy would this have been to completely mess up  and far worse movies have performed just as well
Sep 14 2012,positive,loved it it has action from beginning to end with humor to match i want to see it again soon
Sep 14 2012,positive,the best movie of the year by far the only thing that would have made it more perfect for me is if the hulk got more screen time
Sep 14 2012,positive,i know people love this one but im not sure why sure theres lots of action and superheroes but not much of a story or a proper plotline and the characters are seriously lacking in substance other than the hulk everybody else seemed very onedimensional had i not seen any of the previous movies i would completely dismiss this one as boring mindless action maybe i expected too much
Sep 14 2012,positive,fun very well cast entertaining lots of action great popcorn movie more of a dc comics girl myself though
Sep 14 2012,positive,an action adventure that truly delivers action adventure well written too
Sep 14 2012,positive,it cant be better anymore
Sep 14 2012,positive,great movie highly recommended
Sep 14 2012,neutral,exactly what it should be nothing more or less
Sep 14 2012,positive,funny epic and the heroes we all know come together for this epic story deserves its 5 stars
Sep 14 2012,negative,i feel sad knowing i just wasted over two hours of my life i will never get back   dont watch the avengers
Sep 13 2012,positive,nonstop action and explosions hulk smash
Sep 13 2012,positive,this movie got me bored a little but i still liked this movie it has most of the superheros
Sep 13 2012,positive,pretty much fantastic
Sep 13 2012,positive,im keeping it simple  this movie is everything youd want in an over the top superhero movie  see it
Sep 13 2012,positive,all i want to do is repeatedly watch this
Sep 13 2012,positive,one of the greatest superhero movies of all times
Sep 13 2012,positive,probably safe to say to best superhero film ever made besides dark knight rises 5 stars
Sep 13 2012,positive,great movie lots of action and funny
Sep 13 2012,positive,totalll entertainmenttt a great movie cant wait long for the avengers 2
Sep 13 2012,negative,this movie sucked poor writing poor acting cliche set design and not eye candy simply had nothing going for it
Sep 13 2012,positive,its the biggest film of 2012 it should be 4 stars
Sep 13 2012,positive,marvel the avengers is the best super heroe movies with more than 1500000000 is the best movie off the last 10 years
Sep 13 2012,negative,cant understand why this film was do well liked should have been called iron man and his stupid friends very poor unless your 10 years old
Sep 13 2012,positive,amazing got it on dvd
Sep 12 2012,positive,the movie excels thanks to the power of director and writer joss whedon and his very human treatment of superhuman characters backed by a very game cast
Sep 12 2012,neutral,captain america is the only good thing about this movie
Sep 12 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever
Sep 12 2012,positive,the avengers contains a vast amount of characters and it never becomes to bloated or stuffed the set pieces are the reason this film needs to be seen on the largest screen possible and in the end what was set up six years ago pays off indefinitely
Sep 12 2012,positive,my heroes once again
Sep 12 2012,positive,this is the best movie i ever watch the avengers really made my day lol
Sep 12 2012,positive,i hope they make a sequel with all the same actors
Sep 12 2012,positive,after the hype surrounding the avengers it was either going to be extremely good or extremely poor and thankfully joss whedon has successfully managed to combine multiple superhero stories into one and make arguably the greatest superhero movie of the lot with the likes of robert downey jr chris hemsworth scarlett johansson mark ruffalo and samuel l jackson on board it was always clear that the talent was there to make a wonderful film but it was how to utilize the talent on board that was always going to be the hardest part of the production thankfully whedon manages to construct a plot that has just the right amount of action humor thrills and to make it even better the plot isnt even complicated so there should be no problem in following the story line  when planet earth comes under threat from loki a god from another planet and brother to thor nick fury assembles the likes of iron man captain america the hulk thor hawk eye and black widow to try and put a stop to the hell bent loki their efforts prove to be futile however and loki soon takes control of some of furys best agents to scheme against the avengers and to make a weapon that will allow his army of aliens to come and start a war on planet earth when loki succeeds in opening a portal to allow his aliens into the world they begin wreaking havoc on new york city and it is up to the avengers to fight them off in an epic battle  with stunning action scenes that are heavily influenced by the use of cgi the avengers is a breathtaking movie that matches up to the success of christopher nolans batman films the cast are terrific as they reprise their roles as superheros and the chemistry among the cast is key to the little bits of humor that are involved throughout the film a genuinely thrilling movie from start to finish that has one of the best battle scenes in history to round off a perfect superhero movie
Sep 12 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Sep 12 2012,positive,like it when the put all the superheros into one movie i injoy it in the movies and cannt wait to get on dvd
Sep 12 2012,positive,best movie ever funny masterfull arrt
Sep 12 2012,positive,amazing film when your favourite superheros come together and make a film out of it for the people behind it it is make or break because you cant exactly mess this up i am a huge fan of spiderman and he is my favourite superhero so obviously for me there was something missing the whole time but i can accept that and move on this film has brilliant cgi brilliant acting brilliant direction brilliant plot and brilliant everything else marvel is probably one of the best creations known to man god bless stan lee
Sep 12 2012,positive,some of marvels most famous superheros teaming up to take down aliens and protect earth i think its a must watch
Sep 12 2012,positive,cant wait to rent it
Sep 12 2012,positive,very good but far from perfect
Sep 12 2012,positive,although i have to admit i was really worried it was going to crash and burn horrifically like transformers 3 by having too much action for no reason at all i got the same feeling walking out of the cinema as i did when i watched transformers 1 and for everyone who hasnt watched either of these films its simply an action film which mixes serious with humour perfectly just as each transformation in transformers was as exciting as the next each hulk smash and iron man suit up is eagerly anticipated throughout couldnt stop talking about it for 3 days after so  watch with everyone
Sep 12 2012,positive,alright i think there was to much hype before i saw it
Sep 12 2012,positive,awesomeness in all its spandex wearing glory best file of the year
Sep 12 2012,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Sep 12 2012,positive,thought this was great every age will enjoy it too
Sep 12 2012,positive,regardless of what anyone else says watch it an enjoy it for what it is in my best films of all time list
Sep 11 2012,positive,the movie starts out incredibly boring but just picks up and gets better and better during the last action sequences with the hulk the humor almost boarders on classic greatness joss really captures the essence of the comic book hawkeye and black window hardly get hurt and i realize it is supposed to be because of their superhuman like speed and natural potential but not in a war zone like that with flying shrapnel everywhere all in all i want more i love marvel superhero movies
Sep 11 2012,positive,  there are moments of genuine pathos genuine humor genuine surprise as much as the film adheres to the strictures of the standard comicbook movie it also pops with a knowing loving whedonworld jokiness that keeps everything barreling along the avengers have been assembled and for the most part they fit together superbly a joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick big brash and very funny joss whedons avengers assemble is equal to the sum of its parts  and for once thats no faint praise suit up like a superior stateoftheart model built from reconstituted parts joss whedons buoyant witty and robustly entertaining superhero smashup is escapism of a sophisticated order in terms of storytelling the avengers is for the most part a highly functional bangedtogether vehicle that runs on synthetic franchise fuel yet the grand finale of cgi action set in the streets of new york is  in every sense  smashing      verdict highquality stuff  positive reaction this is a rating to a movie i view as very entertaining and well made and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on dvd it is not perfect but it is definitely excellent films that are rated 35 or 4 stars
Sep 11 2012,positive,lots of things blowing up which you would expect in this kind of movie i have to give props to the studio for giving the major players their own movie first before this one if only dcwb did this kind of planning
Sep 11 2012,positive,edited from 3 stars to 45 saw this movie again before watching civil war had seen it before but with a looking forward to disliking it attitude years and a rewatch later wow this movie is tight as hell less robert downey jr and more tony stark and cool it with the yeah rock and roll again rockstar iron man but yeahthis movie is comics come to life knocked it outta the park joss whedon
Sep 11 2012,positive,movie theatre camaraderie
Sep 11 2012,positive,this movie was no joke
Sep 11 2012,positive,good characters and interesting collisions between them but in the end the story is simply not up to the challenge of keeping me as involved as i wish i was despite the great effects and awesome performances by the entire cast i simply found the story bland and simplistic enough to say that the movie was written for kids and hardcore comic fans the movie is enjoyable if you manage to turn off your brain and accept that this movie is meant for a younger demographic who might not question the logic andor meaning of things interesting concept but poorly maintained my score is generous when looking back on what this movie brought to the table
Sep 11 2012,positive,perfect i can hardly wait for phase 2
Sep 11 2012,positive,an awesome fantasyscifi adventure  everybody loves a superhero a team of superheroes is even better  a mustsee movie
Sep 11 2012,positive,in the year of the comic book movie the avengers stands tall as an enjoyable ride populated with thrilling heroics and eye watering set pieces each avenger gets a share of the spotlight and even though robert downey jr shamelessly steals everyones thunder sorry thor the rest of the cast do an admirable job tom hiddleston is brillantly machiavellian as loki and mark ruffalo delivers a solid hulk whedon gives his script the usual pandering of razor wit dialogue which works in places but upends the tone in others and the final set piece though a feast for the eyes ends with a contrived cop out in order to get to the credits full of knowing winks and fan service this doesnt take itself too seriously and all the better for it the only issue may be having to sit through another thor movie before the inevitable avengers 2 a enjoyable ride just dont expect the narrative to surprise you and youll enjoy it
Sep 11 2012,positive,darn no 6th star
Sep 11 2012,positive,this film is awesome
Sep 11 2012,neutral,graphically stunning but the story line is ridden with predictable cliches and should feel about par for the course to anyone over the age of 18  in many cases the script was going to such awkward lengths to stress characters ideologies that it was difficult for me to keep listening  considering that this movie received a 92 fresh rating from the critics makes it an interesting litmus test for critics who vote their interest as opposed to guessing the masses interest
Sep 11 2012,positive,great movie love that they kept the original cast
Sep 11 2012,positive,super special awesome
Sep 11 2012,positive,actionpacked and really clever love tony stark
Sep 10 2012,positive,an explosivefunentertainingaction superhero movie good for the whole family

Sep 10 2012,negative,the hype is more than misleading
Sep 10 2012,positive,great movie very action packed and totally loved the hulk and thor 
Sep 10 2012,positive,there are no words the movie speaks for itself
Sep 10 2012,positive,not my cup of tea still it has great effects and good acting by almost everyone
Sep 10 2012,positive,fun as all get out well balanced screen time between all the main characters and there are many everyone feels like they have something interesting to do with the story this is what summer popcorn movies are all about
Sep 10 2012,positive,the best film this year by far couldnt keep eyes off screen carne wait for dvd on 17th
Sep 10 2012,positive,it was a great movie the best of the series joss whedon is awesome
Sep 10 2012,positive,what can i say about the avengers  ââââ
Sep 10 2012,neutral,ridiculous film  this shows what happens when people think the sole reason to make a film is box office gross poor characterisation of the alien threat downey jr holds it up
Sep 10 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ever possibly possibly not the most fun superhero movie ever most certainly and some people would remove the word superhero from that sentence
Sep 10 2012,positive,one of the best movies 2012 and i want more  hulk shows a lot of promise coolest superheroes in a one movie working as a team nice cgi new superheroes awesome action scenes humor  bad guy is not very challenging black widow is weak and not very believable superhero heroes has no weak moments so it looks like they are immortal all the time
Sep 10 2012,neutral,a boring pot full of superheroes
Sep 9 2012,positive,superiorly executed good laughs even
Sep 9 2012,positive,between setting up combining and fleshing out the heroes introducing shield and giving them all something to fight a lot got done in this movie with room to spare for humor and fanservice  unfortunately i felt that the villain side of things got left very little consideration  they got the confused and childish loki and a pack of generic invading aliens as adversaries  but its fun enough to watch these heroes tear through em like paper and save the day so thumbs up from me
Sep 9 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies to date

Sep 9 2012,positive,by far best comic book movie to date
Sep 9 2012,positive,loved it although i wouldve loved to see more
Sep 9 2012,positive,everybody who stayed to the end of iron man has been waiting for this for quite some time swell of those who watched the incredible hulk 4 very long years later it came and it delivered this goes without saying that there hasnt been a film that matched this in character wise and there probably wont be all there is to say is thank you joss whedon for this brilliant execution of the avengers
Sep 9 2012,positive,the best action movie since star wars
Sep 9 2012,positive,suspenseful hilarious and awesome

Sep 9 2012,positive,great movie cant wait for part 2
Sep 9 2012,positive,this is without a doubt one of the best superhero films ever made joss whedon knew exactly what the fans wanted and delivered robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth scarlett johansson and jeremy renner were excellent but the scene stealer imo was mark ruffalo who outdid edward norton and eric bana as the new bruce banner not to mention the hulk looked just like ruffalo himself i cannot wait for avengers 2
Sep 9 2012,negative,whats wrong with you people this movie was awful its predictable its dialogues are full of clichã cs it was boring and ugly a sadly overrated film

Sep 9 2012,positive,when does spider man fits in and nice one thumbs up
Sep 9 2012,positive,you want fun so here it is
Sep 9 2012,positive,best action superhero movie for some time
Sep 8 2012,positive,none of the summer movies could ever ever match the avengers im sorry dark knight rises you had a good and fantastic run but the avengers smashed a lot of decent through mediocre movies like battleship the dictator dark shadows and allcomers the movie was awesome my favorite avenger was black widow iron man and the incredible hulk the ending was shocking and i dont know who the new villain is but its still a spoiler so i cant write it on this review with all those box office records i think its even way better than avatar and this years the hunger games i got my advanced ticket i wait in line for at least 30 minutes and when i watched the movie it was all action if you havent seen the avengers then theres a good chance to buy it on bluray on sept 23 dont be late take your time and get your copy while it last because everybody will be rushing to the midnight launch party selling as much as it could get i cant wait for the sequel for 3 more years watch out avatar 2
Sep 8 2012,positive,joss whedon is a god
Sep 8 2012,negative,solid contender for one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Sep 8 2012,positive,good movie but i wasnt sure what movie the girl was from that bugged me the entire time since i have seen all of the other movies
Sep 8 2012,positive,the best hero film all the time
Sep 8 2012,positive,even taking into account joss whedons corny dialogue and penchant for shakycam action scenes the avengers is about as a good as superhero movies get and watching the hulk go on a rampage made me giggle like a schoolgirl
Sep 8 2012,positive,does the job its entertaining and it does very well but do not ask for more the script is simple the direction of joss whedon is dynamic but nothing more than that if you want to see is a deeper story this film is not for you now if you want great entertainment clearly the avengers is for you
Sep 8 2012,positive,i love this movie more than any other i have ever seen
Sep 8 2012,positive,just simply awesome more hulk in the next one i hope

Sep 8 2012,positive,epic rage and derpswag enough said
Sep 8 2012,positive,stunning action sequences and though theres the requisite corniness the writing is surprisingly intelligent
Sep 8 2012,positive,freaking awesome so worth seeing again i def will be buying it on blu ray and digital copy
Sep 8 2012,positive,the script is downright awful but the chemistry between the characters works and the stunning visual effects and humour make watching the movie bearable
Sep 8 2012,positive,awesome cannot say anymore
Sep 8 2012,positive,this action packed movie is a five star rating  with the actors fully going into their roles as heroes and villian the magic they display on the big screen is magnificent  if your fan of the marvel movies you will love this next installment and if this is your first marvel movie then you picked a great one to watch  all the action and explosion is packed together for the viewers to enjoy
Sep 8 2012,positive,totally awesome  nothing else to say about this movie
Sep 8 2012,positive,this movie lived up to all the hype in my opinion it focused more on each individual characters strengths as well as weakness my i only wish is that black panther as well as ant mangiant man and wasp will be introduced into the remaining franchise
Sep 8 2012,negative,what a terrible movie nothing happens for long periods of time poor dialog
Sep 8 2012,positive,its all about entertainment
Sep 8 2012,positive,i only saw this movie because it was the biggest film of 2012 so this review will reflect that superheroes really arent my thing i havent read comic books watched tv shows etc the only superhero films ive ever seen are christopher nolans batman trilogy and the recent thor film thank goodness i saw that thor movie or i wouldve had no clue what was happening in the avengers none at all i still really didnt understand the plot of this movie because i havent seen all of the other superhero films thor was probably over a year ago so it was very fuzzy in my mind the bits i did get were from thor and from me constantly rewinding it and turning on the subtitles so i could try to follow it even though it was hit film i wouldnt recommend seeing it unless you are into superheroes and have seen the other films the graphics were amazing the plot not so much i can see how people could be really into this movie it would probably be very very good if you have that superhero background knowledge i unfortunately did not
Sep 8 2012,positive,much better than i expected
Sep 7 2012,positive,awesome film just waiting for 3d blue ray release now

Sep 7 2012,positive,the hulk la lleva d
Sep 7 2012,positive,some said it could never be done but marvel have proved that hard work and staying faithful to the comic books not only makes an excellent film but rakes in the cash too the avengers is what marvel fans have waited for since the after credits scene of iron man and it finally arrived as the star studded cast assemble to save the day from the fantastic loki tom hiddleston and his army the avengers is everything a comic book fan could hope for in a film and more and has opened up endless possibilites for marvel studios with a whole universe up and running exciting times are ahead for comic book fans
Sep 7 2012,positive,this is the kind of movie that michael bay would direct if he didnt suck the only movie this summer i saw three times in the theaters best time seeing was with my old man who grew up reading the avengers comics during the 1970s i remember wondering at one point i wonder if dad is having a good time then looking over and watching my dad laughing like a hyena at the puny god scene since then its become an injoke with me and my pops we often quote the line when someone with a massive ego in his put in hisher place   also to steal a line from a one mr chester a bum  it has sam jackson as a pirate yo mutha fucking ho

Sep 7 2012,positive,better than what i expected
Sep 6 2012,positive,probably the most ambitious movie of the modern era the avengers set a new higher standard for all future superhero movies and man this film is definitely a must see or buy for everyone this set a whole new meaning to summer blockbuster 2010 in my book
Sep 6 2012,positive,this movie was great cant wait for iron man 3 and thor 2 and captain america 2
Sep 6 2012,positive,i hadnt seen any of the other movies in the series but i am a big fan of moss whedon so i went to see it anyway i loved the movie eventhough i did not have all the plot exposition
Sep 6 2012,negative,i never fall asleep at the movie but i fell asleep during this movie
Sep 6 2012,positive,its alrightnothing special in the storymade me want to see the origin films of the heroes
Sep 6 2012,positive,film was alright too much eye candy though didnt absorb the point of the movie haha
Sep 6 2012,positive,the best mix of action and comedy i have ever seen in a movie
Sep 6 2012,positive,this is single handedly the best super hero action movie as of 2012
Sep 6 2012,positive,the avengers is like five of the best comic book films ever made rolled into one
Sep 6 2012,positive,not only is this one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen its one of my favorite moviesprobably ever
Sep 6 2012,positive,a fanboys delight the avengers is a fun but ultimately hollow film which is more style than substance and features an annoying over the top michael bay style third act that doesnt know when to end
Sep 6 2012,positive,this movie was good but i still prefer the individual superhero films i think they allow for more character development with six superheroes jostling for screentime it was an inevitable problem though
Sep 5 2012,positive,best charactor   the hulk
Sep 5 2012,positive,somewhat of a disappointment  i expected a lot mor a lot of visual impact but the characters were hard to get interested in  it seemed like there were too many story lines to cover in a 2 hr movie however it was a pretty good movie to watch at home for movie night
Sep 5 2012,negative,i was bored about half way through the final battle i thought to myself is this over yet for most viewers you need a character to relate to all of the characters where flat and rather drab in fact having like 8 main characters made the movie even more uninteresting right from the beginning i knew how it would go a problem would occur everything will look okay a set back will occur a large battle someone almost dies good guys win these super hero remakes are not good movies i feel like they have run out of ideas so they are just taking stories right from comic books and making the fan boys go nuts
Sep 5 2012,positive,a great movie lot of fun 
Sep 5 2012,positive,not quite as enamored with this pic as i was by the first iron man but i still found it pretty enjoyable even if some of the dialogue felt clumsy i will definitely say aside from a few earlier scenes like when thor and cap and iron man get into it or when black widow pulls her bit of tricksy not just on a few thugs but also on the norse god of lies himself i let out a gasp of awe when the avengers got down to business and did what they do best save new york city that was the avengers ive known and loved from so long ago  nice foreshadow of what avengers 2 will bring and a real cute bit of whimsy in the freebie aftercredits scene
Sep 5 2012,positive,best comic movie ever also movie of the year
Sep 5 2012,positive,iron man has saved the world
Sep 5 2012,positive,the best comic book film do date
Sep 5 2012,positive,i thought that this movie wouldnt have many turns in the events and it surprised me when i watched it because it has however there has been only one scene of intense in the hole 142 minutes
Sep 5 2012,positive,can i give it 6 stars  i enjoyed it as it paid tribute to the heroes and had such great chemistry including the distrust and feeling out of each other i really cant wait to see where they go next with this as well as the individual franchises and i hope coulston finds his way back to the shield tv series next fall
Sep 5 2012,positive,sweet movie im buyin dis at midnight
Sep 5 2012,positive,the 8 year plan that marvel set in motion payed off big time this is one of if not the best comic book movie to date it was a fantastic film and another to add to my growing blu ray collection
Sep 5 2012,positive,joss whedon is the filosopher behind the knowledge of the avenger and makes it one of the best movies right next to moonrise kingdom
Sep 5 2012,positive,if can add more stars i would
Sep 5 2012,neutral,in my opinion its very overrated its popcorn flick action just reminds of a michael bay film even though the characters are infinitely more interesting and likable then anything bay has ever done i would also like to note that i was somewhat of a fan of iron man and thor but this movie just seemed stupid seeing them all together how this film got a 96 from users let alone a 92 from critics is beyond me
Sep 5 2012,positive,hulk is the fuckinnnn man
Sep 4 2012,positive,by far the best movie of 2012  it was great to see the hulk steal the show by the end of the movie
Sep 4 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for iron man 3
Sep 4 2012,positive,loved loved loved this movie watched it three times and still catching new things joss whedon brought his genius to this movie
Sep 4 2012,positive,fun and extremely entertaining crap story and didnt care about the characters because i only saw the ironman series saw this in 3d 3d is garbage hurt my eyes after two hours of mostly nonsense action
Sep 4 2012,positive,great visual effectsdecent storygreat fantasy charactersbit slow in places but overall a decent filmgood superhero movie not great but good
Sep 4 2012,positive,simply the best superhero film ever
Sep 4 2012,positive,greatest movie of 2012 thus far great story amazing cinematography perfect use of silent action and amazing character development from everyone truly joss whedon directed a masterpiece even considering the michael bayish aliens i seriously couldnt have asked for better
Sep 4 2012,positive,awesome action great dialogue and a solid story   up there with the first iron man if not quite there
Sep 4 2012,positive,pretty bad ass  same group of charactersactors from the other movies with a few additions  the hulk was completely bad ass  i also was totally into iron man  his suit was a lot cooler and seeing all the crazy gadgets was nuts
Sep 4 2012,positive,a pretty decent movie although captain america needs a bit of an attitude adjustment versus his movie he was much nicer then
Sep 4 2012,positive,the cinematography was incredible and it was put so well together that you can practically go with anyone the kids the grandma the friends saw it 3 times in theatres will own on day 1 of its release 
Sep 4 2012,positive,absolutely loved this movie my second favorite movie of the summer to the dark knight rises good humor and great action a good family friendly movie for the most part that the parents will enjoy too action packed great movie
Sep 4 2012,positive,review number 5    marvels the avenger  contains countless of satisfying moments in both action and dialogue in an ambitious teamup that delivers    its pretty much almost everything thats fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen like serenity and the buffy season 5 finale its wellstructured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes i cant think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so wellbalanced between them all and all the different combinations of arguments and teamups between them    theres no need to go into detail on the plot its a superhero flick so naturally something or someone loki thors adopted brother in this instance threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day its formulaic but a lot of fun if not particularly original or inspiring its difficult to surprise cinemagoers nowadays and plots are recycled embellished and reimagined more often than conceived but that neednt be a major issue in a genre film on this scale when the viewer isnt demanding any more than to be entertained    wittily this is coated with a fair amount of good humor though some jokes could be predictable the spontaneity of the performances makes them unarguably funny for example towards the end when rogers is giving orders to policemen what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves nonverbal humor even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard  when dr banners other guyshut loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms    the avengers doesnt transcend it regurgitates a donetodeath plot unlike the avengers the dark knight was more than a comic book film it was entertaining compelling yet it explored complex moral ideas and its plot went in innovative directions did anyone know that the dark knight would end not with a fistfight but instead with a battle between the joker and batman for harvey dents soul a scene that leaves it open to interpretation whether the joker or batman really won in the end a scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be and lets not forget did you ever worry that any of the avengers would not survive if not then where was the real dramatic tension one of the things that made the dark knight so compelling is that one of its two heroes not only dies but is also believably turned evil before he is killed great filmsserious or funmust make the audience feel that there is something truly at stake not just rely on the continual spectacle of fights and explosions    the cast is superb and in the case of the principals either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here mostly they do as youd expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation its not that kind of film however beyond the obvious starbilled cast there are some who delight absolutely tom hiddleston wallander the deep blue sea as loki is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards while jeremy renner the hurt locker the town is an actor whos been around for a few years and costarred in a number of excellent if not huge films as clint barton he again lends solid support and proves to be a most watchable and compelling actor its just a pity that hes given little opportunity to develop his alter ego hawkeye and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify that    i grew up at a time when the technology wasnt up to the task of putting what we see in todays avengers on the big screen with that said it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak the cgi and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle so if thats what youre all about you wont be disappointed however if youre looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot youve come to the wrong movie this is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for so on that score it works but i need something more even in a superhero movie    there have been lots of action films that ive enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to rewatch because that they didnt have much else going for them avatar comes to mind  but this isnt one of them if youre looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot youve come to the wrong movie this is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for
Sep 4 2012,positive,phenomenal movie loved it
Sep 4 2012,positive,best 2012 movie so far and superhero movie of all time
Sep 4 2012,positive,solidly entertaining but when are they going to make captain america more interesting
Sep 4 2012,positive,the must see movie of 2012
Sep 4 2012,positive,some good writing and characterization as well as effects however drags on too long in the last act
Sep 4 2012,positive,this couldve so easily become a convoluted mess of a film with so many characters fighting for screen time but whedon did an fantastic job of balancing everything out and giving each of the individual heroes a deserved amount of attention and development but what really sets the avengers apart from the majority of this years other blockbusters say transformers 3 is that we actually care about the fate of the characters whereas in the comparative final battle of transformers 3 we just dont give a hoot  the avengers is funny exciting and just a whole lot of fun  exactly what every blockbuster should be
Sep 4 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever no question period
Sep 4 2012,positive,just awesome biggest complaints are nerdy in nature hawkeye needed a more comic like costume the aliens should have been kree or skrulls and i thought it was a little too funny
Sep 3 2012,positive,fun sarcastic camp thanks jossy
Sep 3 2012,positive,best super hero movie every
Sep 3 2012,positive,best super hero movie ever
Sep 3 2012,positive,one of the best if not the best super hero movies
Sep 3 2012,positive,this movie gets you pumped upit exciting the whole timewhen hulk smash you wanna get up a scream only problem is the story line fell apart half way through the move and was replaced but action which isnt a bad thing really just wish that the story line could have been a bit more epic
Sep 3 2012,positive,a very enjoyable movie that gets acting directing and writing correct even though they could have treated hawkeye a little better
Sep 3 2012,positive,some cheesy parts but thats what comic book movies are all about
Sep 3 2012,positive,one of my new favorite movies saw it 2x in theaters and buying it first thing it hits dvd
Sep 3 2012,positive,fantastic definitely glad we got to see it on the big screen even though it came out in may
Sep 3 2012,positive,lots of buildings are blown up  lets hope the avengers are there to pick up the tab  thatll be truly heroic
Sep 3 2012,positive,this movie is one of the best
Sep 3 2012,positive,iron man cap thor hulk and featuring hawkeye and black giggity widow assemble for the ultimate superhero movie how can one movie be the sequel to four other movies kick off more sequels show how four equally matched heroes can exist in the sane movie unite play off each others unique abilities and skills while being nearly upstaged by the more ordinary side characters love this movie great ride and hungry for more shwarma
Sep 3 2012,positive,lots of super hero fire power action  if you can get into comic book mode youre in for a fun ride   downy jr is the standout
Sep 3 2012,neutral,expected moreespecially the storyline of the first hour is boring and redundant
Sep 3 2012,positive,one of the best movies ever filled with intense action comedy and well developed characters toped off with a solid plot and its full of super heros a must see movie
Sep 3 2012,positive,joss at the top of his game great movie all around worth watching
Sep 3 2012,positive,this is what you call perfection no complaints would pay to see it again
Sep 3 2012,positive,i love when bruce banner said puny god lolzzzz

Sep 3 2012,positive,incredible movie go watch it now
Sep 3 2012,positive,loved it waiting on the bluray now
Sep 3 2012,positive,one of the few movies i have rated 55 its great humorous classy simple and full of action however there are some scenes that seem like it only focused on ironman well i dont care coz its really fun to watch bravo waiting for part 2
Sep 3 2012,positive,i admit my surprise this was one of the most fun superhero movies hulk smash loki worth it
Sep 3 2012,positive,a good fun movie that is shot beautifully  visually stunning but something was missing  as such it didnt blow me away plus captain america is a knob
Sep 3 2012,negative,bored the shit out of me  but hey i know i am in the minority here
Sep 2 2012,positive,5 stars out of 5 for me this is as good as a superhero movie can get it lived up to all the hype and iron man is just plain awesome in this one as always its one kickass superhero flick this could be the biggest franchise we have ever seen in regards to marvel comics check out my full film revew on my blog at the movie psychoanalyst

Sep 2 2012,positive,enjoyable throughout with good humor dialogue acting and story telling  its one of the best superhero movies ever made
Sep 2 2012,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen i could barely force myself to sit through it the plot is uninteresting and predictable the dialogue was cheesy and not important the villain was not anything memorable i could go on and on long story short if chris hemsworth wasnt in 3d i would have left about 20 minutes in
Sep 2 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Sep 2 2012,positive,the avengers dark of the moon
Sep 2 2012,positive,love it  nick fury of shield brings together a team of super humans to form the avengers to help save the earth from loki and his army   it was great fun watching it lots of action full action package great few comedy parts awesome cast and great heroes and villains i enjoyed very much and i recommend it to everyone  nick fury there was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people so when we needed them they could fight the battles that we never could  steve rogers i wanna know why loki let us take him hes not leading an army from here bruce banner i dont think we should be focusing on loki that guys brain is a bag full of cats you can smell crazy on him thor have a care how you speak loki is beyond reason but he is of asgard and he is my brother natasha romanoff he killed eighty people in two days thor hes adopted   steve rogers big man in a suit of armor take that off what are you tony stark genius billionaire playboy philanthropist   world security council director fury the council has made a decision nick fury i recognize the council has made a decision but given that its a stupidass decision ive elected to ignore it   tony stark to loki lets do a head count here your brother the demigod a super soldier a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend a man with breathtaking anger management issues a couple of master assassins and you big fella youve managed to piss off every single one of them   nick fury wheres barton selvig the hawk up in his nest as usual 
Sep 2 2012,positive,maybe one of the best superhero movies ever made in history
Sep 2 2012,positive,slow out of the gates but poor first half is forgotten with tremendous ending much of which 3d finally played a positive role this is the first movie ive seen in the past 5 years worth the value of 3d the technology has not yet arrived overall
Sep 2 2012,positive,rated 38 am on the minority here this movie just didnt work for me hardly any character development at certain point it just seems like shoot and destroy everything type of movie not much crafting with the details either feels like scattered piece of puzzles never solved not reaching its proper potential it just doesnt click for me only thing i enjoyed was the hulk smash now that has entertainment value rest am not so sure am reviewing this one a little late was trying hard to understand whats the hype so much well i really dont know
Sep 2 2012,positive,great movie come on sep 25
Sep 2 2012,positive,easily the best super hero movie adaptation to date not a classic though there is just something missing with the plot
Sep 2 2012,positive,this movie was greati did not like marvel or dc and i saw this movie and now im a marvel fan                               its hard to find movies with the perfect amount of action and comodyrobert downey jr is a awesome actressand is hilarious
Sep 2 2012,positive,a fun movie with some snappy dialoguewith some good action scenes but my major crisp some of the cgi effects arent as good as i hope to be
Sep 2 2012,positive,entirely silly but more fun than the vast majority of these movies
Sep 2 2012,positive,having seen this i have no regrets giving the thor and captain america movies a miss as they are clearly less interesting than ironman and the hulk is it me or does anyone else think loki has a retarded costume
Sep 2 2012,positive,after the recent disappointments from marvel notably thor and the abyssmal second installement of ghost rider this was a pleasant experience  the special effects are dazzling the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some âdepthâ to their characters sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun  iâtmve always liked robert downey jrâtms portrayal of tony stark and his sharp tongue i did wonder how they where going to get the hulk in there since heâtms supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but i can live with that i absolutely loved the âpuny godâ scene if you havenâtmt seen the film yet youâtmll have to see it to know what i mean i wont spoil it in advance  i have to say that i found thor a bit underwhelming again though i just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder but then iâtmm scandinavian soâ   anyway this was a great film i enjoyed it very much

Sep 1 2012,positive,so much potential  and an extremely entertaining movie without even breaking a sweat  the plot was flimsy 34 of the movie are basically spent watching the heroes fighting amongst themselves and in the end its really pretty lame to watch loki a demigod beat around like one of my dogs toys  i must admit the hunkiness factor was definitely delivered by chris evans  the switch from norton to ruffalo for the hulk was a stroke of genius and the casting of johansson as romanoff was one of the highlights of the movie for me  as for the rest well they did a good job and theyre lucky they got a great director  without a steady hand the movie could easily have gone off the track and crashed and burned  after all of that still i felt like there was so much more that they could have done with a superb story served on a silver platter  oh well at least they didnt ruin it
Sep 1 2012,positive,a classic better get a whole lot of oscar nods
Sep 1 2012,positive,there is nothing better i could say about this movie then what has already been said brilliant
Sep 1 2012,positive,really awesomelots off actiongreat special effects and lots humorslove it
Sep 1 2012,positive,really awesomelots off actiongreat special effects and lots humorslove it
Sep 1 2012,positive,holy cow that was a good movie
Sep 1 2012,positive,id give it 3 14 stars wouldve been higher but i mostly dislike the final battle sequence it just felt too transformersish for me loved the characters interactions and couldve done with more hawkeye  as hawkeye purple suit included thought johansson actually made widow interesting and wish they had done more with starkbanner interplay one weird thing is at the movies we saw a scene where thor confronts illegal fishers and fury knows of thors actions but that scene was not at the two drive in viewings and thor just shows up during the plane sequence no explaination of how earth was reached since the events of his movie oh well the thanos cameo almost made the geek in me forget that bring in masters of evil and kang the conqueror in sequels
Sep 1 2012,positive,the best marvel super hero flick ive seen in years its witty funny action packed striking a rare balance that entertains kids and adults simultaneously
Sep 1 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Sep 1 2012,positive,so good just brilliant
Sep 1 2012,positive,this movie and ironman are the best marvel movies
Sep 1 2012,positive,amazing action packed movie its great to see all my favourite heros in one movie one of my favourite movies of all time no lie
Sep 1 2012,positive,simply one word awsome
Sep 1 2012,positive,simply one word awsome
Sep 1 2012,positive,the superhero movie to end all superhero movies every second is well crafted and well directed filled with moments that will make the 12 year old in you cheer
Sep 1 2012,positive,silly and predictable i must say all the hype and it all collapsed on it self i enjoyed it the visuals are amazing and the plot and script are good there is no character development  this could have been an excellent and clever movie but was disappointing
Sep 1 2012,positive,it was good but i think it was over rated the hulk was the best thing in it
Sep 1 2012,positive,all my marcellus marvel characters d
Sep 1 2012,positive,seen it and felt that whilst the film was in most cases welcoming to watch a few things felt wrong 1 the character of bruce banner no longer being played by edward norton felt wrong but also his replacement was in most cases a side actor not a front like chris evans and robert downey jr 2 the humor in places was a little delayed all to appear in the final fight scene so it felt a little rushed
Sep 1 2012,positive,look at my watch meter  not till it was over  far more entertaining than any of the individual components except iron man the movie showed what the sum of all parts can be  the scene with the hulk near the end is the heartiest laugh ive had in a movie theater in a long long time
Sep 1 2012,positive,walt disney picture choose the right director joss whendon understand how to make personalty in each character very interesting
Sep 1 2012,negative,after all the  it made the studio gives a few paultry special features to the fans including extended scenes not even completed  in front of green screens  where is the extended version promised or will it be rereleasing after we have already paid twice to add to the migraine we have the same old cgi blow them up epic we have all seen before but with more characters
Sep 1 2012,positive,favorite mobie of the year
Sep 1 2012,positive,the buildup to this unprecedented superhero teamup has proven to be well worth it avengers actually stands well above the films that led to it and really should also rank among the best of the crop in the superhero genre this mostly comes down to joss whedons direction and creative input  his background in fantasy tv providing him with the knowhow on how to best create the onscreen chemistry of an ensemble cast it is immensely entertaining stuff to see our heroes quarrel at first and then learning to appreciate their differences and come together against their common enemy unhinged intergalactic megalomaniac loki returning from the previous thor film and played with perverse gusto by tom hiddleston visually the film is stunning making superb use of 3d and all manner of digital effects just as youd expect such a big blockbuster to look then theres alan silvestris sweeping score ramping up the heroics  must seeon the big screen if you can ps  most pleasing to see hulk served so well by this picture too
Sep 1 2012,positive,solid team ensemble with surprising comedy last 30 mins is the coolest
Sep 1 2012,positive,although there were some parts in it that are different than the previous marvel films avengers assemble is an excellent and extremely exciting experience thats rolls up to an outstanding ny battle sequence
Sep 1 2012,positive,better clench up legolas
Sep 1 2012,positive,obviously been over hyped this definite blockbuster just didnt end up being as awesome as expected  i didnt grow up with the marvel characters neither have i watched every movie featuring these heroes which may be a reason why i dont connect with them individually but what they did manage to do was add some witting snappy humour to touch base with their adult fans   action scenes were fun and the hulk wouldve been my favourite but thats really all i can say nothing here to wow me as visual effects and storyline were generic not outstanding enough to have me see it again but instead watch titles like thor captain america etc to get a bit of history
Sep 1 2012,positive,cant wait for the next one
Sep 1 2012,positive,i am hardly a comic fan i have never even picked up a comic book and im utterly lost in comic shops ive never been very interested in superheroes however i picked up the dvd because it had so many good reviews thinking that it would be a good enough movie barely worth my while i actually ended up loving it i bought it just yesterday and have already watched it twice and its made me quite determined to watch some of the other movies that feature these characters as well as perhaps a few others i think my experience proved that anyone can enjoy a film as long as its a good one not just someone with specific interests
Sep 1 2012,positive,just brilliant hulk stole the show
Aug 31 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in my life d
Aug 31 2012,positive,much more fun than i had originally thought which wasnt much what a surprise although it has taken marvel many years to get all of the background characters and stories developed theres still some fresh and interesting material here to delight me and the journey rough at spot was worth it as whedon and others mentioned this isnt about vfx but about characters and their stories which is well balanced here
Aug 31 2012,positive,its as great as anyone could expect it to be
Aug 31 2012,positive,it was super good and long
Aug 31 2012,positive,awesome i loved hulk and iron man and everybody excellent graphics

Aug 31 2012,positive,watched this awesome spectacle twice in two days
Aug 31 2012,positive,loved it it has it all this needs to have a a number two
Aug 31 2012,positive,best film of 2012 though you might have to watch all the other films about the characters to understand  great action movie
Aug 31 2012,positive,cant wait for the sequel marvel is a movie making giant now
Aug 31 2012,positive,the action was awesome and i was in awe most the movie but there was a little too much dialouge
Aug 31 2012,positive,full tilt action masterpiece  with the marvel slate of films having set the stage it nearly seemed impossible for this superhero mashup not to fail on some level  but it didnt and joss whedon finally gets his due  with an intricately woven story that brings all of our favorite heros together to save the world joss and co nearly ripped our screens to shreds with precisely timed action sequences and succinct barrages of comic relief  this was truly the perfect summer action film
Aug 31 2012,positive,the actors fit the roles to perfection the writing was superb the witty one liners successfully hilarious im still quoting them the plot well paced the action engrossing without overwhelming each characters personal development especially bruce bannerhulk played by mark ruffalo and the iron sharpens iron effect in their relationships with each otherpun intendedwas beautifully portrayed especially capt x iron man and thor x iron man   i normally avoid action movies but this will take a place of honor on my video shelves as the best movie of 2012
Aug 31 2012,negative,all the build up for something average disappointing
Aug 31 2012,positive,really enjoyed this full of hot men and a decent storyline works for me x
Aug 31 2012,positive,oodles of fun lots of eye candy for the guys and girls plus cool fx for movie geeks  marvel did a great job setting up this movie with the individual character movies first a soon to be classic
Aug 31 2012,positive,the great superhero movie  hulk vs thor
Aug 30 2012,positive,fun movie but not as fun as iron man and not as good as dark knight
Aug 30 2012,positive,when youre ready to be entertained and have your senses fed to the point theyre bursting go see marvels the avengers id call it the new gold standard for what every blockbuster action film should aspire to be
Aug 30 2012,positive,action thrill adventure all in one did i mention funny too
Aug 30 2012,positive,i didnt want it to end
Aug 30 2012,neutral,competent pop corn flick but doesnt bring more to the game
Aug 30 2012,positive,i went to see this movie and i love it loki is a character of deep depth and thought
Aug 30 2012,positive,amazing dialogue and cast the action and comedy is great perfect combination all in all a very very good super hero movie i recommend you see the heros individual movies before seeing this i mean you dont have to it will still be a great movie but it makes it even better
Aug 30 2012,positive,one of the few movies i saw in theater and more than once
Aug 30 2012,positive,every avengers fan will admit that the plot was nothing short of lame but the script specifically those written for stark  banner were awesome  that kept the movie going ruffalo added a new dimension to the character of banner starks expressions  dialogues were superbly timed tom hiddleston was great in the role of loki the script is a winner
Aug 30 2012,positive,absolute entertainment loved the hole concept
Aug 30 2012,positive,fab film watched several times at cinema and cheesy grin was present  at each showing
Aug 30 2012,positive,gonna be even better on blu ray
Aug 30 2012,positive,probably the best superhero movie ive seen in a considerable amount of time if you havent seen it yet youre really missing out it has everything
Aug 30 2012,positive,the avengers reputation  even after just a few months of being on release  is quite impressive and it has some very vocal fans  the first thing to say is how impressive it looks  the effects are first rate though the final thirty minutes begin to resemble a computer game  the acting is fine joss whedon directs with flourish and his script has some very good oneliners  it is however a very hollow spectacle full of holes and entitely incomprehensible to the outsider    there is a problem with almost all these superhero movies and it is that they are too enthralled to the surface sheen the look that they forget all about the heart  sometimes they make token efforts towards depth and true characterisation but it always sounds like a teenage boys idea of what emotion is not an adults    then there are the inconsistencies  lokis plan was a bit muddled  if the hulk cant control himself on the ship why can he then control himself on the streets  if security at stark tower is so strict how can a scientist get on top of the building and set up a device completely unnoticed especially when the world is looking for him  why if the tesseract is a twoway door and loki can come through it without trouble does it need a power source to open it for everyone else  to made it wider you might say why then are others able to cross between worlds in thor  these were just some of the bigger questions the film failed to answer  and as with the stunted emotional issues of these films these are questions raised because such film are enamoured with the way things look  they quite often dont care for logic consistency or intelligence    the avengers then is a loud brash good looking film that does everything it can to stop you thinking about its emptiness shallow self  still this is one of the better films in this mode
Aug 30 2012,positive,this was a great movie and exceeded my expectations
Aug 29 2012,positive,im maybe the only person in the entire world who dont like this i find pointless just action e explosions the entire movie no great acts or a good script
Aug 29 2012,positive,the avengers is the best marvel movie out there and in my top 5 favorite superhero movies its funnyhas good actionand worth the 4 years of wait
Aug 29 2012,positive,very good moviewith no floors in the story

Aug 29 2012,positive,exceedingly enjoyable movie  one of very few releases that had me entertained until the credits
Aug 29 2012,negative,watching this shit on blueray boring pos
Aug 29 2012,positive,enjoyable even if storyline full of holes over the top action
Aug 29 2012,positive,overall rating 5 plot passable 35 ending cute 35 graphics wonderful 45 actors 55 scarlett johansson robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth liam hemsworths brother tom hiddleston jeremy renner mark ruffalo misc marvel thor iron man captain america hilarious yes yes yes yes and yes wasnt even a marvel fan hadnt watched any of the other movies like iron man didnt understand a lot of what was going on but man this was great its surprisingly hilarious youll be falling off your seat one second and then crying because what are these feelings its great made me go back and watch all the other movies  they arent as great but necessary 
Aug 29 2012,positive,excellent cant wait i personnally enjoy it more on 2d than 3d
Aug 29 2012,positive,absolutely brilliant movie
Aug 29 2012,positive,this movie was great
Aug 29 2012,positive,thats my secret captain im always angry
Aug 29 2012,positive,in my opinionthe avengers is by far the greatest super hero film of all time
Aug 29 2012,positive,the dysfunctionals together genius they play off each other so well with a couple of inhouse bitch fights of epic proportions loved thor  iron mans faceoff especially the hulk had a few comedy tantrum moments  was interesting to see hawkeye  black widows relationship am hoping a few more historic avengers appear joss whedon can do no wrong  i am a whedonite through  through i think we should vote for him to save xmen too most entertaining movie since cabin in the woods 2nd half
Aug 29 2012,positive,simply amazing waited a year to see it worth the wait
Aug 29 2012,positive,its surely a novel concept of not having one prequel to a film but having a whole range of prequels to one film unfortunately this concept is likely to be copied over and over again in the future first of all of course by dc comics  however regarding this film you get what you expect a mediocre story that is nevertheless strong enough and reasonably coherent to carry the film and lots of superhero action and with scarlett johansson as black widow and the recent kate beckinsale as catwoman it can only be a matter of time until we finally get to see a female superhero film that isnt completely screwed up remember halle berry as catwoman
Aug 29 2012,positive,very entertaining like watching a moving graphic novel its clear that the creators are fans of the comics and thats the way it ought to be i just wanted more than one female superhero perhaps the sequels will have the wasp and i really hope they have spiderwoman
Aug 29 2012,positive,awesome action packed thriller definately a must see if youre into superheros
Aug 29 2012,positive,arguably the greatest comic book movie since the dark knight all the heroes are magnificently endearing but the real hero here is whedons script and tight direction
Aug 29 2012,negative,piece of overrated crap lmaof
Aug 28 2012,positive,i liked it do much no i loved it but i am a marvel fan so that makes sense a little cant wait for the second one with a new  super villain  cant wait to buy it
Aug 28 2012,positive,absolutely amazing the perfect movie my new favorite of all time iron man is always the best and awesome and hilarious i cant wait for the sequel and iron man 3 woooooooooo
Aug 28 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Aug 28 2012,positive,by far the best superhero movie ever created in my opinion joss whedon is a certifiable genius
Aug 28 2012,positive,loved it great cast of actors perfect for their parts
Aug 28 2012,positive,love iron man robert downey jr is awsome
Aug 28 2012,positive,humans they are not the cowering wretches we were promised they stand they are unruly and therefore cannot be ruled to challenge them is to court death
Aug 28 2012,positive,pretty awesome  like the effects and action scenes havnt seen iron man 2 or captain america but non the less very entertaining
Aug 28 2012,neutral,boring as hell two and a half hours of supposed superheroes doing silly parkour jumps around a flying aircraft carrier and the streets of nyc iron man is cool but he has his own movies to be cool in this movie is not cool believe it
Aug 28 2012,positive,marvellous production perfect script humour and action downeys performance clearly stands up  without the iron man the team would be just plain boring
Aug 28 2012,positive,when you go see a superhero flick this is exactly what you want to see mark ruffalo was a bit of a disappointment but im still not sure if thats his fault or the writers
Aug 28 2012,positive,i always fear the hype with comic flicks like this but i was entertained  since a sequel was inevitable i think it would have been best not go past the 2 hour mark and i did register at least three big yawns before it was all over but the amount of juiced action sequences and snarkful rapidfire dialog keeps it from ever getting too boring  its probable that i would watch it again
Aug 28 2012,positive,the best film ever action packed from start to finish
Aug 28 2012,positive,the best super hero movie ever worthy of 6 stars
Aug 28 2012,positive,laughed at this movie alot more than expected
Aug 28 2012,positive,cant wait for the 3d blueray releasewe just bought it in 3d this last tuesday
Aug 28 2012,positive,joss showed perfect team to protect world
Aug 28 2012,positive,not very original story but makes up for it with very good characters actionmessages and a lot of funny and epic moments
Aug 28 2012,positive,amazingiron man and hulk rocks
Aug 28 2012,positive,friends avengers countrymen lend me your ears i have come to praise joss whedon not to bury him  ill tell you that mark ruffaloâtms hulk was moving the actor did in seconds what others needed hours to do he might have even outemoted colin firthâtms mr darcy if there is a heart in the avengers it lies within mark ruffaloâtms sometimes green monstrous chest or in scarlett johanssonâtms bosomy chest the jaded shattered spy is a trope and yet she brings it to life with such pathos that i wanted to pay for her counseling and her interaction with hawkeye where in seconds backstory was spun out with such depth such richness i might have been eating a comic book mousse  and that is the brilliance of whedon quickly magically he can create characters we love snap your fingers you are captured and if you like the characters everything elseâ will follow because that is the magic of storytelling  the avengers is a completely satisfying comic book movie the movie has texture the characters the action sequences the whole motherlovinâtm spectacle of it has texture and itâtms funny i howled laughter and clapped my hands with glee a child again witnessing the circus i needed though two things and i just wonder if joss whedon knew i needed them  i was surprised that much of the tension was due to the hulk here you have largerthanlife superheroes even a few demigods and yet they are afraid of the hulk  and the end battle i needed a dark moment that whole end battle could have been handled better more grit and angst at times the story was murky why would lording over humans please loki his character arc wasnâtmt as clear as it needed to be  but funny and cool and moving iâtmm telling you when bruce banner walked on stage i got tears in my eyes just looking at him and the shawarma at the end if you wait through the credits youâtmll see the shawarma and itâtms worth the wait  joss whedon through decades of storytelling and work has become an icon heâtms the george lucas we all wanted heâtms a great man arise joss whedon and bring us more stories more characters more since the avengers has become a hulkish hit maybe you can insist on a john carter sequel
Aug 27 2012,positive,best superhero team up ever i love everything in this movie what caught my eye was that each hero at least got enough screen time as it should love it
Aug 27 2012,positive,has to be the best movie ive seen all year
Aug 27 2012,positive,another great action packed movie based off marvel comic books i mean come on what guy doesnt love the spectacle of an amazing superhero movie nerd and popular kid a like
Aug 27 2012,positive,brilliant movie managed to recently watch it and i was wowed the 3d was great and the movie was even better even if you have high expectations it should be better than them the hulk was perfectly cast and the cgi on him is perfect must watch and must buy on 3d
Aug 27 2012,positive,best comic book movie out there cant wait for two 
Aug 27 2012,positive,being a comic book geek firstly it was awesome to finally see a team of heroes on screen although i wish it was justice league dc fanboy as much as this movies been talked about everything from the acting the action sequences mark ruffalo stealing the spotlight but i think the thing that should be talked about more is joss whedon the way he wrote the script giving all of the members equal screen time making it a real team effort also a blockbuster cash cow
Aug 27 2012,positive,best thing about avengers chris hemsworth
Aug 27 2012,positive,as soon as i heard joss whedon was at the helm of this baby i knew it was in safe hands how right i was whedon manages to give all of the characters a good amount of screen time so that no matter which hero you prefer youll be satisfied i feel that whedon really understands comic books and how their movie versions should play out as seen clearly in the avengers its epic to the point of exploding and silly in just the right amount the scale is suitably grand and the set pieces likewise a marvel see what i did there the villains motive may not have a lot behind it but loki himself is a lot of fun and a lot of the backand forth between he and the avengers provide some delightfully snappy dialogue also finally the hulk done right now of the things i enjoyed most about this film was bruce banner so kudos to mark ruffalo for a great job throw in some funny moments most notably from downey jr some amazing special effects and samuel l jackson and youre sitting on one of the most entertaining and most fun movies ive seen in a long while oh and stan lee has a cameo naturally
Aug 27 2012,positive,avengers is exciting and really funny but tried too hard to make a smash hit and overdoing some parts
Aug 27 2012,positive,excellent film great story and not over the top
Aug 27 2012,positive,pure entertainment  thats my secret captain im always angry
Aug 27 2012,positive,simply put its 140 minutes of chock full of nerdgasms
Aug 27 2012,positive,perhaps the best superhero movie ive ever seen
Aug 27 2012,positive,maybe the hype was just too muchi kinda expected the godfather of superhero moviesi still probably got the best one of all of them but still it kinda fell a little short for mewould have given it 4 stars hiddleston probably deserved all four of them himself but cobie smulders ruined it for me
Aug 27 2012,positive,this movie was off the chain this movie will keep you entertained from beginning to end the story from bringing everyone together to fighting together is engaging loki plays a very deceitful villain that keeps you guys guessing what his motive is starting a inter galactic war is one thing but it goes deeper  the film is filled with some amazing action scenes reminds you of films like transformers but better lots of cool graphics and realism i am steadily amazed by the work that film makers do to create these films  overall you will love this film whether you are a follower of the marvel comic book characters or not you will enjoy the avengers i would highly recommend you see this
Aug 27 2012,positive,one of the better superhero movies  a jolly romp and well worth seeing
Aug 27 2012,positive,awesome popcorn fun
Aug 27 2012,positive,whedon did a fantastic job the cast was great action packed visual great
Aug 27 2012,positive,oh god this film ever since i watched the avengers  the animated series i fell in love with this team and god are they great as time past on and as i watched more of the animated series i thought to myself make a movie please so captain america came out in the credits there is always usually a miniclip to reveal if there is a second movie they are going to release but what i saw was phenomenal even better than seeing a second to captain america what i saw was ofcourse the avengers miniclip trailer i got so excited and since then till the release of this movie i was so excited i couldnt sleep   onto my thoughts  this movie was exceptionally great equalling in humour action and adventure joss whedon made you feel like you were apart of this god team when i nagged my dad to go see this and he said yeah sure lets go see it i cried in my head although they couldve improved just a bit better on how they form the avengers but no hate it was still tremendous the humour in this film was huge when thor says  now listen to me loki or something then gets tackled by iron man and loki responds without thor next to him  im listening  everyone in the theatre just cracked up in laughter and also when hulk just pummels loki in stark tower and walks away like a king and says  puny god  this was absolutely hilarious the cast was ofcourse the best and only option samuel l jackson as nick fury was the one and only perfect actor to play him its like nick fury is apart of him that is why he played that role perfectly overall i honestly thought this was a exciting way to form these heroes into one team in one movie this just made my year
Aug 26 2012,positive,awesome fucking awesome
Aug 26 2012,positive,a feast for the eyes in terms of cgi effects and the stars the film flows very smoothly and all the characters fit perfectly even when theyre fighting against each other
Aug 26 2012,positive,and then captain america says hulksmash  hahaha awesome and super funny specially when hulk smashed loki while loki was trying to give a speech lmfao
Aug 26 2012,neutral,the movie was good but i found it to be kind of boring there were major periods of time with no action which made the movie move slowly also the whole story line of saving the planet was fine but i just did not think that it was overly entertaining in the films defense i had never seen thor captain america or the hulk movie which might have helped me to enjoy the movie more
Aug 26 2012,positive,it keeps getting more awesome everytime i watch it
Aug 26 2012,positive,even if your not a comicbook fan you will unltimately love this film
Aug 26 2012,positive,see this is what a comic book adaptation action movie with a plot looks like are you taking notes micheal bay
Aug 26 2012,positive,the best action packed movie i have ever seen
Aug 26 2012,positive,captain americas ugly costume design ugh
Aug 26 2012,positive,going to have to watch it again for my own reasons
Aug 26 2012,positive,while not the greatest film of all time the avengers delivers all the hype bulit up in 50 years since its first comic an all star cast incredible action sequences good dialogue and large amounts of humor joss whedon has surpassed all standards that the past films in the marvel cinematic universe have made overall the avengers is the defining example of a true comicbook film made real
Aug 26 2012,positive,great it is my favorite comic book film character interactions at the same time the action scenes where amazing
Aug 26 2012,positive,the best super hero film ever  ace
Aug 26 2012,positive,avengers was great cant wait for the hulk to have a new movie
Aug 26 2012,positive,maybe the best movie in 2012
Aug 26 2012,positive,a top flight movie in its own right and even better as pure comic book escapism
Aug 26 2012,negative,except for some good cgi nothing ground breaking here just the same old theme that we are used to seeing in super hero movies in the end the superheroes accomplish everything they had to without sacrificing even one bit seriously tired of this shit for gods sake introduce something new to this genre like nolan did
Aug 26 2012,positive,this movie really whips the llamas ass
Aug 26 2012,positive,i own this on dvd and bluray
Aug 26 2012,positive,the culmination of marvels phase one does not disappoint bringing us exhilarating action great writing and unparalleled chemistry between the cast the bar has been set for every comic book movie to come
Aug 26 2012,positive,massive film very well done witty humour but the only problem is that avengers 2 will have to top it
Aug 26 2012,positive,too much action too little plot
Aug 26 2012,positive,99 satisfiedtremendous fun
Aug 26 2012,positive,after sitting through the morose and plodding dark knight rises the other week it pleases me to say that whedons extravagant and kinetic super hero romp exceeds its hype to produce one of the finest comic book adaptations to date the script by whedon and zak penn utilises the avengers legacy to give flesh to the characters while adding his own brand of fan boy humour to the proceedings eschewing the normal opening action set piece whedon instead steadily builds up the tension keeping the superheroics at bay while outlining lokis threat to the planet in doing away with the normally requisite exposition the dialogue is allowed to breathe especially during the many ego clashes while giving each of the characters space to develop playing on each heros strengths and weaknesses banners anger management issues and captain americas dudley doright persona among them the script fairly crackles with quips and witty repartee to such a degree that i could have listened to them bicker for another hour on the technical side the digital mayhem is rendered in comic book style too the art directors astutely plundering the original comics to pour vivid energy into finelychoreographed setpieces especially the jawdropping alien invasion finale performances are uniformly terrific with special mention going to the pairing of ruffalo and downey jnr whose scenes together are pure comedic gold although there are a couple of dud scenes usually involving the bland black widow andor hawkeye the overall result is a satisfying and brisklypaced piece of entertainment that leaves bat man looking like the gloomy emo he is if further evidence is needed that the dark days of comic movies are over avengers more than provides the proof of their demise highly recommended
Aug 26 2012,positive,it was mediocre i kept falling asleep
Aug 26 2012,positive,like a superior state of the art model built from reconstituted parts joss whedons buoyant witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash up is escapism of a sophisticated order boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143 minute teamorigin story
Aug 26 2012,neutral,what a load of nonsense even transformers 3 is better than this p
Aug 26 2012,positive,very easy to watch exactly what you expect apart for the useless comedy bits guy playing 8bit computer game would of liked to see more ruffalo getting mad
Aug 26 2012,positive,a movie filled mostly by action sequences is hard to enjoy these days but yes we still sometimes get a rare experience like this
Aug 26 2012,positive,wanna make a superheroes movie just call josh d
Aug 26 2012,positive,in all reality a very average and routine movie made great by cgi eye candy and downeyâtms acting
Aug 26 2012,positive,absolutely loved it impatiently waiting for the next one 
Aug 26 2012,positive,the avengers is a lot like a high class hooker both cost a lot to put together and definitely look phenomenal but after the experience you cant help but feel a little empty its armed with an abundance of very snappy dialogue from its starstudded cast however for each gem there are 3 lame lines 2 over descriptions of obvious plot points and a lengthy dull speech about every 15mins robert downey jnr carries this film and having talented friends to play with certainly does make him all the funnier the action sequences themselves are exciting visually impressive and will make comic book movie fanboys cream themselves faster than the aforementioned lady of the night  all this put together makes for a solid 2 and a half hours of brain dead fun but little else this nerd porn gets a solid 3 stars
Aug 26 2012,positive,probably one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen
Aug 26 2012,positive,if i can give this movie a 10 star rating i would anthony stark aka ironman aka the first amored avenger is the fin super hero out there stan lee who ever gave you this idea is the worlds greatest much love  benito caballero
Aug 25 2012,positive,great fun at the cinema absurd yes but who gives a shit
Aug 25 2012,neutral,this movie is so longi dont have the patience for these sorts of things a month after seeing it i dont remember any particular story theme or payoff outside of iron man i dont have a relationship with most of the characters either so were relying mostly on cinematics to impress as an audience member i enjoyed watching the first transformers in theaters more than i enjoyed this
Aug 25 2012,positive,great movie and i am a huge hulk fan and the hulk looked and played bad ass in the movie with all the other characters
Aug 25 2012,positive,one of the greatest comic book movie adaptions of all time fun funny and full of awesome action
Aug 25 2012,positive,surprisingly fantastic there should never be that many good looking people on one screen
Aug 25 2012,positive,so action packed
Aug 25 2012,positive,as if i didnt expect this movie to spend 40 minutes in that ship with rdj yapping it is hilarious but then at the end bam you get a transformer length battle to kill off the rest of the time
Aug 25 2012,positive,while not boring wasnt engrossing at all more formulaic superhero overrated nonsense with few redeeming values aside from its cgi grandiose action spectacle
Aug 25 2012,positive,best movie of summer 12
Aug 25 2012,positive,this is everything a summer film should be super hero films dont get any better than this
Aug 25 2012,positive,it all comes back to whedon  his clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled his unexpected knack for action choreography his funny tender immaculately constructed script and ultimately  never underestimate the entertainment value of the hulk smash
Aug 25 2012,positive,i actually have to say i expected this to look much better i think that any of the transformers and captain america or thor look better than this ensemble movie in particular the big scenes in the city looks kind of cheap but apart this the movie is amazing it features a great cast and its fun jeremy renner is an amazing new entry i cant wait for the sequel to come out i would probably also add that is better if you watch thor captain america and the two iron man and hulk before watching avengers
Aug 25 2012,positive,watchin it on dvd great film
Aug 25 2012,positive,cap vs thor thor vs hulk
Aug 25 2012,neutral,the avengers is rather comical than serious which i cant say i didnt expect its your typical super hero movie with plenty of action special effects predictable plots good looking super heroes and scarlett johansson my favorite was the hulk only when he in his green state though there are two incredibly funny sequences one being the hulk in his original state arriving on a little scooter in a war zone and the second being when he is challenged by the main villain loki tom hiddleston i always enjoy super hero flicks so it was fun but it needed a better villain and a more dynamic climax to be fully satisfying below average at best
Aug 25 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies of the year
Aug 25 2012,positive,is what it is  comic fun  watchable
Aug 25 2012,positive,i wanna watch it over and over again
Aug 25 2012,positive,so good it deserved 5 stars
Aug 25 2012,positive,you got to love the hulk
Aug 25 2012,positive,average no real stand out moments nothing memorable a real disappointment all the other films leading up to this were better plus side the hulk was good
Aug 25 2012,positive,i seen this 3 times the 1st week it came out awesome
Aug 25 2012,positive,lamest villain among all superhero films least mindful among all superhero films  yet among the most fun of all superhero films
Aug 25 2012,positive,first of all and obviously it is a greatly talented cast that perform awesomely its comedicdramaaction ratio is very tolerable and applause worthy very nicely scripted meaning the way all of the characters story lines crossed over was pretty magnificent except for some loosen edges but still pretty entertaining expectations bar are officially raised for the amazing spidermanincluding sequel
Aug 25 2012,positive,wanted to put this one up ages ago but didnt have the time s  anyways  this movie was entirely mehhhh for me  didnt have a great plot which to some extent is forgivable cause its a supherosuperheros movie afterall no noe expects dark knight quality here but its just not as great as ppl make it out to seem dont get me wrong  i like explosions and good cgi effects as any other guy but its just over used  till it gets to the point of tedium  props to samuelljackson for doing some good work as nick fury his character was badly written but he played it well  the reason why this movie was fun other than the action was because its not too serious and the jokes work very well to make the movie fun instead of another mindless cgi fest read any transformers movie   in the end 35  good work by robert downey jr but a stand out performance by mark ruffalo and his character the hulk
Aug 24 2012,positive,msswagg to the rescue
Aug 24 2012,positive,waiting for pt 23  4 great stellar fantastic
Aug 24 2012,positive,thought they were pretty conservative like in the first iron man still plenty of fun though
Aug 24 2012,positive,great movie really fun to watch and very emjoyable lots of action and oneliners same simple nonevolving plot found in most marvel movies but also same awesomeness found in most marvel movies
Aug 24 2012,positive,amazing movie definately one of my favorites everything was awesome and the action scenes were intense and just plain sic
Aug 24 2012,positive,i just dont know why people so love it
Aug 24 2012,positive,just brilliant enough said
Aug 24 2012,positive,the hulk is awesome xd
Aug 24 2012,positive,why did i watch men in black 3 at the cinema instead of this
Aug 24 2012,positive,beauitfully down movie with all the comic relief and action seqences excepted in marvel movies i loved the second i saw it i was a big fan of the old tv series as well and this was good for it
Aug 24 2012,positive,naai 10 stars ani wanna watch karun august29 in theaters again daw
Aug 24 2012,positive,i almost preordered this movie but then i decided that going to a midnight release would be more fun the avengers franchise is growing more than ever and this movie is just another rung on the ladder of success
Aug 24 2012,positive,summer blockbuster bread and butter looks great entertains from start to finish
Aug 24 2012,positive,the best thing about the avengers is that it is fun it isnt serious or intellectual but it will give you a smile
Aug 24 2012,positive,stan lee is genius marvel should have bought spiderman on board 
Aug 24 2012,positive,fun film very much a predictable superhero flick but manages to entertain with good acting and exciting action i will say i couldnt care less about the archer hawkeye robert downey jr does a great job reprising his role as tony stark iron man but for the third time in recent cinema they desperately attempt to find an actor for bruce banner hulk it doesnt work as this new guy is completely charisma free otherwise this was an enjoyable summer action film
Aug 24 2012,positive,wordscannotsuffice
Aug 24 2012,positive,i like this flick it has some great actors and actresses it has some great scenery it has great cgi and effects it is a very big movie big in budget big in roles big in effects and big in every way actually super heroes are great and super villains to in almost every form they come and appear not all avengers are represented evenly but they all have they special part and role in this film and it will be wrong to under estimate the entertainment value of ironman blowing things up or the hulk smashing stuff  it is a good story there are lot of great effects and the action is what it is all about and that is all great but putting so many heroes in one flick can seem a bit to much and eventhough the film last 2 hours and 22 minutes it seems like there isnt enough time to feature them all and keeping the steam up
Aug 24 2012,positive,loved it i felt the first 30 minutes could have been better iron man stole the show
Aug 23 2012,positive,absolutely loved it action flicks dont get much better than this hulk smash
Aug 23 2012,positive,loved it slow at first but good
Aug 23 2012,positive,great action lots of fun
Aug 23 2012,positive,family friendly action with fleeting moments of humour but with only one major villain a tad one sided
Aug 23 2012,positive,everything about this movie was perfect by far my favorite movie of the year
Aug 23 2012,positive,one of the best movie experiences ever and after generations and generations this will be the indiana jones star wars or back to the future movie classic this movie is action packed and never boring its just one of those movies where you can watch all over again and all over again and youll never get bored action is terrific script is witty and surprisingly really funny check it out its my favorite movie of the year so far and in my opinon it tops the dark knight rises
Aug 23 2012,positive,this movie is so frkn good i love it  3
Aug 23 2012,positive,top notch bit of action some wild sfx
Aug 23 2012,negative,very boring and dragging one of the worse super hero films it tries to be funny to make you laugh at times but i just cant
Aug 23 2012,positive,the best comic book movie of all time   this like the john lennon of comic book movies  legendary
Aug 23 2012,positive,all action no story
Aug 23 2012,positive,one of the best comictomovie movies ive seen it hits all the right beats of a comic book has good characterization and surprisingly good acting in it  the plot is a little weak and a bit simplistic tom hiddleston and mark ruffalo needed much more time on screen as they both do a superb job i would actually have preferred a lot less rdj i would have preferred that the plot not use the kill the puppeteer and the puppets all stop working plot device and spent more time on the heroes actually saving people and cleaning up afterward  the other thing that would be nice would to have a stronger female presence especially as one of the heroes hawkeye was fine but you already had black widow so adding a ms marvel wasp firestar or even a tigra would have balanced out the testosterone nicely my vote would have been for wasp  if you like action movies comic book movies or scifi movies youll probably like this one enough time is spent allowing each character to shine that youre bound to find a character you like to follow through the movie  t
Aug 23 2012,positive,its actually pretty goodtheres a good balance of action and talkingthe humour is good the music is disappointing however and just follows a lot of other scores that to be honest have also been disappointing
Aug 23 2012,positive,almost busted a gut at the hulk scene you know which one friggin awesome
Aug 23 2012,positive,if you didnt like this movie then there is something definitely wrong with you its all the blockbuster movies wrapped up into one dream team
Aug 23 2012,positive,i honestly thought it might be just too much material for a single movie but somehow it works great vfx acting and it also has a soul
Aug 23 2012,positive,my life we complete when i saw this movie
Aug 23 2012,positive,id grown tired of all the build up to this film as it just made all the individual films feel insiginificant to what would come here  im pleased to say i was surprised at how entertaining it was  the trick is in the fact that the stronger actors downey jnr ruffalo johansson  jackson could really paper over the cracks left by the weaker step forward hemsworth evans  to some degree renner  you could say it was playing safe to do this as the pros would always outweigh its cons its a simple enough story hugely similar to dark of the moon in both action sequence  plot  save earth from the imminent attack of alien beings led by lokihiddlestone  its really that simple  at first a reluctant team soon become one after some inhouse bickering and whos the best competition become the planets last line of defence  they do this well  sure its cheesy but reasonable cheese effectswise its way above the average even the hulk seems more convincing  wryly humorous especially one little scene with thor bright breezy and it will of course go on
Aug 23 2012,positive,perfect story well chosen cast one word to saysexy
Aug 23 2012,positive,epic cant wait for part two
Aug 23 2012,positive,im not one to wax intellectual on comic books seeing how the only comic books i have ever really read were archie comics and thats only because my dad would get us burger king when we were younger and wed sit in the parking lot the only thing we had to do was read archie wheres my archie movie i bet that would break records  its safe to say i enjoyed this movie it had a solid cast and hell they did a great job of tying in all the little nuances from each individual movie its a hard concept to actually visualize and it would be very easy to muck up but in my opinion they did a pretty good job it didnt seemed too forced there were some cheesy parts hulk smash that line made me cringe a little it just seemed forced but hey its a block buster comic book movie there has to be some cheese strewn about here and there its pretty much inevitable i would say i usually am a fan of robert downey jr but for some odd reason he made me dislike him in this movie and i dont really get why because in iron man i loved his performance that being said i think mark ruffalos performance as the hulk was superb he seemed to portray the man at odds with the beast inside him very well overall this movie was great and it was a perfect blowout of my summer   ps scarlett johanson was extremely sexy in this movie i was enamored by her suit
Aug 23 2012,positive,surely the best superhero movie ive ever seen
Aug 22 2012,positive,brilliantly directed by joss whedon
Aug 22 2012,positive,all superheroes in one movie and the humor makes me laugh out loud
Aug 22 2012,positive,i want to c that one to
Aug 22 2012,positive,average super hero flick with a lot of super hype great cast boring plot cool visuals wonder what could have been if they hadnt relied on the quantity of stars and brought in a quality scriptsee the dark knight trilogy
Aug 22 2012,positive,its good but too overrated
Aug 22 2012,positive,best superhero movie to date amazing stuff
Aug 22 2012,positive,allstars movies usually work this one makes no exception
Aug 22 2012,positive,style over substance movie but still it was a good entertainer 
Aug 22 2012,positive,loved this one hulk was bad ass puny gods
Aug 22 2012,positive,three stars might seem low but you might notice it is an above average score its over 25 its a fine movie the individual captain america iron man 1 and thor movies were better but this was still an alright movie really
Aug 22 2012,negative,wayyy wayyy wayyy overrated everything is just so unrealistic and overplayed unenjoyable movie if  you are over 16 or you are just pure fiction geek
Aug 22 2012,positive,and there came a day unlike any other when earths mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat on that day the avengers were bornon the silver screen  for 4 years we have been treated to the works of marvel studios we have seen the likes of the iron man the hulk thor and captain america all come to the big screen and make names for themselves though each film has been able to stand alone there has always been one thing circling each film the inevitable team up now with director joss whedon at the helm the wait is finally over with so much riding on this film did the superhero team up live up to the hype wait no longer as it is time to assemble the review of marvels the avengers    the story of the avengers deals with what else the formation of the avengers iron man captain america thor and hulk team up to take on loki who means to bring war to the earth in the hopes to rule over the human race as their king the films major theme is of course bringing these heroes together and it does terrific job at making the idea a reality the script of the avengers creates enough depth and conflict in the plot to keep you interested from the beginning to the end  there is no denying that the movie is action oriented but thankfully the writier never forgets the relevance of storytelling    the avengers features a grand cast full of reprisals and newcomers the likes of robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth and scarlett johansson among others return to their roles continuing and continue to develop then there are newcomers such as mark rufallo as bruce banner and jeremy renner as hawkeye these two prove that they belong in this cast as they play both parts respectively   this cast is an ensemble personified each character gets enough screen time and development in the film giving everyone a purpose for being in this movie the different combinations of performances made this cast stronger and really made for one the best ensemble i have seen for quite some time     the movie is an action oriented film and trust me you will receive your money worth in that regard there is enough action in this film for everyone as it the movie does a terrific job giving a variety of action as well putting detail into sequences there are also several funny moments in the movie but they are all in context and blends well with some of the films more tensed scenes yet among everything that makes this movie great one of the more impressive feats is being able to mix the individual films traits and combining them to create a united atmosphere     the avengers was four years in the making and it exceeded expectations yes the film has a ton of action but the movie never forgets the relevance of storytelling and characters  it mixes everything that each film accomplished and manages to make it work in one feature presentation this film is for both comic book fans and movie goers alike and it is everything a comic book film should be it rivals the like of the dark knight as the avengers is in fact the perfect comic book film
Aug 22 2012,positive,excellent awesome impressive a good example of how to put different superheroes into one movie without being another cliche
Aug 22 2012,positive,noticeable bloopers still a movie ill enjoy for years to come thanks stan lee for sharing your world with us
Aug 22 2012,positive,pure undiluted entertainmentfun to watchfull action drama comedy sfx pure masala
Aug 22 2012,positive,the avengers presents one of the most ambitious concepts of our time by combining all of marvels best comic book superheroes into one huge blockbuster film while at times the script seems excessively slow compared to marvels previous superhero productions and leaves you wondering whether the film will overcome the characters problems with themselves the last half much like christopher nolans final batman installment doesnt disappoint impressive special effects and large scale battle sequences deliver a satisfying result  great acting and well done action makes this marvels best superhero production yet but in all honesty marvel still cant compar to the brilliance of nolans batman trilogy
Aug 22 2012,positive,its the usual super hero movie well whitout anything really good the story is flat but its the action its good for a sunday afternoon
Aug 22 2012,positive,this is an epic superhero film better then i expected it is over two hours long but it is so engrossing that it feels shorter the special effects were top notch as well as the directing this movie set the bar for furture superhero movies 5 stars
Aug 22 2012,positive,very funny but imho the weakest of the franchise
Aug 22 2012,positive,all i saw was buildings crushing car destroying and people screaming totally overrated movie
Aug 22 2012,neutral,avengers tranformers 3 initiative
Aug 22 2012,positive,it was a good movie no need for 3d
Aug 22 2012,positive,great film from start to finish
Aug 22 2012,positive,stocked to the brim with action and a great cast but the story line was dull and unoriginal aliens invade manhattan super heroes save the day crazy
Aug 22 2012,positive,very good didt like scarlett though
Aug 22 2012,positive,possibly one of the greatest movies of all time
Aug 22 2012,positive,robert downey as ironman is as funny and quick thinker as he was in ironman  ironman 2 movie one of the surprising package is mark ruffalo his 1st movie as hulk hulk nt only destroys every alien spacecraft into half bt also adds humour to his actions especially when he manhandled loki captain america chris evans does full justice to his character  his acrobatics are just awesome  no nonsense chris hemsworth as thor is another superhero to watch thor is as unpredictable as hulk bt a demo god fighting for earth is just mindblowing it is the biggest blockbuster of summer  i think it will end as the biggest blockbuster of 2012 waiting for avengers 2 to hit the theatres
Aug 21 2012,positive,breathtaking  the best marvel movie ever
Aug 21 2012,positive,action packed the execution was a little dry some charm from the characters but not enough hawkeye is a waste of screentime loki didnt quite measure up for a bad guy
Aug 21 2012,positive,its awesome but the story is soso
Aug 21 2012,positive,up there with the best comic book films of all time  after all the narrative buildup from previous marvel flicks many of the comic book companys greatest superheroes finally meet to defend the earth from loki tom hiddleston its an appropriate climax to an exciting if minor longrunning multifilm story arc thankfully what could have been a silly bloated overlycontrived mess is handled quite competently by buffy the vampire slayers joss whedon action drama and humor are all balanced wonderfully here and each character except perhaps hawkeye played by jeremy renner is given appropriate character development and screentime each action setpiece is fun and even the talkie exposition scenes are enjoyablewith witty dialogue and clever winks to the fans   theres not much that i can offer as far as negative criticism is concerned i would however admit that the film doesnt quite reach the epic heights that it could have despite the shots of citywide destruction much of the action feels too containedtoo confined to very specific locations in my opinion theres rarely a sense that the world as we know it is really in danger not even the panicing masses as few of them as we see engender any kind of sympathy over their apparent peril theyre just out of sight collateral damage caught in a war among gods our heroes might as well be fighting in an abandoned city like they do in the transformers movies  the alien creatures making up lokis army arent very well rendered either i never feel like these are living breathing beings actually interacting with our world its very poor cgiespecially when compared to what they did with the hulk  theres some very cheesy dialogue in the avengers as well one particular example comes from tony iron man stark robert downey jr as he gives a groaninducing speech to loki about how the avengers are destined to take down the evil god one way or another we have a hulk im sure lots of fanboys dig it but it makes me want to puke its unfortunate given other examples of whedons signature wit in the films script that the writerdirector feels the need to stoop to such pandering  overall its a great comic book film that is quite groundbreaking in its ability to juggle so many moving parts incorporating plots from other films melding different established styles the merging of such varied characters from their own specific worlds etc into a cohesive film with its own specific style heres hoping for many more of these
Aug 21 2012,positive,its just so awesome
Aug 21 2012,positive,the movie is excellent and the last scene after the credits was very funny made me laugh  altogether a really great fun movie lots of action worth seeing
Aug 21 2012,positive,loved this movie so much
Aug 21 2012,positive,a fascinating film of epic proportions
Aug 21 2012,positive,best film all summer probably all year love the director
Aug 21 2012,positive,an outstanding film and probably one of my favourite super hero movies of all time to date amazing special effects and acting and yes it may be slow to get going but you know they have to build a story right it cant just be all out action from minute one i loved the characters the interactions between all the characters and i loved the comedy moments that actually had me burst out laughing there were not many of them this is an action movie after all but when they did happen it made it all the more hilarious joss whedon completely hit this one out of the park entertainment at its best
Aug 21 2012,positive,they went to stuttgart germany but i didnt see any familiar buildingsstreets from it 
Aug 21 2012,positive,by far the best action movie ever i would give it 3 thumbs up if i could 
Aug 21 2012,positive,a little all over the place saved by the charm of robert downey other than that confusing and messy
Aug 21 2012,positive,a spectacular superhero film that takes itself seriously but not to seriously which is exactly what they were going for marvels the avengers is even more than you expected with its brilliant plottouching subplotsgreat actingand amazing direction the avengers is no doubt one of the best if not the best superhero movie ever made
Aug 21 2012,positive,im not a comic book reader but i have enjoyed the films based on comic books for example i really enjoyed the christopher reeves superman films a few of the batmans spidermans and i loved iron man i liked the new thor and captain america films im not a big fan of fantastic four or wolverine with all that said i have to  rank this film just below the original superman the batman with jack as the joker and batman begins this is an excellent very well done film not just a comic film but film the special fx were awesome as was the plot robert downey jr is great as ironman i love his role anyway i recommend this film as it is fun smart and has scarlett johansen in a tight leather jumpsuit
Aug 21 2012,positive,topnotch action exceptional
Aug 21 2012,positive,its not like the avengers break whole new ground or any new ground but oh boy dont the single superhero films look boring now
Aug 21 2012,positive,all through the film the person i sympathized was lokihahaha gr8 movie which shares screen spaces for all the super heroes and their characterisation  five out of five
Aug 21 2012,positive,seen very hi fightingsmall plot wait till credits finish a little teaser after
Aug 21 2012,positive,this is it i just wanted to see a superhero movie you know that is heroic i laughed i got angry i enjoyed the actions love the hulk and his humanityway to go marvel 
Aug 21 2012,positive,it is such a treat for a comic book fan to see the characters that they grew up with successfully make the transition to movies  all i can hope for now is that they buy away the rights of the silver surfer from that pos fantastic 4 franchise  the actor who played the hulk did an excellent job of capturing the mannerisms of a scientist  he reminded me of all of my biology and chemistry teachers from college  him and loki were better in this film than in their previous reincarnations
Aug 21 2012,positive,this was the best of the superhero  comic book hero movies yet
Aug 20 2012,positive,fantastic movie but now that ive seen the dark knight rises i kinda feel like a lil more depth to this movie would have been nice still however good movie for entertainment value
Aug 20 2012,positive,was great in 3d
Aug 20 2012,positive,its no dark knight but it is the best marvel film to date
Aug 20 2012,positive,comical action packed terrific screenplay the combination of three seperate movies over a few years is simply amazing this awe struck film is a masterpiece that will not be surpassed by superhero movies in years bravo
Aug 20 2012,positive,yup it lives up to the expectations and hulk youre awesome 
Aug 20 2012,positive,my my mr whedon so we meet again
Aug 20 2012,negative,absolute waste of time
Aug 20 2012,negative,not as good as everyone says it is but entertaining
Aug 20 2012,positive,avengers assemble oh and assemble they did in this smash hit blockbuster of the century or perhaps ever that has been in the works since 2008 our heroes all bask in the glory of their first outing in style as they each progress and accept that they are a team what was really impressive was the screenwrite written with such finece and so well done showing the progression of them all coming to accept they are a team and learning to act as one the cinematography was incredible just as everything about this movie but the cinematography really stood out for me introducing each character so effectively and never even throughout the entire 2 12 hours of footage allowing one or the other to hog the spotlight the characters were so fleshed out and well portrayed by such an incredible cast what i really loved was that each character was developed so effectively not just in this film but all the films in the past 5 years that led up to this each preparing the characters mentally for this moment this film draws so well on each characters personalities and their traits from previous films and as each personality clashes while they are becoming a team they all learn to put aside their differences to unite against a greater problem the transition from bickering heroes to a team was so well done while each hero would usually anchor all the films direction and hold the story up single handedly no single one had to carry to much weight and each successfully held up the film together as a team full of incredible imagery cinematography and direction it makes you believe in them and want to root for them not just because their the good guys but while this is mostly consisted of action the film is so wonderfully peppered with those little emotional ties that attach us to each character and make us want them to succeed this film packs such a punch except this time it aint hitler whose taking the blow its the other films opening this week who will feel its force because it was just so outstandingly done packed with action believable emotion and performances and comedy somehow each joke was incredibly effective grossing an insane amount of laughs and was never a flop and no matter how dire the situation their never afraid to crack a joke but it was not just jokes that were drawn from the huge crowds but applause not just at the end but throughout the whole film such a great time at the movies with so many fanboy nods this film is perfect for all out marvel fans and non fans alike making it easy for us all to put aside our differences and assemble against a common goal the no 1 spot in the box office overall the best experience you could ever possibly have at a theater for now because this was only the beginning as we all anxiously await the next few years with marvels schedule consisting of iron man 3 capt america 2 and thor 2 which will all hopefully lead up to the avengers 2 just as the others led up to this film and we cant ever forget the final shot of the film before the credits the most memorable and meaningful shot in film history containing the most memorable letter in film history as tony and pepper are remodeling stark tower with the broken sign zooming out to show us just one letter a letter that withstands the entire force of an alien army a
Aug 20 2012,positive,much better than expected
Aug 20 2012,positive,the best movie that marvel has ever made i loved the way each character was completely relevant to the story you got the captain giving them all orders which is what his character is made to do because hes a soldier thor is using that hammer to no end iron man is flying around blasting aliens even the hulk was relevant i was afraid that because the hulk film franchise hasnt done as well that they wouldnt use him very much but he is freakin awesome in this movie scarlett is there to look at which is always her only purpose and she does it well hawkeye is like if legolas and katniss everdeen had a baby that combines both of their awesomeness joss whedon is my hero and this movie is definitely the start of something even greater grade a
Aug 20 2012,positive,a spectacle in the grandest sense of the word  hulk rulez
Aug 20 2012,positive,absolutely spectacular
Aug 20 2012,positive,absolutely loved this film marvel has proven you can bring super heroes together successfully into a movie and make it work for everyone now lets make a dragonball series
Aug 20 2012,positive,i know that people may look at me strangely for saying this but i wasnt a big fan of this the movies long and the first half isnt all interesting i hate the fact that they chose loki as the bad guy in this film i mean come on there are so many better marvel vilans out there in the comic book world and sitting in a theatre listing to chris hemsworths voice for 2 hours just makes this movie less and less interesting the action is great but the first half was just a big chunk of my time wasted
Aug 20 2012,positive,very well done and delivers on almost all fronts one of the better superhero movies in the last few years and the cast are very good
Aug 20 2012,positive,marvel studios pulled this off really well great combination of action laughs and story the best marvel movie by far
Aug 20 2012,positive,so good you wanna watch it twice
Aug 20 2012,positive,the avengers is a perfect superhero movie of the year putting heroes altogether and this filmhad great acting scenes funny scenes that would make you laugh and the avemgers have a lot of that put into this film it was 2hrs 15min estimate but this film was good if you havent seen it i recommend its a must see movie
Aug 20 2012,positive,absolutely amazing film and exciting to watch very huge fan of tom hiddleston and robert downey jr
Aug 20 2012,positive,it was okay not as spectacular as what people said the action was great the storyline was meh the characters are well if youve seen iron man captain america and thor youd know how the actors would act i gotta say i only enjoyed watching the last 20 minutes of the movie
Aug 20 2012,positive,great movie had everything in it beat mty expectaions by a long run
Aug 20 2012,positive,finally saw this much hyped marvel installment and i have to say i was not disappointed  its probably the best superhero movie ive ever seen  great pace tight witty dialogue incredible special effects and a very satisfying ending  it was only hours later as i thought about the film that i realized how simplistic the storyline was which i suppose the mark of a well thought out superhero film  the only thing the avengers was missing for me was a tight throat emotive moment  hence the 4 12 star rating  i actually cant wait to see it again in bluray on a proper big screen tv
Aug 20 2012,positive,the avengers is everything you would hope it to be fun exciting epic and often times hilarious not only that but its most impressively extremely well balanced with about 6 major characters they all are equally involved in the film its smart and absolutely thrilling and its the most fun youll have at the movies all summer
Aug 20 2012,positive,this movie was excellent it had everything you want from a superhero movie the action scenes are not old overused but rather interesting and refreshing and powerful mustwatch
Aug 20 2012,positive,what a fantastic movie all me favourite marvel characters in one movie brill movie
Aug 20 2012,neutral,this flick is pure and harmless fun  and of course  the action scenes were great  nevertheless the avengers gives us nothing new about the characters  has a very predictable story and tries to show us a lot more than it could handle
Aug 20 2012,positive,i loved the build up in all the characters movies to get to this one it rolls in together so well 
Aug 20 2012,positive,joss is a great presenting all the characters part in this movie nonetheless he also present a few funny fight scenes between the characters
Aug 20 2012,neutral,expected so much more from this average blockbuster i am just gonna totally bitch about this film cuz i did not like it and didnt understand why people are so hyped about this film good stuff costumes were excellent true to the comics and tom hiddleston saved the whole show from crumbling i am not sure if the film was aiming for a set design that pays homage to the 50s or just plain awful storyline was basically nonexistent or simply too weak to have any significance acting from everyone else was pretty melodramatic no character development but bickering and loads of lame jokes camera work was quite crappy in the beginning but slowly got better with the one continuous shot of everyone fighting then gone back to standard transformer type of work iron man close ups killed me deeply they were awful and paltrow the horrible actress killed him completely with her bad acting and dialogue joss whedon should be ashamed for his script it was so ridiculous and not funny at all plot holes were everywhere a few examples are captain america and human torch are the same people xmen were the first super heroes not hulk mortals cant fight with gods family cliche drama and crappy unemotional lines more action and less cheese would allow me to give the film a higher rating
Aug 19 2012,negative,i fell asleep the first half of the movie the action came near the end and the end was not a big thing a long film that show us the expected
Aug 19 2012,positive,fantastic awesome having everyone together and that makes fights more epic seems like some characters are stronger hulk seems way overpowered and hawkeye seems useless thought the council was kind of cheesy felt their response was so canned happened in resident evil 2 alien vs predator requiem lets just nuke everything if we cant win stupid
Aug 19 2012,positive,fun movie with some clever scenes
Aug 19 2012,negative,super power party hehe is not my thing one star to the alien dragons
Aug 19 2012,positive,one of the best movies ever
Aug 19 2012,positive,this was another movie that i could not wait for it to come out in theaters and was hoping and praying it would be as awesome as it could be  i was not disappointed in the least  the avengers was amazing and totally entertaining  as expected robert downey jr was a riot as tony stark and to my great pleasure the hulk was hilarious as well  my only very slight complaint was that the edward norton didnt come back as bruce banner because i hate when movies change up actors for the same role unless its a reboot of course  however i must say that mark ruffalo was a better fit as banner compared to norton and i was pleased with his performance  this was the probably the best movie ive seen since the dark knight and i absolutely cannot wait for avengers 2
Aug 19 2012,positive,surprisingly funny i really enjoyed it
Aug 19 2012,positive,best movie ever seriously new favorite likely to stay that way except maybe until avengers 2
Aug 19 2012,positive,its no dark knight but still great
Aug 19 2012,positive,joss whedon  joss whedon  amazing
Aug 19 2012,positive,great superhero movie
Aug 19 2012,positive,daft but good fun hulk stole the show
Aug 19 2012,positive,yo yo sick dope real dope1 of the summer 2012
Aug 19 2012,positive,nice movie i really enjoyed it watching everything come into place
Aug 19 2012,positive,if one likes this sort of movie its every bit as good as youve heard
Aug 19 2012,positive,the avengers is the summer blockbuster this year nothing came close to matching it on script action and plot the characters are perfect the acting tense and spot on and the action sets especially the end is a thing of masterpiece all hail josh whedon
Aug 19 2012,positive,sure its entertaining at times it becomes unintentionally hilarious how the movie tries to justify all the crazy things that the superhero team concept implies if you take it too seriously but no this movie does not ultimately take itself too seriously and the revelation in the end is quite rewarding to any marvel fan
Aug 19 2012,positive,man those aliens were weak as hell standard superhero fare
Aug 19 2012,positive,very good much better than i thought it would be everyone plays their apart and except for the boring captain america each is amusing or interesting  of course the highlight has to be the hulk with one standout moment making me roll off the sofa laughing and having to replay the scene 3 times
Aug 19 2012,positive,i would be dumb to give it anything less than 5 stars so much anticipation and marvel delivered 100 and the best part its only phase one baby
Aug 19 2012,positive,i can only say one word about itamazing
Aug 18 2012,positive,loved it this is how action movies should be made cant wait to pick up the blu ray and watch it again
Aug 18 2012,positive,great writing from joss whedon and great acting from all of them  i just dont get hawkeye
Aug 18 2012,positive,a comic book brought to life joss whedon has a gift for epic movies and an uncanny ability to bring together characters quickly so far the best movie of 2012
Aug 18 2012,positive,eh     not my kinda movie but sat through the whole 2 hours and 22 minutes of superhero action       not a genre of movies that i care for but was just ok in my book   nothing spectacular nothing exciting but if you are a superheroes marvel or like this type of movie that you would probably like it
Aug 18 2012,positive,pretty decent super hero film but i know nothing about the history of the comic books i only ever knew iron man because he looked cool when i was a kid and the first iron man movie turned out to be good i assume all the love for it is based on the fact that it stays loyal to its comic book roots but if you are like me and are not a comic book fan then what you will see is a slightly above average comic book film still not on par with any of nolans batman films
Aug 18 2012,positive,honestly i didnt really enjoy this movie as much as i thought i would do the first hour and a half was just check out my sweet directing chops showofferey and the story or complete lack of was atrocious if it wasnt for downey jnrs iron man yet again being amazing and that fight in manhattan id only be giving this 12 stars roll on iron man 3 i say meh
Aug 18 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Aug 18 2012,positive,now thats epic and full of epic
Aug 18 2012,positive,awesome movie just excellent and fun from start to finish
Aug 18 2012,positive,this is truely one of the best films of the year bar none action special effects and the acting wasnt bad either so this true hits the mark  1010  but then theres the expenderbles 2 to come yet
Aug 18 2012,positive,a whole lot of fun  loved this one  this is probably one of the best super hero movies out there
Aug 18 2012,positive,powerful and destructive may be the best marvel movie
Aug 18 2012,positive,this was a really good movie
Aug 18 2012,positive,i freaking love the hulk
Aug 18 2012,positive,a little drawn out in places but overall entertaining
Aug 18 2012,positive,i wish i could give it more stars i didnt want it to end
Aug 18 2012,positive,joss whedon truly outdid himself on this latest endeavor of man partialman super man god and the supernatural  the set pieces are spectacular however those are easily outshined by the clever script and the interactions between the heros themselves  i am looking forward to the second installment and i have faith that mr whedon can surpass the first
Aug 18 2012,positive,the best marvel movie that i have ever seen
Aug 18 2012,positive,greatest movie ever
Aug 18 2012,positive,the new hulk is awesome the movie has a lot of good superheroes but they really did a good job with the new hulk persona a lot of fun and great visual always angry was my favorite
Aug 17 2012,positive,storyline is all over the place but damn they look good in tights
Aug 17 2012,neutral,good attempt to string together all the marvel characters but the plot could have been better
Aug 17 2012,positive,havent had this much fun watching a movie ever
Aug 17 2012,positive,blockbuster done right one of the funniest movies this year hulk owns
Aug 17 2012,positive,marvel studios has been gearing up for this film everything marvel had been working towards over the past 5 years has led to this perhaps the biggest superhero blockbuster ever made the dark knight showed us that you can bring superheroes to life in a realistic way and a dark tone dark isnt always better in my book the dark knight was a monument in cinematic breakthrough in the superhero genre but the avengers in my opinion is what a superhero film should look like and i find it to be a superior superhero film to the dark knight in almost every way  marvel did the impossible by bringing together four heroes from their respective films together for one awesome team up robert downey jr is a fantastic performance as ever as the billionaire playboy tony stark and his superhero counterpart iron man and with joss whedons witty script it gives rdj enough humor to satisfy viewers without him taking the entire show it was always a controversy when talks came in about switching edward norton and mark ruffalo for the hulk but boy did he deliver and the hulks cgi motion capture is the best hulk weve seen chris evans delivers solidly as captain america and a surprising one when compared to other roles and hemsworth muscular as always made thor once again a fun and interesting addition to the team aside from the main stars samuel l jackson as always was great as director nick fury of shield and the most surprising breakouts were scarlett johanssen as black widow which showed us she is more than just a pretty face the other is hawkeye by jeremy renner who was also fantastic  the great thing about this movie is that it has something for everyone the humor is great and used appropriately and doesnt take away from the serious moments and whedon also finds perfect balance and manages to unite these characters in a believable and smooth way that really proves to the audience that earths mightiest heroes are truly a force to be reckoned with and the end fight scene is fit in an inspiring without turning into a giant transformer movie i seriously think that everyone should see this film it is the culmination of what every superhero film should look like this film should have you leaving with a big stupid grin on your face that will take hours to get off
Aug 17 2012,positive,love love love this film
Aug 17 2012,positive,very entertaining indeed although the plot was very predictable my favorite character throughout the story is definitely the hulk
Aug 17 2012,positive,big shots come together cant say not worth it
Aug 17 2012,positive,the park is where the show beings but not where it culminates in all out grilled cheese parties
Aug 16 2012,positive,every bit of the films budget can be seen on the on the screen a big movie
Aug 16 2012,positive,awesome there are a few minor things but i can over look them
Aug 16 2012,positive,everything a summer action movie should have amazing
Aug 16 2012,positive,dont know about story but it was fun to watch
Aug 16 2012,positive,this movie rocked for me it was everything a comic book movie should be bring on the spinoffs and sequels
Aug 16 2012,positive,im sure ill get dragged through the mud by everyone who says this is the greatest film ever made but i dont care  its pretty good but hardly memorable  i admit that the special effects are incredible and groundbreaking and the story is almost but not quite successful in balancing the role of each superhero  loki is a pretty lame villain and it sucks that he has to be the main bad guy  but his otherworldly forces manage to be pretty fearsome  i am really upset over the absence of edward norton who i thought brought the most depth and humanity to the marvel series  apart from downey jr and maybe even samuel l the characters are as underdeveloped as they come  they might as well have had cardboard cut outs stand in while the actors merely dubbed their lines from a studio  thats the problem with a film that relies on cgi  it has the tendency to take even the most talented actors out of their zone  now that ive stated my qualms i will still say this is a good movie and entertaining in that turn off your brain kind of way  its on par with what i expected
Aug 16 2012,positive,ive never seen any characters past movies even so i quite enjoyed and learned a lot about american comic superheroes 
Aug 16 2012,positive,its hard not to love this movie it has 4 of the most well known and loved superheroes plus two others
Aug 16 2012,positive,and now  a party  while scientists are trying to decide what to do with tesseract  energy cube caught from the ocean during the first avenger  somewhere in a parallel universe stepbrother thor loki hiddleston who is a little earlier expelled from asgard receives from the evil new chief order to steal the cube to the earth came the chaos and destruction the order is executed tesseract kidnapped population of the planet facing imminent disaster save humanity and restore order may only eyed nick fury jackson  the head of a secret organization shield willpower gathered superheroes fighting force consisting of iron man dauniml hulk ruffalo captain america evans and black widow johansson on top of that from somewhere in the sky falls down on the heroes thor hemsworth  if ten years ago almost no one outside of the us except for geeks did not know who the thor iron man hulk and captain america now answer this question any preschooler thor  the guy with the hammer the hulk  the big green monster  captain america  stars and stripes guy with a shield and iron man  a guy with a hangover marvel studio preparing for the avengers four years consistently introducing new characters and elegantly zarifmovyvaya each story line so that the total collection of all these people in one room was not something wild and irrational manage the orchestra called joss whedon  marvels comic series mission serenity and buffy  the vampire slayer  and as it turned out for good reason for the first time got my hands on two hundred millionth budget he contrary to expectations does not convert to the late george lucas and behaves like a schoolboy caught in disneyland  the dream of a lifetime come true but life is not changed the avengers  kind of a parade of us military power in part costume party with nice friends but so smartly done that if it were possible to speak in terms like superfilm the avengers would have been just that metaphorical superfilmom johansson eloquently says my name is natasha romanoff and i  russian and then falls off the chair at downey still best in the world is sitting crumpled on friday evening jacket mark ruffalo the film goes with clenched teeth and gently picks in the computer and then suddenly turns into a green king kong you asked me why i never get angry because im angry all the time hiddleston subtle squints cardboard characters with impermeable faces  thor and captain america  gently pushed into the background and are mostly objects to exercise their wits fly iron lizard people torn from heaven fall down scandinavian epic heroes that smashed the roof monster offer to wear pants superheroes battle is in the kitchen on the ruins of the celebration quietly bustling gwyneth paltrow the camera flies around manhattan as if it was tied to a distraught thunder bird characters recite texts that do not expect to hear in a movie about a meeting of the gods with armored men in flying saucers  mechanism launched weedon never strays the rhythm it does not change the context and plays with it and as a professional geek wellversed in superhero discourse squeezes the best out of it never mind that this is a film in which the long run nothing happens its just different the avengers  a big family and weedon it definitely his after all what is the success costume party smart people dressed like a fool and rejoice
Aug 16 2012,positive,love it cant belive my favorite superheros come together
Aug 16 2012,positive,im not sure why it took so freakin long for this to play here but it was definitely worth the wait
Aug 16 2012,positive,im still a bigger fan of the christopher nolan batman movies
Aug 16 2012,positive,id have to say that this is one of the best films this year
Aug 16 2012,positive,this movie is the best movie of 2012 the cast was incredible they really kicked ass the special effects were amazing in this film it was a fun movie and also entertaining
Aug 15 2012,positive,awesome action packed
Aug 15 2012,positive,im a sucker for super hero movies and this one definitely lived up to my expectations my favorite hero through this movie is agent barton and i figured since he wasnt one of the big four heros he wouldnt get a lot of screen time but he definitely does super happy with the even show time of all the heros  this is my favorite movie of the year and definitely in my top all time ill be counting down the days till the next one
Aug 15 2012,positive,fantasy stuff but amazing overall
Aug 15 2012,positive,very action packed with plenty of light hearted moments too but having not seen the other films there were a few plot details i wasnt sure about
Aug 15 2012,positive,a perfect storm great actors storyline not too heavy action packed and emotional yet had some light and fun moments that really brought you just enough out of the dark sides of the story much better representation of lokis power than in thor kind of failed a bit in that film even though it was amazing and was a definite hit in tying the marvel universe together cannot wait for the inevitable sequels
Aug 15 2012,positive,this was the best the avengers movie anyone couldve hoped for and im giving all the credit to joss whedon and to marvel for hiring him  usually the screenplays for summer blockbusters are jammed out by committee with producers and writers and toy designers all sitting in a room jamming more and more things into it for their own commercial or personal reasons  by the time we see a summer movie its been watered and dumbed down until its hardly a movie anymore full review 
Aug 15 2012,positive,if your a fan of any of the avengers as i love iron man and thor then you will love this movie all of your favorite characters in one movie with clashing personalities and action packed fights that literally rip the city apart
Aug 15 2012,positive,best superhero squad ever
Aug 15 2012,positive,it was all right i dont think it was that good at all
Aug 15 2012,positive,gotta say i expected more the plot was predictable though i suppose this was more of a team development story to pave the way for the sequels also probably didnt help that the old oyaji geezer sitting next to me wreaked of stale beer left midway through the movie only to come back with a new aroma eau de puke
Aug 14 2012,positive,a long time marvel reader collector and fan its hard to make a movie from a bunch of other movies that sadly were collectively underwhelming after the original iron man and hulk reboots the casting change from ed norton as well purturbed me greatly not that the movie was terrible but thor is a horrendous rendition no offense to the actor and cap is just boring stark delivers typical quips some good but none as superb as the original movie the second should have been 2 movies and the change in rhodies casting was a downgrade in my opinion that being said the storyline was based off the ultimates line not the traditional avengers arc so its forgivable and fun
Aug 14 2012,positive,the best movie of all time
Aug 14 2012,positive,very enjoyable and fun to watchmoney well spent that said the end battle was drastically over the top cant these directors tell a story and have a battle that isnt all cgi lookwhaticando crap anymore
Aug 14 2012,positive,great movie  the hulk steals the show  the only negative was samuel l jackson  he just doesnt pull it off everyone else hit a homerun  will see it at least two more times
Aug 14 2012,positive,aewsome movie best superhero flick ever made
Aug 14 2012,negative,wow what a pile of rubbish no story to speak of and trying to rely on flashy special effects to save its cringy dialog i cant see a way to give negative stars
Aug 14 2012,negative,the avengers relies too heavily on action overkill and forgets to add any amount of heart
Aug 14 2012,positive,yes justyes that is all
Aug 14 2012,positive,fun summer blockbuster unites six superheroes against an evil god from another dimension i think who wants to destroy the earth i think good characters and prefect doses of humor make up for poor special effects and tensionless action sequences that more closely resemble a video game than a film
Aug 14 2012,positive,great film enjoyed it from start to finish had everything
Aug 14 2012,positive,so great i loved this movie it was hilarious suspenseful and action packed everything you could possibly want from a blockbuster it did lack the emotional depth it would require to be the greatest movie of all time but the rest of the checklist was present
Aug 14 2012,positive,full of joss whedons patented blend of oneliners and blue filters the avengers is surprisingly well put together and fun to watch even if it doesnt carry any emotional weight
Aug 13 2012,neutral,i didnt really get it but then they started to fight it still was weird
Aug 13 2012,positive,pure entertainment from start to finish the very definition of what movies can be love how the whole thing came together
Aug 13 2012,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever
Aug 13 2012,positive,a bunch of awesome superheroes including ironman in one movie whats not to like
Aug 13 2012,positive,best movie of 2012 loved it
Aug 13 2012,positive,such a great movie keeps you wanting more
Aug 13 2012,positive,thrill ride  absolutely loved it and was glued to my seat for the entire movie  worth seeing over and over again
Aug 13 2012,positive,loved it loved it loved it
Aug 13 2012,positive,exceeded my expectations this is the best super hero movie ever made and i doubt itll be topped the humor is great the acting is great the effects are great this is a perfect film
Aug 13 2012,positive,as a big marvel fan this film was 100 satisfying
Aug 13 2012,positive,fantastic movie will clever laughs and excellent character development into the the total story  clever dialouge and fun for all fans of the genre  best movie of the summer bar none
Aug 13 2012,neutral,yet another big dumb superhero movie that cant be taken seriously on any level but is mildly entertaining and funny at times  robert downey jr and mark ruffalo carry the film but what a tremendous waste of acting  directing talent
Aug 13 2012,neutral,its no where near a bad movie but there too many people who think this is a flawless movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,good action stuff  great meshing of all of the various marvel characters involved in the avengers
Aug 12 2012,positive,the avengers had a lot of laughs and i was pleasantly surprised the hulk really stole the show and was funny and overthetop destructive the avengers started the summer movie season off with a big bang it doesnt need to be seen in imax but it will definitely improve your viewing pleasure for some extra 
Aug 12 2012,positive,awesome movie watched it twice
Aug 12 2012,positive,super good must watch 
Aug 12 2012,positive,a great movie  one of the best movies of the year
Aug 12 2012,positive,while not as emotionally moving as other super hero blockbusters like spiderman and batman the avengers is a movie for people just looking to have a good time watching a band of super heroes beat up aliens and blow stuff up
Aug 12 2012,positive,really good movie to anyone even if not an action or a heroic fanatic great visuals cast and script
Aug 12 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever the avengers has nonstop action that will keep your eyes burning because you just cant seem to blink  it also has nonstop humor that the major and minor characters provide  this is one of major supernerd joss whedons best works
Aug 12 2012,positive,i had no expectations of it even though it did have a lot of hype there were one or two scenes in it that i felt didnt need to be so long but a film needs that i think especially when its a character based movie more than an action film  everyone in the cast did awesome and everyone from a behind the scenes creative aspect did their jobs really well  one of the best movie going experiences ive had in a long while
Aug 12 2012,positive,if u could higher than 5 stars i would i saw this 3 times jn the theater and when came out on dvd i watched it every day for close to a week and looked forward to watching it each and every time
Aug 12 2012,positive,easily one of the best movies i have ever seen
Aug 12 2012,positive,the avengers was so epicllay awesome
Aug 12 2012,positive,best superhero movie i seen all year the action was incredible and the plot was good plus the acting was unbelievable im getting it on bluray when it comes out
Aug 11 2012,positive,i watched it in 3d amazing
Aug 11 2012,positive,when i walked out i was thinking lets see dc top this
Aug 11 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is the long awaited film that takes some of marvels most famous super heroes and merges them together into what can now be safe to say is one of the greatest action movies of all time every character gets plenty of screen time and development and every actor doesnt disappoint in their roles especially the surprising mark ruffalo as the incredible hulk this movie has so many memorable scenes on top of that that its a film that will keep you engaged to it for the full 2 plus hours no doubt that this film gives marvel ultimate supremacy over dc
Aug 11 2012,positive,feels a bit intellectually empty compared to movies like nolans dark knight trilogy or even the first iron man still the movie was very satisfying and fun to watch
Aug 11 2012,positive,cant find much fault with a movie that good
Aug 11 2012,positive,one of a kind never before have individual superheros come together in a movie as a team and this doesnt disappoint  tons of adventure character humor and action that will get your adrenaline pumping for a week
Aug 11 2012,positive,deff one of the best over all movies ive seen in a long time
Aug 11 2012,positive,the only thing fun about the movie was the action other than that there really wasnt anything that great about the film a huge amount of plot holes cheesy jokes and whole 1 hour of boredom
Aug 11 2012,negative,i dont understand why this movie is said to be so good it is so critically acclaimed that maybe it was just too high of expectations i was under the impression that this would be a fun summer blockbuster to behold but got a confusing boring and stupid film i didnt think the characters meshed well there were too many of them and their stories didnt really connect i had only seen two of the movies going into thisiron man the incredible hulk2008 but i dont think that really matters too much i didnt find it humorous and i almost fell asleep during this 2 12 hour waste of time i dont understand the only good thing i can say is it looked great the visuals were spectacular the restehh
Aug 11 2012,positive,not much to say exceptawesome
Aug 11 2012,positive,the best super hero ever made or at least one of the top three
Aug 11 2012,positive,i cant believe it made as much money at the box office as it did i thought it was good not great
Aug 11 2012,positive,loved it  bought all the characters together nicely  well written and acted
Aug 11 2012,positive,as a four year hype machine it beat all expectations
Aug 10 2012,positive,wish i could give it more stars
Aug 10 2012,positive,first 10 minutes made me wonder if the movie was worth the hype   after that all doubts were put away  was able to get over the change in actors for bruce banner
Aug 10 2012,positive,the best marvel movie so far
Aug 10 2012,positive,i was determined not to follow the crowd by liking this movie as much as everyone else i loved it
Aug 10 2012,positive,great visual effectswonderful actingand a nice screenplayfast paced and action packedavengers is a fun ride and very entertaining
Aug 10 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ive ever seen
Aug 10 2012,positive,this was great seeing the heroes go from solo movies to an ensemble was a just awesome  total nerdgasm
Aug 10 2012,positive,its an excellent super heroes movie very cool effects and superbly nit together especially waning the charactersits an action fun movie with no signs of being anything else but a comic heroes adaptation  it is a lot of fun and very entertaining  thumbs up
Aug 10 2012,positive,joss whedon is a genius
Aug 10 2012,positive,each actor chews up the scenery and blows you away all the way down to agent coulson not a single turn is wasted nor stone left unturned for pure entertainment tom hiddleston steals more scenes as loki but in the end hulk smash beats rock paper and scissors worth seeing twice
Aug 10 2012,positive,great movie very exciting although not alot of dialogue i feel marvel did a great job in the idea of making all the super heros individual movies first then making the final avengers movie even more exciting because you figure anybody who even saw just one of the super heros individual movies would probably want to go see avengers
Aug 10 2012,neutral,wildly overrated uneven mess the final action set piece stands out as does robert downey jr
Aug 10 2012,positive,never underestimate the entertainment value of the hulk smash d
Aug 10 2012,positive,joss whedon has created a memorable film which will forever be implanted in the brains of nerds like me  the plot was executed perfectly with not one of the many protagonists stealing the glory the stories from the five previous films are twisted to one the acting was a little strained for some characters and the antagonist did not strike me as that evil i rate this film a solid 4 of 5
Aug 10 2012,positive,this is an awesome movie well the trailer is i still havent seen it though this movie sounds like an incredible movie 
Aug 10 2012,positive,a superhero master class which gives every character enough screen time but overrated
Aug 10 2012,positive,and i jizzed in my pants oo
Aug 10 2012,positive,best film of the year so far
Aug 10 2012,positive,a fun and shallow superhero movie i liked this movie but kind of embarrassing for the few critics who rate this higher than the dark knight rises i think any critic who did loses all credibility
Aug 10 2012,positive,excellent i love how during the heros fight with each other they kicked each others butts yet none of them appeared weak well done
Aug 10 2012,positive,i liked the action sequences and the fight scenes but the way the characters acted was kind of childish
Aug 9 2012,positive,a box office miracle im not saying the movie wasnt  fantastic but it earned way more props than what it deserved and the only reason it grossed that much was because it was kid friendly and the had the overpriced thing we call 3d
Aug 9 2012,positive,noticeable bloopers still a movie ill enjoy for years to come thanks stan lee for sharing your world with us
Aug 9 2012,positive,great but the dark knight rises was way better
Aug 9 2012,positive,i love joss whedon but i couldnt bring myself to love this film
Aug 9 2012,positive,as i settled in for marvels the avengers to cite its full title my mind began to drift back a few years all the way back to another marvel action team the xmen  i complained then that the problem of having multiple superheroes on the screen at the same time is a problem of crowd control  how do you give equal screen time to a handful of characters with special abilities and have them be more than just cardboard characters with colorful powers  the xmen series never straightened out this problem but i am happy to report that with marvels the avengers this is not an issue    it was a smart plan for marvel studios to build the characters one at a time giving each superhero their own movie in an effort to introduce them in preparation for their assembly here  as a leadin we got iron man 2008 the incredible hulk 2008 iron man 2 2010 and last summers thor and captain america the first avenger  next up is nick fury  with that by the time we get to marvels the avengers most of the heavy lifting in the introduction department is already done for us  that frees up the plot to get past the introductions and get on with the action although the movie does open with the required scenes in which the team members have to be brought into the fold one by one    the avengers are more interesting to me than the xmen because they come from different places  thor chris hemsworth is norse god from another galaxy captain america chris evans is a geneticallyaltered army strongman from the 1940s hulk mark ruffalo is a green muscle mass hiding out in india under the passive alter ego of bruce banner and iron man robert downey jr is the billionaire metallurgist whose headquarters overlook the chrysler building in new york  plus theres an archer called hawkeye jeremy renner and a token female russianborn woman named black widow scarlett johansson who i think is good with martial arts for whatever reason these last two didnt get a movie of their own but stay tuned    the avengers like the xmen are also led by a secretive baldheaded authority figure with a handicap  he is nick fury samuel l jackson who runs a shadow organization called shield whose function is to stop super villains from     well doing supervillainy i suppose  the task here is to get back an object called the tesseract an object that  if i understood it correctly  acts as a power source to open a portal to another galaxy  thats bad news for our planet because it means that the norse god loki tom hiddleston thors adopted halfbrother can make his way into our realm and rule the world with his powerful superarmy  it also means that he can use it to take control of the minds of certain shield personnel  lokis first stop to announce his intentions to rule the world germany  maybe he hasnt heard but thats probably not a wise place to start    the avengers personalities are known to us but what is refreshing is that they are not known to one another  in this movie many are meeting each other for the first time and for a long time no one knows who can be trusted  thats especially true with a tense relationship between iron man and thor  since he has fallen out of the heavens just like the evil loki can he be trusted  another issue of tension comes with the addition of bruce banner  everyone knows that he has a serious anger management problem and the movie deals nicely with everyones apprehension that hulks destructive nature could be a potential problem    the most engaging character in the film for me is bruce banner played this time by mark ruffalo who manages to pull off  with all due respect to eric bana and edward norton  the best performance out of the past three actors who have occupied the role  ruffalo plays banner as a mildmannered soul who is very aware that he has to keep his mood in check  he does something interesting he quiets his voice to a calm mellow deliberate tone that lets you know that he is aware of the destructive power of what he calls the other guy  i liked his rendition of bruce banner although i think the screenwriter missed a perfect opportunity to show bruce living a feng shui lifestyle with meditations and aroma therapy candles in an effort to keep his mood in check maybe with the mantra keep calm and carry on  that might have been perfect    i liked the character touches in marvels the avengers  i liked the dialogue which is written at a smart snappy level by writerdirector joss whedon  he has a way with dialogue that makes even the most mundane of action scenes come alive  he is the man behind buffy the vampire slayer firefly toy story and a brilliant horrorcomedy the cabin in the woods still in theaters    i just wish that he could have avoided the trash and bash of the third act  hes a smart writer but he allows the movie to go into the same exact scenario of tearing up the streets and trashing buildings that weve seen a million times  it would have been nice if he could have taken the same inventive brilliance as the last act of the cabin in the woods and created something that would really take the movie into the realm of something special  his avengers is best in smaller perfect moments and little flashes of smart dialogue  when you stand back and look at the plot as a whole you see that it really doesnt add up to much more than just a bunch of superheroes trying to keep a meany from taking over the world  his movie as it stands exists somewhere between the hohum of the xmen and the brilliant extravaganza of the dark knight  it isnt a perfect film but i enjoyed it probably more than i expected
Aug 9 2012,positive,i loved it need more
Aug 9 2012,positive,loved every minute of it
Aug 9 2012,positive,the whole time i was waiting for samuel l jackson to pull out a purple light saber  so disappointed
Aug 9 2012,positive,possibly one of the best movies of all time if you are a marvel fan then is the best movie of all time
Aug 9 2012,positive,saw it last night it was awesome
Aug 9 2012,negative,this movie is not good as what i expected some parts look like power rangers episode but its cool to see those heroes united in one movie
Aug 9 2012,positive,the best marvel movie from my opinion besides the first iron man
Aug 9 2012,positive,at first i was skeptical i decided last second to see this movie i ended up seeing it four times this is without a doubt the greatest superhero film i have ever seen major kudos to the team who created this everything from action acting plot and soundtrack are amazing cant wait to see what thanos does
Aug 9 2012,positive,best movie ive seen to date marvels the avengers will keep you at the edge of your seat with its action packed plot joss whedons direction of the film made me fall in love with my favorite superheroes all over again i wish there were more stars to give this movie
Aug 9 2012,positive,loved it awesome movie
Aug 9 2012,positive,the avengers was one of the most anticipated films of the 2012 summer and rightly so  all the prior films that spill into the avengers had solid superhero coming of age stories but this film does a great job of building the coming of age story of the avengers finding its identity and purpose  i particularly liked how the hulkbruce banner and hawkeyeclint barton had a little more attention in their development considering they didnt have a direct prequel movie  the pace of the movie is not overwhelming considering there could have been but didnt have a lot of backstory that needed to be introduced for the characters while at the same time successfully keeps moviegoers well entertained throughout the film  the plot was complex enough to keep viewers entertained and the screenplay is witty and reasonably true to the characters of the avengers  there arent a lot of flaws to the film unless youre not a fan of comic book to film movies and overall its a must see for marvel comic fans or anyone who is looking for a fast fun and entertaining film
Aug 9 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Aug 8 2012,positive,excellent movie tons of action with a solid story
Aug 8 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies out of all the marvel movies but i still prefer the dark knight rises
Aug 8 2012,positive,absolutely fantastic love it best comic book movie ever made at least until  avengers 2  bvs
Aug 8 2012,positive,for about 4 years of preparing since iron man it didnt please my expectations the action was great it was just the story that sucked and the fact that it reminded me of transformers 3
Aug 8 2012,positive,incredibly fun movie definitely recommend it since its up there with some of the best superhero films
Aug 8 2012,positive,colossal instantly forgettable fun
Aug 8 2012,positive,in one word  epic humour huge action set pieces some of the greatest heroes in the world and did i mention the heartfelt moments this is the bar against which all superhero films will be measured
Aug 7 2012,positive,forget any other superhero movie you have ever seen this one takes the cake and after its over the recipe will get lost because its rare a film such as this actually lives up to its expectations even though there were five solo avenger films iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america in that order you dont have to see any of them to understand the plot of this film although story wise it may be a good idea to check out thor to learn more about loki the main villain of both this and that film the cast is phenomenal hands down if you love superheroes there are some scenes in this film that will blow you away truthfully i havent seen a sequel if thats what you can call it that has lived up to its hype since terminator 2 judgement day and the empire strikes back this film does not disappoint in any way unless you really are that much of a perfectionist
Aug 7 2012,positive,loved this effing movie
Aug 7 2012,positive,whedon did it despite his strong track record i was still nervous that pulling all these big names together could never work but somehow it turned out to be one of the casts best films possibly ironman aside each character fits together extremely well while all get pretty fleshed out even the unknowns hawkeye and black widow what a heart pumping ride the 3d was quite well done to boot
Aug 7 2012,positive,an epic blockbuster action movie that has flaws but still manages to be big bold and something to behold pulling off a movie with all of the characters here is an accomplishment in itself
Aug 7 2012,positive,a modern day robin hood hawkeye is also there
Aug 7 2012,positive,love it it was  great
Aug 7 2012,positive,honestly one of the best if not the best movie i have ever seen it was exciting action packed nerve racking emotionally stimulating and funny  it was just a huge bonus that most of the lead characters were fantastic actors as well as easy on the eyes
Aug 7 2012,positive,disney cashes in on some of marvels biggest heros acting at times from mark ruffalo seems forced and not genuine the casting of nick furys character was not hit on the head not too many complaints of this film all in all a wonderful comic book based film
Aug 7 2012,positive,a rare thing a modern summer event movie that truly satisfies in character and action the story is simple but thats the magic of it bringing together four very different characters with tonally different films already released with varying degrees of realism and success is a massive gamble but the established heroes deliver and ruffalo is a revelation as a banner less at odds with his raging alter ego hiddleston owns as a villain who is brutal yet somehow still someone who can evoke support from an audience whedons humour shines but doesnt smother respectfully dulling his fingerprint and accepting that the sheer branding is enough to get an audience but a respectful reverence to it is flexible the action scenes are outstanding and it never feels slow or bloated in an age of explosive summer blockbusters and super heroes marvel continues to up its game excelsior
Aug 7 2012,positive,100 pure unadulterated potent chinawhite entertainment
Aug 7 2012,positive,absolutely amazing
Aug 7 2012,positive,something that has not been done before to have most of our favorite heros in one moviemarvel had the pressure on themand marvel delivered a plan 5 movies in the making that started with iron man and ended with captain americathe avengers is a movie that knows how to balance so many iconic characterswith joss whedon who knows a little bit about comicbookswho gave each every character there moment in the spotlight directed this movie solidly
Aug 7 2012,positive,a true comic book movie whedon does not dilute the marvel brand
Aug 7 2012,positive,i would have rated it lower but i just saw tdkr and this literally is everything that movie is not fun witty intelligent and resonating
Aug 7 2012,positive,brilliant fun make no mistake though the character development was in the preceding films so as long as you have seen all of them there is a great time to be had with the avengers amazing special effects but only there to facilitate the story no dominate it this is an awesome series
Aug 6 2012,positive,whaaaaaaat what a lame website how how how did this get a higher rating the dark knight rises oh come on
Aug 6 2012,positive,awesome thats all i have to say hope theres a second one only jeremy renner can make a dude with a bow and arrow look cool
Aug 6 2012,positive,amazing and surprisingly funny
Aug 6 2012,negative,overrated the plot made little to no sense and the movie spent a lot of time explaining the backstories of the various characters  too much to deliver a story in its own right there was a small amount of witty dialogue and robert downey jr is clearly a gifted actor but overall it felt like too many cooks trying to mash together so many disparate stories somehow added up to a whole that was less than the sum of its parts not sure what all the hype was about
Aug 6 2012,positive,lived up to expectations and is only surpassed by the dark knight rises in superhero films  joss whedon did a heck of a job with this
Aug 6 2012,positive,so far the funniest and the best of the marvel movies i left the theater knowing i was going to see it again the hulk stole the show
Aug 6 2012,positive,hulk smash best superhero movie of all time
Aug 6 2012,positive,i have been waiting for the avengers for a long time like since iron man came out probably since i realised there was such a thing as the avengers and i saw it on opening night   it was all and all a good movie there was lots of humour and everyone was in character you got to see black widow speak russian no accent again though like iron man 2 l and got to see the team fight as one somehow i didnâtmt think this was possible but loki got sexier i was quite disappointed that i didnâtmt bring my patented drool bucket the actionfight scenes were top notch howeverâ  spoiler alert from this point on   i donâtmt want to be one of those fans that complain about everything but there were things i didnâtmt like i donâtmt want to say a lot but there were some definite things i didnâtmt like and yes spoilers i didnâtmt like how the movie seemed to focus a lot on iron man i like iron man ish starting to like him more after certain events coughcivilwarcough but i didnâtmt want to see him i wanted to see thor and hulk and cap and spiderman i was so hoping for a cameo from him but alas disappointed i donâtmt get why they canâtmt do that itâtms probably some bureaucratic mumbojumbo i didnâtmt like the lack of accents on black widow and i didnâtmt like that the hulk grunted a lot and there were a couple scenes where i was like did i accidently buy tickets to atlantis the lost empire   i hate to admit i forgot where the alien villains were from and apparently prune face is their boss guess who that is folks   but i loved the characterization of everyone it was like spot on black widow was a great wellrounded female who was strong and tough i loved the fight scenes as said above there was one scene where everyone was arguing that was amazing i loved how it was all put together i love loki marry me tom hiddleston and hulk andâshuttering nerdgasm   the actor playing bruce banner also kind of reminded me of hank from corner gas at first i thought he wouldnâtmt be as good as edward nortonâtms performance but i felt he did pull off a more wellrounded performance   there was so much bromance so much bromance   there is a death and i didnâtmt cry i am so proud of me   just and fyi the after the after the big credits scene is funny but has no hints at next movies watch it anyway
Aug 6 2012,positive,the best thing avengers has going for them is action humor fun characters and overall just a lot of fun and that is what superhero movies are supposed to be fun i cant really do a very good job of explaining the story though its somewhat simple yet somewhat complicated the action is so fun you forget about a lot of the boring parts even if you dont follow the avengers you will appreciate the humor my favorite character in this movie was iron man rdj provided most of the humor with his wit and once again just owns the role i also thought mark ruffalo was a great hulk and hulk is my 2nd favorite marvel hero behind only spiderman although his screen time as the hulk is somewhat limited he darn near steals the show in the end especially with what he does to loki absolutely hilarious i feel this movie focuses on thor the most since the villain is thors adopted brother loki who is simply trying to take over the world with his army and this team of six simply has to stop him and his army i know the villains goal sounds a bit cliche but all of that makes for some great action in the end sure the battle does take a toll on the city but it could have been a lot worse plus the action was just so much fun overall id say definitely a cool movie one of my favorite comic book movies of all time and a must see
Aug 6 2012,positive,amazing movie enen if you have not seen an of the other movies
Aug 6 2012,positive,biggest disappointment of the year so far way too cheesy way too jokey and not serious enough
Aug 6 2012,positive,starts off slow but all the action at the end was awsome an i love robert downey jr
Aug 6 2012,positive,loved it it was great in 3d
Aug 6 2012,positive,hell yeah one of the best marvel movies
Aug 6 2012,positive,every great thing has already been said also ill say it again epic
Aug 6 2012,positive,five years in the making the avengers supersedes expectations and portrays marvels image perfectly bravo whedon
Aug 6 2012,positive,was worried how it would all fit together but it turns out to be one of my favourite movies of all time just have to wait and see how they top this off a hulk smashtastic movie
Aug 6 2012,positive,not a major fan of the dc series but i loved this film one of those rare cinema experiences where you are totally drawn in to the film and forget about reality action humour and depth of character are standouts
Aug 6 2012,positive,as a fan i can only write in the perspective of one but can i just say that if you are a fan of marvels superheroes and movies this will be a real treat and a mustwatch at first glance you may be put off by what seems like an average action movie with guns explosions and oh no aliens but wait theres more to it than that what i loved about this movie was how they managed to give each character their time in the spotlight from their introductions to the fight scenes at the end and how it managed to put all these characters together to form the glorious team known as the avengers but what i think really made this movie enjoyable was the humor it was expertly woven into the fabric of the story with a variety of jokes that made audiences both young and old fill the theater with laughter with a well put together plot fascinating characters cool effects comedy and plenty of awesome oneliners this movie should be on everyones want to see it list
Aug 6 2012,positive,bad ass movie want to see it agen
Aug 5 2012,positive,surpassed all expectations awesome 
Aug 5 2012,positive,this is not the shawshank redemption but for what it is a marvel film its pretty damn good
Aug 5 2012,positive,great action film with plenty of familiar faces
Aug 5 2012,positive,skizzle and personally my all time favorite movie
Aug 5 2012,positive,a must see on the big screenbut i will have to own in my dvd collection
Aug 5 2012,positive,awesomestill the best movie i have seen all year
Aug 5 2012,positive,the most funny hero movie a unique and unprecedented idea of assemble several heroes from others movie in one amazing and awesome film full comedy scenes and  heroic action that mark every characters life in unique way just stunnig idea
Aug 5 2012,neutral,while it delivers great action sequences the avengers is an overrated piece that had much more to offer
Aug 5 2012,positive,i love it but not better the dark knight
Aug 5 2012,positive,a must see action film
Aug 5 2012,positive,while a good movie the avengers feels lagged at some points and the excesive fights fists and bullets dont help the story is good a some points though the avengers is a nice film but may not be as good in a home small screen
Aug 5 2012,positive,quality action as well as great character development
Aug 5 2012,positive,loved it i can not wait to have this on bluray
Aug 5 2012,neutral,not as good as i thought it would be xmen first class still easily the best group superhero movie
Aug 5 2012,positive,realistic hulk funny action packed
Aug 5 2012,positive,we finally made it the end of phase one the culmination of marvels entire bluff gamble that a team up of comic book superheroes would actually work hit theaters and oh my god it tore down the house what marvel did in investing this big climax in the hands of nerd icon joss whedon to write and direct this ensemble piece everyone thought would faileven me im glad to say though that it does deliver in every aspect of what a comic book movie adaptation ensemble piece should do and then some    in broad strokes the story goes loki tom hiddlestonthe brother of thor chris hemsworth is made a deal with the space mutants anime guys to take over planet earth and now nick fury samuel l jackson and shield must bring together this motley crew of freaks and accidents as theyre called to come together as the avengers so yes we get our big epic team up of iron manrobert downey jr captain americachris evans bruce bannerthe incredible hulk now played flawlessly by mark ruffaloblack widowscarlett johanssen and hawkeyejeremy renner im not going to spend too much time on the story because it would just suck up a lot of time and it would just confuse you so just go and see the movie and experience it for yourself     i will discuss further the mastery of what whedon did in being able to skillfully go around and give each of these largerthanlife personalities that have led their own movies for the most part in the pastshare the screen with equal time to be with each of them and to build upon them as characters and have them build archs as a team    this is going to be a short review because over all although its not a perfect 5 start movie it is a pivotal movie to see if you not only like action movies but more importantly comic book movies because this changed the game this was one of those days the world stopped and we knew this wasnt the same old circus anymore let me just close by saying that if this is going to be a different kind of circus from now on ill gladly sign up to be at every show you sold me marvel congratulations now keep it up although the major congratulations and thanks goes to you joss whedon youre the one that made this real
Aug 5 2012,positive,awesome story brilliant effects and a fabulous cast
Aug 5 2012,positive,wow now this how a superhero movie is done totally loved the interaction of the main characters

Aug 5 2012,positive,loved it loved it loved it
Aug 5 2012,positive,loved it been waiting for it since the end of iron man in 2008 and it did not fail to deliver casting was excellent i was a bit concerned about the change from edward norton to mark ruffalo for bruce banner but for the difference in character between the incredible hulk and avengers the casting change worked fantastically and joss whedon as director was a touch of class would have happily walked right back into the cinema to watch it over again and eagerly await its release onto home media
Aug 5 2012,positive,this movie is freakin awesome
Aug 4 2012,positive,this movie is good i loved 1

Aug 4 2012,positive,the movie started a little slow for me but as the avengers came together so did the movie the movie couldve been alot better however it was the best superhero movie ive seen since the dark knight
Aug 4 2012,negative,the only time it stops being boring is when it decides to be obnoxious instead not trolling just my correct opinion
Aug 4 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for more no matter how many they make i hope they all entertain me and allow me to escape into a world of adventure
Aug 4 2012,positive,one of the best movies if the year
Aug 4 2012,positive,the avengers is a brilliant action film bringing in the witty yet hardcore action hero of the iron man films the amazingly written fantasy of thor and the amazing action sequences of captain america the avengers also brought the first sightings of the new hulk and hawkeye and both are satisfying for marvel fans the avengers is marvels best film yet and has spawned what could possibly a franchise as big as star wars absolutely amazing

Aug 3 2012,positive,awesome movie best super hero movie in a long time
Aug 3 2012,positive,it was great having all the heroes together but it needed more action and less time trying to settle their differences
Aug 3 2012,positive,as a nonrobert downy jr fan i can honestly say i walked into avengers expecting to be more annoyed than anything i was actually pleasantly surprised to find that this was a far cry from the stereotypical superhero movie sure it had its been action sequences and fancy costumes and all that but there was a certain amount of realism to all the characters there was actually a plot and a good one at that which is something that is easy to get away from in superhero movies as an audience wants to see explosions and mayhem every few minutes an excellent way to start out the summer movie season and it definitely wont be the last we see of earths mightiest heroes
Aug 3 2012,positive,id prefer another league hehe
Aug 3 2012,positive,years in the making and well worth the wait
Aug 3 2012,positive,stand down true believers they did it joss whedon and co made a fantastic superteam movie even though the thrill of watching these characters together onscreen wore off within a minute and even with the fanbuy nitpicks no avengers assemble no wasp or antman an overlong intro generic hero battle themes hawkeye getting the least amount of screen time scarlett johansson still stinks as black widow all of those little things are outweighed by all of the good stuff the character development is great hereespecially in how it showed thors maturing as a warrior something that i felt was lacking and should have been addressed in his solo movie while i didnt really like mark ruffalo as much as eric bana and certainly not as much as ed norton and i didnt like this look for the hulk as much as i did for the one from the last film i did enjoy that unlike the previous films he was able to communicate how bad the pain of transforming into the hulk is i thought that it was interesting how they dealt with the issue of wmds as well surprisingly it was also the funniest film that ive seen in a while in summary it exceeded my high expectations i feel that this is the best marvel movie since spiderman
Aug 3 2012,positive,this was an awsome new addition to the marvel movies
Aug 3 2012,positive,there is nothing not to like
Aug 3 2012,positive,a dream cometrue for a marvel lover exhilerating entertaining actionpacked and simply unforgettable
Aug 3 2012,positive,easily a top 5 movie mixed action with a great plot and it wasnt clogged by any unnecessary romance if you dont like superhero movies this one will get you started
Aug 3 2012,positive,its a cool movie wouldnt be anything without iron man no way does it even come close to the dark knight or the dark knight rises
Aug 3 2012,positive,love the action adventure  comedy makes it the best movie of the year
Aug 3 2012,positive,good movie with pretty good acting a well written plot and nice special effects the only proboblem that i had with it is that weve seen it all before in previous super hero movies
Aug 3 2012,positive,  if youre like me you became hooked ever since you were blown away by iron man and waited for the final post credits scene when samuel jacksons nick fury says he wants to talk to robert downey jrs tony stark about the avengers initiative    you then waited for the incredible hulk and was not as blown away by that film  but you were still along for the ride when tony stark says to general ross in that films post credits scene that were putting together a team  then came iron man 2 a bit of a disappointment thor pretty good and captain america also pretty good  the picture was getting clearer the avengers film was incredibly just around the corner  now it is here  the film does not disappoint because most of us have been along for the ride and have been eagerly awaiting the unfolding of the larger tapestry that marvel has now revealed to us  director joss whedon was a great choice to direct  he has the requisite skills and experience  he is skilled at working with team dynamics  buffy the vampire slayer firefly serenity and his work with the astonishing xmen comics to name a few    whedon slowly assembles the avengers for us during the first and second acts  its a bit of a slow trip to get there but we dont mind too much  we are kept going in particular by the characters of black widow and bruce banner  widow did not impress us much in iron man 2 and was in fact quite an annoyance  here whedon finds the key to let johansens acting chops out  we see why she is called the black widow and it is not just because she is deadly  whedon also finally unlocks the best rendition on either television or film of bruce banner and the hulk  mark ruffalo nails it  we are very curious how banner has managed to go without an incident in over a year    its fascinating the way whedon plays each character off of each other  its a bit of a chess match going on screen  in the melee however jeremey remmers hawkeye is quite overshadowed until the third act  its part of the plot but this was the first film where hawkeye should have had some more backstory  we missed that  samuel jacksons nick fury director of shield finally does get some decent screen time but we dont get to really see him manipulating the action behind the scenes to pull the strings of the avengers as he should be doing  there is one scene that indicates that perhaps he has had more of a hand in doing that than we might have thought but perhaps more insight into that dimension of his character and the story was needed  chris evans captain america also gets shunted for most of the film  i would have liked to have seen more of the influence of his old school good and bad view of the world at play in helping to shape the avengers into a team  after all he is supposed to be the leader of the avengers and there must be a reason why these other powerful heroes would want to follow his lead  instead another plot device is used to trigger this that i wont spoil by revealing here  chris helmsworths thor is also a bit overshadowed  i wanted to see more thunder from the god of thunder in his interactions with the rest of the team  downeys stark is back and as entertaining as usual  he almost steals the show in his scenes  tom hiddlestons loki is up to his mischief here but despite the terrible things he does in the film i never felt like i wanted to rip his head off which is how we should feel by the third act  dont get me wrong we do come to hate him but not to the degree that we should  once the avengers do assemble and get through the initial phases of team dynamics  forming storming and norming  they are ready to perform  the third act kicks ass  we finally get to see some true comic book level action on film here  the team gels and captain america starts barking orders  again though the bad guys here are menacing enough to look at but you dont really hate them as you should  so when the avengers start taking names and kick ass it is not quite as lip smackingly satisfying as it should be   also where the heck is the us military when an obvious national level threat is at hand  how shield fits into the equation with the us military is unclear and as a geek that bugged me  banner finally reveals to us his secret for controlling his anger and in turn the hulk  i wont tell you but it is worth the price of admission   see the avengers in ultraavx 3d  see it twice  stay for the two post credits scenes  we now realize that our ride with the avengers is only beginning  the size and scope of the universe that has been opened up to us by marvel look immense  where will this ride go  i am on it to the end  12 out of 4 stars
Aug 3 2012,positive,the ultimate entertainerd
Aug 3 2012,positive,spectacular movie took a while to get started with the front part mainly being getting the heroes together but the second part more than made up for it d no character development was needed that was the point of the previous movies all the actors were cast awesomely robert downey jr was perfect as iron man with some awesome jokes and puns chris hemsworth is just wow mark ruffalo was even better than ed norton as the hulk ive never been a great fan of the incredible hulk but omaigosh he just portrayed bruce banners character so well chris evans was brilliant as usual scarlet johansson as black widow was brilliant and she was not just someone to stare at my only concern is that jeremy renners hawkeye had too little screentime renners a brilliant actor in mi4 bourne legacy and the hurt locker and yet he had the least screentime out of all the avengers overall though it was still a brilliant movie with some epic fight scenes the actions scenes and special effects were awesome 910
Aug 3 2012,positive,action packed funny and waiting to own on dvd
Aug 3 2012,negative,loki was beat in 3 seconds by the hulk wow wasted 2 hours of build up for that what a terrible movie
Aug 3 2012,neutral,not saying it was a bad movie i am just not the biggest superhero movie fan too many downright unbelievable scenes
Aug 3 2012,positive,i was petty impressed that the movie came together so well thor was god awful as a solo movie didnt see captain america so i cant say about that one so i was worried
Aug 2 2012,positive,avengers was sick ill give it thatexcept iron man fighting thor was fucking retarded since he studied up on who would be in the avengers so why the fuck is he fighting him like he doesnt know who thor isexactly made u thinkand the character of mariah hill and scarlett jo pointless scarlett just like iron man 2 was eye candy and i was not dissappointed with that   but no russian accent downermakes me thinkcan she actmariah hilly were u even in the movieu did nothing of valueu werent even good as eye candyfucking useless
Aug 2 2012,positive,probably the best comic book comic book movie all of the lead characters are on the top of their game downey jr more than the others whedon manages to balence the humor and actionserious elements pretty well whcih is good because this is a very funny movie and the ending action scene is like if transformers  was done well but the whole movie is really held together by the superheroes interactions
Aug 2 2012,neutral,well i didnt understand anything partly cause i was on the floor partly cause i havent seen any of the other movies d
Aug 2 2012,positive,after all these years of waiting  the avengers was definitely worth the wait 
Aug 2 2012,positive,good movie for comic book and ironman fans hulk say this action film not for everyone

Aug 2 2012,positive,humorous in all the senses of the word a complete spectacle
Aug 2 2012,positive,its the avengers but hulk stole the movie
Aug 2 2012,positive,this box office smash hit is a marvel blocbuster it smashed the screen i personally enjoyed the movie and why i think it may beat the dark knight rises to stay on the top and finish as the highest grossing film of the year 1 comic book geeks and 2 scrennings showing on 3d its pretty simple if its on 3d then you make more money i prefered the dark knight rises though
Aug 2 2012,positive,the perfect marvel movie light suspenseful and hilariousness great for all family members and a joy to watch
Aug 2 2012,positive,spectacular and fun kind of losses focus a bit but jw told the story with skill and humor  i dont think anybody else could have pulled this flick off
Aug 2 2012,negative,this review may contain a few spoilers but at this point everyone has already seen the avengers and if you havent already youre probably going to see it anyway so why even bother with a review because theres no way i can say that i dislike the avengers without explaining myself   im not big on super heroes the only film ive seen related to the avengers is iron man 2 which i wasnt impressed with so maybe im not the target audience for this film but shouldnt a good film be tailored for all audiences   the avengers tries to be a smart and complex film but in the end the film is just about captain america iron man the hulk and thor teaming up to stop loki whos bent on world domination   the avengers irritates me a lot and the reason for that well one of the reasons is because its all about the money the avengers doesnt take any risks i probably could have told you exactly what was going to happen in the movie before i even saw it the story held only one surprise and it wasnt a pleasant one the surprise was lokis plan for world domination aliens   yup the avengers isnt just a cash grab its another alien movie and the aliens arent the only problem far from it the avengers is campy to the point of laughter its filled with cheap escapes and hammy dialogue   i mentioned a moment ago that the avengers is just a cash grab that doesnt take any risks allow me to elaborate on that if you havent already disowned me as a critic   at the near ending point iron man has to launch a nuclear missile into a portal to stop the alien invasion after succeeding it appears iron man may be dead in the end he lives surprise surprise if iron man dies there cant be any iron man sequels and one of the primary selling points of the avengers wont be around for the avengers 2   marvel has a huge money maker and they know it they werent going to kill off iron man theyll miss out on sequel opportunities to make even more money a plot twist or a super hero dying wouldve made the avengers a better film but in the end its a predictable and straightforward film   of course i knew the avengers wasnt going to be an intellectual film but was it too much to ask that the avengers might be a little more than a tracethelines action movie for crying out loud audiences have endured 6 films in anticipation of the avengers i think at this point marvel shouldve given as a quality product   the action is nothing new there was nothing regarding the action that i havent already seen there needed to be a new twist to the action or something but all we get is basic beathimupanddeliveroneliners fights the sheer scale of the action and the speed and manic in which it is delivered was enough to evoke artificial excitement from audience members but surely someone had to see how cliche this all is   and then theres the humor which consists almost entirely of predictable oneliners nearly all the humor in this movie has been presented in the same way in other films but audiences arent laughing because it is funny audiences are laughing because its supposed to be funny otherwise there would be little laughter at all sure some of the dialogue was pretty funny but i scarcely laughed at all   and nothing even really happens for the first hour and a half everything that happens in the avengers feels pointless and uninteresting   but i suppose the avengers isnt all bad the acting is decent but not incredible there arent going to be any award nominations for acting but the acting is serviceable   as expected the special effects are incredible even if i didnt enjoy the film much the special effects were incredible theres enough eye candy to make the avengers at least endurable   and the score by alan silverstri while often generic has more than a few bright spots i was pleasantly surprised by the score even if it there were a few missed opportunities   and speaking of pleasant surprises i was quite impressed at how well the avengers managed to juggle all the super heroes giving each ample screen time and not letting one take over the rest i expected robert downey jr to steal the show but for the most part the parts were balanced well   the avengers isnt completely terrible but i cant excuse the avengers laziness there were no risks taken everything is very straightforward i wasnt expecting a masterpiece but i was hoping the avengers wouldnt be completely pointless a villain is bent on world domination so a bunch of people join together to stop him is that the best you can do marvel   ugh forget it marvel im not seeing the avengers 2 if i ever want to see a quality super hero movie ill wait for the incredibles 2
Aug 2 2012,positive,the avengers fires on all cylinders and is great entertainment for fans and nonfans alike with mindblowing action and immensely likable characters
Aug 2 2012,positive,oh ya love it going to get some swarma now
Aug 2 2012,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Aug 2 2012,positive,entertaining enough surprisingly very funny actually downey jr was excellent as iron man as he was in his own movies which i really liked and the hulk as very good as well well acted and well written other than that it was a bit shallow for me i dont know if its just not my kind of movie or what i thought it was poorly paced and got bored in parts during the first half and i assume all of the character development was done in each heroes own movie i know iron mans was because there is jack shit in this movie  which meant that i didnt care at all about any of the other characters i suppose you are supposed to see all the others first no thanks there were some very cool parts in the action but i am more a fan of intense gritty action preferably with handtohand combat rather than big shiny cg effects
Aug 2 2012,positive,lots of action with a touch of comedy enjoyable till the end if you havent seen it u must
Aug 2 2012,negative,i was expecting more from this movie it just somehow fell flat to me four superheroes in one movie would have opened to a lot of awesome possibilities especially on fight scenes stunts choreography and much more to graphics and animation but sadly this movie did not live up to expectations  maybe next time
Aug 1 2012,positive,a fantastic superhero movie that gives a decent plot and gives the audience what they want a lot of showing off by each superhero whedons direction and writing always create a lot of laughter from me and this was no exception the only aspect that kept this film from a fifth star is norton would have been a much better hulk and there are also few plot points that dont quite make sense but you forget about them with all that is going on
Aug 1 2012,positive,loved thor and hulk
Aug 1 2012,positive,i loved it but i didnt like them changing the hulk
Aug 1 2012,positive,much better then i expected
Aug 1 2012,positive,probably the best comic book comic book movie all of the lead characters are on the top of their game downey jr more than the others whedon manages to balence the humor and actionserious elements pretty well whcih is good because this is a very funny movie and the ending action scene is like if transformers  was done well but the whole movie is really held together by the superheroes interactions
Aug 1 2012,positive,this movie islegendary no movie have i ever seen has ever brought together almost all of my favorite heroes and i was sitting back in my seat the entire film marvel fans will utterly love this movie from the duke out of iron and thor to the hulk smashing of our beloved hulk a epic has been created
Aug 1 2012,positive,needed more hulk smash
Aug 1 2012,positive,the humor was a little dry  and the plot was all too predictable but enjoyable nonetheless
Aug 1 2012,positive,loved itaction packed
Aug 1 2012,positive,there are so many epic moments in this movie it is perfect superhero team movie future xmen and justice league movies need to use this as an example each hero shined even hawkeye and caught the attention of the viewers this movie is full of witty banter great fight scenes and scenes that just give you goosebumps this movie totally lived up to the hype
Aug 1 2012,positive,combining marvels trademark visual dazzles with whedons witty writing style the avengers seamlessly ties together its already spectacular franchises into a superpowered epic that revolutionizes the realms of comic book movies
Aug 1 2012,positive,a absolutely great movie my third favorite to the dark knight movies
Aug 1 2012,positive,what it lacked in story line it made up in action
Aug 1 2012,positive,perfect action and seamless dialogue effective converted 3d and wonderful performances marvels the avengers is the exact definition of a summer movie loki used as the villain was a perfect choice with that perfect amount of crazy and a standout performance by robert downey jr keep this afloat i dont know why it only earns a 45 from me but it seems like something is missing for it to be a full 5 stars i dont know what yet
Aug 1 2012,positive,what a great solid movie having only seen the iron man movies before viewing the avengers i was worried i wouldnt quite get the allure of an epic superhero movie but it really doesnt matter when it is a blockbuster done right it was funny suspenseful well written and shot and the only thing i could fault in was scarjos lameness but all the superfanboys i saw the movie with said that it was to be expected so i let it slide i cant wait to see this movie again on dvd
Aug 1 2012,neutral,i dont really understand the film actually
Aug 1 2012,positive,my goodness this movie is amazing amazing effects acting and one good comedy im glad they team up in this movie its awesome
Aug 1 2012,positive,i thought it was a really good movie the action was good and the acting was good also
Aug 1 2012,positive,greatly filmed awesome performance from tom hiddleston action packed and i mean action packed a funny and spectacular script amazingly filmed and great acting from every avenger the highly anticipated avengers lives up to its hype in the best possible way rating 94 overall fantastic
Aug 1 2012,positive,that damn good  men and women of all ages will love this movie  it not only lives up to the massive hype but destroys the bar in the process  it contains almost everything youd want in an action movie great special effects humor sex appeal for men and women thor scarlett johansen  if you get a chance see it on imax 3d  i usually hate spending extra money for purported 3d effects or ear drum killing sound but this movie is well worth it
Aug 1 2012,positive,despite me pretty much hating or not enjoying most of the previous mcu films the avengers works because it features gasp actual interesting things going on shaky opening scene aside it features top notch performances fantastic action sequences and some honest to god clever writing see marvel see what happens when you care  loki is still the worst though
Aug 1 2012,positive,ill be the fist to admit that the plot was a little weak but this is a fanboys wet dream what ive been waiting years to witness as a proud marvel comics nerd i never had any doubt in my mind about this one ever since marvel studios began its journey making films in house which started with iron man and the incredible hulk it has been nothing but great the room for creative writing and directing is limitless  mark ruffalo delivers the best portrayal of bruce banner hulk on film period the balanced screen time each of these crucial characters receives is flawlessly pulled off by joss whedon what marvel studios has done with the cinematic universe has forever changed the course of film and has raised the bar pretty dang high  take note fox and wbdc there are enough laughs action and emotional moments that will satisfy the casual moviegoers and fanboys alike
Aug 1 2012,positive,filled with action pack and non stop ass kicking is just awesome
Aug 1 2012,positive,a fairly fun movie with some good action would have been wayyy more enjoyable if i was a marvel fan though some of the movies that the central heroes cone from felt like rushed cheap cashins ie capt america for the sole purpose of introducing those characters before this movie was released
Aug 1 2012,negative,the most over rated film i ever saw the story is lame and predictable the script is cheesy and full of cliches and the chracters keep fighting each other for no reason what so ever seriously why does this film get a 93 on rottern tomatos this needs sorting out this is outragous
Aug 1 2012,positive,the avengers is a great mix of everything such as action humor and drama joss whedon has done quite well in capturing each of the superheroes ways as well as presenting some of the most insane stunts ever caught on film
Aug 1 2012,negative,this was totally overhyped and not worth the 5 i paid to see it dont understand what the big deal is too much shit going on at once and the writing was bad there was never even a really good climax in the film it had a constant rate at which is was going really slow and boring its sad that all of the character origin movies have lead to this one big piece of crap i was really hoping this would be good
Aug 1 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever great action and a fast moving plot with good characters way better then batman
Jul 31 2012,positive,no spider man i think even though not all the avengers are in the movie the movies was pretty good the movie has it all comedy action the two main ingredients for a epic movie
Jul 31 2012,positive,it could have been better sure however i dont know of any movie that brings this many storylines together this well extremely entertaining
Jul 31 2012,negative,the effects were cool
Jul 31 2012,neutral,sadly it starts slow witch upset me some good moments other not so much
Jul 31 2012,positive,bliss and heaven contains everything you could ever hope for in a superhero movie
Jul 31 2012,positive,excellent want to see more of the avengers
Jul 31 2012,positive,if you liked this check out firefly joss whedons show on netflix
Jul 31 2012,positive,sorry for my last review about this movie but after watching the movie for a second time i  realized i was wrong and that the avengers is badass superhero move with intense action sequences great acting joss whedon directing and ofcourse the movies humor
Jul 31 2012,positive,pretty epic story was weak though
Jul 31 2012,positive,5 stars for action and effects but i need some semblance of drama to stay interested  got really bored
Jul 31 2012,positive,best super hero movie of the decade
Jul 31 2012,positive,definitely the best film of the year so far
Jul 31 2012,positive,ginormus fun moviethis is how you do itmixing all these tales to make a fun moviewow some directors can not even compile one superhero vs villain and then add a few othersremember daredevilaghhhhand whedon  ramithese guys know their comic books and saturday morning flarethey remember what is was like to wake up saturday morning at 6am with a bowl of cereal and have funnot some depressing interpretation
Jul 31 2012,positive,ill be honest when i saw this film was being made i thought it was going to fail i am so glad i was wrong amazing film great plot great dialogue great everything

Jul 31 2012,positive,this movie is great cant wait till the next one
Jul 31 2012,positive,i dont really know how to wrong this film it was absolutely beautiful i could not find any major flaws and they had a wonderful script with wonderful acting not to mention those silly parts that made you laugh and for once they actually made super heros seem realistic  i was never a fan of super heros but this movie makes me love them i can even pick out my favorite characters and have a huge debate on who is better i usually cant do that with any movies nowadays because in most new movies the acting is shit the script is shit and so is the character developement   this is truly a new age movie gem
Jul 31 2012,positive,impossible to live up to the hype but still a good movie glad that they finally got the hulk right but still didnt have the feeling i did while watching the original iron man
Jul 31 2012,positive,just one word awsome
Jul 31 2012,positive,one of the best comic book films of all time the avengers is one fun action packed hit
Jul 31 2012,positive,a blast through and through while nolan has managed to make superhero movies serious joss whedon manages to bring a lot of fun and energy like nonstop fun and energry there was never a dull moment in this thing and it progressively got better and better this is a true summer blockbuster in every sense of the word hopefully we get more like it in the near future
Jul 30 2012,positive,nonstop action and decent effects and cgi even the shouldbecheesy oneliners are fantastic perhaps the best part is that this film made me want to go back and watch all of the others in the franchise that built up to this one  if youre a guy you must see this movie
Jul 30 2012,positive,amazing cant wait for the next one

Jul 30 2012,positive,the greatest super hero movie ever made period
Jul 30 2012,positive,though the plot is paper thin the way the characters interact with each other and the large action sequences more than make up for it one of the most exciting movies out there
Jul 30 2012,positive,because the avengers doesnt take itself too seriously it is colorful fastpaced and fun it is probably the best superhero movie ive seen
Jul 30 2012,positive,amazing movie marvel has been working for a long time to bring us this lets see what its sequel brings to the table and how itll do against dcs justice league that hopefully will be out by then

Jul 30 2012,positive,funfun and morw summer fun at its best
Jul 30 2012,neutral,with this bloating movie paramount proved that the superhero movie generally is more style over substance  with the oversaturation of this genre no where near its end i can only assume that we will be up for at least 2 more avengers films
Jul 30 2012,positive,one of the most overrated movies of all time im usually the one that wants more character development in superhero movies but this was too much they have there own movies for that the last 30 minutes was amazing and one reason was we finally got to see what the hulk could do since he was just being a scientest for the whole movie robert downey jr delivered another annoying performance as iron man chris evans did a great job as usuall as captain america and thor barelly said a pep in the movie and why was loki picked as the villain this movie was very boring until it got to the finale so i will be generous and give it 3 stars
Jul 30 2012,positive,one for the fans me not so much

Jul 30 2012,positive,melding such a disparate collection of characters who have been featured in their own films should be a difficult task joss whedon demonstrates why hes one of the master storytellers working in film and television today commanding a control over a genre that has only started to have more than a handful of films that could be put in the pretty good column in the last 10 of the 70 years superhero films have been produced whedons strength has always been his focus on external and internal conflict for his characters never forgetting what they really want and desire giving them a humanity that made the first superman film the first great superhero flick with the avengers whedon has used that to create the story of a team that has to form and gel very much in the vein of classic films like where eagles dare and the guns of navarone in which group dynamics are just as a danger to completing and surviving the mission as the enemy themselvesas to be expected downeys tony starkiron man shines and the other team members get their own moments to standout and help drive the story the hulk is a breakout character that underscores that in comics he can standalone yet on film hes best integrated in a team setting where his near unstoppable nature can be unleashedas strong as the film is one cant peg the it as having any higher ambitions however as with the aforementioned films such as eagles and navarone that makes the film all the much stronger and watchable as well as rewatchable captain america telling hulk to smash is as memorable and energizing as the climactic confrontation in eagles when burton and eastwood confirm who the traitor whedon should also be praised for including a brief nod and call back to 911 when citizens post pictures of the friends and family they lost on a wall near the end of the film over time summer blockbusters have glossed over the death toll in their films bad boys iis shantytown destruction comes instantly to mind and moments like this while a blink and you miss it moment are a reminder that even in a fictional universe there are real stakes and casualties
Jul 30 2012,positive,a kind of greatest hits package of marvel characters who have had their own films over the last 5 years like most greatest hits you only really get the good stuff and this film certainly delivers in terms of action and performances downey jnr is still the most entertaining as tony stark and is given the most individually to do but hiddleston is also excellent as loki and makes a worthy villain however the real surprise is ruffalo as bannerhulk who brings a sympathetic edge to the role that norton and bana never achieved we dont see a huge amount of the hulk but when he finally starts to smash at the end it is certainly the most effective use of his character in any film yet and whedon throws in some nice comic moments too see his grin when told he can smash and the sneaky punch he throws at thor the confrontation scene between loki and the hulk is also the most laugh out loud moment of the marvel characters series so far  johansson and renner try to do the best with black widow and hawkeye but without their own films to back them up their characters feel a little undeveloped and bland thats the only real critisism i can level at the film ok we dont get the depth that the individual film in the series can offer but thats not what was expected here this is fullon comic book action and its all the better for it
Jul 30 2012,positive,it was totally awesome i loved it soooooo much
Jul 30 2012,positive,outstanding movie with a dynamite story and solid acting  there was astrength in doing the individual member movies first  holywood take note
Jul 30 2012,neutral,i was a big fan of all the other marvel universe movies but this one does not live to the expectation it had no substance no decent action scenes the only plus point was the hulk can be watched only once
Jul 29 2012,positive,great job of bringing the team together and actually having a plot
Jul 29 2012,positive,really cool superhero whizzbangawesomesauce held together by hilarious banter between great characters
Jul 29 2012,positive,great superhero collection
Jul 29 2012,positive,this is the best movie ive seen in a long while i love the cast and all of the action it had a pretty good plot line also it leaves you feeling like a superhero when it is over
Jul 29 2012,positive,a perfect superhero film everybody has a role in the movie
Jul 29 2012,positive,it was amazing it litteraly blew me away best super hero movie yet
Jul 29 2012,negative,although it is impressively produced and there are shots worth watching this movie remains as a standard super heroes movie that aims at pleasing the fans but fails to deliver any surprise or interesting twist
Jul 29 2012,positive,a little over rated in my opinion but not bad to say the least  610
Jul 29 2012,positive,the avengers is an intelligent movie that actually works way above the level set up by previous comic adaptations to this movies credit they never assumed that the advertising or hype or even the look alone was good enough to put butts in the seats without question the makers of this movie went all the way in making it a satisfying experience for not just the fans but for the uninitiated as well they obviously respect their own source material but theyve accentuated the believable and realistic angles of these wild concepts this is a story about great characters and remarkable heroes the action stemming from that is more than amazing i cant tell you how much i enjoyed this movie and how refreshing it was to see something with a guaranteed payday try and succeed at being great they assumed nothing and delivered true greatness kudos
Jul 29 2012,positive,awesome movie better than i expected and i already had high expectations
Jul 29 2012,positive,ridiculously entertaining appeals to the comic geek in everyone while lacking any depth it definitely delivers the wow factor
Jul 29 2012,positive,loved it allcant wait for the next one
Jul 29 2012,positive,probably the most overrated movie of the year avengers was funny and entertaining but lacked emotion by the time the credits roll you would have forgot about this film it lacks thought provoking themes or stories required to be a meaningful movie
Jul 29 2012,positive,awsome  seen it 3 times
Jul 29 2012,positive,i was skeptical going into this film as most people probably were i just wasnt sure how one could pull it off even the incredible joss whedon who is well known for his excellent writing of ensemble casts thankfully this film did not disappoint in any way in fact this is the best film i have seen from marvel to date joss whedon makes the very wise decision to make the avengers as a team a singular protagonist rather than making them multiple protagonists constantly clamoring for screen time which was what i feared it would be this allows all of the characters to be relevant to the story there is also a level of wit that allows these characters to come to life to the point where they dont just feel like charicatures its plot is simple but effective my only major issues were with the chitauri who didnt really feel well developed enough to be more than just the threat that the avengers had to take on but this doesnt bother me that much because its loki that really steals the show here  this is also the first comic book movie that actually felt like i was reading a comic on screen it felt like a culmination of the previous plot lines established in the earlier movies really taking advantage of continuity like any good comic book story should this film is a love letter to comic book fans everywhere and deserves to be placed among the best of all comic book movies
Jul 29 2012,positive,i am not even a big comic book person overall but i thought that this was very entertaining and i will most likely be excited to see any sequel i thought that it was a great adaptation of bringing a comic book to film large scale but still real particularly the scenes in the city overthetop but not overly ridiculous and the characters interactions and personality flaws as well as transitions felt a lot more real and i enjoyed them a lot more than in a couple of the characters individual movies
Jul 29 2012,positive,bested perhaps only by the dark night rises jampacked with action drama and the perfect amount of comedy great watch
Jul 29 2012,positive,i seen it and it was a great movie
Jul 29 2012,positive,i mean give me more this was so good
Jul 29 2012,positive,the most epic movie of all time
Jul 29 2012,positive,the only downside to the film is that it finished great cg awesome action scenes great storyline and superb script every actor was perfectly cast ill admit i was a little unsure about mark ruffalo as bruce banner but superb cant wait for the next installment
Jul 29 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen all the actors were marvelous and joss did a fantastic job one of my top 5 desert island movies
Jul 29 2012,positive,i dont usually worship at the alter of joss but with the avengers i come close  a brilliant ensemble piece with character development a complex plot and  heartstopping action sequences
Jul 29 2012,positive,hope they make a second film
Jul 29 2012,positive,good fun as long as you going wanting to sit back and watch some good action with a few laughs then youll love this
Jul 29 2012,positive,well hey now whedon does well with what could be a pretty uneven script and rather nafflooking men in funny costumes having fun with his material while its not the wildly orgasmic thrillride most breathless fan reviews would have you believe its not a crappy product either having good actors although hemsworth is probably the weakest of the lot is a great asset to a fantasy film
Jul 28 2012,positive,super awesome movieloved it 3
Jul 28 2012,positive,best movie ive seen the hulk was the best 
Jul 28 2012,positive,best superhero movie i have ever seen iron man hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow are amazing together on the big screen the humor action visual effects characters story are all strong

Jul 28 2012,positive,loved it i got a good laugh out of it
Jul 28 2012,positive,best movie of all time hands down 
Jul 28 2012,positive,great epic  funny with heart
Jul 28 2012,positive,loved seeing all the characters in one movie love the humor and the character interactionsplot is going to be predictable its a comic book but it was an enjoyable night out
Jul 28 2012,positive,i watched two time on the movie theater and is a great movie and funny movie in some part to start the move it same not vary inserting is only when everything getting research about the cube from the lad then in new york city there someone help to catch person and i really love him he is funny moments and i bring more happy and funny most of this movie is going to catch person and also getting remove a different plant  what why they are some part have funny moments and most part are sires to work together it a great movie only from funny moments
Jul 28 2012,positive,about what i expected it to be but it managed to entertain me enough and dazzle with spectacular effects but the best superhero movie ever it is not
Jul 28 2012,positive,really really good some funny parts to
Jul 28 2012,positive,i absolutely loved this movie
Jul 28 2012,positive,for fans of the featured marvel superheroes the avengers is a fun and actionpacked experience best served on the big screen in 3d ive loved the films leading up to this one dibs on tony stark and was pleasantly surprised by how each of the main characters received equal screen time  i ended up enjoying the hulks role far more than i would have expected and it was great seeing the introduction of new supporting characters such as agent maria hill played by my favorite how i met your mother star cobie smulders  lots of campy oneliners bright costumes and completely unfeasible stunts make this the perfect summer blockbuster
Jul 28 2012,positive,i have to admit ive enjoyed all the marvel studios productions thus far  this was the culmination of it all joss whedon was the perfect director for this project he not only knows  understands the core apects of the characters he respects them coupled with his knack for balancing groups of strong characters he was expected to hit it out of the park  i feel he did i was disapointed that ed norton wasnt coming back as banner but i have to say that im totally sold on mark ruffalo he was the dark horse in the mix and he really broke out all in all this was far from a perfect movie but it knew what it was  what it was trying to do an ensemble of marvels mightiest delivering high octave  action  summer movie fun
Jul 28 2012,positive,best superhero film to date the hulk was incredible
Jul 28 2012,positive,still love this movie it holds up well after a couple years and the whedon banter is thoroughly enjoyable 512015
Jul 28 2012,positive,easily the best marvel movie to date the hulk steals this one
Jul 28 2012,positive,this movie was amazing it barely had any corny lines most superhero movies do and tom hiddleston had me fangirling most of the time iron man had some very funny lines that had me and my friend cracking up the whole time
Jul 28 2012,positive,a pretty good movie i didnt like the cheesy humor if you know what i mean i absolutely loved robert downey jrs part the plot didnt make much sense but it wouldve been better if all the villains from the heroes movies were against them instead of only thors enemy and robots
Jul 28 2012,positive,it was ok but not it exceeded my expectations now to wait the second part
Jul 28 2012,positive,the best loved the avengers
Jul 28 2012,positive,love iron man as usual some of movie was not as good as it was hyped up to be
Jul 28 2012,positive,best marvel movie ever must see if you havent seen it yet
Jul 28 2012,positive,with a promising collection of great action heroes and a plot though meatier it never messes with the power of great heroes but to the greatness and magnum opus created this is surely a popcorn action film watch out for hulk smash b
Jul 28 2012,positive,a solid outcome after mostly lackluster introductory movies save for iron man the script is decent though it relies more on humorous dialogue than an enticing story whedon is smart to make rdjs tony stark the centerpiece and while this reduces some others to stereotyped bit parts ruffalo breathes muchneeded life into the hulk character action in the final battle is a bit overwhelming but the visual presentation is sharp and discernible a frenzied yet entertaining theme park ride
Jul 28 2012,positive,laugh out loud when i saw the scene of hulk being angry
Jul 28 2012,positive,if youre a fan of comics  youre gonna salivate all over this one 
Jul 28 2012,positive,best movie of all time completelly epic
Jul 28 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is a great movie that brings together four separate franchises with four separate leading actors each with an established career and egos could have gone terribly wrong for marvel if just one of those egos got too big to control but joss whedon managed to unify the ensemble and they bang it out of the park the movie starts off with a bang and never lets up the only thing keeping this from a perfect score are a few minor conveniences that  take away from the seriousness of the situation and the lack of a better score its a great time to be had and a fun time for all ages as the avengers assemble in a grandiose way
Jul 28 2012,negative,i admit i did have a bit to drink before this movie and then fell sleep during the showing so im not entirely sure this counts but it has good reviews so my little shitty one shouldnt hinder it if i didnt have so many glasses of wine i might have stayed awake the characters looked a bit faggy but there was some chest hair so it gets points for that
Jul 28 2012,positive,a good super hero movie and not much more than that
Jul 28 2012,positive,best movie of the year better than the dark knight rises in my opinion
Jul 27 2012,positive,as a comic book fan i enjoyed this i got real excited when they formed on the screen together this was a fans dream
Jul 27 2012,positive,best movie ever seen it 8 times and will see it several more before the dvd can be added to my movie shelf
Jul 27 2012,positive,i love this movie best marvel movie yet 
Jul 27 2012,positive,best movie in the entire world would deffinatly see it again cant wait for it to come out on dvd
Jul 27 2012,positive,so amazingly executed it still amazes me that one director could bring all these characters from all different films in to one film and still remain very true to the backing stories of these characters from the other films in which they starred in although a little dull in some places those dull moments were in deed needed to take place in the actual film otherwise it wouldve been another blow out super hero film thats only way to entertain its audience is to show massive explosions the actors played their roles amazingly and i very much like the hulk in this film as well as tom hiddlestons loki what an actor he has become i still want to see this film one last time even though i saw it in the cinematheatre 5 times
Jul 27 2012,positive,absolutely amazing the effects are awesome the fights are killer and the characters are so badass only thing were missing more hulk
Jul 27 2012,positive,late on this review but when is this going to be out on dvd
Jul 27 2012,positive,what a breathtaking unstoppable force that throws hero after hero at you in a crafty entertaining way though joss whedons plot seems a bit weak per usual it still works passing by with a stellar script and excellent performances from the superhero cast
Jul 27 2012,positive,marvel has made the best movie ever action and humor combined so seamlessly and everyone did a great job hulk was fantastic definately gonna see it in theaters again
Jul 27 2012,positive,movie with lots of breaks that could be contained with more action instead of talking gibberish so that you end up distracted by silly things in their midst but what makes this film being good is the excellent performance by mark ruffalo and scarlett johasson as bruce  hulk and black widow the jokes of tony stark and the evil loki but nothing that is worthy of five stars
Jul 27 2012,positive,awesome movie my only problems are hawkeye is hypnotyzed through most of the movie and hulk is barely in the movie
Jul 27 2012,positive,best superherocomic movie ever made marvel fans rejoice
Jul 27 2012,positive,really entertaining  good for all ages
Jul 27 2012,positive,still a bit sour about whedon doing the avengers instead of xmen but this is still like  wow
Jul 27 2012,positive,even though its rushed cheesy and it lacks one serious bad guy named thanos marvel supersedes all detractors with another good ol blockbuster
Jul 27 2012,positive,great movie a comic book bigger than life with humor morality and a lesson for us all a great couple of hours and money very well spent thanks marvel  a mustsee for any one who enjoys seeing heroes overcome the odds and toss evil out on its a
Jul 27 2012,positive,one of the top 5 superhero movies of all time carried by robert downey jrs performance and surprisingly not hurt by mark rufflos
Jul 27 2012,positive,absolutely fantastic movie
Jul 27 2012,positive,absolutely outstanding film it didnt take itself too seriously which i think helped move the film along nicely while lending to the complexities of the characters youd think hot heads would collide more but the way joss whedon blends everything together just runs perfectly very funny fast paced and all together incredibly entertaining
Jul 27 2012,positive,the visualeffects is a masterpiece by itself but i believe its the wellconstructed buildup to the film that provided that strong delivery throughout its allotted time its colorful charactersstars and strong chemistry erects the film to a height bigger than any superhero or group of superheroes combined avengers indeed assembled and its outstanding 455
Jul 27 2012,positive,saw it when it first came out of but never rated it
Jul 27 2012,positive,excellent action from beginning to end 3d made it even sweeter
Jul 27 2012,positive,the avengers was an okay movie i thought the best thing about the movie were the characters the hulk and iron man everyone else just did not have much to do especially hawkeye and captain america i also thought the fight scenes with the the avengers and lokis army was too unrealistic i was really disappointed in how loki was easily defeated loki started out very strong but was dismantled in two seconds by the hulk with no retaliation i thought the story line was simple
Jul 27 2012,positive,someone told me this was the new avengers movie  no patrick macnee no gareth hunt and no joanna lumley
Jul 27 2012,positive,fun movie not great but fun  hulk smashing was hilarious
Jul 27 2012,positive,love marvel movies adding this one to my collection
Jul 27 2012,positive,one star off for recastings hawkeyes lack of costume and captain americas mask
Jul 27 2012,positive,it was good a little bit over ratedbut good
Jul 27 2012,positive,its not perfect by any means but it captures the essence of my favourite superheroes that i can so relate  especially the hulk i would like to smash something too if i get that angry seen it six times and cant wait for the next installment of the marvel cinematic universe
Jul 27 2012,positive,too much adventure scenes with our favorite heroes also there are some funny scenes which are very succesfulvote910

Jul 26 2012,positive,it was amazing didnt even notice time pass by definetly worth a watch if not more
Jul 26 2012,positive,best superhero action film to date
Jul 26 2012,positive,outside of the christopher nolan batman movies particularly the dark knight i cant think of a single superhero movie that was nearly so engaging so beautifully continuing what was previously set up and just so darn awesome as this one best movie ticket i ever bought
Jul 26 2012,positive,best marvel movie ive ever seen but doesnt come close to outshining batman
Jul 26 2012,positive,i love love love this movie robert downey jrs iron man aka tony stark is the heart and soul of this film but i found myself really liking the other main players as well including mark ruffalos bruce bannerhulk saw it multiple times and cant wait until it is on home video i need my daily tony stark snark fix
Jul 26 2012,positive,i loved this movie it was perfect from beginning to end
Jul 26 2012,positive,i got confused they messed everything up with a lot of characters from different moviesâ but its also so so so funny the funny guys deserves four stars loved the movie
Jul 26 2012,positive,klassefilm action nonstop fede oneliners og scarlett johansson
Jul 26 2012,positive,the avengers has a special script included with action and humor and its director knows distribute masterfully time and the importance of each character
Jul 26 2012,positive,this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
Jul 26 2012,positive,this is popcorn entertainment at its highest this movie got it all great action scenes very funny script and a fast foward pacing not to mention all the great performences the hulk rocks
Jul 26 2012,positive,the avengers is by far the best marvel movie ever and the dark knight wont be able to beat it
Jul 26 2012,positive,well well well what a pleasant surprise any film that tries to reintroduce the word quim into everyday usage deserves three stars any film with harry dean stanton gets a star by default and im giving it an extra halfstar because i cant remember the last time i had so much fun in a cinema ridiculous overblown nonsensical fun that has its tongue firmly in cheek but also slyly subverts the superhero genre  which is not so surprising since joss whedon is at the helm i have never been a fan of his  his characters usually annoy the shit out of me and his tendency to make every single line of dialogue a comedic gem gets on my nerves  but hats off to him here this is a brilliant film that cracked me up on multiple occasions and ticked all the right boxes   it takes a lot to get me to watch a cgifest but this did the trick in spades one of my films of the year so far
Jul 26 2012,negative,definitely not my franchise at all but i guess the effects were good
Jul 26 2012,positive,iron man need me to say anything else
Jul 26 2012,positive,without the conic relief it would not have been as good as the hype
Jul 26 2012,positive,what can i say this is an absolute must see movie
Jul 26 2012,positive,this has to be one of the best fullthrottle action movies  and the hulk steals the show
Jul 26 2012,positive,an entertaining movie whose job was made considerably easier by a great cast of characters admittedly to balance their screen time while advancing the plot mustve been a challenge and everything was pretty tightly scripted but at the end of the film it was all just light entertainment good but i suppose tdk trilogy had me wanting more of course the film was also better because i felt like i was getting four movies for the price of one but i digress
Jul 26 2012,positive,if there was more stars i wouldve given it way more great movie period
Jul 26 2012,positive,the kids and i really enjoyed this one  it really was concerned about having this much star power that they just wouldnt gel as a cast but they did very well  it was worth the wait and looking forward to the next one  while its not a complaint on mark ruffalo i wouldve loved to have seen ed norton as the hulk also laughed at the scene with stan lee and lou ferrigno  while the kids knew who stan lee is  had to explain the humon with ferrigno and after showing them a picture they thought it was hilarious
Jul 26 2012,positive,love the actor who played hulk
Jul 26 2012,positive,hands down the best comic book movie of alltime there is no competition click below for a full review 
Jul 26 2012,positive,great movie a great sense of action and personality and a nice twist with the death of the agent
Jul 26 2012,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Jul 26 2012,positive,another grey adventure 
Jul 26 2012,positive,if youre expecting something like christopher nolans dark knight franchise i will tell you to look elsewhere if you are looking to be thoroughly entertained and get some laughs from some of your superhero favorites then you have come to the right place secondbest super hero flick of the summer an definitely better than all of the characters respective movies that make up the avengers
Jul 26 2012,positive,fabulous fun they are all heroes 
Jul 26 2012,positive,good entertainment i am glad they made the money they spent wont deny enjoying the screen presence of jeremy renner mark ruffalo chris evans and gool old rob downey jr hemsworth i didnt care for much in this movie and was glad to not have watched thor johansson was an actor i used to like but now her screen presence entertains me only slightly the costume designers could have done better i feel and what i detested the most the newfound fascination with india there is so many of them spread all out getting tips shouldnt be difficult even if it is for a few scenes
Jul 25 2012,positive,best movie of the year saw it twice
Jul 25 2012,positive,freaking great live iron man n hulk thing going on and sexy thor yummy
Jul 25 2012,positive,the avengers is one of the best super hero movies of all time the acting the action scenes and some funny parts to the line that captain america says to the hulk which is hulk smash that was a good line and the part where thor tries to hit captain america with his hammer and he captain america with stood it with his shield now that was funny and samuel l jackson as nick fury is what i like to call a bonus
Jul 25 2012,positive,marvels avengers has something not a lot of movies have and that is balance there are some scenes that will having laughing hard followed by some scenes that will blow you away with its explosions each super hero gets their moment to shine even agent coulson gets his time to shine but the true scene stealer is the hulk the story is the movies only fault borrowing the plots of the other movies and feels less interesting than the characters in the film this is still an exciting and enjoyable super hero expierence
Jul 25 2012,positive,funny yet not as epic as was expected
Jul 25 2012,positive,they have done it again love this movie
Jul 25 2012,positive,this film was made very well outstanding writing outstanding directing and acting i loved every comedic moment and every action sequence was villain loki was great and i loved how each avenger reacted off of each other  some things to nit pick like how the hulk conviently learned how to control his anger at the end when earlier in the movie he went on a rampage yeah nice control  but other than that great film  9510 masterpiece
Jul 25 2012,positive,action packed from beginning to end
Jul 25 2012,positive,maybe i was expecting too much but its not in the same class as xmen first class
Jul 25 2012,positive,best super hero movie there is

Jul 25 2012,positive,cool big fan of hulk
Jul 25 2012,positive,a wonderful action packed well cast well scripted nonstop ride  despite the fact i had yet to watch any of the superhero films for any of the characters featured in this film that came before and were referenced within the film i still didnt feel i had missed too much  this says a lot for the films writers and the director  often in movie franchises you miss large plot turns and twists along the way when even one film goes unseen in this case i didnt really feel that at all and i had missed them all  i really think this is a film that could be enjoyed by everyone no matter their gender or age it has something for everyone  i recommend this one superhero fanatic or not
Jul 25 2012,positive,proud to be a marvel fan

Jul 25 2012,positive,amazing superheros good story action comedywhats not to love
Jul 25 2012,positive,awsome movie just the way they done it was amazing
Jul 25 2012,positive,though at first i viewed this movie as another hollywood fad to drive more comic book related films into the limelight i must admit im not an overly huge fan of comic book films  iron man and chris nolan directed ones excluded when i watched this i was pleasantly surprised to really quite enjoy this film its very cleverly done usually when you have this array of characters in one film it tends to either be a bit long and tedious whilst the director is trying to develop every characters individual emotional backdrop or it tends to do the opposite whereas one character has the main limelight and youre left wondering what is the point of having all the other characters there this one treads the background story lightly and works rather quite well obviously i check a lot of films out on flixster before i see them i try not to because its can change my opinion with this film it feels like it has been a tad bit overrated on my books like i said though im not a huge fan of comic book films but to me this film should be a standard of comic book films rather than treating it as a masterpiece the main reason why i feel like this is because there is nothing outstanding about it and there is nothing that is overtly different about it essentially if you have seen all the previous marvel films leading up to this it is a fairly similar theme and setting there is little extra to take from this film the only thing i can think of that kinda separates it apart is the freeforall royal rumble element to it where several superheros are beating the st out of each it though quite a satisfying viewing  first things first is that the acting in this is quite cool robert downey jr is awesome and smarmycocky best just like in the iron man film which i rate highly sometimes i feel like the reason why i enjoyed this film so much is because of downeys demanding presence and he is quite a central character as well he has a lot of screen time samuel jackson plays his role quite well albeit nothing too different from his usual samuel role theres a great quote in this film which highlights this no context needed nick fury  thats a stupidass plan give my team time i thought that was very typical samuel and rather funny i think though the rest of the avengers were played quite well and it felt seamless i give a lot credit for mark ruffalo as bruce banner i enjoyed edward nortons portrayal in the incredible hulk i was unsure what angle of which that mark ruffalo would approach it it worked rather nicely i thought as the calm but decidely instant moodswing manner that he had the villian in this loki was a very well portrayed by tom hiddleston he was a very cool hellbent character that seem to start of invincible and the end up laughable it was a nice villian character to have as most comic book villians tend to be laughable but insane at the very beginning and remain that way but with loki it was a nice and charismatic character to have one other point which i couldnt work out and id like people that comment me on this when i went to the cinema to see altough it was a cardboard cut out poster i saw that cobie smulders was in it and whilst watching the film she had quite a bit of screen time generally it would be a reaction shot or quick sentence or two speaking to nick fury it struck me a bit odd because her role was not that essential to film and it was not as if she was well known character i thought that the amount of screen time she had was a bit too much for her importance in the film it just struck as something that im not sure if it was just me that noticed or maybe she has got an important role i dont know  at the end of the day though what joss whedon has done with this film is very clever and although prehaps not a special film it is certainly a great film and shows that with a clever script direction and actors you can have a lot of characters in one film and not make a meal of it just look at the watchmen
Jul 25 2012,positive,hilarious intense heartful entertaining and never boring the avengers is everything a suphero movie should be and it marks for the best superhero and action movie ever known to man
Jul 25 2012,positive,i am writing this about a month after i saw the film  having just seen the dark knight rises i can have to say this takes second place to that movie  if i could speak about this movie before i saw tdkr i would say it was the best movie of the summer  i was kind of afraid to see them mash up all these people from some movies that ran the gamut from entertaining to a bust but they really did a great job  it was an epic film and everything seemed to meld well  i would recommend going to see this in the theater  robert downey is generally portrayed as an arrogant but loveable jerk  this quality is amalgamated and made even better by the compliment of the other actors in this film  it was very entertaining as it was suspenseful very funny action packed with a well developed plot   i would say that the avengers is the summer movie but maybe it was the spring movie  really good go see it and but the dvd when it comes out  also they didnt screw up the hulk which seems to be the default for all hulk movies   capt ammurkia was like the least super of the super heros  still his presence was noticed and added to the movie hawk eye and ninja girlwell their not so super  no super suit no super green stuff going on no super godness and no super duper patriotism but again their presence was noticed  i really should have written this review after i saw the film
Jul 25 2012,positive,this was definitely the hit of the summer  after a 5 year 5 film buildup the avengers delivers on all fronts  mark ruffalo and tom hiddleston had performances that stole the movie  joss whedon who i seriously had my doubts about directed this movie with sheer flawlessness  a mustsee mustown movie
Jul 25 2012,positive,so far the best movie of 2012 nuff said
Jul 25 2012,positive,it was an okay movie it was interesting and it kept you entertained still its not a movie that will be remembered maybe thats why you have to see it so many times to actually keep it in your memory seeing as so many people have seen it over and over again but for me its not a movie that i would watch more than once although i enjoyed it the first time
Jul 25 2012,positive,awsome loved it loved loki films have got a lot to live up to
Jul 25 2012,positive,cant wait for the next one
Jul 25 2012,positive,nothing to complain about great movie no holes and done in a reasonable time no offense batman
Jul 25 2012,positive,really really good and im not a huge fan of all the super hero flicks some really funny scenes as well
Jul 25 2012,positive,visually stunning wonderful acting great plot the avengers has everything that makes up a great super hero movie joss whedon is finally getting the recognition that he deserves as this masterpiece is truly a credit to his thus far under appreciated genius
Jul 25 2012,positive,great job joss whedon
Jul 25 2012,positive,all your favorite marvel heroes team up for this awesome blockbuster movie
Jul 25 2012,positive,a tad overhyped and not as good as i hoped it would be downey steals the show again
Jul 25 2012,positive,nonstop action and suprisingly funny
Jul 25 2012,positive,my favorite movie of all time
Jul 25 2012,positive,the traditional summer super hero movie just a lot of puncheslarge explosions and hulk smashing it was pretty good but i dont see why it got such a big hype i mean it was cool to see a lot of your favorite super heroes fighting together but it wasnt that special to me
Jul 24 2012,positive,great movie keep them coming 
Jul 24 2012,positive,fun  there were never really any stakes as to any characters not surviving but still fun
Jul 24 2012,neutral,fun to see everyone together but if your going to hype everyone with teasers through 5 other marvel movies you better try harder to cover up those plot holes
Jul 24 2012,negative,lame story watching rerun of any xmen movie is infinitely more entertaining
Jul 24 2012,positive,would have been the super hero movie of the year had it not been for dark knight none the less this was an awesome movie
Jul 24 2012,positive,action packed and star studded movie not the best plot but who cares with all the action packed and humor filled scenes
Jul 24 2012,positive,good movie lots of action
Jul 24 2012,positive,a fun action packed smash if you havent seen thor then watch it on blu ray before watching the avengers
Jul 24 2012,positive,this is my favorite action movie but wheres spider man
Jul 24 2012,positive,amazing avengers thats all i gotta say
Jul 24 2012,positive,now that was a great movie
Jul 24 2012,positive,good fun but thought scarlett johansson character little pointless aside from her in that catsuit
Jul 24 2012,positive,great flick gonna get that dvd in blurayfor the kid in all of us
Jul 24 2012,positive,might just be the greatest superhero movie ever made
Jul 24 2012,positive,a must see movie funny at times and a lot of action loved it
Jul 24 2012,positive,great story great acting great action  and in most other summers would be considered the best film darkknightrises
Jul 24 2012,positive,theavengers has everything you want from a comicbook movie great action great preformances and masterfully written whedon really did a good job fleshing out not just the main cast but the entire supporting cast as well marvel studios proves that if you take your time with each character get a writer and director who is passionate about the material and knows the material well enough to juggle around a juggernaut of a cast you end up with one hell of a movie take out your note pads people at dc comics
Jul 24 2012,positive,a wonderful witty superhero movie generic at times but i loved the callback to an actual 70s comic book style
Jul 24 2012,positive,doesnt deserve 5 stars next to dark knight rises and amazing spiderman but it was good entertaining good characters
Jul 24 2012,positive,absolutely stellar years worth of individual movies culminates in a veritable extravaganza of pure geek indulgence a triumph in its own way
Jul 24 2012,positive,perfectly done fun action packed and nails the characters like no film has before
Jul 24 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ever made it has it all plus so much more this movie quite brilliantly ties all the prequels thor iron man 12 hulk and captain america together this is a text book example how to please the movie goers looking forward to new prequels and of course avengers 2
Jul 24 2012,positive,if ot want for hulk and ironman it would have not made it
Jul 24 2012,positive,i love love loved it captain america the hulk thor  my personal favorite ironman all together in one movie  how can you go wrong
Jul 24 2012,positive,its big its loud and its awesome  the avengers is certainly an exiting movie  with plenty of wit and sarcasm to satisfy even the most deprived watcher  joss whedon  has done it again
Jul 24 2012,positive,the 12 summer movie season certainly started off with a bang thanks to marvels the avengers also given the horrible title avengers assemble in the uk directed by joss whedon the avengers is the tale marvel fans have been dreaming of since iron man hinted at the idea many years ago now that dream has come into fruition and what we have here is some exceptional popcorn entertainment the story is simple nick fury samuel l jackson needs a team a team of heroes far greater than the world has ever seen to stop an angry loki tom hiddleston  from taking the world into his grasp so what does mr fury do he assembles captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth iron man robert downey jr black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner  the incredible hulk mark ruffalo to bring about justice to the innocent citizens ofwell planet earth at first glance i wasnt too impressed by the story with loki being the key villain i knew going in that this hero teamup would take more from the thor movie than any of the previous marvel movies but alas this simplicity is the avengers secret weapon by making the story line so basic whedon  cowriter zak penn accomplished 2 things that being they 1 made it basic enough for youngsters watching to get the gist of it and 2 allowed more time for the characters to ramble amoungst themselves and grow into the team that they ultimately have to become by the end of the movie in order to save the world this 2nd point leads into what i enjoyed most about avengers the heart of the movie to some may be the action yes but to me what made this movie so effective in its inherent awesomeness was being able to sit back and watch some of the greatest super heroes ever created argue with one another yeah to me some of the best scenes were not the combat because to be honest the aliens or whatever they were fighting looked about as good as something on scifi channel but the scenes of dialogue the avengers had to overcome two obstacles in this movie annihilation of the planet and themselves the latter of the two being what i enjoyed most captain america really shined at the end of the movie i loved how for majority of the time he was doing his best to work with the team by way of being humble eventually however he had to put on the mantle of being a true captain and lead his team out into the field iron man on the other hand was probably the most annoying of the entire team i understand that part of iron mans appeal is his lack of empathy and arrogance to anyone who isnt as rich as he is but there were times when i thought to myself wow he really needs to shut up that being said this is my second favorite performance of downey jr as tony stark with my favorite being the original iron man black widow and hawkeye seemed pointless at first but surprised me by being thoroughly entertaining i just wish that they wouldve had a little more personality compared to cap thor iron man  hulk they really arent that charismatic thor was easily my 2nd favorite hero out of the bunch cap being 1st for his god line and sincere desire for justice you can definitley see that hemsworth really understands his character now that he has played him in two movies thor appealed to me because of his emotional ties to the villain loki who is also his brother the hulk was tremendously fun to watch bounce around and punch bad guys right where it hurts there is a gag between him and loki that had the entire theater roaring with laughter this hulk is great and is the way hulk should look act and sound they finally got the giant cgi blob of green rage right on film loki was to say the least a villain that acted as if he had great intentions with his plan against the world but deep down still was unable to get over what happened between him and his family in the first thor movie loki was a delight on screen snobby confident and a bit more sinister loki could potentially be one the great movie villains in later marvel movies overall the avengers was an absolute blast i had a few things to nitpick but nothing that seriously damaged the integrity of the film a lot of people including myself were skeptical about a super hero teamup movie being done well those fears have been laid to rest thanks to whedon and co the avengers was everything it promised to be and more phase 1 of marvels motion pictures is complete and let me tell you it has been a joy watching it all come together 4 12 out of 5 stars
Jul 24 2012,positive,i would watch it again in the theater
Jul 24 2012,positive,it was a pretty awesome movie
Jul 24 2012,positive,one of the best movies this year i liked everyone in it they pulled everyone together nicely im still lost about hot guy and black widow
Jul 24 2012,positive,absolutely awesome full on bad ass movie cant wait for the sequel
Jul 24 2012,positive,a really great movie robert downey jr does a really good job of adding a comic roll to this action movie
Jul 24 2012,positive,definitely met expectations
Jul 24 2012,positive,it was a great movie team work was good action was good kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie
Jul 24 2012,negative,this is a real delight fun filled flick its so entertaining that you wont even mind if the guy sitting in the front of you farts on your face
Jul 24 2012,neutral,this movie is good but highly overrated they could have done so much more with it just a bunch of oneliners and cgi its pretty much iron man 3 featuring a bunch of black widow character development it is directed great but the plot sucks i dont see how some people like this better than tdkr
Jul 24 2012,positive,its just another uninspiring explosion fest thats it  no heart no soul no nothing
Jul 23 2012,positive,what more can be said the perfect pop corn comic book flick
Jul 23 2012,positive,what more can be said the perfect pop corn comic book flick

Jul 23 2012,positive,i really like this movie very well done
Jul 23 2012,positive,holy crap on a cracker bestsuperheromovieever joss you rock now that ive seen dark knight only one movie stands a chance to beat the avengers for best movie of the year when we go back to the shire we will see but avengers has heart soul action  everything luuuuuv
Jul 23 2012,positive,funny adventurer the cast is wonderful but i enjoyed the last 45 minutes the most
Jul 23 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever made
Jul 23 2012,positive,it was good but it was very predictable
Jul 23 2012,positive,its certainly entertaining im just not sure if i want to see movies on individual characters after this especially thor and captain america
Jul 23 2012,positive,great culmination of the marvel universewell done and leaving us wanting and expecting much moregreat marketing
Jul 23 2012,negative,unfortunately not for my taste too flat and with an emphasis put on special effects it is only another blockbuster made to earn the big bucks the dialogues are witty and funny at times but thats all
Jul 23 2012,positive,first action packed comedy with a group of heros
Jul 23 2012,positive,an awesome marvel teamup bad ass movie
Jul 23 2012,positive,this is a fantastic film by marvel the one thing that slightly disappointed me was that spider man was not included in this film however because of the constant action in this film i dont see how they would have fitted him into it all it is a very good film and a must see for all marvel fans
Jul 23 2012,positive,99 of crossover movies usually suck thankfully marvels the avengers is in that 1 in fact it is marvels most successful movie to date joss whedon hasnt had many boxoffice smashes until now being a comic book nerd himself whedon knew what was best for this film robert downey jrs narcissistic tony stark plays the perfect leader for the avengers initiative chris evans is the perfect opposite for robert downey jr evans plays steve rogers aka captain america the old yet loyal counterpart to downeys young and condescending iron man the hulk has always been a difficult role in cinema when ang lee brought the superhero to the big screen in 2003 it opened to mixed reviews it was improved back in 2008 when edward norton was brought in since norton couldnt sign on for this movie ruffalo became the angered bruce banner he was subject to much skepticism because no one seemed to believe he was up for the part contrary to popular belief he was the most favorable hulk yet not to forget thor played by chris hemsworth who didnt get as much screen time as the others but did an excellent job also hawkeye and black widow played by jeremy renner and scarlett johansson respectively were superb superheroes along with the clear sexual tension between them along with tom hiddleston gwyneth paltrow samuel l jackson and cobie smulders the ensemble cast was perfect for this epic movie all in all this movies financial success speaks for itself when it comes to reviewing it
Jul 23 2012,positive,really food and fun movie  nothing out of the ordinary in terms of storyline but the filmmakers did a great job of establishing all the characters even though most of us know them and their relationships with each other  a very fun and at times funny film a definite must see
Jul 23 2012,positive,great movie to begin the summer season
Jul 23 2012,positive,best comic book movie yet
Jul 23 2012,positive,everything you want a super hero movie to be bravo joss
Jul 23 2012,positive,good but not amazing
Jul 23 2012,positive,thin on plot think on action  mindnumbing entertainment
Jul 23 2012,positive,this movie played it safe but in doing so successfully set up great movies to come well made and i cant wait for the next one
Jul 23 2012,positive,very good action and ending was spectacular but for me personally didnt have enough substance or emotion to make it a fantastic movie still is great and my second favorite marvel movie behind the first iron man
Jul 23 2012,positive,the best movie to date based on a marvel property  filled with action suspense and comedy it is everything that a comic book movie should be and is the epitome of a summer blockbuster  the effects were seamless and as a whole the movie looked fantastic at the imax 3d screening i was at  joss whedon and the rest of the creative team did a great job building a both a coherent story and a believable reason for these characters to come together  each character was given just the right amount of screen time and with no one of them monopolizing the action or laughs though again downey slips perfectly into the skin of tony stark  the future is bright for this franchise and with most of the stars signed to a 3 picture deal there is little doubt the avengers will assemble again
Jul 23 2012,positive,awesome epic and funny one of the best superhero movies ever
Jul 23 2012,positive,simply awesome couldnt be any better
Jul 23 2012,positive,marvels the avengers was exactly what i imagine it was intended to be a very fun movie  while the story lacked depth it pulled off the very difficult task of uniting four of the biggest names in comics without it feeling like one overshadowed the others  the action scenes were fantastic
Jul 23 2012,positive,can easily watch it over and over again
Jul 23 2012,positive,the avengers 2012 directed by joss whedon 5 out of 5 stars  outstanding well worth the wait and the hype when loki threatens the earth sam jackson assembles the hulk iron man and world weary living legend captain america to save the day in the finest marvel film since last years captain america  which in many ways was better even than this  the film is action packed and filled with humor pros the banter between the heroes is the star of the film cons boring intro and opening an alien threat that isnt so threatening verdict the avengers is a must see everyone had their doubts but marvel has delivered their answer to dcs the dark knight and while the avengers is pure popcorn cheese compared to christopher nolans 2008 masterpiece it works an an entirely different level the avengers doesnt try to make you think its just wants you to sit back and have fun well done marvel well done
Jul 23 2012,positive,what more can i say baby
Jul 23 2012,positive,surprisingly well balanced with so many heroes it is exciting ambitious and has the perfect mix of humor it is easily apparent that joss wheadon knows these characters better than the other marvel movie directors finally someone was able to hit the nail on the big green head of âthe hulk on the big screen
Jul 23 2012,positive,i am waiting it in bluray
Jul 23 2012,positive,amazing movie suggested to all marvel fans and even someone who ha seen the other movies just pure amazing
Jul 23 2012,positive,glad i watched it on the big screen  never a dull moment
Jul 23 2012,positive,huh al right but couldnt really see what all the fuss was about
Jul 23 2012,positive,the fact that they could that actually exceeded expectations of the build up for the avengers movie is just unbelievable but they really did awesome awesome movie along side the batman trilogy iron man movies and xmen 2 this is hands down one of the greatest comic movies of all time
Jul 23 2012,positive,probably the best superhero movie of all time
Jul 23 2012,positive,the best movie of the year 1
Jul 23 2012,positive,enjoyable film and exactly what you expect from a whedon film however this breaks away from how several of the characters were built up in their previous movies and detracts from the entire film in my view
Jul 23 2012,positive,was good in some partsnot so in some but overallit drags a bit and suffers from the 3dacting was the saving grace of this film the story maybe easy to followbut is loose and dull in many pointsthings stretch on without anything happening at times and bores at times overallaverage one for me
Jul 23 2012,positive,its was a good movie marvel keep true to the comic and the earths mighest heros formed the team that stopped loki and the evil planes he had for earth everyone was great the hulk could have been just alittle better but his little fight with loki now that was the funniest thing in the movie cant wait from the second avengers to come out in a couple of years after iron man 3 captain america 2 and thor 2 cant wait summer next years heating up already avengers assemble
Jul 22 2012,positive,enjoyed the movie ive been waiting to see all of them together  good comedy spots in there over all good  i wanna see it agaaaaaaain cool
Jul 22 2012,positive,sickest movie ever tons of action
Jul 22 2012,positive,this years best movie with a 96 audience like it easily beating out spiderman and batman
Jul 22 2012,positive,pretty much the best movie ever
Jul 22 2012,positive,this is how you do a superhero action movie
Jul 22 2012,positive,it was pretty good but im not that into super heros
Jul 22 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movie ever
Jul 22 2012,positive,i wish joss whedon would learn how to write female characters otherwise fun movie
Jul 22 2012,positive,loved the humor whedon should assist in all the marvel movies from now on
Jul 22 2012,positive,i thought that this movie could be bad with so many heroes all having the same amount of time in the movie with the exception of iron man having the spotlight for a little bit more but who would complain with robert downey jr this movie worked so well together and the action scenes were suburb
Jul 22 2012,negative,the visuals in the avengers are impressive but when ever i go to the cinema i look for more than cgi and cgi was mostly what the avengers was to me i dont see what all the fuss is behind this movie the story is weak as is the case with all of marvels latest films theres trouble then comes the hero and finally the eye candy there was no meaning and no emotion the dialogue was cheesy unfunny and just plain bad in the end its just another mindless money making machine from marvel this is probably the most overhyped and irritating movie i have ever had the displeasure of seeing 25
Jul 22 2012,positive,great movie all around the producers pulled the plot lines of all of the movies together almost perfectly
Jul 22 2012,positive,this and tdrk have been the best movies of the year
Jul 22 2012,positive,avengers lagged little in drama but it compensated all in action sequences in moviethough it  lives up its expectation and fulfill fans
Jul 22 2012,positive,smashing just smashing british accent
Jul 22 2012,positive,cant wait for number 2

Jul 22 2012,positive,marvelous 3 this is perfect great movie nice fights and special effect and the greatest thing was the actors theyre the same of the individuals movie adventures
Jul 22 2012,positive,absolutely amazing did not think a movie with so many characters and elite actors would be decent  boy was i wrong  avengers is definitely in my top ten
Jul 22 2012,positive,although i saw marvels avengers earlier this year i waited until the dark knight rises to debut in theaters before rating the avengers now for the moment of truth after seeing what the dark knight had to deliver i still have to give over all power and impact to the avengers all the years of waiting this movie to take the world by storm have paid off the key to the whole movie believe it our notthis is the first movie to get the hulk right yes big green sole the show in all the right places in fact everyone stole the show somehow this movie managed to incorporate every character in this movie without overshadowing anyoneim totally sold on this being the biggest summer movie in decades
Jul 22 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever i loved it
Jul 22 2012,positive,exceeded expectations in ever way imaginable some of the best lines ive heard in a movie in a very long time
Jul 22 2012,positive,not as good as everyone said it was
Jul 22 2012,positive,so you go in thinking oh okay i liked iron man i liked captain america thor was okay good thing that old hulk is gone then you start this movie it is bloody brilliant the movie keeps you on the edge of your seats while also keeping you amazed with beautiful eye candy splendor and smart comedic swipes at your face the movie follows a cliche plot with very cliche characters but the chemistry and interactions pays off it is so much fun to watch and enjoy it also makes reference to classic comic books and tv shows and old movies it is entertainment and good enterta
Jul 22 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Jul 22 2012,positive,this movie was sweet
Jul 22 2012,positive,best fun ive had watching a movie in a looooong time

Jul 22 2012,positive,this was the best action movie i ever saw i saw it in 3d two times
Jul 22 2012,positive,im not into comic books at all i didnt even know who most of these characters were but this movie is entertaining  i thought robert downey jr was really good and i like capt america too  i thought they could cast better for the hulk but its a good movie
Jul 22 2012,positive,the movie was top notch start to finish kudos to joss whedon  the story was thrilling the perfromances were excellent and the characters were perfectly placed inside a movie that was bigger than any one of them the digital hulk sets the bar for all future digitized characters hulk is the first real digital character in movies  if you dont want to have fun dont go to this movie because fun cant be helped superhero movies have juts been given new life
Jul 22 2012,negative,not very good expected so much more

Jul 22 2012,positive,good popcorn flick but i was ultimately not invested in any of the characters or the overall story
Jul 22 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ive seen
Jul 22 2012,positive,the grandeur of hollywood is rather flamboyant this time with the hexa hilarious superhero team  iron man captain america the black widow hawkeye and the hulk  apocalypse now for the earth and here they come together after much realization though bang   iron man robert downy insane incorrigible and incredible his cheesy one liners swashbuckle with the screenplay to pour out a hefty humor doze   the black widow scarlett johansson alluring and scintillating as ever scarletts mind games are freaky and her stunts sublime  captain america chris evans is gallant and lucid with his shield shining brighter  hawkeye jeremy renner hails adroitly with his bow and arrows  thor chris hemsworth torn at the altar of relationships breaks out with a bang thor is terrific   hulk tom hiddleston is colossal magnanimous and sheer protagonist when it comes to adrenaline gushing action stands out majestically   the avengers is an adrenaline booster  larger than life special effects cheesy rib tickling oneliners and august action is only gonna leave you applauding for long  dont miss it 
Jul 22 2012,positive,theres a lot of great things about this film but i think that the thing that stands out the most is how well everything came together you have four main leads a hell of a supporting cast and a lot of stuff that has been building up from the previous marvel solo projects there was alot of room for it to go wrong here it was not easy to balance everything but not only does the avengers deliver it soars to levels that i dont think anyone expected while in terms of superhero films i gotta put tdkr on top but this film is still head and heels above the rest of the competition
Jul 22 2012,positive,a movie which you want to make the heroes to stop talking and just fight
Jul 21 2012,positive,a popcorn flick that does everything right i loved every minute of it even the michael bayesque battle at the end
Jul 21 2012,positive,want to feel like a kid again then you have to see this movie once it gets rolling it doesnt stop
Jul 21 2012,positive,comic book movie done right
Jul 21 2012,positive,good action scenes and love the story but would of liked a little more from it
Jul 21 2012,positive,for me this movie had everything love humor amazing fight scenes heroes galore and the hulk being awesome  this is a movie i will have to buy  i cannot wait for the next one to come out  a must see film
Jul 21 2012,positive,action packed super epic iron man thor captain america black widow hawkeye and my personal favorite the incredible hulk all brilliantly brought together by nick fury in this adrenaline pumping humor filled film
Jul 21 2012,positive,best movie ever cant wait for part 2
Jul 21 2012,positive,besides the cheesy dialogue poor character arcs lack of storyline and the plethora of one liners that fall flat strong performances by ruffalo and hiddleston and for the most part spectacular special effects make the avengers a worthwhile summer blockbuster
Jul 21 2012,neutral,superficial and shallow its fun but there is nothing to take away with you other than a good time that is if seeing muscly men do cliche things and make swarmy remarks for 2 hours is a good time for you  i was very underwhelmed
Jul 21 2012,positive,great action packed thrill movie but it tries to force comedy and be too funny during parts that ruin the adrenaline rush viewers feel while watching
Jul 21 2012,positive,amazing i would watch it again
Jul 21 2012,positive,a fan boys wet dream these avengers perfectly cast and in no need of introduction bring the comic book to life  though fairly lighthearted the film has its serious moments  the most fun youll have in a movie for a long time
Jul 21 2012,negative,it was not as good as i thought it would be it seemed extreamly long and the last 45 minutes wouldnt go by the story seemed like they ripped of transformers 3 and it was way to over hyped it was good action but nothing else
Jul 21 2012,positive,great movie to bring some of the best comic book heroes together great fun summer movie
Jul 21 2012,positive,hands down marvels best movie the movie has lots of jokes to break the tension the vilians were disappointing especially loki there are lots of flawsbut overall it was a good movie

Jul 21 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever
Jul 21 2012,positive,the ultimate super hero movie
Jul 21 2012,positive,good job getting all these characters onto one screen should be cool to see where this franchise goes from here
Jul 21 2012,positive,its a tall order to bring in multiple superheroes from the same universe with their own vast backstories and have them in one film together for the first time without cutting some of the characters short unfortunately marvels the avengers doesnt fully accomplish this the script is lacking at times largely due to the forced humor from the ensemble cast as well as having numerous action sequences just for the sake of having them with no real anchor to the overall story not to mention the overload of cgi implemented giving the film a fake and tacky look ultimately marvel fanboys will no doubt be impressed possibly being unable to see behind the facade of what really is a giant merchandising vehicle see you in the endless line of sequels avengers
Jul 21 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever saw
Jul 21 2012,positive,holy poop on a stick i loved this movie
Jul 21 2012,negative,while the audience around me in the sold out theater laughed at what they thought to be hilarious dialogue and amazing special effects i literally laughed at the fact that i was watching nothing more than an overhyped poorly created cartoon
Jul 21 2012,positive,i keep changing the number of stars cause im still confused about this movie am i the only one who really though that this movie was really overrated
Jul 21 2012,positive,fun movie nothing more
Jul 21 2012,positive,the hulk stole the show
Jul 21 2012,positive,i couldnt take it seriously enough for five stars it wasnt personal enough
Jul 21 2012,positive,too awsome to write about seen it 4 times now
Jul 21 2012,positive,the best super hero move of them all
Jul 21 2012,positive,really enjoyed the movie worried how they would tie the characters and share the spotlight but they pulled it off well action was really good and comedy was funny cant wait for another
Jul 21 2012,positive,the avengerswow this film is action packed with moments leaving you thinking you wish you could do that mark ruffalo and chris evans portray there roles brilliantly as well as robert downey jr who provides us with laughs thor was my favourite movie before the avengers but i dont think he got enough screen time in this which was a disappointment but overall i love this film and it lives up too its hype thank you joss whedon star of the show mark ruffalo
Jul 21 2012,positive,my all time fav for multi heros
Jul 21 2012,positive,amazing totally awesome
Jul 21 2012,positive,for a movie that had a 5 movie build up  it had such a big chance of being a major disapointment good thing for us a great director was signed and it could very possibly the best super herocomic movie out there great story great action great characters finally the hulk was done right
Jul 21 2012,positive,moves well  fun effects
Jul 21 2012,positive,fantastic best marvel movie to date
Jul 21 2012,positive,great movie want to see it again  again

Jul 21 2012,positive,favorite marvel hero movie  comic book
Jul 21 2012,positive,best movie of 2012 hands down  how josh whedon was able to make this work is simply astonishing  too much fun
Jul 21 2012,positive,looking forward to the next movie
Jul 21 2012,positive,great great great marvel does it again
Jul 21 2012,positive,i did really like this film a lot however it could have been a different villain one we havent seen before but still it was great all in all
Jul 21 2012,positive,best action acting ever
Jul 21 2012,positive,a late review so i know everyone knows this movie is the best of its kind and of the year
Jul 21 2012,positive,pure art true believers nuff said
Jul 21 2012,positive,excellent movie action from beginning to the end
Jul 21 2012,positive,okay we watched a bunch of comedian not a superheroes with some joke that make it became a popcorn movie that i can forgot easily but i love the action and cgi so eyecatching
Jul 21 2012,neutral,probably the most overvalued film in years only hulks moments can save it
Jul 21 2012,positive,i love the ironman and hulk character and even though its true to the comic thor black widow hawkeye really often nothing to the team  lokie is a sad villian that seem to have needed an upgrade from the pages
Jul 21 2012,positive,entertaining from beginning to end plenty of laughs especially from the hulk my favourite and all the inside jokes and banter between the characters was awesome joss whedon youve done it again bring on the sequel
Jul 21 2012,positive,this movie is awesome d
Jul 21 2012,positive,ok best ever cant wait for more more more marvel now the only complaint was they didnt have edward norton as the hulk dont get me wrong mark did a good job but edward should of been the part
Jul 21 2012,positive,man how did i not post a review about the best superhero film of all time   i love spiderman as a superhero character  but i have to admit that marvel did a outstanding job representing the avengers  the movie felt so real  it was like the superheros were directly taken out of the comics  there souls were injected into human bodies   ironman and hulk for me stole the show  i was lucky enough to watch the movie with a awesome audience  people were laughing at the jokes  wooing on every awesome moment that too in pure sync  i was fortunate for such a audience because i didnt miss any awesome dialog  the story too had a comic like feel to it  the plot was yeah something that you would expect from the awesome marvel line   this movie was a superhero movie that felt like a superhero movie  not some glorified real world take on superheros  seriously why would you want awesome fantasy creatures like superheros  tame them down of their unearthly potential   avengers by far  by infinite distance far is the best super hero movie  it blew away my mind  gave me hope live action adaptation of superheros is in safe hands  marvel  sony please do join forces  it will be awesome to watch the spidey  avengers combo in live action  1010  if i was a fanboy then oooo ooinfinity
Jul 21 2012,positive,great entertaining movie with wit charm action and good old fashioned butt whooping  must see in theaters
Jul 21 2012,negative,the avengers is the worst super hero movie ever  with no satisfying story line  ending or acting truly on of the worst movies in history
Jul 20 2012,positive,best time ive had at the movies in a long time
Jul 20 2012,positive,this was the bomb lol worth seeing
Jul 20 2012,positive,i like how they plan well for every heroes there is they didnt make you feel left out for each of them too much unnecessarily jokes the scenes sometime fast paced not much of a story telling most of the plots are predictable but satisfying blockbuster movie
Jul 20 2012,positive,freaking awesome great kickoff to the summer
Jul 20 2012,positive,apart from some minor dislikes i thought the movie was totally fun and could have watched several hours more
Jul 20 2012,positive,excellent comic book fun
Jul 20 2012,positive,i loved it even without having seen cpt america  thor before i went in cant wait to see it again
Jul 20 2012,positive,absolutely loved
Jul 20 2012,positive,    when i first saw trailers for this movie i thought it looked like it would be nothing more than a chaotic cluttered mess of cgi explosions first impressions arent always right    superhero movies are a tired genre nearly every one follows the same story structure brief and uninspired back story discovery of superpowers or abilities unnecessary romantic entanglement convenient introduction of a villain at the same time as the creation of the hero etc look up just about any superhero movie especially from the marvel cannon and that is what youll get but where other superhero movies spend most of their time with these generic setups the avengers both doesnt want or have the need of these rules all of these characters have been introduced in their own films so what we have here is the culmination of a series of generally lackluster movies including captain america the first avenger the incredible hulk thor and iron man 1  2 and the result is better than i could have possibly hoped for    written and directed by joss whedon who also cowrote the cabin in the woods another of this years best films so far whedon manages to blend humor into the action to great effect this is probably the funniest conventional superhero movie ive ever seen despite the incredible action sequences and topoftheline special effects to me it was the comedic elements that won me over instead of taking itself too seriously all the time this movie knew when it could be funny and when it needed to be serious without making radical tonal shifts    this movie succeeds on so many levels along with perfectly blending action suspense comedy and drama whedon also manages to give every central character adequate screen time all the while understanding that several of these characters have definite limitations in how functional they could conceivably be  lets be serious here hawkeye black widow and captain america are in no way going to be as useful at the world as iron man thor and hulk and thanks yet again to whedons excellent writing plot convenience rarely enters into the script this is the case especially with hawkeye who for the entire duration of the movie i was fearing the script would find some convenient use for his incredible marksmanship eg a faroff pinsized target which needed to be hit with great precision during a brief window of time instead of leaving the movie thinking well wasnt that convenient you might leave the movie saying that was awesome    another major difference that set this movie apart was the casting of mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk not having seen the incredible hulk with edward norton i cannot attest to his performance but i can say that found ruffalo to be a vast improvement over eric bana from the 2003 ang lee incarnation of course robert downey jrs tony stark dominates the cast reminding us once again why the iron man movies are the best of the prequel series starks brash confidence and sense of humor allows for excellent chemistry with the entire cast serving as the cornerstone of the movie tom hiddlestons performance is also a standout yet again turning in a great villainous performance as loki    with the possible exception of the dark knight i would be inclined to say this is the best superhero movie ive ever seen but where nolan went with a dark moody tone with his film whedon went with a brighter more exciting approach making the avengers less brooding but more entertaining it may stand as being one of the best movies of the year come december theres no way of knowing that at this point but one thing is for sure  its the most entertaining so far
Jul 20 2012,positive,so good i cried and probably failed my math test the next morning
Jul 20 2012,negative,i didnt like this film and i think a lot of people are giving it good ratings simply because of the fan base much like twilight the dialouge acting and the story line where very poor it was a waste of time
Jul 20 2012,positive,probably the avengers one of the best adaptations of the marvel comics but his script  has one objective show explosions on the screen and never force the audience use their brains
Jul 20 2012,positive,the scenes with the hulk doing what hulk does makes it work the while  highly entertaining and nonstop action
Jul 20 2012,positive,the perfect comic book movie this is a real game changer from now on everyone will have to step their game up the scale is epic action relentless and writing sharp this movie was made for the fans everyone handles their arts surprisingly well and the hulk steals the show loki was was great as the baddie
Jul 20 2012,positive,one blockbuster which delivers simple working chemistry and well hulk smash nuf said 
Jul 20 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies of all time   the over the top action and good humor mix  well with the origin of the most powerful super hero team ever assembled and it has heart to boot
Jul 20 2012,positive,awesome puny god greatness
Jul 20 2012,positive,never underestimate the entertainment value of the hulk smash
Jul 20 2012,negative,not very creative standard plot cool special effects in some parts but overall unimaginative
Jul 20 2012,positive,the best movie of the year hands down great cast of actors mark ruffalo steals the show as hulk and robert downey is at his best while playing the billionaire playboy genius entrepreneur stunning graphics incredible action and jokes that keep you laughing
Jul 20 2012,positive,a highly enjoyable film that infused action with clever comedy more of a family film but a very good movie
Jul 20 2012,positive,amazing epic funny and whitty a must see this summer
Jul 20 2012,positive,amazing great storyline and detail to the characters
Jul 20 2012,positive,i didnt know what to expect from this blockbuster i just knew that i was excited i find when im excited to see something the movie is never as good as i imagined so maybe it was just me when i say they could have done more it was interesting and the action was really cool but it just wasnt enough for me still fresh however
Jul 20 2012,positive,loved itstuck to the story line very well
Jul 20 2012,positive,it was good but i dont think it deserves a 92 on rt
Jul 20 2012,positive,lively fun and imaginative the avengers is a great close to phase one of the marvel cinematic universe
Jul 20 2012,positive,one for the bluray list an amazing film and the series is shaping up nicely
Jul 20 2012,positive,as of right now the avengers is the best marvel film to date
Jul 20 2012,positive,one of the best popcorn movies every made
Jul 20 2012,positive,a great film for one coming out of the marvel universe but there is only a fine line that separates it from from being a loud summer popcorn flick and quality entertainment
Jul 20 2012,positive,a fantastic conclusion to the marvel comics series all the characters are well drawn and played by various very good actors having never seen a good portrayal of the hulk i was delighted with his portrayal on this film
Jul 20 2012,positive,it was soooo awesome and funny
Jul 20 2012,positive,like amazing spiderman this is one of my personal favorites accept i new this was going to be good
Jul 20 2012,positive,this is the new big summer movie measuring stick
Jul 20 2012,positive,could gave cut about twenty minutes of explosions and still been just as good thor and iron man steal the show
Jul 20 2012,positive,very good movie lots of action
Jul 20 2012,positive,with out a doubt the best super hero movie i have ever seen
Jul 20 2012,positive,go to see this for what it is  a fun superhero movie its just that  fun lots of fun dont expect any of the character development or dark gritty realism found in nolans batman trilogy but you will absolutely find a lot of action humor and great effects a surprisingly fun first lets face it there will be more coming together of the marvel supers
Jul 20 2012,positive,a fun movie to watch though the characters get a little bit lost but still very funny scenes
Jul 20 2012,positive,hulk smash that toothy green smile made my day
Jul 20 2012,positive,great movie  good job at incorporating all the heroes  a little more action would be cool
Jul 20 2012,positive,best comic book movie since the dark knight its not that the film is a masterpiece  it very clearly isnt  its that it has the best working knowledge of what a comic book character is and why we love watching them everyone is at their best in this huge feat to make a movie like this work so well
Jul 20 2012,positive,good movie the ending was just way to convient for the heros to me go see the dark knight rises better movie overall
Jul 20 2012,positive,when all these super heroes reunite it creates a great action movie with great action scenes but this movie fails to deliver any heart or soul to the characters and the first half of this 2 and a half hour movie is useless towards the plot overall a typical superhero movie
Jul 20 2012,positive,marvels best team up for all the scifi geeks this was a great treat
Jul 20 2012,positive,one of the best all time movies
Jul 20 2012,negative,long boring cheesy lame did i say long
Jul 20 2012,positive,pretty much the perfect comic book adaptation ever made with all sorts of its own contributions to the genre  it manages to be even greater than the sum of its rootsparts
Jul 20 2012,positive,seen this opening weekend i absolutely loved it it did not disappoint if you are a marvel fan or have loved any of the movies previous iron man thor cap america hulk etc you will love this movie
Jul 20 2012,positive,best action movie in a long time
Jul 20 2012,positive,not a wasted moment   often a film can get bogged down with pointless moments  not so with this film
Jul 20 2012,positive,joss whedon hit the nail on the head with this i dont think you could have chosen a more perfect director each character has equal screen time and it really gives you the chance to enjoy the film without feeling rushed from all the competing story lines
Jul 20 2012,negative,an incoherent mess  a parade of required characters put in obligatory appearences without any realistic dialogue or motivation  does not stand up as a movie on its own merits only for rabid fans of the marvel menagerie  interesting only as an illustration of how bad a movie can be  was wheadon even there  this seems assembled by a committee inserting comic book characters by the numbers as required for marketing purposes
Jul 20 2012,positive,good fun summer blockbuster lots of action once the story picks up nearly 45 minutes into the movie after the opening sequence just dont expect this movie to get you deeply involved with the characters or story like our beloved batman does it does what it is meant to do and that is entertain you for nearly 2 12 hours
Jul 20 2012,positive,fun exciting casting was great the comic book world came alive robert downy jr radiated superhero in the most vain arrogant love able way possible while family loved this movie 
Jul 20 2012,positive,loved it the characters were portrayed awesomely and the plot was great
Jul 20 2012,positive,this movie was so good never left my seat plus the actors werent bad to look at either 
Jul 20 2012,positive,with out a doubt the best superhero movie made to date
Jul 20 2012,negative,2008s the dark knight is my second favorite film of all time
Jul 20 2012,positive,love love love absolutely great action movie cant wait for a sequil
Jul 20 2012,positive,greatest film iv ever watched
Jul 20 2012,negative,just fanservice no story and poor oneliners
Jul 20 2012,positive,best action movie this summer ready for the next and the way it went off excellent  
Jul 20 2012,positive,greatest superhero film ever  nuff said
Jul 20 2012,positive,best comic movie sooo farr
Jul 20 2012,positive,im absolutely dying to give it a 5 because its just so damn good i just have slight beef with the sequences involved in lokis coming to power but god damn the script is amazing the action is great and the characters chemistry is phenomenal
Jul 19 2012,positive,great comic book movie not as good as batman returns imo
Jul 19 2012,positive,what and awesome movie for the super hero fans just spectacular
Jul 19 2012,positive,just about as close to a perfect summer movie as ive seen well executed fluff with lots of great oneliners menacing glares and special effects not deep in the least  just fun
Jul 19 2012,positive,a super soldier a god from other planet a huge green monster a genius billionaire a femme fatal a super marksman in this movie these different charanters gets teamed up only to face loki and his army its quite surprising and somewhat dissapointing that this movie didnt have a super villain however we still get to see tony stark and his new stark building and many other blow your mind action scenes i must say that robert downey jr and mark ruffallo performance is the best thing in this movie like a live wire im not a marvel fan im not a josh whedon fan but robert downey is one of my favorite actor therefore i give this movie 5 stars and i enjoyed watching it in 3d cinema and i will buy the bluray
Jul 19 2012,positive,i seen this movie 5 times in the theatres
Jul 19 2012,positive,good story great action great visuals excellent fun popcorn summer movie
Jul 19 2012,negative,honestly it just couldnt capture my attention i wasnt draw in the action sequences lagged and the saving graces were the quips from tony stark
Jul 19 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for the next
Jul 19 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Jul 19 2012,positive,one of the no the best superhero movie i have ever seen
Jul 19 2012,positive,good movie good action slow starting plot climax dragged on too long but once again robert downey jr stole the show as the comic relief entertaining go see it
Jul 19 2012,positive,best movie ever in my opinion
Jul 19 2012,negative,joss whedon safe control over the movie can not save the movie  that has no story
Jul 19 2012,positive,wow  i did not see this one coming  i have liked but not loved pretty much all the previous movies in the marvel universe thor being my favorite so i did not anticipate loving this one as much as i did  i should have known it was going to be great because joss whedon is a genius  i just did not expect all the amazing action sequences  the character banter is great here too  as most everyone has stated hulk completely steals the show and has a ton of great scenes  overall a great movie and probably my 2nd favorite superhero movie behind dark knight which is hard to even call a superhero movie
Jul 19 2012,positive,100 nothing to comment on other than see this movie and stay for the credits thanos perfect director who knows how to handle 7 larger than life heroes and make them coincide as a team the avengers to be specific saw this on its premiere and 4 times after and it never missed a beat keep them going marvel
Jul 19 2012,positive,tons of action excitement and a good bit of comedy thrown in a really great movie
Jul 19 2012,positive,one of the coolest movies and ideas for a movie i think i have ever seen
Jul 19 2012,positive,very well done and entertaining a collage of marvel superheroes that will leave you satisfied while i normally dont like superheroes i prefer the avengers because i actually enjoyed it
Jul 19 2012,positive,just what you expect  but next to the superstars  some of the characters were vastly out of place
Jul 19 2012,positive,best movie so far this summer saw it 3 times at the movies
Jul 19 2012,positive,an achievement and near perfect marvel universe film worthy of multiple viewings  everyone shines
Jul 19 2012,positive,before you decide to watch this movie please watch all the other marvel movies the hulk iron man captain america and thor thats the only way you can fully appreciate its brilliance best movie of 2012 so far
Jul 19 2012,positive,great movie very interesting and funny
Jul 19 2012,positive,great film with an awesome cast and story
Jul 19 2012,positive,avengers was a great movie and it had a lot of great lead characters playing the roles it is cool how they got them to look just like they did in the comic books cant wait for the 2nd one to come out
Jul 19 2012,positive,it was an amazing experience totally worth the wait
Jul 19 2012,positive,osm way better than i thought it would b
Jul 19 2012,positive,everything you would expect from a superhero movie  lighthearted action packed and a great theater experience
Jul 19 2012,positive,not entirely flawless but an ambitious superhero epic that lives up to all expectations the first continuity heavy superhero teamup film set within its own cinematic universe a movie that is sure to influence hollywoods superhero future this is the best marvel movie since iron man and spiderman 2
Jul 19 2012,positive,one of the films of the year almost the superhero version of the expendables non stop action and thrills however to basic a storyline halts its potential to be an all time epic however still an amazing film
Jul 19 2012,positive,amazing this was an epic super hero story filled with action and excitement  i can watch this film over and over
Jul 19 2012,neutral,the good a lot of action heroes  the bad everything else   the story line wasnt plotted very well also the evil side was more like the goofy side
Jul 19 2012,positive,hulk smash  the hulk steals the show in arguably the greatest super hero made to date
Jul 19 2012,positive,one of my favourite movies of all time best comic book movie yet

Jul 18 2012,negative,it was meh am i the only person who didnt like it
Jul 18 2012,positive,i thought this movie was great
Jul 18 2012,positive,whedon and crew have accomplished the impossible but the stakes could have been higher the answer to this the avengers phase two beginning 2013 the avengers is a completely entertaining film from beginning to end by bringing together the earths mightiest heroes and saving the world all this while still quenching any action fans appetite honoring the characters and making some good jokes
Jul 18 2012,positive,little too silly at times not a memorable scene for me still awesome though
Jul 18 2012,positive,amazing film maybe the best of 2012 whedon has yet another hit on his hands

Jul 18 2012,positive,this movie is awesome
Jul 18 2012,positive,a masterpiece in many ways the dialogue is well written the action sequences are very entertaining the comedy that they include as a bonus while not classy is definitely better than most of the content you find in many comedy movies
Jul 18 2012,positive,a very great action movie and still maintaining a good plot every character is well thought out i recommend seeing it kept me on the edge of my seat for more
Jul 18 2012,positive,unexpectingley exciting even though an action movie still has a great plot great character development and i belive it followers the old marvel comics which makes everyone happy including me
Jul 18 2012,positive,a good superhero action movie with a lot of spectacle but not the excellent movie thay everyone is talking about it has great character development but the story lacks sense of danger in particular by its weak villain loki
Jul 18 2012,positive,great bit of fun and a br buy for me
Jul 18 2012,positive,joss how did you do this movie justice when buffy was a total mistake
Jul 18 2012,positive,thatll do joss thatll do

Jul 18 2012,negative,mediocre moviesome good action scenes but not a strong and consistent storylinegood for kids

Jul 18 2012,negative,this is one of the worst movies ever made  it is a ode to where the movie industry is headed

Jul 18 2012,positive,this is in my opinion as a comics aficionado the best movie ever made there is comic book action on a scale never seen before so many characters so beautifully balanced great visuals good score sure the plot was a bit lacking but with all the characters and their dynamics together there was no room for more plot a great movie my favorite  great performances  you will believe in heroes
Jul 18 2012,positive,my favorite movie based on marvel comics cant wait to see what happens on the next one
Jul 18 2012,positive,joss whedon is a genius
Jul 18 2012,positive,okay  maybe it would have helped if i had seen all of the prior movies  i did see iron man  it just didnt hold my attention  even in the action scenes it wasnt edge of my seat action  which is what i like in an action movie

Jul 18 2012,positive,one of the best films ever such great action  the control of all the characters was perfect overall a film that can be rewatched anytime
Jul 18 2012,positive,i honestly think that people are really overhyping this movie i mean yes the special effects are good and there are some really good comedic moments in the film i liked the performances by robert downey jr and mark ruffalo however its way too long almost being two and a half hours i have seen the movie twice but i only saw it because the people i was with wanted to see it again if it had been my choice i would have seen something elsemy rating 25 stars out of 4
Jul 18 2012,positive,i have always been a fan of marvel and dc comicsi sawthe avengerstwice in theatres and this movie was better than i thoughtthe actionspecial effectsplotand the cast did a great jobthis is the best marvel movie ever madethis is my 2 favorite superhero movieso farthis is also a perfect movie to put in your collectionwhen it comes out on dvd
Jul 18 2012,positive,without iorn man and hulk this movie would not have been half as good comic book fans should be pleased and the general audience will enjoy the big budget special effects
Jul 18 2012,positive,in my opinion so far the greatest superhero movie ever made and if you dont at least like this movie seek medical attention immediately
Jul 18 2012,positive,joss whedon is simply a god and everything he touches turns to gold
Jul 18 2012,positive,packed with action good acting and comedy throughout this film presents all that is expected from a great superhero movie
Jul 18 2012,positive,fun great character development considering the frantic pace of the film rdj is excellent as always but does not overshadow the other actors each character gets their own individual moments to shine

Jul 18 2012,positive,fantastic movie that wears it genre on its sleeve and is proud of it laugh out loud funny too thank you joss whedon
Jul 18 2012,positive,awesome movie love the ending scene how they really blow up the cars using explosive  nice scene when all the heros start to quarrel as the camera shots and editing did a good job on it overall i believe it is a must to watch but the only i dont really get it was the hulk in this storyline well just watch it and you will get what i meant
Jul 18 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is without question one of the most enjoyable comicbook themed films in years while it doesnt match the character depth tension and thematic gravitas of the dark knight it excels as a pure crowdpleaser  after some lackluster outings for captain america the hulk and some admirable attempts with iron man and thor marvel has finally found the right note again since marvels xmen 2  spiderman 2 i got the sense that later marvel movies were being graded on a curve simply based on brandname alone as successful as iron man thor and captain america were they were forgettable films the avengers however takes what could easily have become hokey subject matter and turned it into an actionpacked ensemble that manages to give adequate screen time to all the major players  the plot is is simple thors brother loki attempts to rule the universe its your typical megalomaniac story line and of course earths greatest heroes are assemble to fight back its about a simple as thattheres no reason to pretend theres anymore depth than that but thats not a bad thing in this film because the simplicity of the plot allows its heroes to shine  the avengers assumes youve seen some of the previous films and moves right into battle perhaps the most cinematically destroyed character on filmthe incredible hulkfittingly becomes the most beloved by the time this movie is over the rest of the cast is splendid as well robert downey jr shines as tony stark and chris evans second outing as captain america is appreciated over his solo effort  despite the heavy dose of special effects the director manages to find the right mix of action humor and character development to keep this from being another special effects dependent film we see every summer  at its heart the avengers is about heroism the kind of heroism we imagined as kids from our superheroes while the avengers wont win any oscars outside of the special effects category it has earned a much higher honor by moviegoers as it is guaranteed to be a remembered as one of the best comic book movies of all time
Jul 18 2012,positive,great movie cant wait for the next one
Jul 18 2012,positive,pact with fun and many memorable moments great quotes great characters and everything you want if you have nothing to do in 2 hours take the plot out it barely had one
Jul 17 2012,positive,the story is simplistic for a movie like this its predictable at times and its treated like the citizen kane of superhero movies when it isnt that great but it is a fun movie with enjoyable characters a fun movie a popcorn film theres not much to say about a movie like this because there isnt tht much to it its safe and marketable i do however like how they went into the minds of superheroes and how they feel about certain things
Jul 17 2012,positive,hands down the most complex the most put together and the most fun out of all the marvel films as of late avengers succeeds where most films would have disastrously fallen its a fun summer movie with heart and tons and tons of action with some very funny bits by a scene stealing hulk walk in proudly you are about to witness something extraordinary
Jul 17 2012,positive,slow build up but worth the wait as the hulk steals the movie
Jul 17 2012,positive,nonstop action with a step up for the adults that still love the characters they grewup reading and idolizing a complete sexy cast that had your heart pumping and your rear at the edge of your seat
Jul 17 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Jul 17 2012,positive,love it could watch it over an over again all my childhood favs all in one
Jul 17 2012,positive,i dont know how joss pulled off a group superhero movie but he did it  man did he do it
Jul 17 2012,positive,you have to see all the movies to understand it
Jul 17 2012,positive,loved it great storyline of course great action great comedic parts and great ending cant wait to see sequels 
Jul 17 2012,positive,i saw this movie already and it was perfect and good
Jul 17 2012,positive,personally i liked it a lot but something strange happened in that theater that ive never seen before i looked around the auditorium to see what looked like 200 people all rejoicing in enjoyment of the film they were cheering laughing and smiling wide like jolly totoros for any other movie this would be the nightmare audience but with the avengers i began enjoying the movie more as i saw how much happiness and escapism it was providing to everyone there   this isnt a cashgrabbing blockbuster drenched in stupidity but a genuinely goodintentioned superhero movie that fans had been waiting for joss whedon and all the others involved did their upmost to make the film worth everyones while and from what i saw it succeeded gloriously   walking out i saw children tugging at their parents pant legs about how awesome the hulk was how funny iron man was there was so much quoting and how much they wanted to walk right back in and watch it again i saw the same from adults as regularly dressed people who just got off from work looked at one another with a delighted shock on their faces like they were surprised at how much fun it turned out to be and the comicbook fans had to mask their shame as they rushed to the restrooms to clean themselves off   in short the avengers is the gift that keeps on giving my thoughts and complaints mean nothing compared to the 140 minute actionpacked bliss it spread worldwide
Jul 17 2012,positive,marvel fans unite together for a perfect movie for marvel fans but has one plot the whole movie defeat the villain very good but not the best i think the dark knight rises will be better
Jul 17 2012,positive,the avengers is nothing more than a great action movie the film is original with the whole team of superheros thing but in other terms i feel it can be as generic as any other of the solo superhero movies to start off aside from the team of superheros thing the plot is that loki is bringing aliens from another planet to conquer earth and the avengers have to stop them the whole thing is cliche and pretty predictable i also thought that the reason why the heroes decided to band together was pretty stupid they all hate each other until a character who is pretty much good for nothing but cracking jokes dies that was pretty weak aside from a stale plot we have some of the best cgi work in recent time the effects look amazing and best in imax there are sometimes i felt the cgi looked too much like a video game but its nothing to really gripe about now once your down to about to the last 40 minutes of the movie thats when everything starts to get very very good the action was awesome each character played a big part and the hulk kicked ass and stole the show marvels the avengers is one of the best action movies around but in terms of the best superhero movie i still think that belongs to the dark knight marvels the avengers is a good time that everybody can sit back and enjoy marvels best movie sure the best superhero movie ever nah a good action flick you bet cha 355
Jul 17 2012,positive,this movie was awesome
Jul 17 2012,positive,only negative is they werent consistent with the hulk
Jul 17 2012,positive,in 2005 marvel studios began paving the way for hollywood to dazzle the worlds movie going public for what they anticipated to be the apex of big block buster cinema since 2008 they have worked diligently to transform iconic comic book super heroes into live action archetypes these past four years have brought us 5 major motion pictures building characters and storylines with the hopes that on may 4th all their hard work would pay off    the avengers starring robert downey jr samuel l jackson scarlett johansson chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo jeremy renner clark gregg stellan skarsgård and tom hiddleston and written and directed by joss whedon has made over 700 million just in its opening weekend making it the highest grossing film to date i along with 96 of the worlds movie theater patrons agree its time for marvel studios to finally stand up and take a bow    if youve followed the previous films which include iron man 1  2 the incredible hulk captain american and thor then youll have no problem jumping right into the avengers as whedon meticulously wrote this screenplay perfectly as the latest installment not only has he united all 5 stories together in a brilliantly coherent fashion but hes also created something wholly new and fantastically marvelous in the process to be able to direct such a large cast is no easy task either but whedon had little issues comparing himself to jacksons character nick furry stating that he didnt have as many problems because my actors actually wanted to be together they enjoy each other    there was some concern before the film was released that having so many big name actors in a single film and with equally essential roles would clash on screen however it turns out that everyone no matter the size of their characters physical appearance or egos got just as much attention and face time the film itself is about team work and thats exactly what we see here    for those of you who havent jumped on the comic book genre bandwagon yet or simply arent a fan of them  but secretly always wanted to be the avengers would be a great introduction to them the 143 minutes of quick witted humor action packed scifi fight sequences and spectacular acting and direction is pure cinematic gold that is sure to satisfy even the most skeptical of movie goers
Jul 17 2012,positive,so much could have gone wrong so much was done right
Jul 17 2012,positive,effin loved it action from beginning to end
Jul 17 2012,positive,really amazing effects perhaps it can have take more advantages to 3d effects in some scenes a must see movie

Jul 17 2012,positive,i absolutely loved the avengers it was definitely action packed and always kept me guessing the entire movie the actors were chosen perfectly to fit the characters
Jul 17 2012,positive,i absolutely loved the avengers it was definitely action packed and always kept me guessing the entire movie the actors were chosen perfectly to fit the characters
Jul 17 2012,positive,good but missing something
Jul 17 2012,negative,overuse of special effects that didnt even look real should have been a comedy with the constant jokes
Jul 17 2012,positive,extremely entertaining with great action but most importantly funny and interesting dialogue to hold your attention throughout the whole film
Jul 17 2012,positive,for me ties the dark knight returns as best superhero movie ever made
Jul 17 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movie
Jul 17 2012,positive,hands down the most exciting superhero film to date however i still prefer the realism and maturity of nolans batman movies the dark knight still holds number one for me however this is in a very very close 2nd place
Jul 17 2012,positive,i wish i would seen this in 3d it prolly would have been that much better
Jul 17 2012,positive,great movie  i was skeptical at first on how theyd coordinate the story with all of the heroes and they did a very good job  loki is one of the best villains ive seen in a while  they added just the right amount of humor  its one of the few dvds ill purchase
Jul 17 2012,positive,joss whedon knows how to direct an ensemble cast  best comic book movie right behind kickass  scott pilgrim
Jul 17 2012,positive,love it  watch it 3 times
Jul 17 2012,positive,the avengers the best superheroe movie of the year epic   im glad that marvel is taking this opportunity and not like  dc comics because they are late with the jla movie
Jul 17 2012,positive,this is the ultimate summer movie it is fun and exciting with great actors playing great parts recommended by me and larry tinklefish
Jul 17 2012,positive,the avenger is an exhilarating funny awesome epic film that takes you on a 140 minute roller coaster that you wont forget a wonderful extravaganza of performances laughs and action sequences that will blow you away
Jul 17 2012,neutral,less then i expected but loved the incredible hulk
Jul 17 2012,positive,great comic moviecant wait to see sequel
Jul 17 2012,positive,this isnt a review just some logic when the avengers does good and gets great reviews according to all the batman fans trolling around the comments its because everyone is just kissing joss whedons ass despite the fact that its an awesome movie but when the dark knight does good they disagree with every single negative review and insist that its art created by a god that the underdeveloped masses couldnt hope to understand followed by a giant swallow of mountain dew and a git er done no wonder you guys love batman so much hes kind of got two distinct personalities unfortunately you guys dont you have whats called double standards hypocrisy or just mental deficiencies take your pick to be so blindly devoted to something like that is admirable makes me want to get my thetan levels tested
Jul 17 2012,positive,love it great humor and enjoyable great visuals and design enough story depth thanks to each characters individual prologue movies this movie does not waste time explaining backgrounds of characters but still provide enough info
Jul 17 2012,positive,no words can explain the epicness
Jul 17 2012,positive,comic book adaptations always have their kinks  quirks but marvel did this one well savetheworld level action with enough humor and drama to keep things interesting fans from the comics might have a deeper experience when presented with certain character interactions but everyone can enjoy this one without needing a comics background
Jul 17 2012,positive,the second great superhero film in my opinion watching the avengers was like a dream come true for a marvelite like me
Jul 17 2012,positive,one word  thor 
Jul 17 2012,positive,one of the best marvel movies
Jul 17 2012,positive,an absolute blast sharp fun loud bright shiny bombastic and enthralling the avengers is thankfully an example of a movie that could have easily been ruined by a number of factors but instead paidoff in absolute spades one of the biggest superhero ensembles ever attempted for a featurelength movie the avengers is what the already great marvel movies of the past 5 years have been leading up to and its a hell of a party very rarely missing an opportunity for action and only slowing down in a few parts for necessary exposition the money is on the screen with the avengers and there are no chances to get bored while a somewhat basic not a particularly puzzling structure for a movie in and of itself and it doesnt need to be the plot really only serves as a solid skeleton that the filmmakers wrote the fireworks around yes it is a bad guy shows up good guys assemble bad guy gets army and good guys and bad guys fight plot but for a comicbook movie that works when its done right and its done right here every actionscene is a sight to behold but the climax in particular will have your eyes popping out of your head and your brain doing cartwheels its a mindblowing finale thats a visual feast the true entertainment value is not only in the action setpieces and the great specialeffects but also in the moments of dialogue shared between characters the avengers never forgets the human strengths and weaknesses of the characters and watching these fun wellwritten individuals interact with oneanother is a spectacle as much as any superpowered fightscene all characters are perfectly cast it is questionable to some baffling why marvel replaced the part of bruce banner with mark ruffalo after establishing wellrespected actor edward norton in relevant marvel movie prior to this but ruffalo plays the part and plays it well marvel made the right decision in selecting a longtime fan of the avengers comics as the writer joss whedon does a better job with the material than anyone i can imagine take note hollywood it pays when the people involved have a passion for what theyre making again the avengers could have easily been a disaster if not handled right and weve seen the c to f grade results mismanagement can get with things like the star wars prequels or the fourth indiana jones movie this may be a crowning achievement for joss whedons already successful career in entertainment and im excited to see what the provencompetent write will bring us in the future the avengers deserves every dollar it receives at the boxoffice clever funny tense dramatic and explosively fun the avengers is one of the best superhero movies ever made the only qualm is how or if marvel will manage to top this
Jul 17 2012,positive,the avengers was a big step in the right direction for comic movies i was very impressed with the avengers and i was never a avengers fan growing up they needed one more powerful villain to balance out the fight overall great movie and im so hyped for avengers 2
Jul 17 2012,positive,a whole lot of superhero fun  hulk vs thor hulklarious  saw it in 4d which was a little distracting though
Jul 17 2012,positive,wow a terrific actioncomic book movie with fleshed out characters stunning visuals and crisp witty dialogue joss you done good
Jul 17 2012,positive,well hell cant believe a team of superheroes finally assembled on the big screen in one of marvels best comic book adaptations of the worlds most loved heroes in the marvel universe            for some reason i still cant get used to 3d it messes with my eyes and the lights feel darkish call me old fashioned but this is the last 3d ill watch ever anywayproper review           wow outstanding explosion double son poweeer this film blocks off the sun a little exited finally getting the chance to see a film of such magnitude on screen absolutely amazing each scene with every super hero of every moment every second of it brilliant and an outstanding performance all the way            the kid in me simply burst out thru the entire film and felt like ive never felt in years like santa is coming the avengers is finally complete over a decade of awesome marvel films the team eventually gets together and puts out a helluva performance one of a kind even a true spectacle in every way possibly imaginable              go watch it now stop reading reviewsits truly an experience enjoy  peace
Jul 17 2012,positive,good stuff couldve done with a lil less captain america and a lil more thor though and a few more gratuitous keester shots of scarlett johansson but still a good flick
Jul 16 2012,positive,good action and a fun ride great oneliners and a few surprises interesting themes about the moral fight we all engage in and the power of coming together for the greater good
Jul 16 2012,positive,great fun and superbly made  it sets the bar high for the genre as it should
Jul 16 2012,positive,saw this movie multiple times love it
Jul 16 2012,positive,worth the trip to the theater 10 fold loved it
Jul 16 2012,positive,good film but doesnt top the dark knight rises
Jul 16 2012,positive,not the best plot ever but nice anyways
Jul 16 2012,positive,amazing movie worth the wait and the build up only made it better
Jul 16 2012,positive,this movie ended perfectly
Jul 16 2012,positive,a great movie for everyone an ensemble of a nicely portrayal comical superheros an apparent and interesting story plot enough to captivate the audience of all ages a few cheesy liners with a touch of a micheal baysortofaction which really didnt    amaze me like everyone else there is nothing in this movie that i havent already seen in transformers as far as the action goesstill a much more sophisticated movie than that awful trilogy jeremy renners portrayal of hawkeye is probably my favorite character besides the hulk he seems the only actor in this movie that does leave me impressed overall a very entertaining movie
Jul 16 2012,positive,amazing movie a must see
Jul 16 2012,positive,robert downey always does his thang what a amazing actor
Jul 16 2012,positive,it was amazing in everyway there was so much action and humor it was great
Jul 16 2012,positive,most fun ive had in a theater in a long time
Jul 16 2012,positive,slightly overrated but still a fantastic superhero movie with great writing and action
Jul 16 2012,positive,superfun comicbook action movie with great performances
Jul 16 2012,positive,awesome movie enough said a must see and must own on blueray
Jul 16 2012,neutral,most people will disagree with me on this but this movie disapointed me in many ways the villian was a poor and lazy choice the oneliners werent funny and the climax of the film came in the last 20 minutes i was waiting and waiting and waiting then finally the last 20 minutes were great but not great enough to carry the rest of the films weight without rdj this movie would be a huge bust with all the other characters being shallow and boring theres just something about xmen x2 spiderman iron man nolans batman movies the original superman they intertwine fantasy and reality this movie fails to do that a hero is someone you look up to someone you strive to be and can relate too i cannot relate to any of these characters seeing as how they are fighting giant worms in 10 years when the special effects are out of date no one will remember the avengers and all of their boxoffice heroics
Jul 16 2012,positive,great movie loved ever second of it
Jul 16 2012,positive,i thought it was nicely executed
Jul 16 2012,positive,great movie but was a little disappointment about who they choose for the  first vilan
Jul 16 2012,positive,marvel ingeniously lines up its heroes from past respective films takes the best pieces of lore and kicks things up a notch energetic witty and actionpacked its marvel at its finest
Jul 16 2012,positive,i really thought this movie was gonna do bad but it was great i loved the fight scenes and the villian was not stupid
Jul 16 2012,positive,while it may in my opinion not be up to snuff with nolans batman series this is definitely the best film we have gotten from the marvel universe great performances from all lead actors and a story that brings just enough heart to the heroes make this one of the most entertaining films i have ever seen
Jul 16 2012,positive,the wait for this was definitely worth it it was just so epic
Jul 16 2012,positive,back in 2008 the movie iron man hit theatres after the ending credits there was a small clip that promised the audience an upcomming avengers movie three years later the first official teaser was attached to the aftercredits of captain america thus begining the excitement and anticipation for movie goers and comic book fanatics alike the movie finally came out on may 4th 2012 the day that made us all think was a fouryearlong wait worth it  iâtmm gonna cut strait to the chase because the answer is yes this movie is indescribably good when i first heard of it comming out i knew it was gonna be a pretty good movie but it gave the audience what it wanted and more the film couldnâtmt have been made better the director did an exceptional job helping the actors and actresses collaborate with eachother and there wasnâtmt a single person who broke character the sound and visual effects were stunning as well with the michael bayish type of cgi animation another thing that i totally liked about this movie was that the plot was realistic in a sense the members of the avengers didnâtmt always get along they had to work out the kinks of switching from working solo to working as a team something else i found interesting was that they didnâtmt just show âthe avengersâ throughout the entire movie the film focused on the separate characters at the beginning of the movie and showed how everything tied together which the director did a phenomenal job doing  bottom line this movie can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone if you donâtmt like this movie then iâtmm sorry i have no clue what could possibly be wrong with you the avengers seriously set the bar for cinematic entertainment this year and will be insanely hard to top
Jul 16 2012,positive,if you like action and suspense this is for you they did a great job bringing together all the different characters to make one epic superhero movie
Jul 16 2012,positive,best movie ever just dont watch it in subtitles like i did by accident lol
Jul 16 2012,positive,greatest movie by marvel so far
Jul 16 2012,positive,finally got to see this and it was too much fun
Jul 16 2012,positive,it was a great film at first but watching it a second time we see that it is less of a superhero movie and more of a comedy film with superheroes in it there is not a minute that goes by that doesnt have comedy sadly the emotional parts faulter due to too many jokes however robert downey jr pulls off a great tony stark yet again and all the cast is in it to win it
Jul 16 2012,positive,take your inner child to see this amazing movie the whole movie i felt with interest not a boring point whatsoever also as usual stay after the credits
Jul 16 2012,positive,i saw this movie in 3d and there is no other way to see it the writers did such an excellent job with the comedy robert downey jr does a great job along with all the others but he stands out he is so funny when hulk throws the villain im not gonna say who the is around like a rag doll was just to funny i would see that movie over and over again my rating beyond five stars
Jul 16 2012,positive,brilliant film with stunning special effects and great action and surprisingly funny at the same time robert downey jr stands out for me the one flaw that stops avengers assemble is the  character thor not chris hemsworth as an actor but the character just annoyed me joss weddons screenplay is outstanding
Jul 16 2012,positive,the avengers is so good because of its strong cast that plays lovable characters like thor cap and iron man but its greatest hero was a very strong writerdirector in joss whedon avengers assemble
Jul 16 2012,positive,dear jared young age 12 future reviewer of the avengers  tell me jared how am i supposed to compose a fair review of a movie that seems  from start to finish in tone and content in the quiet beats between loud explosions and the loud beatings between quiet expositions  plucked directly from your twelve yearold brain and more than that treats your slurpeeinduced reveries with such respect such veneration   i cant contd  
Jul 16 2012,positive,great movie but a tad overrated compared to spider man and some other good comic book movies even so great fun due to good fight scenes and good laughs
Jul 16 2012,positive,100 times better than the marvel crap that came before
Jul 16 2012,positive,exactly the way i think marvel intended it inspiring but not too childlike mature enough for adults without being too dark for the whole family and a dozen or two one liners that really keep you laughing without the movie being a joke they pulled it off brilliantly and everyone in my family decided then and there it was a must have
Jul 16 2012,positive,loveditcom my movie of the year so far
Jul 16 2012,positive,more than likely the most entertaining movie ive seen to date a fantastic mix of great action comedy and of course some wonderful actors robert downey jr steals the show as tony stark tom hiddleston was great as loki though he never really seemed to be a big threat as a villain chris hemsworth plays the mighty thor and has a few great lines as well as great action scenes and mark ruffalo was a far superior bruce banner and hulk than all the previous adaptations throw in johansson for a strong female performance and naturally a bit of eye candy and it makes a brilliant film
Jul 16 2012,positive,loki is a weak villian there are quite a few plot holes but dam what an awesome film joss whedon was a very wise choice heres hoping the 2nd one is even better
Jul 16 2012,positive,definitely worth watching
Jul 16 2012,positive,oh yea this movie kicked ass
Jul 16 2012,positive,i love every part of it 
Jul 16 2012,positive,went with my honey and not seeing prior movies and was impressed by itwould watch again
Jul 16 2012,positive,i am amazed that the women superheroes are only equipped with spandex and a fan blowing their hair  surprises me all the time
Jul 15 2012,positive,new favorite not as much of a breakthrough as the matrix or id4 but nonetheless it was a monumental movie  unfortunately im sure others will try it too but remember this movie is not tbe first movie to enter the combination format of several blockbusters joining into one even though many forget that freddy vs jason and alien vs predator have already done it  so keeping that in mindthe avengers movie wasnt even the first comic adaption movie to do it  i really expected a few things and was releaved to see it didnt happen 1 iron mans ego didnt force the film to over show him robert downey did not push it too much but he is used to caring about the finished product over his film time tropic thunder 2 they kept all of the characters from their own films without any holdouts like the cheadle stamp problem that still pisses me off 3 hulk was actually like the bruce banner i remember from comics and tv  not sure how red hulk will play out but we will visit that later 4 it was quality unlike some of what i call hold up movies that blow their load in the trailer to build it up then rob you when you get to the theatre it was a quality film throughout  unlike just about every adam sandler movie  dont get me wrong its not his fault he makes oneliner moviesthe studios spoil the joke by showing all the punchlines  great moviegreat time money well spent
Jul 15 2012,positive,really awesome movie
Jul 15 2012,positive,awesome movie ready for the 2 movie
Jul 15 2012,positive,exceptional the best of the year
Jul 15 2012,positive,awesome movie one of the best superheroes movies ive seen joss whedon doesnt disappoint bringing to the table good dialogues clichesmashing scenes yeah hulk was smashing one of their best ones good timing and an affordable plot for everybody for anyone who liked this movie i recommend his series no i havent watched buffy though p
Jul 15 2012,positive,this movie was very funny and action packed  and i cant wait til the next one comes out
Jul 15 2012,positive,fav scene hulk secret and puny god
Jul 15 2012,positive,not really impressed
Jul 15 2012,positive,quite possibly the greatest comic book superheros movie ever made it also may have replaced my all time favorite movie which was gladiator simply put the avengers is an epic piece of modern day film making
Jul 15 2012,positive,i saw this on opening nightthere were many losers in the theatre
Jul 15 2012,positive,awesome movie great action scenes
Jul 15 2012,positive,i dont like giving 3 stars  i see it as a bit of a cop out  but the avengers earned it too entertaining to be bad too unnecessarily shallow to be good
Jul 15 2012,positive,best movie of 2012 
Jul 15 2012,positive,overall a great movie
Jul 15 2012,positive,i have waited for two years for this movie and its finally here  its the biggest action movie of the year so far and certainly the most anticipated  its the avengers      the tesseract a newly discovered power source has been stolen from shield led by nick fury samuel l jackson  the perpetrator is none other than loki tom hiddleston thors chris hemsworth brother  so now its up to iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor the hulk mark ruffalo and a few others to retrieve the tesseract before anybody gets hurt  some assembly may be required to build this team known only as the avengers      as the release of the movie came closer my expectations for the film went down  fortunately i was wrong  let me begin by simply stating that this film is as awesome as you imagined it would be when you first heard about it       joss whedon creates a somewhat normal superhero story that lacks some originality  its the kind of story that normally only one hero is needed to be a part of  and it clearly shows  some characters are much more central to the story and have much more screen time than others  if youre a fan of iron man you wont be disappointed  sorry captain america fans       the special effects are as usual incredible  its almost like youre watching a michael bay movie only with a better story and without giant fighting robots  the film has fewer explosions and pyrotechnic effects than i thought it would but i think it makes the film better because they didnt go overboard with the effects       this film is not about the actual team of the avengers but instead its formation  we see that some of the characters dont exactly get along with each other in the beginning yet have the same common goal to ensure the safety of earth and the return of the tesseract       so if there are actually those of you reading this who havent seen the film yet what are you waiting for
Jul 15 2012,positive,best movie in a long time

Jul 14 2012,positive,the best movie i have seen this summer
Jul 14 2012,positive,honestly i was worried about the film because i didnt enjoy most of the comic book transition films batmanmichael keaton the first 2 spiderman films christoper nolans dark night xmen first class joss is obviously a fan of the genre of narvel comics especially for the mere fact of introducing thanos keep it up and looking forward to future projects
Jul 14 2012,positive,so why didnt i see this yet well when i get a chance i am going to
Jul 14 2012,positive,epic block buster for this summer hulk was actually decent and comedic just watch it do it and enjoy the hero fantasy in the marvel universe
Jul 14 2012,positive,great movie the new haulk maid the movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,the most fun ive had seeing a movie in a very long time 9510
Jul 14 2012,positive,whedon not only made a great movie and raised the bar for superhero movies he made a movie any director could take a note from
Jul 14 2012,positive,an absolute summer crowd pleaser full of wit humor and excitement while it may have an overuse of almost fully cgi action sequences you cant avoid walking out feeling entertained
Jul 14 2012,positive,it was entertaining i didnt love it because i expected it to blow my mind but that was my fault i shouldnt have expected so much  as a movie though it was pretty well made that is the reason i still gave it five stars
Jul 14 2012,positive,this can very well be the best attempt at an avengers movie were ever going to get
Jul 14 2012,positive,awesomeloved every minute of it iron man made this movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,i thought some parts were cheesy and slow but there were a lot of hilarious parts that made up for them 
Jul 14 2012,positive,it was both hilarious and serious well balanced between both highly recommend this movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,basically everything anyone has ever wanted in a superhero movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,best movie of all time for being the first avenger movie is bad ass cool pure action and funny 2
Jul 14 2012,positive,a pretty cool movie overall with all of marvels favorite superheroes
Jul 14 2012,positive,this movie encompasses everything i love about the avengers  each character is larger than life and really carries this one  oh yeah digital domainhydraulx keep wowing me with the destructible environments and animation  this is by far a stunner  my only question how did i miss stan lee  i might have to go see it again just to catch him like wheres waldo
Jul 14 2012,positive,amazing movie the story the action the characters the comedy they were all perfect and the way they incorporated all of their different stories in one movie was brilliant i though i would have to watch thor and captain america before watching avengers because thats how series movies are but for this one you didnt because they explain all of their stories so well in this movie and i just have to say i love robert downey jr one of the best actors in hollywood i definitely recommended this movie for all ages
Jul 14 2012,positive,great acting and action packed
Jul 14 2012,positive,there is something that kept me from giving this movie 5 stars but im not quite sure what it was anyways this is perhaps the best superhero movie that i have ever seen it has everything you want in a superhero film action humor great special effects this film raises the bar from any other superhero movie that i have seen whats not to like about a movie with all of your favorite heroes  in one movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,great movie action packed completely funnn at points predictable with sweet surprises
Jul 14 2012,positive,absolutely the best super hero movie to date
Jul 14 2012,positive,it was nice to see how all the superheros would interact together they shared the spotlight well and the integrated humour made me really chuckle it was thought out well and had a good plot script and cast a really fun family movie i look forward to the next one
Jul 14 2012,positive,if youre a person that really likes the superhero movies then this is a must see i am a big fan of the batman movies a couple were a tad goofy but they all were fun each of the characters in this movie weve all seen in their own original movies it was nice to see the same actors in the same rolls all come together in this movie i thought you didnt excellent job i like a lot of different movies my taste very eclectic but i think if you like these action figure movies you got to see this
Jul 14 2012,positive,great movie showed up had a good time watching and munching popcorn before i knew it the final battle came and was great 3d was nice added feature
Jul 14 2012,positive,not my normal movie but it was good and kept my attention and smile
Jul 14 2012,positive,once you get past the fact that thors world has opened a portal to ours and that a god wants to get a cube thingie there and that flying fortresses hang out over the sky protecting us secretly this movie was a lot of fun full of laughs and great fight scenes but it was farfetched for me personally as an adult enjoyment style film  my son loved it and that seems to be all the realism that was required for him  i give it a 35 and put it in the style and genre of spiderman 3 and any bruckheimer film hey i liked con air too
Jul 14 2012,positive,not many movies can keep you glued to the screen for over 2 hours but the avengers does just that a brilliant mix of comedy action and characters that all have their shining moments particularly iron man and hulk the only small problem i had with this movie is the fact that loki did not seem as much of a threat as i thought he would and you dont take him as serious of a villain as maybe the red skull or iron monger but he does his job in the movie and tom hiddleston managed to pull off one of the funniest moments of the movie and had a very impressive entrance in the film this is one of the few movies that i actually watched more than once in the same week because it was that good and i look forward to its bluray release
Jul 14 2012,positive,loved it go see it there are a couple issues but most have to do with the fact that it was a huge ensemble movie with characters that im used to having way more screen time with as a result the characters became caricatures of themselves cap is nothing but noble and serious tony is nothing but sarcastic thor is nothing but thees and thous the one shining star is ruffalos banner he was a lot more nuanced and interesting action was amazing i cheered for hulks great moments near the end
Jul 14 2012,positive,loved it i thought it was a perfect idea to put all of them together
Jul 14 2012,positive,the avengers manages to accomplish something incredible that is  epic in scale while at the same reminding you that these heroes are all humans at heart through excellent direction tremendous acting and a script that is as light hearted with its humor as it is intense with its action the avengers is a must see for anyone additionally the pg13 rating is very weak and doesnt contain any sex dialogue or intercourse the violence is fantasy based with very little blood and gore
Jul 14 2012,positive,this movie was fantastic
Jul 14 2012,positive,best line cap america to hulkhulksmash
Jul 14 2012,positive,i loved it plus i got to be with my youngest daughter  my 3 of my grandkids always a blessing when that happens
Jul 14 2012,positive,and you hulk smash
Jul 14 2012,positive,the movie was awsome i loved it very entertaing movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,amazing best movie this year
Jul 14 2012,positive,i was seriously impressed this exceeded my high expectations its as good as you are going to get in the super hero genre with high class actors effects and an honest to god great script that was both dramatic hilarious and very much true to the tone of the original stories
Jul 14 2012,positive,totally worth seeing again
Jul 14 2012,positive,great movie fun to watch movie was even good enough for my girlfriend d i would recommend this movie to everyone but the storie line was pretty weak
Jul 14 2012,positive,without a doubt one of the best films marvel has dished out and writerdirector joss whedon does a fantastic job of bringing together some of our favorite movie super heroes and making a smart witty and action packed adventure with them
Jul 14 2012,positive,the best movie of the year period
Jul 14 2012,positive,awesome superhero movie
Jul 14 2012,positive,decent fun but did not keep me engaged all the time perhaps it had one super hero too many to handle
Jul 13 2012,positive,as a film it carries limitations on its potential by virtue of being a comic book story alone  particularly when it comes to character development  still its a great story a good step further than your typical highbudget summer blockbuster  most importantly its exemplary for other films of the genre  4 12 stars for being just plain entertaining to watch
Jul 13 2012,positive,combine 4 great marvel movies and good things are bound to happen
Jul 13 2012,positive,cant say more one of my favourite movie so far in 2012 
Jul 13 2012,positive,an action packed film as promised and the essence of the characters not being perfect and getting in arguements is superb  however watching half the film in an invisible aircraft carrier gets irritating after a while  while its big climax in new york is an intense and visual thrill the setup could not have been more bland
Jul 13 2012,positive,loved it and cant wait to own it
Jul 13 2012,positive,this movie was badass
Jul 13 2012,positive,it was worth every penny that i spent
Jul 13 2012,positive,far to much overated and alot doesnt even make sence in it

Jul 13 2012,positive,loved it had humor and great action
Jul 13 2012,positive,the hulk stole the show
Jul 13 2012,positive,its a great movie it was awesome its worth going to see
Jul 13 2012,positive,loved it overall a few things i didnt like mainly concerning the hulk director did a great job putting all these heavy hitter marvel character in one movie and making it work well
Jul 13 2012,positive,loved the movie it was better than i thought will buy it on dvd for sure
Jul 13 2012,positive,surprisingly good its always hard to hard to direct a movie with so many super heroes but this was good kinda long though
Jul 13 2012,positive,one of the best comic based movies ive seen highly recommended
Jul 13 2012,positive,great and hilarious movie
Jul 13 2012,positive,one of the great adaptations of the comic movie era  good characters humor story and great action
Jul 13 2012,positive,have now seen this film twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times this is a film that knows almost exactly what its core audience wants and gives it to them in buckets call it a guilty pleasure but if you have any interest in marvel films or the heroes featured you will most likely love this film many have complained that the individual films that came out before this were just to introduce them for this film but i find it hard to believe that hollywood could be that forward thinking   normally the plan is produce a movie see how much it makes then if it does well make a sequel or spin off some of the original films were hit and miss i didnt like any of the hulk films but here hes a superb supporting character but overall they must have know they were onto a winner in summary if youre an action film fan dont miss this on the big screen in full surround sound and 3d if you can
Jul 13 2012,positive,it was pretty cool and very well put together overall i thought it was awesome and hilarious one of the best movies of all time
Jul 13 2012,positive,best movie ive seen this summer so far
Jul 13 2012,positive,awesome movie  exceeded expectations
Jul 13 2012,positive,joss whedon is fantastic
Jul 13 2012,positive,one the greatest movies of all time the acting was amazing the hulk was spit on and it was hilarious this a great movie and i strongly recommend it to any one whos interested 
Jul 13 2012,positive,failed to reach my expectations but it was enough for me to want to see the next avengers chapter
Jul 13 2012,negative,uh every superhero movie is not good you just cant put people in tights and think that everybody is gonna come out and watch the movie
Jul 13 2012,positive,i can know die happily
Jul 13 2012,positive,this movie was beyond amazing and the comedic timing was dead on
Jul 13 2012,positive,totally amazing had me laughing the whole time and was freaking epic
Jul 13 2012,positive,amazing great action scenes and surprisingly funny at times
Jul 13 2012,positive,love iron man love the hulk and love thor captain america was a bit dry and the black widow was needed to add some feminism i guess laughed loved the action great watch
Jul 13 2012,positive,better than expected had good humor as well as action but not even close to the level of dark knight as far as storyemotional attachmentacting
Jul 13 2012,positive,creative and hilarious
Jul 13 2012,positive,one of the greatest super hero movies of all time
Jul 13 2012,positive,the story was build nicely the jokes are fun but what really turned it down for me is how weak the bad guy is loki was beaten easily by hulk and the army is quite boring just lots of them with low intelligent
Jul 13 2012,positive,i wanna give it 6 stars definitly a great moviei just love the hulkand thor and iron man
Jul 13 2012,positive,cant wait for the sequel  action packed
Jul 13 2012,positive,hands down the best film ever made just look at the facts it became the third highest grossing film in a month the two that beat it titanic and avatar two films that had multiple releases and were in theaters so long you could rent it while it was still playing  not to mention the fact that pulling off five successful releases to build up to one should have been impossible i know not everyone liked all the lead up films but they all were a success finically
Jul 12 2012,positive,absolutely loved the writing acting special effects and fun  loved it so much i saw it twice
Jul 12 2012,positive,this movie is so awesome i could watch it over and over again
Jul 12 2012,positive,awesome best movie of theres ever favorite person captain america
Jul 12 2012,positive,amazing film to bad they made my favorite superhero captain amercia look like a pansy and cut his story and is part in the film so short he seemed close to worthless
Jul 12 2012,positive,130729 some good humour a ton of action and wild characters all battling to either destroy earth or protect it what a great premise seriously marvel has been putting out so many movies over the last few years they are all starting to seem the same to me dont get me wrong this is a good movie but its just a battle fest combining all the single characters into a groupbut i guess thats what the avengers has always been about so marvel is giving us just what theyve been doing in comics for decades good idea i have to admit there are some really neat fight scenes here the most spectacular being when the hulk takes on a god loki i wont say what happens but its awesomely nasty
Jul 12 2012,positive,awesome cant wait til the next one
Jul 12 2012,negative,terrible movie unless you all you are looking for is high tech explosion scenes i left bored to death after one hour
Jul 12 2012,positive,fantastic movie every time you get bored with a scene director joss whedon moves you to another scene so the movie doesnt seem slow and stale absolutely incredible action sequences and with considerable amount of depth within the characters this movie really is a top contender against the dark knight rises for movie of the year highly recommendable for the entire family and also recommendable for a bluray purchase
Jul 12 2012,positive,the mixed entertainment of iron mans suit captains shield thors hammer hulks smash hawkeyes bow as well as black widows wellsexiness indeed joss whedon did an excellent job in this marvel team up
Jul 12 2012,positive,was ok effects outstanding dialogue suspect throughout  had its moments
Jul 12 2012,positive,very good movie for many reasons it is funny with its sarcasm and iron mans aka tony stark satire and wittyness but it has the feeling and setting of a hero movie good for kids because they can see and familarize themselfs with superheros they know but it also had the feeling of a kick butt movie
Jul 12 2012,positive,entertaining movie but overrated at the end of the day
Jul 12 2012,positive,compilation of supers intertwined great job but id just like to say that just because scarlett johansens character looks good doesnt make her a super
Jul 12 2012,positive,i likes the individual charactersand seeing how their personalities collided when together was interesting never seen one of these before but i loved the action and the plot elements very talented actors
Jul 12 2012,positive,damn close to perfect in every way
Jul 12 2012,positive,it lived up to the hype and more
Jul 12 2012,positive,brilliant in everywaya must see
Jul 12 2012,positive,not as interesting as iron man
Jul 12 2012,positive,just like every marvel movie its not accurate to the comics but the story line was pretty good for non comic book readers great action and special effects and even laughs must see
Jul 12 2012,positive,joss should write all the super hero movies from now on
Jul 12 2012,positive,best super hero movie so far this year
Jul 12 2012,positive,oh yeah la necesito
Jul 12 2012,positive,brilliant movie a must watch thoroughly entertaining flick
Jul 12 2012,positive,rather impossible to not love this one charismatic lead performances a fine pace a bombastic soundtrack and some unique action in a genre thats lacked it manage to form marvel studios strongest installment to date really worth the fiveyear wait
Jul 12 2012,positive,joss is a movie genius ill watch anything with his name attached but this is joss and a lot of my favorite superheroes what could be missing
Jul 12 2012,positive,i dont like the comic books but i really did like this movie and it made me want to see the other individual movies about them
Jul 12 2012,positive,the end of movie was the best part
Jul 12 2012,positive,good film with a great mix of action comedy and drama but a little dull at times

Jul 12 2012,positive,tremendously well made one of the best of the year
Jul 12 2012,positive,i think what the avengers is an interesting film dares to tell their characters and has a very good development in the script whedon brings the history of our childhood and that is important
Jul 12 2012,positive,i loved this movie and how they brought most of the marvel characters together
Jul 12 2012,positive,joss wheadon did a spectacular job in this movie could not stop smiling really good paced story keeps the eye moving not to mention the great chemistry between characters and how well the respective actors did with their roleshaving wheadon as a director sure have the avengers movie the edge in special effects as well as giving americas favorite superhero alliance the overhaul that it needed there were no small roles no small parts and no small actors in this years avengers initiative
Jul 12 2012,positive,a must see for all ages fans of comic or just fans of really well done summer blockbusters comedy and star studded cast you will not regret watching this bring friends and family along for a fun conversation after the movie 
Jul 12 2012,positive,the movie presents all the characters well and it is very entertaining to watch
Jul 12 2012,positive,best movie marvel has made thus far im anticipating the sequel this movie had action and comedy loved it

Jul 12 2012,positive,probably the absolute best actionsuperhero film ive seen awesome movie
Jul 12 2012,positive,blockbuster of the year it delivers what it promises to deliver exciteen scenes familiar faces purposeless story and a ton of cheesy humor for the hipster era a lethal mix for art but an undoubtedly profitable undertaking

Jul 11 2012,positive,i seen this movie at the drive in an its so awesome  it keeps u on ur feet an theres never a dull moment i think its the best movie ever made i would rate it 6 stars if they had that many
Jul 11 2012,positive,pretty good but i thought it would be even better cause of the high ratings the 1st half of the movie was kinda boring
Jul 11 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever the only thing is there is to much talking but the action is great
Jul 11 2012,positive,this movie is great it really is its fun the action is spectacular and the chemistry between the actors is great i have one problem that prevents the film from being a true classic for me and that is the villain tom hiddleston gives it his all for sure but his character is easily the least interesting in the film i also cant help but feel that samuel l jackson is sleep walking his way through his role besides that the movie is outstanding  910
Jul 11 2012,positive,aside from the dark knight this may be the best super hero movie to date
Jul 11 2012,positive,that was the first movie i have sat down and watched since surgery it has a great cast and awesone special effects

Jul 11 2012,positive,couldnt be better not perfect just damn good
Jul 11 2012,positive,better than the average comicstrip movie but i didnt enjoy it much everything felt  a bit small scale for a blockbuster movie also scarlett must have a great agent because shes a horrible actress absolutely no talent at all
Jul 11 2012,positive,it was definitely entertaining and good but i just didnt feel that it was as amazing as a lot people seem to think it is after seeing it i felt a bit too mentally exhausted  to be excited afterwards unlike thor which left me feeling alot more excited
Jul 11 2012,positive,definitely amazing movie
Jul 11 2012,negative,didnt really get going till the end
Jul 11 2012,positive,mark ruffalo makes the perfect hulk definitely a mustsee
Jul 11 2012,positive,this is an awesome movie
Jul 10 2012,positive,was a little worried that they might kill the story or fail to capture each character equally but they pulled it off with stand out performances from ruffalo and downey jnr the special effects were pretty huge and the film was entertaining from start to finish
Jul 10 2012,positive,avengers couldnt have been done any better comic book fan or not the movie will please all viewers its wildly entertaining well acted funnybut not too cheesy and sets the bar for superhero movies and how they should be made only the dark knight surpasses it for the best comic movie of all time and barely
Jul 10 2012,positive,feels like an ensemble movie as it should but could have been alot more interesting with even more bickering between characters but it was a great year start of comic boook movies
Jul 10 2012,positive,the movie is a success by not  crumbling under the weight of putting 7 heroes4 super from 5 other films and telling a story that puts the final stamp on the phase one films from marvel keeping  everything before the avengers in tact hinting to an even more epic future but  a lot of the dialogue  was goofy and it didnâtmt take as many risks as i felt a great movie in general should bringing all the these superheroes together also felt pointless because there didnâtmt seem to be a major threat
Jul 10 2012,positive,awesome just so friggin good
Jul 10 2012,positive,joss whedon my hats off to you sir  this is every action and comic book fan boyâtms dream  it has everything in it and delivers nothing but thrill after thrill  it beautifully wraps up all the other marvel movies together in an action packed joyride that is this spectacle and come on hulk killed it  and leaving it open for another installment is exciting but only if joss takes the helm once again
Jul 10 2012,positive,amazing movie absolutely zero disappointment

Jul 10 2012,positive,excellent super hero movie  i admit this genre is really starting to wear thin on me but avengers was pretty cool  thoroughly enjoyable
Jul 10 2012,positive,awesome that is all
Jul 10 2012,positive,it all goes to the larger than life action sequences the movie had the down sides for it was that it took too long for the movie to really kick start not to mention the movie didnt have much of a story to begin with nor did it end well with its cliche ending
Jul 10 2012,positive,good family action movie
Jul 10 2012,neutral,just okanother spin off

Jul 10 2012,positive,maybe one of the best movies of all time
Jul 10 2012,positive,joss whedon has set a whole new standard for superhero films this original and wildly entertaining superhero flick doesnt entertain with depth or development but with its eyepopping action and charming humor its not the best comic movie ever nor is it the best movie of the summer but its definitely up there

Jul 10 2012,positive,fucened awesome movie and funny as hell
Jul 10 2012,positive,almost a perfect movie great story and even better acting
Jul 10 2012,positive,the long awaited group effort of the marvel universe has finally arrived pretty much the ultimate summer movie for easy viewing pleasure whedon definitely has the right instincts and makes sure the story and the human elements dont get crushed under the heavy cgi effect bombardment downwy jr as expected is the real star with lots of great lines some likely adlibbed but all the others all also given their moments to shine and we even get a true emotional moments from the two nonsuperhuman avengers from johansson and renner ruffalo is also the best hulk so far too bad then that the bad guys are mostly faceless cannon fodder and even though loki has his moments he doesnt really rise to the level where we would at least little doubt the success of our heroes
Jul 10 2012,positive,greatest movie this year
Jul 10 2012,positive,great combination of the  superhero genre characters well done
Jul 10 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever newcomer mark ruffalo joins the hero genre as the new hulk alongside robert downey jr samuel l jackson chris evans and chris hemsworth all of them reprising their marvel hero roles brilliantly tom middlesworth also did a great job as the villain loki whos latest evil plot forces nick fury jackson to assemble a team of earths mightiest heroes including iron man downey jr captain america evans the hulk ruffalo thor hemsworth hawkeye and black widow tons of marvelized action make this a must see superhero movie my favorite superhero movie ever
Jul 10 2012,positive,an amazing mix of action comedy and drama marvel has really out done itself the actors were spot on in how the characters think and act in certain situations and each superhero gets a fair amount of screen time each so dont be afraid that you wont see enough of your favorite character
Jul 10 2012,positive,this film was absolutely amazing i was really worried about the amount of screen time for all of the actors and their respective roles but they did a great job getting everyone in there i absolutely loved the combined powers thing that cap and iron man did i didnt like that they made the hulk apeish but ruffalo was perfect for banner the quarrel between him and thor was epic cant wait to see thanos as the baddie for the next film
Jul 10 2012,positive,the only superhero movie with similar tomatometer and audience ratings its unbelievable to think that whedon has found the golden mean between cgi and sfx and a good script
Jul 10 2012,positive,awesome but its good if you see all the movies about the characters before seeing this so your not confused
Jul 10 2012,positive,this movie is basically all action i mean with a total of 6 heroes and a villain army there is nothin much more u can have and if u r the movie person even if u dont love action movies this is the kind of movie that u need to see

Jul 10 2012,positive,if youve enjoyed joss whedons past work youre familiar with his knack for writing snappy dialogue and strong female characters youll find it in his latest the avengers the pace of the movie never slows down and the cast rises up to the challenge of whedons script   great action great dialog excellent intercharacter chemistry and just fun to watch performances of note include robert downey jr as the snarky tony starkiron man as well as tom hiddleston as a deliciously deranged loki if you liked the preceding movies ironman thor capn america you will love this

Jul 9 2012,positive,the fast paced action packed avengers consist of some funny and exciting heroes the hulk steals the show with his humour while green whilst thor adds some comical medieval remarks tony stark is well tony stark and the two new ones black widow and hawkeye are young characters with plenty of movie life left in them

Jul 9 2012,positive,great movie reminds me of watchmen get the feeling the watchmen comics were a spoof of the avengersjustice league
Jul 9 2012,positive,an amazing action movie and one of the best superhero movies ever made this was an extremely fun film to watch every step of the way and each character was done justice to the action sequences were flawless and the cgi was a spectacle in its self the story was surprisingly well written and was fun to see all these big superheroes interact with each other on camera with the perfect mix of fun comedy a well done story and flawless action sequences the avengers is a great movie to watch
Jul 9 2012,positive,saw it twice  love thor
Jul 9 2012,positive,for those who like the marvel movies this is by far the best
Jul 9 2012,positive,being a casual comic book person i was very impressed with this movie because i did not need to know about any of the backgrounds of the characters i did not see thor or captain america but i could pick up the gist of each character i believe the movie was wellpaced had great timing on humor and had very likeable characters i cannot wait to see this movie again when it comes out on bluray
Jul 9 2012,positive,believe the hype i went to see it because of the hulk and iron man captain america was awesome loved this film
Jul 9 2012,positive,one of the best comic book movies ever made hands down great action storyline acting and humor
Jul 9 2012,positive,hands down one of the two best movies ive seen all year the cast the story the humor the action the eye candy the cinematography all if it seemed perfect to me
Jul 9 2012,positive,this was a movie some 56 years in the making  how they managed to get all these fantastic actors to commit to these characters for that duration is impressive and ideal  some would argue that this movie is devoid of plot and that it is all action  i would disagree based on the fact that this movie is a culmination of five other movies that preceded it  the two iron man movies the incredible hulk thor and captain america all lead up to the avengers  this film was meant to be the climax of the storyline  the characters were perfect  the battles were perfect  i left the theatre feeling proud of the job that marvel and joss whedon and everyone involved did  they did justice to the avengers  quite possibly the best marvel superhero movie ever
Jul 9 2012,positive,this is the most fun ive ever had watching a movie ever
Jul 9 2012,positive,joss whedon does it again another amazing film i hope the studios allow him to continue to make great movies
Jul 9 2012,positive,great cant wait for the second part
Jul 9 2012,positive,and finally marvel revealed its baby with years in the making with so much background added to it and with such a hype created around it anything short of amazing wouldve let it down and it didnt 4 superheroes 2 super agents and 1 mastermind of all this against a topnotch cool looking loki this movie had exactly the right amount of action humor and drama the script was water tight and the screenplay so smooth that people unaware of this marvel universe didnt have much of a problem in understanding what the hell is happening characters and their individual spaces were clearly and neatly drawn giving each one to grow equally and come together in the end as a team against the villian there were a lot of places where this movie couldve gone wrong with so many superduper heroes in a single frame but director joss whedon made sure of covering his tracks tactfully the special effects were topnotch story was good screenplay simple and crisp and joss whedon literally knew how and what to get out of his actors all were great but a littletoneddownonanger hulk and iron man come at the top an amazing movie a must watch
Jul 9 2012,positive,phenomenal one of the best movies of the year and arguably the best comic book movie ever
Jul 9 2012,positive,entertaining for comic book fans or action film fans not familiar with comics
Jul 8 2012,positive,fantastic movie a rollercoaster ride from start to finish i really enjoyed this film very funny in some parts and jaw dropping action in others with a awesome cast who play their parts very well if you havent seen this film yet then you are really missing out a five star experience
Jul 8 2012,negative,this film is mediocre at best the avengers came out in may at the tail end of the superhero fad that has struck hollywood over the past few years  i enjoyed it so dont misunderstand what im saying it just needed to step up its game in order to compete with some of the other movies that are circulating out there a lot of people loved it but im not a lot of people it had its moments of well done special effects humor and dialogue i was hoping for better but it didnt meet my expectations  this movie was crowded and truth be told there was no solid story line or structure in this we just saw a bunch of super heroes get together and fight the bad guy  i probably will not be seeing this film again in the near future
Jul 8 2012,positive,its a fun summer superhero blockbuster joss whedon has a tight script but he leaves his characters unexplored and thats exasperating
Jul 8 2012,positive,amazingly acted directed and sporting an incredible joss whedon script i have not a single qualm with this movie i would pay to see it again and thats saying something
Jul 8 2012,positive,a group of unique superheroes after they finish cracking jokes and fighting amongst themselves come together and take down a foe with an unlimited power source and an army equal in size
Jul 8 2012,positive,very solid sadly i only ever watched iron man before this one so i didnt get to benefit from 4 years of buildup  still it was a good film on its own merits with a good mix of action laughs and tension  of course who would expect less from joss whedon
Jul 8 2012,positive,great action special effects humor and story mixes the previous films perfectly well acted and action packed felt much shorter than what it was  one of the best movies of the year and one of the best comic book movies ever cant wait to see it again
Jul 8 2012,positive,while i believe too much was revealed in the trailers and television spots to not have its audience surprised the film had enough character development humor and action to keep it interesting also the nerd in me would switch out black widow and hawkeye for the wasp and giant man in a heartbeat either way four years was worth the hype and the wait
Jul 8 2012,positive,great superheroes great cast entertaining and action packed movie
Jul 8 2012,positive,this film exceeded my expectations and satisfied my inner geek it has everything i look for in a movie humor drama action suspense and more the characters and their interactions with each other were surprisingly entertaining and well executed it brings us the fun creativity and spark back into movies that weve all been missing this is a movie worth seeing and it has definitely raised the bar for action and superhero movies
Jul 8 2012,positive,that was so awsome i would see it a thousand times
Jul 8 2012,positive,a perfect superhero movie there has been no other film that creates the perfect blend of superhero action laughs and drama fantastic must see
Jul 8 2012,positive,well im more of an xmen girl but this is still a great super hero movie
Jul 8 2012,positive,loved this movie especially wen hulk grabs lokie by his ankels and slams him
Jul 8 2012,positive,touted as one of the best superhero movies ever this movie did not disappoint while many complained about its lack of character development thats what the other marvel movies were for it does well to bring all these characters together and show how all their idiosyncrasies can fit together kudos to marveldisney on getting this one right
Jul 8 2012,positive,best superhero movie to date and im a big fan of the genre well balanced with all the heroes  hulk was my personal favourite  there was a scene between hulk and loki that still has me rofling  bottom line must see and definitely worth the 
Jul 8 2012,positive,it is the best film iv sen this yer
Jul 8 2012,positive,awesome flick the whole family will like
Jul 8 2012,positive,the film was absolutely awesome i definitely recommend seeing thor capt america the hulk and iron man 1  2 prior to the movie if nothing else especially thor this was definitely a movie appropriate for all ages and the acting was very great i hope they make a 2nd
Jul 8 2012,positive,im not sure what to say here its the avengers the culmination of the last several years of marvel movies bringing the iron man incredible hulk thor and captian america franchises together in one awesome movie and its a really fun ride great visuals a good script etc a summer popcorn movie dont expect high art but its definitely worth the time especially if youve seen the other marvel movies then again if you see this movie you probably already know what youre getting into already
Jul 8 2012,positive,simply put this is what super hero movies are supposed to be like joss whedon takes an entire team of alisters and somehow makes a movie that meshes them all into a cohesive unit while still showing their differences a
Jul 8 2012,negative,tony stark is still the best character movie felt a lot like transformers only two stars

Jul 8 2012,positive,best comic movie so far cant wait to see the next one
Jul 8 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever laughed the whole time the theater audience stood and applauded when it was over
Jul 8 2012,positive,they could have done this wrong in so many ways that fact alone earns this movie the five stars but they didnt just avoid doing it wrong they did it very very right the bad guys motives are nothing to write home about and there are a few parts that suffer from fridge logic how did thor get back to earth wasnt it convenient that the doctor added a loophole in his device how about the part where as hishecom points out the minions all die phantommenace style but the movie has wit humanity and it really does every character justice the next movie can only get even better since they wont have to establish all of these relationships and antagonisms im looking forward to the result
Jul 8 2012,positive,what a great modern action movie
Jul 8 2012,positive,great it was one of the greatest comic book movies ever
Jul 8 2012,positive,we were told by many to see it  glad we took the time to watch the individual stories beforehand to add even more to the enjoyment  we even watched thor and while it will not be in my top movies of all times  it was a good primer
Jul 8 2012,positive,i was entertained the entire near two and a half hours there was action super heroes aliens gods and lots of freaking explosions was i the only one who laughed when loki called black widow a mewling quim no just me okay
Jul 8 2012,positive,good but i probably would have loved it seeing it in theaters a little overrated from everyone else by the time i finally saw it
Jul 8 2012,positive,exceeded my expectations  seriously  how easy would this have been to completely mess up  and far worse movies have performed just as well
Jul 8 2012,positive,cant wait for part two
Jul 8 2012,positive,simply amazing undoubtedly the best super hero movie yet
Jul 8 2012,positive,best superhero movie of all time
Jul 8 2012,positive,this is a great marvel movied

Jul 8 2012,positive,way to much to say awesome on so many levels
Jul 8 2012,positive,i felt lost like there wasnâtmt really a beginning like i shouldâtmve watched all the movies to appreciate it more

Jul 8 2012,positive,not bad for a superhero movie with a bunch of guys in funny suits
Jul 8 2012,positive,the avengers is charming hilarious actionpacked sad at times and filled with complex and marvelous characters it raises the bar for the genre and hopefully blazes the trail for other fantastically written actionmovies whose action scenes dont drown out character development thank you joss whedon
Jul 8 2012,positive,who said comics are not fun
Jul 8 2012,positive,the avengers is a fantastic superhero film that utilizes the abilities of their fantastic list of actors and isnt ever trumped by the music or the usual loud obscene sounds that dominate most superhero movies
Jul 8 2012,positive,they knocked this movie out of the park it just doesnt get any better than this movie
Jul 8 2012,positive,one of the greatest movies of the year basically 7 marvel movies in one

Jul 8 2012,positive,best movie of the year can batman knock it off the pedestal
Jul 8 2012,positive,i loved it  simple as  no it isnt perfect but damn what were we all expecting  nothing near a film this funny engaging exciting and balanced  i have a lot invested in this from the comics and as a fan it delivered everything i wanted and far more  the set up has been fantastic but really full praise to the whedon for making it more than the parts  hulk for the oscar
Jul 8 2012,positive,frankly it was the best film in the history of ever
Jul 7 2012,positive,the avengers is a fun fast faced extremely well done action film joss whedon creates some great set pieces and the movie never feels like it has run down the scenes of characters talking out there problems between the fighting are great too filled with drama and one liners a great payoff to all the movies leading up to it
Jul 7 2012,positive,great move watched it 4 times its one not to miss
Jul 7 2012,positive,all the  characters get equal screen time and nothing is too overbearing the plot is really really simple but you can still tell there was a lot of care put into the story
Jul 7 2012,positive,pretty much the perfect superhero movie at least in terms of the breadth and scope that it covers reeling in that many characters giving them ample screen time and weight within the story and still having it all come together as a dynamic and satisfying experience damn impressive joss whedon may have just cemented his station in the realm of blockbuster directors with this ensemble piece now if it could only help resurrect firefly 
Jul 7 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ever

Jul 7 2012,positive,excellent action  storyline
Jul 7 2012,positive,best movie of the year so far  robert downey jr never disappoints as his role in iron man  the action scenes are out of this world and it was just a really fun movie to watch  there is a lot of playful banter between the characters and i couldnt help but feel like this was a later movie in a series because of how well the characters played off each other  i cant wait for the sequels

Jul 7 2012,positive,absolutely brilliant the first director to understand the hulk and the first actor to play him to perfection joss whedon does an amazing job of giving each star their time in the limelight the movie is filled with joss whedons one liners that are so perfectly timed my only criticism is that the bad guys arent unique not enough time is spent understanding their motives they are faceless that is a minor nitpick with an absolute fantastic move thanks joss
Jul 7 2012,positive,awesome love the action  humor
Jul 7 2012,positive,this was a movie with a lot of action
Jul 7 2012,positive,gives new meaning to the phrase battle of epic proportions
Jul 7 2012,positive,the movie lived up to its hype and perhaps even reached the level of other recent superhero masterpieces like iron man 1 and the dark knight
Jul 7 2012,positive,enjoy this movies for free                                   enjoy this movies for free 
Jul 7 2012,positive,awesome popcorn movie no substance but lots of laughs and great effects
Jul 7 2012,positive,best action movie ever hands down
Jul 7 2012,positive,great overall flick
Jul 7 2012,positive,while lacking the deeper story line of nolans batman avengers is adept at bringing together the various films leading to its releasewith a perfect blend of action comedy and fan service and the film all future superhero films will be judged against
Jul 7 2012,positive,best movie of the summer
Jul 7 2012,positive,the avengers   12     i was looking forward to this film since 2008 but ill admit i had my worries while i enjoyed all of the other marvel universe films i could not help but fear that this would be one giant mess those fears were put to rest thanks to talent of joss wheton who took all these charcters put them in one film and gave them all equal time and impotance to the story while still giving great action clever dialog and even some hetwarming moments the biggest suprise in the film is mark rufflos hulk who is the best onscreen hulk ive seen yet and he really deserves praise for making bruce banner and the hulk a great 3 dimensional charcter   the avengers is one of the best superhero films of all time a true success in terms or writting acting and directing
Jul 7 2012,positive,so much fun seen it twice might see it again
Jul 7 2012,positive,this is te best movie ever a must see btw loki rocks
Jul 7 2012,positive,loved this movie this is the marvel universe
Jul 7 2012,positive,after watching the avengers again my opinion of it has somewhat soured thinking about it more than i did at the time it feels more and more like a michael bay film youve got the quips youve got the boom boom blow everything up every five minutes and so much happens in the space of two hours that it makes all the other marvel films feel pathetic by comparison even the visual effects feel somewhat used ultimately this is a film that tries to go places but ends up right back where it started
Jul 7 2012,positive,why was i annoyed by scarjo though im probably just jealous
Jul 7 2012,positive,pure blockbuster fantastic just hope they can keep up the story and not lose it in special effects
Jul 7 2012,positive,while not on the caliber of something like the dark knight or iron man in terms of story telling or character development the avengers is funnyaction packed and is a more than satisfying conclusion to a build up that has spanned 4 years
Jul 7 2012,negative,this isnt what most of us die hard comic book fans were hoping for all there is to this silly movie is hammy dialogue unnecessary scenes which contain useless and annoying overacting
Jul 7 2012,positive,i am just a playboy millionaire philanthropist 
Jul 7 2012,positive,amazing movie the acotrsactresses have the perfect portrayal of each avengers characters every second was a must watch without blinking
Jul 7 2012,positive,as much of a fan of marvel comics as i am im only giving this movie 3 out of 5 stars its your typical action movie neat graphics and animation not much story or depth of character causing parts of the film to seem corney and rushed overall id call this summer blockbuster overrated
Jul 7 2012,positive,it was the best marvel  movie ever now im waiting for spiter man
Jul 7 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive seen  this is definitely on my current top 5 best 
Jul 7 2012,positive,hectic roller coaster of a movie awesome special effects though
Jul 7 2012,positive,come on its marvel its many of my favorite characters from some of my favorite films rolled into one movie its a geekgasm and finally a hulk i can truly appreciate
Jul 7 2012,neutral,think i am the only one on the planet disappointed by this movie
Jul 7 2012,positive,yea yes yes this was awesome
Jul 7 2012,positive,cant wait to own it
Jul 7 2012,positive,good in bits and pieces
Jul 7 2012,positive,if you really liked any of the individual movies of the avengers youll like this one just buy your copy 
Jul 7 2012,positive,we liked it kids liked it now we own it 
Jul 7 2012,positive,great popcorn movie and a great taste of the marvel movies to come hopefully they can fit in one more avengers movie before they have to reboot the characters
Jul 7 2012,positive,this a great movie and would defenitly recommend it
Jul 7 2012,positive,a little long but a fiery blast  peppered wdowney jrs wise cracking and wit made this fun one usually wonders whose super powers can best the others and that fantasy came alive as one super hero was pitted against another thor was much cooler in his own flick though yet his brother was perfectly cast as the villain you love to hate can anyone say sequel  cause its coming
Jul 7 2012,positive,marvel movies have always been of interest to me but after captain america and thor i began to loose that interest but after this movie it completely made up for that lost interest i absolutely loved this movie for the stunning story and all around entertaining action and the wonderful performances by the cast
Jul 7 2012,positive,boy howdy talk about throwing in the kitchen sink what didnt marvel throw into this flick  one of the best things about the avengers  all those marvel films leading up to it  iron man 1  2 incredible hulk thor and captain american  now tell me what other franchise in hollywood history had trailers like those  leading up to the slam bang the avengers  is it perfect no  in some ways its almost impossible to make a perfect superhero film  yes i know dark knight reaches for it and just about makes it but i have one major issue with dk that keeps it from being dang near perfect  the avengers sports one of the better villains in loki and everyone else delivers as well  for me one of the actual best moments was the final easter egg at the very end  that was grrreat to quote tony the tiger  it made me wish that marvel would on a lark make a movie based on a three part miniseries comic from the early 90s called damage control  it could be a cable movie even  great idea never ever explored before on film but you almost get a taste of it during this greatestsofar codas to a superhero movie ever
Jul 7 2012,positive,it was really good and kinda funny
Jul 7 2012,positive,brilliant moves really enjoyed took my fourteen year old son with me not sure who enjoyed it more if you like marvel characters you will love this
Jul 7 2012,positive,1st movie watched in a 3d cinema
Jul 7 2012,positive,easily the greatest comic book movie ever
Jul 7 2012,positive,the best movie ive seen in theaters this year ive seen it three times already and plan to see it again
Jul 7 2012,positive,watching this film makes me want to buy all the comics x loved it
Jul 7 2012,positive,amazing stunts amazing actors amazing effects and an amazing film the avengers is one of my most anticipated movies of 2012 and after i walked out of that movie house it was 5x better than i expected by far this is the best movie of 2012 yet this movie made it into my top 20 films of 2012  note mark ruffalo did a wonderful performance and he deserves an oscar for his role as bruce banner incredible hulk
Jul 7 2012,positive,to be honest i didnt enjoyed this movie as much i expected it maybe my expectations were huge unlike the movie
Jul 7 2012,positive,it would seem as though too many superheroes played by too many movie stars would dilute the plot and hinder the film in fact it does the exact opposite well done
Jul 7 2012,positive,5 diamonds this is by far the best action scifi etc movie of all time
Jul 7 2012,positive,another superheros film with a mixture of action humour and credit goes to iron man n hulk for salvaging an otherwise masala mix
Jul 7 2012,positive,awesome awesome movie  i would pay to watch it again
Jul 7 2012,positive,great action as expected and love the dialogue banter nice job again and again
Jul 7 2012,positive,an awesome bundle of all our fav superheroes with downeys humor ruffalos spot on performance and other key assets this film gets it done right
Jul 7 2012,positive,will watch it many times more
Jul 7 2012,positive,how can you not just love it  
Jul 7 2012,positive,very strong superhero flick humour acting intelligence story and of course action are all very much present  and nicely done too
Jul 7 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever
Jul 7 2012,positive,the avengers definitely delivers and stays faithful to the comics robert downey jr samuel jackson and tom hiddleston carry the movie
Jul 7 2012,positive,joss whedon rocks  the cast performed perfectly and i would see this movie again in a heartbeat
Jul 7 2012,positive,hey this is the assemble cast  woh
Jul 7 2012,positive,better than i thought
Jul 6 2012,positive,great beginning to end i was worried the movie would focus on one hero more then the other they did a great job
Jul 6 2012,positive,iron man robert downey jr the incredible hulk mark ruffalo hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson thor chris hemsworth and captain america chris evans  make the avengers this film is pretty sweet   the avengers assemble to face off against the god of mischief himself loki portrayed by tom hiddleston   what does the avengers have awesome visual effects great characters great direction not the best plot i cant think of any other villains that they could have fought against well villains of these superheroes magneto or a batman villain could have worked but of course that goes out of their section of villains i just wasnt feeling the alien invasion thing   though the action was incredible  and it prevented the viewer from becoming bored the gags were really funny  iron man and the incredible hulk added charisma to the film the film casts a big box office shadow for upcoming super hero films like the amazing spiderman and the dark knight rises so hopefully those dont disappoint  my expectations were high from hearing all of the awesome things about it so i didnt enjoy it as much as i wanted to and i also viewed the film in 2d and not 3d in which it was made for so that may have taken away from my enjoyment  granted the film is still better than ones average super hero film and was still extremely enjoyable
Jul 6 2012,positive,great adventure we all loved it
Jul 6 2012,positive,all these raving reviews are really making me want to see this one
Jul 6 2012,positive,joss whedon rises from the ashes like a phoenix fun flick dont over analyze it

Jul 6 2012,positive,awesome movie if you like action youll love this one
Jul 6 2012,positive,awesome watched it 2 times
Jul 6 2012,positive,the avengers was awesome  so far its definitely the best movie that ive seen of 2012 and ive seen more than a few  the action was stellar the special effects great the comedy subtly genius  the basic idea of this film was nicely set up in the previous marvel movies the iron mans captain america thor and the hulks with the introduction of both many of the characters and the elements that were at play  my one problem with this movie was that there were still a lot of names that i didnt really pick up on because they werent really said often enough  without doing an internet search i would be unable to tell you the superhero alter ego of renners character  the premise of the movie is a bit complicated  asgardian loki hiddleston has made a deal with an alien race in exchange for retrieving the tesseract he will receive an army that he can use to conquer earth  using his scepter loki manages to enslave dr erik slevig skarsgård clint bartonhawkeye renner and several other sheild agents while also stealing the tesseract and blowing up sheilds remote research facility  sheild director nick fury jackson reactivates the avengers initiative and calls in tony starkiron man downey steve rogerscaptain america evans dr bruce bannerhulk ruffalo and natasha romanoffblack widow johansson  in the pursuit of loki they are also joined by thor hemsworth lokis brother and the god of thunder  the group dont exactly work well together and are as likely to fight each other as loki and with the exception of romanoff none entirely trusts fury suspecting him of withholding the entire story  it is up to the group of them to come together for the greater good stop loki and save the planet  the best part of a movie like this is the action and the avengers doesnt fail to meet expectations  its an action packed movie and despite the league of some of the characters none of the fights are one sided  theres no moment when the bad guys line up and wait to be slaughtered onebyone by the good guys nor does the fact that thor and loki are gods make the outcome of a fight rather obvious  even the very human phil coulson gregg gets a few good shots in  the space bits were a bit over the top and i have to admit that the alien invasion kind of reminded me of transformers dark of the moon    the second best part of this movie was the cast  downey as always is stellar as tony stark  i dont think he was as funny as he was in the iron man films and i would have enjoyed a little more between him and pepper potts although his interactions with jarvis did make up for it a bit  seeing him squaring off with captain america loki and thor really gave us an idea of just how powerful iron man is and for the first time he seemed to really be up against an opponent who is his match  i liked captain america more in this film than i did in captain america although i do hope that by the next movie hes gotten an upgrade on his uniform  i think i liked thor more in thor although part of that is because hes quieter and more stoic than the other avengers and thus fades a bit when in a larger group  hiddleston makes an amazing villain i spent part of the movie hoping for his sake that he doesnt look as creepy in real life as he does when hes playing loki  his timing was amazing i just wish that he hadnt been wearing that horrible horned helmet for so much of the film  i enjoyed both johansson and renners characters and i liked that the black widow was utilized more  id like to see standalone films for them in the future  id also love to see a standalone film for nick fury  smulders character left me wanting more  it was nicely acted i just found myself questioning who she was every time she appeared on screen did they even mention her by name  i didnt really care for ruffalos bruce banner although hes not my least favourite bruce banner  when stark asks banner if he smokes pot i was waiting for him to say yes  ruffalo however had the distinction of playing two very different characters and while his banner was lacking his hulk was amazing  easily the best part of this movie  it says a lot about an actor when he manages to make the hulk funny  
Jul 6 2012,positive,hilarious movie go iron man and hulk
Jul 6 2012,positive,amazing movie cant wait till it comes out on dvd
Jul 6 2012,positive,i really want to see this
Jul 6 2012,positive,awesome and funny movie

Jul 6 2012,positive,amazing super hero flick but almost too many to share the screen the individual films for each seem better balanced
Jul 6 2012,positive,great and fun movie
Jul 6 2012,positive,this was a badass movie man i cant wait for the next won to come out
Jul 6 2012,positive,rarely does a comic movie meet beat and absolutely exceed expectations  established a new ceiling for comic movies the build up from the other movies built incredible anticpation and the movie did not disappoint  it actually was better  rare in movies but rarer in an increasignly saturated genere congrats
Jul 6 2012,positive,best superhero movie of all time
Jul 6 2012,positive,kicked all sorts of ass
Jul 6 2012,positive,the ultimate summer film
Jul 6 2012,positive,i dont typically like blockbusters and my inner nerd makes me overly critical of comic book movies that said this was the first time i have ever felt a 15 ticket was a steal how fluid the plot is kept given the breakneck pace comedy large cast and epic scope of action is nothing short of masterful
Jul 6 2012,positive,the best superhero movie so far
Jul 6 2012,positive,very entertaining and actionpacked movie but the plot lacked consistency and fight scenes were slightly lackluster still an overall great movie to watch especially for marvel fans and superhero fanatics
Jul 6 2012,positive,instant reclassic they really hulksmashed it
Jul 6 2012,positive,one of the most heroic epic amazing movies ever made this movie was just simply the best i was speechless at the end wanted more but we will see whats next great movie
Jul 6 2012,positive,one of the most overrated pieces of shit of all time is it still a good movie yes is it great hell no terrible villian incoherent storytelling cgi porn all over the end i hope the second one is better
Jul 6 2012,positive,awesome movie a must if you like super hero movies i cant wait till thedvd is out so i can watch it again
Jul 6 2012,positive,sickest film ever cant wait for more avengers films
Jul 6 2012,positive,i liked it very much and it was a great way to bring everything together the end left an opening for yet another sequel when this story was already enough how much crazier will this get
Jul 5 2012,positive,great movie good mix of comedy and action
Jul 5 2012,positive,the avengers is a fun action packed maybe a little too action packed effects ridden blockbuster with a great ensemble cast fans of other films in the franchise thor captain america iron man etc wont be disappointed
Jul 5 2012,positive,very entertaining great visuals and action packed the avengers is the amazing payoff of 5 movies that was somehow able to make room for everyone
Jul 5 2012,negative,the avengers articulates why the genre is so popular the action is larger than life the whole premise is wacky and the characters clash with their egos as often as their enemies the film is a cinematic innovation and a vastly irrepressible fun time
Jul 5 2012,positive,good job over all this is light stuff and thats why it works it could easily have been an epic fail but its funny and wild enough
Jul 5 2012,positive,very awesome kept me off the edge of my seat lots of action and some funny parts very enjoyable
Jul 5 2012,positive,the movie was awesome its inspiring
Jul 5 2012,positive,best movie i have seen this year funny thrilling action filled and great cast
Jul 5 2012,positive,great u dont have to know about the superheroes to know the movie
Jul 5 2012,positive,this is a really good movie and funny
Jul 5 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever superman and batman cant beat this neither can any marvel movie except avengers 2 this was absolutely amazing but they can do even better
Jul 5 2012,positive,nothings perfect but this movie is very close to being a perfection itself
Jul 5 2012,neutral,a much less wellknown rounded film than its superheroconglomerate predecessor xmen first class
Jul 5 2012,positive,amazing i loved it awesome beggining and happy ending i sure hope there is a second one coming
Jul 5 2012,positive,soooooo awesome i loved this movie
Jul 5 2012,neutral,not the best movie but satisfying
Jul 5 2012,positive,the best comic super heroes ever put together in a super hero movie
Jul 5 2012,positive,the avengers is sofar the best film of the year it is the perfect way to combine some of my favorite super heroes
Jul 5 2012,positive,one of my favorite superhero movies ever best in 3d
Jul 5 2012,positive,lots of fun go see it
Jul 5 2012,positive,awesome movie with a lot of good graphic and action scene the plot was predictable and character set up was outstanding cant wait for number 2 to come out
Jul 5 2012,positive,every nerds wet dream that has raised bar to elephant heights fantastic in every single way
Jul 5 2012,positive,this movie was unbelievable 5 stars without a doubt
Jul 5 2012,positive,wow thats all i can say wow i have not been wowed like that since the reboot of star trek the avengers truley worked one of the hardest movies ever to make was truley a succsess this movie is for sure to be a classic with a great plot awsome action fine acting with great humor a long reveiw is not needed you get where im comming from the avengers is sure to be a classic for years to come
Jul 5 2012,positive,theres not a lot of dramatic tension half of the cast seems incapable of getting a scratch let alone dying and its pretty corny that said its still a lot of fun
Jul 5 2012,positive,this movie was a lot of fun but it takes some time before things get interesting probably since its the first movie about the avengers i like this movie and its awesome to see everyone work together but compared to marvels other team of heroes xmen this lacks the luster and strong story behind it i still recommend it to anyone who likes any of the heroes in the movie i think they picked a good villain
Jul 5 2012,negative,michael bayish and overrated the avengers deserve much less recognition then it got
Jul 5 2012,positive,hulks humor makes my day
Jul 5 2012,positive,zero complaints  every fanboy itch satisfied  every character had just the right amount of screen time  3d was the way to see it no other way  i already paid for this on amazon  done
Jul 5 2012,positive,this is the perfect super hero movie
Jul 5 2012,positive,a great time at the movies and a childhood dream fulfilled  just wished they would have fought an actual villain at the end instead of a stream of faceless storm trooper types
Jul 5 2012,positive,best superhero movie so far 
Jul 5 2012,positive,saw it twice going for a third time and have the 3d bluray on preorder what is left to say
Jul 5 2012,positive,i understand what joss whedon was trying to do and appreciate it but the avengers could have been so much more than mindless action and nonstop one liners it had the potential to delve deep into their characters and the plot but there was so much comic effect in the movie that when it was time to be serious you cant help but laugh and then you realize how silly you feel
Jul 5 2012,positive,full of action humour and a great cast its impossible not to enjoy this film the one criticism i have is that it is perhaps slightly too long
Jul 5 2012,positive,quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made
Jul 5 2012,positive,ill sayby far the best superhero movie ever 
Jul 5 2012,positive,fun movie i think you need to see thor captain america and hulk in order to appreciate some of the story  humor
Jul 5 2012,positive,amazing just simply amazing and now theyre coming out with a sequel even better
Jul 5 2012,positive,it was good ol fun hulk stole the spotlight and every character had lots of complexity to them
Jul 5 2012,positive,thor iron man hulk and the shield cracking alien skulls not bad at all
Jul 5 2012,positive,exactly what a movie about a band of super heroes should be
Jul 5 2012,positive,couldnt ask for a better combination of actors and super heros in one movie
Jul 5 2012,positive,i simply loved this movie i am not a big comic book person but i watched the other films with my roommates and boyfriend who are and could explain things to me it had the right amount of funny action and suspense to make it worth wild
Jul 5 2012,positive,i took my kids out of school early on opening day to see this it was and is a great movie i will go back to see it again before it leaves the theater
Jul 5 2012,positive,this movie is awesome youve got to see this
Jul 5 2012,positive,when you find yourself at the cinema for a second time to see a movie to fill in what you may have missed blinking or tinkling it lends to the cinematic piece of awesomeness that is the avengersbring on the age of apocalypse
Jul 5 2012,positive,ive had a change of heart about this film the thing is the producers directors and such of this film took no chances when making it this is a very conservative film giving the people what they want so that they dont screw anything up great movie but not anything special
Jul 5 2012,positive,one of the top five superhero movies ever made absolutely spectacular
Jul 5 2012,positive,this movie was really good i enjoyed every second of it robert downey jr and chris evans played their roles well the others did too
Jul 5 2012,positive,great concept that really came together and in my opinion didnt try to cram too much down your throat for 2 12 hours  everyone got screen time and a sense that this movie serves as a sequel to their own ventures  certainly captain america was better here than previously  in particular i enjoyed mark ruffalo as bruce banner and would have like to have seen him explored more  tom hiddleston also did a good job carrying the weight of being the lone villain  looking forward to the next one  ps  im no fan of natalie portman but she was too busy for an appearance here  wheres don cheadle for that matter
Jul 5 2012,positive,amazing action movie just felt like there was something missing not sure what it is but i hope to find it in the sequel
Jul 5 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movie worth watching in theatre 
Jul 5 2012,positive,a good but overhyped film its not something im going to revisit over and over again some painful saturday morning cartoon  comic book physics dialogue about cosmic cubes  tesseracts that slows down the first hour followed up by some micahel bay style explosions at the end marvel fans are always going on about the human element to their superheroes yet the film they geek spasm over is an overly cgid action spectacular with punchy dialogue but thin ploting its decent but not great disposable entertainment but certainly not the paragon of brilliance that some make it to be
Jul 5 2012,positive,just a kick ass movie all the way around the avenger just all came together and had a kick ass time with in joining the movies together with the whole picture stan lee just a few words is awesome
Jul 5 2012,positive,not a bad film but people have blinders on if they think this is a well written movie oneliners and a handful of clever moments dont cover up a poorly structured script with little logic and disposable villains
Jul 5 2012,positive,amazing movie thor is a personal favorie
Jul 5 2012,positive,thee most epic comic movie ever the  storyline the cinematography the comedic lines amazing awesome movie with really hot men
Jul 5 2012,positive,really cool not much into superheroes but this makes you wanna get involved with superheroes
Jul 5 2012,positive,it was a little long 5050 but was well worth the admission if your into comics  know about the characters some youll be amped to see more
Jul 5 2012,positive,what can i say about the avengers that already hasnt been said  an absolutely amazing movie that delivers on all superhero levels and leaves nothing to be desired  bravo joss whedon
Jul 5 2012,positive,be sure to stay though the full end credits
Jul 5 2012,positive,great movie cant wait till the sequel
Jul 5 2012,positive,you shouldnt need me to tell you to see this movie rent it buy it own it
Jul 4 2012,positive,the comic snob in me wants to dock the rating 12 star for omitting thors helmet and hawkeyes mask and for switching races on a character still the stupidest thing to me no matter how they try to spin it with bullshit alternate universe explanations but this movie was so damned surprisingly good that when it was done i didnt care that the dark knight rises formerly my only hope for a good superhero movie in 2012 was still months away joss whedon finds the balance between action and comedy and showcases every single character in a masterful way something just about all other marvel films namely the original xmen trilogy and spiderman 3 fail to do
Jul 4 2012,positive,anybody can watch this movie and be blown away because it is so awesome
Jul 4 2012,positive,i am a diehard comic fan i am also something of a movie buff i had extremely high expectations for this movie and i can happily report that this completely blew me away i have nothing negative to say about this movie nothing at all brilliant and skillfully executed on every front keep it up marvel
Jul 4 2012,positive,all about iron man and hulkthe others would not be missed
Jul 4 2012,positive,fantastic superhero movie so funny and the hulk was finally done some justice iron man is great as always not happy with chris evans but hey he does alright
Jul 4 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen much thought was put into this
Jul 4 2012,negative,the action part of it was cool and the actors were fine but the underlining story was boring and i was falling asleep throughout this movie
Jul 4 2012,positive,amazing in every aspect probably best movie i have ever seen the action effects humor characters and plot are simply amazing
Jul 4 2012,positive,the avengerâtms is everything you could ever want in an action movie this is probably the best action movie of all time  two and a half hours of pure enjoyment captain america is very charming strong and displays his natural leadership abilities iron man is quick witted sarcastic and awesome bruce banner is nervous fidgety and bursting of intelligence the hulk is strong unpredictable and my personal favorite i was really worried about mark ruffalo as the hulk edward norton and eric bana both did an excellent job as bruce banner ruffalo has joined that list and did a great job he played the role perfect iâtmm not a huge fan of scarlett johansson i was surprised at how well she did at being black widow black widow is acrobatic quick and clever hawkeye had a perfect shot every time thor is his normal godly self with a hammer of awesomeness and loki is as pale and evil as ever there is a very awesome fight scene between iron man and thor there is another awesome fight scene with the hulk and thor you can catch extra clips at the start of the credits and at the very end of the credits stay for both great to see in the theatre and to see multiple times seriously one of the best movies ever
Jul 4 2012,positive,hulk stole the show
Jul 4 2012,positive,all i can say is epic d
Jul 4 2012,positive,awesome  cant wait fit the sequel
Jul 4 2012,positive,one of my favorite movies spider man would have made it my favorite
Jul 4 2012,positive,marvels the avengers was the perfect superhero movie it was action packed funny intense and has you glued to your seat for the whole 2 and a half hours running time i expected this film to be more focused on iron man and captain america but i can happily say that i enjoyed how marvel spilt the screen action between all of the avengers  this film truly lives up to the hype and will be remembered as a classic
Jul 4 2012,positive,such great entertainment i was afraid it wouldnt be able to meet the crazy high superhero standard but the movie didnt disappoint in any way go see it if you can
Jul 4 2012,positive,not bad  i would have liked to see a little bit more relationship building among the characters but i cant complain too much  with all of its captivating combat choreography sharp oneliners and ridiculously cool visual effects the avengers might just be the movie of the year
Jul 4 2012,positive,this movie is the true definition of a summer blockbuster it has everything we need action kick ass heroes and villains and not to mention awesome fighting sequences
Jul 4 2012,positive,the movie doesnt have much of a plot but the preceding films provide us with a rich back story that makes this one a lot better it was a long wait but well worth it and hopefully the sequel will be even better
Jul 4 2012,positive,not a bad moviejust needed more of the hulk
Jul 4 2012,positive,great action just the right amount of fantastical spectacular overthetopness  hulk scenes had me pumped up like an overexcited little boy hopped up on candy  im not sure what was missing but it wasnt perfect  just really great
Jul 4 2012,positive,it has everything an action movie needs
Jul 4 2012,positive,this years most over rated film
Jul 4 2012,positive,the perfect superhero movie each character has there moment to shine and no one gets pushed to the background every manages to come across as a real person the action is insane and the ending alone is worth price of admission and then some the forming device for the story is pretty basic bad guy wants to take over the world but they handle it well the movie shines by the strength and personality of its characters and the action sequences
Jul 4 2012,positive,of all the superhero movies lately i liked thor the best for its story line the fight scene at the end of the movie was too long felt like a transformers movie the story was good the movie was a b for me
Jul 4 2012,positive,greatest superhero movie ever
Jul 4 2012,positive,the perfect movie its a great time for us old marvel comics fans seeing the characters we loved to read as kids come to life
Jul 4 2012,positive,this movie was awesome

Jul 4 2012,positive,awesome action packed
Jul 4 2012,positive,solid action best hulk movie yet
Jul 4 2012,positive,best movie of the last several years just about every other movie seems to pale in comparison
Jul 4 2012,positive,as far as movies with 7 main characters and a villain who cant really die go this is really really good
Jul 4 2012,positive,a little super hero action on the 4th of july with the boys
Jul 4 2012,positive,the best movie this year
Jul 4 2012,positive,has to be the greatest superhero movie made i sarcastically call it ironman 3 because robert downy jr steals the show joss whedon was the perfect director and the music by alan silvestri was epic
Jul 4 2012,positive,this was an amazing movie and robert downy jr is sexy as always 
Jul 4 2012,positive,awesome action packed movie with great writing and storyending
Jul 4 2012,positive,joss whedon did an awesome job with the characters in this movie my only complaint is that i cant give this movie more than 5 stars lol
Jul 4 2012,positive,an awesome movie with a good mix of action and humor
Jul 4 2012,positive,very fun well made and entertaining movie
Jul 4 2012,positive,loved it buying it when its out
Jul 4 2012,positive,it was funny at times not at bad as i thought it was going to be
Jul 4 2012,positive,a little bit disappointed in comparison to the individual movies with iron man thor and captain america being so good
Jul 4 2012,positive,thrilling near the end
Jul 4 2012,positive,this movie was excellent and had beautiful sfx it was so good even without 3d that i might go see it again
Jul 4 2012,positive,joss whedon is the right man to take several complicated superheroes and weave them into a wellbalanced mix of enticing action brief drama a handful of character development with a thick topping of great humor that comic books nerds and average joes can enjoy equally
Jul 4 2012,positive,such an awesome movie
Jul 4 2012,positive,i dont like superhero action movies all that much and some of the origin films from this whole series left something to be desired i wanted to watch them before seeing this in theaters so id know what was going on  i missed thor but it didnt matter because that happens to be one of the origin movies that just sucked but holy hell this movie was justawesome  i love joss whedon and you can see his influence but he doesnt take over the movieand its so great to get those little easter eggs of dialogue and whatnot that may not have been there otherwise  if movie theatre prices werent so prohibitively high id have already seen it a couple of times
Jul 4 2012,positive,excellent summer fare enjoyable for nerds and their girlfriends
Jul 4 2012,positive,the dialog was better than the fighting
Jul 4 2012,positive,hells yes    that is all
Jul 4 2012,positive,it is so difficult to make a super hero movie that combines great action and character development  even more difficult when you combine so many superheros this movie was so much fun to watch and up there with the best superhero movies ever made
Jul 4 2012,positive,so so so finf good i like the two endings
Jul 4 2012,positive,absolutely loved it in my top 5 favorite movies
Jul 4 2012,positive,i watched this without having seen any of the superhero movies before and it still stood out
Jul 4 2012,positive,im a bit of a comic geek so i was prepared to be let down  this flik was phenomenal  action from the first min all the way to the last  as always with marvel stay seated until the end credits have completely finished
Jul 4 2012,positive,great mesh of castcharacters
Jul 4 2012,positive,way better then i expected   i think this is one franchise that marvel has done right and all other comic based movies should take note   the way that they built up to the movie with the small clips at the end of each movie the fact that all of the main characters had their own movie so that there was no need for time killing back story it really is what made the film possible
Jul 4 2012,positive,what else can i say this movie was awesome
Jul 4 2012,positive,nothing i can write that noone else has already written awesome movie
Jul 4 2012,positive,best superhero movie yet great script and action loved it
Jul 4 2012,positive,love it but i sooo want to see this shit again
Jul 4 2012,positive,this is a well done comic book come to life and finally somebody that did the hulk justice 
Jul 4 2012,positive,awesome just awesome
Jul 4 2012,negative,the first 34 part of this movie is a really boring dramabut the ending is awesome
Jul 4 2012,positive,imo one of or perhaps the best superhero movie ive seen well written by the ever excellent joss whedon story for the large ensemble of heroes the story carries individual characters from solitary heroes into the avengers great cast of actors too  im particularly fond of tom hiddleston as loki  i saw the standard 2d format which i thought satisfactory and didnt regret missing out on any 3d gimmicks
Jul 4 2012,positive,this movie was petty pack full of funnies and actin
Jul 4 2012,positive,i have to watch it again in english because the voices in spanish are awful specially thors who sounds like a teen boy
Jul 4 2012,positive,outstanding flick whether or not you are a comic book fan high amounts of action and a few laughs mixed in the characters play their roles perfectly and the hulk will leave you with goose bumps
Jul 4 2012,positive,i only watched this cuz i had given my brother a movie date of choice for his bday however it turned out to be really funny at times and a lot of fast pacing action i didnt get most of the references having only watched the ironman movies but it was good to watch it with someone who knew a bit more definitely worht seeing despite not knowing a hell of a lot of it  i was a bit surprised by the mythology connection since that wasnt something that people had discussed
Jul 4 2012,positive,simply mindblowing definetly worth the wait 3
Jul 4 2012,positive,good but highly overrated
Jul 4 2012,positive,great culmination to the marvel movies weve come to love
Jul 4 2012,positive,the perfect superhero film period marvel brings together six superheroes and one epic villain to create a cinematic landmine filled with highpacked action hilarious comedy and plenty of emotion marvels the avengers is a mustsee for any movie fan period
Jul 4 2012,positive,good movie made me want to watch each single super hero movie
Jul 3 2012,positive,marvels answer to dcs the dark knight although no comparison whatsoever can be made this movie is an absolute opposite of tdks deep and dark theme and i suppose that is a good thing seriously marvel superheroes are rather shallow in character development compared to dcs and joss whedon realizes this so instead he focuses on what marvel superheroes does best kicking ass an excellent writer himself whedon provides excellent oneliners throughout the entire film and he saves the best lines for mark ruffalos bannerhulk who is by far gives the best interpretation of the hulk on the silverscreen yet if youre a tween or just someone who likes action films without wanting to burden your brain with storyline marvels avengers is it
Jul 3 2012,positive,perfect super hero movie in every way shape  form
Jul 3 2012,positive,whats not to love hot menwomen fighting evil and kicking ass

Jul 3 2012,positive,a competent summer blockbuster nothing more nothing less
Jul 3 2012,positive,it was great my kids luagh and the movie had me on my toes
Jul 3 2012,positive,im a big fan of comic book movies but im always weary of them taking over the box office for not being original but no matter what i enjoyed this film it was entertaining and done very well i mean the whole part of the film when the avengers are in the city was real other than the aliens and hulk of course the explosions and stunts i think it deserves the rating it has and being the 1 highest grossing film in the world as of right now im very anxious to see more from what marvel has to bring to the theaters and im sure they will please however im still weary of these films overshining original films
Jul 3 2012,positive,this was a good movie but i have to say that its slightly overrated the story just seems a little slow to me but still its a really fun movie and i will definitely be buying it on blue ray
Jul 3 2012,positive,a box office smash that was highly entertaining believe the hype and enjoy the awesome action
Jul 3 2012,positive,unexpectedly very good maybe the best of the summer biggies
Jul 3 2012,positive,it wants the hype it was set out to be but it was ok it was to rushed and to umm childish i like serious story telling
Jul 3 2012,positive,very enjoyable movie with many great action scenes but slightly cliche
Jul 3 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for part two
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie is one of the best action movies ive ever seen you have to watch it d
Jul 3 2012,positive,liked the film but you have it for what it is just a hollywood blockbuster jumping on the cash wagon didnt think it was true to comics but i did think it was definitely a fun watch would recommend anyone to watch it
Jul 3 2012,positive,im not usually a fan of superhero movies but the avengers was an amazing surprise for me it was just plain awesome the characters the soundtrack the plot everything about it was epic i was on the edge of my seat the whole time fantastic film go see it now
Jul 3 2012,positive,it was fun to watch if only it were more original and less predictable
Jul 3 2012,positive,let us sit here and sum up this movie for a second directed by joss whedon has robert downing jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris helmsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner cobie smulders gwyneth paltrow and samuel l jackson who play the characters of iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow hawkeye the hottie from how i met your mother and nick fury all of which come together to mess up some aliens whilst having a good solid plot having great humor sit on the edge of your seat action and some intense drama practically makes the perfect movie so if youre reading this because youre unsure than youre crazy because it doesnt get to much better than this
Jul 3 2012,positive,cant wait for part two great cast and a director who actually likes comic books
Jul 3 2012,positive,one fun ride to next very entertaining chemistry between characters
Jul 3 2012,positive,the movie seemed to take too long to get all of the superheroes together  the ending felt rushed  on the other hand captain america has a new found respect from me  mark ruffalo was great as bruce bannerthe hulk
Jul 3 2012,positive,its not as perfect as some people might suggest  mostly due to the slower pace that the movie jogs at for the first half but the dialog crackles with life and the battles especially the final one is absolutely awesome theres just no other way to say it
Jul 3 2012,positive,the film is first rate with a great cast and excellent visuals the previous films established the characters so time didnt need to be wasted reintroducing the characters much like james bond we start with action and stop only to plan for the next event the scope is epic enough to warrant a team of people rather than an episode any single member could handle a common fault in many justice league stories where superman dominated all joss whedon a fan with strong credentials in the comic world hits the notes right he introduces the threat then begins assembling the team however teams in the marvel world rarely work harmoniously at the beginning they test each other argue trade barbs but when it counts they get down to business this truly felt like the comic brought to life much as richard donners superman had before and christopher nolans batman had more recently its not a perfect film though there are a few to many convenient moments like the scientist unconsciously building a failsafe into the dimensional gateway hawkeye and black widow are still underdeveloped as they had little more than cameos in the previous films dialogue suggests a history but they are still mostly cyphers to nonfans many character moments ended up on the cutting room floor due to time constraints so we dont really get to experience captain america struggling with an unfamiliar world in a related note cap never really sounds like someone from the 40s hopefully sequels will be able to explore these things more and the film series can mature beyond just an action spectacle as the comics did whedon and the cast  crew certainly gave a foundation on which to buildthere are many moments to enjoy from whedons trademark wisecracking dialogue to tom hiddlestons layered villain to the revelation of shield as more than just a glorified marvel fbi there are some excellent quiet moments in all of the thunder and we see the human costs of the battle which is too often missing from these things in the end the film earns its success heres hoping that marvel wont rest on that success and try to venture into some of their other books especially those that dont revolve around superheroes the company produced some fine western and scifi characters not to mention someone needs to do a howard the duck film that is as good as the comic was
Jul 3 2012,positive,great movie enjoyed very much and it had some very funny moments between the super heros
Jul 3 2012,positive,i did not know about this movie until i saw the trailer after viewing the trailer i was not interested i simply saw this movie based on the ratings that it received i was not obsessed with this movie like millions of others it was a great action film with a decent plot the hulk is unstoppable he could have been the only hero in this movie i will probably buy this movie batman dark knight rises comes out later this month it will blow this movie away
Jul 3 2012,positive,best movie of 2012 so far there are amazingly hilarious jokes and it is very cool
Jul 3 2012,positive,i walked into the theater without any knowledge of the characters or prior story lines and loved the movie  
Jul 3 2012,positive,best action movie ever
Jul 3 2012,positive,entertaining and action filled
Jul 3 2012,positive,if you did not grow up with these superheroes this is an ok watch otherwise youll likely love it
Jul 3 2012,positive,not bad all characters done well except captain america goofy outfit and that actor is not good fit to play super soldier wwii vet
Jul 3 2012,positive,iron man makes the best jokes marvel couldve done better though
Jul 3 2012,positive,my favorite superhero movie of all time perfect in every way
Jul 3 2012,positive,this was a great movie when it comes to entertainment one thing that dragged the movie down for me was that their were some cheesy lines but besides that this movie is a  ton of fun to watch with your friends
Jul 3 2012,positive,you dont have to care about any of these characters to enjoy this movie better than i expected and i expected a lot sad that movies like madeas wp have a higher box office revenue it shows how shallow and clueless most of america is
Jul 3 2012,positive,best superhero movie everso far
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie was greeat so good i saw it twice

Jul 3 2012,positive,the best fucken movie ever
Jul 3 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever even the dark knight cant compare to the nonstop fantasy action in this amazing thriller
Jul 3 2012,positive,joss whedon expertly meshes four movie franchises together to make a film that spends ample time on each of its characters even as it delivers huge amounts of action the avengers is humorously scripted and immensely entertaining
Jul 3 2012,positive,though it may not be as deep or philosophical as the dark knight this movie is quite possibly the greatest superhero flick ever made
Jul 3 2012,positive,d movie well its marvelous
Jul 3 2012,positive,awesome storylines action and acting
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie is awesome it has everything you need in it and alot of good actors its the perfect combination

Jul 3 2012,positive,best comic book movie so far
Jul 3 2012,positive,what a glorious load of fun
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie was good but i think it has more hype then it really deserves  i cant wait for the dark knight to just crush on this movie
Jul 3 2012,positive,great thrill ride good script
Jul 3 2012,positive,that man is playing galaga he didnt think wed notice but we did
Jul 3 2012,positive,robert downey jr can save many movies hes hilarious and his characters are seemingly always witty in one form or another it was nice to see the other actors pull their weight as well as far as a superhero movie is concerned this fit the bill in an age where the superhero genre has rapidly expanded it is good to see a film that is able to take many superheros and still manage to find time for all of them some of the special effects were a bit over the top and there were a few acting mishaps but all in all this was a fun movie to watch
Jul 3 2012,negative,first one and half hour boring as hell
Jul 3 2012,positive,a blast true hollywood summer flick
Jul 3 2012,positive,wonderful want to see more
Jul 3 2012,positive,it was a wonderful movie i would love to see it again best superhero movie ever definitely worth the price of admission i cant wait for it to come out on dvd so i can buy it
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie is awesome
Jul 3 2012,positive,simple as this joss whedon has to do ever marvel movie from now on it was damn near perfect
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie was awsome im definitely getting it
Jul 3 2012,positive,this movie lived up to the unprecedented build up marvel in the previous individual superhero movies it had action seamless storytelling great lines and a credible cast of actors and the hulk was the breakout star of the movie
Jul 3 2012,positive,seen it twice and wouldnt mind watching it hundreds of more times
Jul 3 2012,positive,best super hero movie ever
Jul 2 2012,positive,awesome threedimensionally so in imax 3d  love the new hulk mr ruffalo
Jul 2 2012,positive,im not a big superhero action movie fan that being said this one was up there with wolverine but not quite dark knight
Jul 2 2012,positive,best marvel movie ive ever seen seriously it was quite fantastic i really cannot wait till phase 2 d i left one star off because i cannot stand mark ruffalo please for the love of god bring back edward norton or at least a good actor for that matter
Jul 2 2012,positive,5 stars what else is there to say the action and all the one liners made this movie one of the best films this year
Jul 2 2012,positive,great there are no words to explain how much i loved it
Jul 2 2012,positive,boom  bang  crash  smash  boomityboom crash bangbang  oh and three hot men mark ruffalo jeremy renner and robert downey jr
Jul 2 2012,neutral,popcorn movie the villains some random aliens what the hell the avengers have a few good villains and they pick bullshit like that loki okay he had to be there then they reveal the big bad after the credits a big bad that the general populous has no idea who he is lame
Jul 2 2012,positive,great movie a must see
Jul 2 2012,positive,one of the best comic book movies ive ever watched
Jul 2 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever made
Jul 2 2012,positive,theres reasons why most directors dont want to attempt something like this but josh weddon took the idea and transformed it into an amazing experience
Jul 2 2012,positive,great movie for all ages awesome
Jul 2 2012,positive,what a great movie suspenseful and funny it had my attention the whole way through
Jul 2 2012,positive,overrated  does not deserve rts 93 rating  time to get different reviewers to rely upon  and yes i did see it on the big screen quite a deluxe theatre in fact  the script is superior to most superhero movies i grant  but that isnt really saying all that much is it  lots of stars appear here but barely get used  why for example is gweneth paltrow stooping to this material  oh because of the million dollar paycheck excuse me  the main players are mainly lame  the whole story is overblown and uninteresting  the highpriced special effects arent even especially good  the hulk special effects are particularly bad  the black widow fight scenes are so bad the editor just offers up a blur of quick cuts  apparently scarlett jahansson couldnt or wouldnt learn how to even put up a semblance of fight moves  i dont know why im so generous as to give this 3 stars out of 5  i guess because the other superhero movies are even worse
Jul 2 2012,positive,one of the most overrated movies ever and by the standards set by joss whedon in his previous films this sucks the low budget internet film dr horrible was better as a fan of the comic i was disappointed with its pure lack of originality and near nonexistent and lazy story this film is also the subject of poor editing by having the most mistakes in a film this year 15 and a poor 3d conversion the 30 second ending reveal of thanos was more exciting then the rest of the film overall a huge dissapointment
Jul 2 2012,positive,marvels the avengers  continues the longliving hype of superhero films but was too long the film left me defiantly hyped for the next film the avengers 2 but there is no way im going to be able to sit through it again as it was one of those fantastic movies that you love but can not sit through again it also lagged in a few spots but  was overall filled with enough action comedy and a fantastic castcrew to diffuse the small sizzles of it being too long and a bit laggish
Jul 2 2012,positive,simply great funny dramatic beautiful and thrilling i left this movie with great satisfaction you will feel like the movie touched on each genre needed to make an amazing movie well done
Jul 2 2012,positive,loud and funny fun for all
Jul 2 2012,positive,it will be hard to top this actionpacked epic it is definitely the best summer blockbuster so far great performances story lines special effects action sequences and a sense of humor to go along with that mix all those ingredients together and you have yourself the recipe for an exceptional motion picture achievement that is sure to win the approval of both audiences and movie critics alike my only complaint is that the pacing is a little slow at times but once the action takes off it soars to extraordinary heights easily the most fun you will have at the movies this summer
Jul 2 2012,positive,still dont get what all the fuss is about but it was a decent superhero movie
Jul 2 2012,positive,ive seen it its awesome
Jul 2 2012,positive,i am unsure if i am just getting old for these movies or they all look the sameor something  however this movie is well put together and features outstanding performances by downey jr and the hulk entirely cgi  but spectacular  could have been better could have been worse
Jul 2 2012,positive,most action packed marvel movie to date cant wait for the sequel
Jul 2 2012,positive,loved loved this movie
Jul 2 2012,positive,loved this movie ed especially in 3d
Jul 2 2012,positive,they should have called it the hulkiron man show
Jul 2 2012,positive,totally loved it all out barnstormer  it was great to watch action  comedic and beautiful to look at sj u know the bit and has a big green mother fucker smashing up everything in sight roll on blu ray  another great comic book production jamesboz23
Jul 2 2012,negative,one of the worst films ive seen this year its annoying oneliner setups are cringeworthy to say the least and though whedon tries his very best to provide black widow hulk and hawkeye with brand new and emotional backstories these moments are so fleeting and uninvolved in the plot that you will find yourself laughing out loud at them that said the only developed character in the entire film is tony stark but thats only because hes the only hero of the bunch that had an even slightly good solo movie though i try my very best to forget the horrendous second effort that is iron man 2
Jul 2 2012,positive,the hulkis the best dont talk with him or might have a really bad day dont take my word for it just ask loki hahaha
Jul 2 2012,positive,thoroughly entertaining
Jul 2 2012,positive,i am a comic book fan this movie was great only down side for me was the antagonist of the film and the lack of information on them
Jul 2 2012,positive,very well done i was thoroughly entertained and very impressed with mark ruffalos portrayal of bruce bannerhulk stole the show in a hand full of scenes good story line with huge potentials for the future i hope they can keep it up
Jul 2 2012,positive,this is the movie for the summer of 2012
Jul 2 2012,positive,the definition of the sum is greater than any 1 of its parts  there is no better individual character marvel movie this is the reason why adults still read comics wanting the next epic story
Jul 2 2012,positive,this is a really well made superhero movie it was well written and had an amazing cast with great chemistry
Jul 2 2012,positive,i have seen this movie more time in the theatre than any other movie ever and it still get better with each and every viewing highest recommendation
Jul 2 2012,positive,its marvels answer to the dark knight its as though joss whedon is asking christopher nolan why so serious  11  2
Jul 2 2012,positive,loved it deserves every bit of praise its recieved
Jul 2 2012,positive,best movie of the year hands down hulk smashed in too many ways he basicly made the action  humor but everyone one of the avengers shinedwaiting on the black panther comeon marvel
Jul 2 2012,positive,this is easily and with out a doubt my most favorite movie ever its got everything and is for everybody
Jul 2 2012,positive,in contrast to the film focused on one or two characters the filmchoir gives several players about the same screen time and importance dramatic this format is more common on television as it ensures the writers time to work alone each character per episode  although it has very little experience in film as a director joss whedon knows very well how to work multiple players on the small screen in the series he created like buffy  the vampire slayer angel and firefly whedon fantastic universes explored from the point of view of different guides but always keeping the focus on one main story line his choice for the first major merger series in theaters in the avengers  the avengers 2012 therefore could not have been more inspired  with the tv experience even under the short time of the commercial hollywood productions the director  who also worked on the screenplay for the film  he knew how to manage the holdings of each of its superprotagonistas giving them specific functions within the plot the avengers joins this ability the fact that whedon is a huge nerd knows each of his players and travels with ease through the universe of superheroes it are for example the first arc of a series of the most exciting comic mutant marvel surprising the xmen  reading the comic it is easy to understand how he landed the coveted job in the overproduction of marvel studios everything was there the balance between the time of each hero the wild action and imaginative the central story that mixes human relations and a deadly challenge and moments of pure passion nerd obviously there was doubt that whedon could take his experience in tv and comics to film since the only film that had driven so far was serenity 2005 a big screen adaptation of the series firefly  fortunately the writer experienced proved to the challenge although it is somewhat aesthetically pasteurized not differing from any other bigbudget blockbuster of the last decade the avengers is perfeitinho within their pretensions it is after all a filmão marvel  and as such follows five decades  tradition of the house of ideas it is still well a modernized version of the first adventure of the avengers 1963 her lone heroes come together  after a misunderstanding generated by the inevitable conflict of egos that came great beings  to face a common threat engendered by the handler  greedy and unscrupulous villain loki  in spirit the film is identical to the comic book created by stan lee and jack kirby with passionate fans and whedon as president of marvel kevin feige in command there could even be different it is curious as agent coulson  a character created specifically for the film played by clark gregg  is a way for these executives  directors  fans put there in the middle of the action coulson who reveals himself a nerd is fundamental in the union of the avengers as were whedon and feige  for those like me grew up reading these stories and follows the marvel universe as a marriage of decades the good bad and bad times so see the meeting of the franchise iron man thor captain america and hulk is a will performed and see it done well a delight specific scenes appeal to emotion memory and help to reveal without any effort small problems as the first act which is rather dragged in comparison to the explosive climax and superelaborado michael bay could learn a lesson here on how to concatenate characters and action focuses separate into a cohesive whole  but even in the long sequences in which little happens plot and lump together a bit also a tradition of stan lee the most verbose of all comic there is nothing to enjoy like robert downey jr the glue that binds the group on the scene in better interactions with the cast especially newcomer mark ruffalo in the series discussions between the two men tony stark and bruce banner and between him and tom hiddleston as loki fantastic and much more at ease than in thor are as fun as the invasion of alien armada that afflicts new york at the end  a wellstructured action film which explores the strengths of all the cast and gives the fan  or novice reader who knew that universe in the cinema  just expected the avengers  the avengers now comes as another milestone in the celebrated history of marvel
Jul 2 2012,positive,i wasnt really into superheroes but i saw this movie and i loved it 
Jul 2 2012,positive,oh my gosh i love this movie its amazing the only thing i hated about it is that the scenes had lots of flashing and my eyes started hurting a bit
Jul 2 2012,positive,amazing movie one of the best movies i have ever seen i seriously recommend it
Jul 2 2012,positive,saw it twice and still loved it best superhero movie since the dark night probably tied with it
Jul 2 2012,positive,im just glad that this a super hero movie with an actual plot
Jul 2 2012,positive,amazing film truly amazing
Jul 2 2012,positive,one of my top three movies of all time
Jul 2 2012,positive,good movie great action some jokes here and there but there were some dry part where my brain fell asleep or i started to think about getting a refill on my sodapop corn but it picks back up over all good movie
Jul 2 2012,positive,awesome fun exciting great movie
Jul 2 2012,positive,go to see it now if you want to get blown away
Jul 2 2012,positive,not only was it action packed but it had some comedy i loved it
Jul 2 2012,positive,âtmâtmâtm it i watch all movies like this  am never disappointed cuz comic book characters in a movie what more could you ask for hands down âtmâtmâtm it  
Jul 2 2012,positive,slow start but grabbed my attention and i loved it
Jul 2 2012,positive,single greatest superhero movie of all time  although i had been counting down to this movie since the aftercredits scene of the first avenger i admit i was worried about whether or not it could be done  the idea of taking together 4 separate movie franchises several exceptionally different characters and an ensemble cast of superstars and bringing it all together under one giant superhero blockbuster was certainly a bold one  however marvel made the brilliant choice of making joss whedon the director and thus succeeded in this endeavor   although iron man was probably the main appeal for most people who went to see the movie joss did a good job making sure avengers didnt become iron man 3  each hero had his or her own badass moments and chances to shine  robert downey jr yet again disappointed no one with his portrayal of the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist tony stark  his wittiness and arrogant personality blend to create a charm that americans cant seem to get enough of  this can be seen offscreen as well because robert downey is tony stark  no one else could have done it  chris evans was great as the patriotic soldier lost in time  he was very believable as the principled and brave leader of the super hero squad  chris hemsworth both through his physical stature and through his acting brought thor to life yet again  hemsworth is one of my favorite actors these days and a rising star    out of all the brilliant actors however mark ruffalo as the hulk and tom hiddleston as loki really stole the show  even though i was a huge fan of ed norton ruffalo took the character of the hulk to the next level  out of all the actors who played the character ruffalo matched the character perfectly  whereas i thought erica bana in the first hulk movie was too manly to play bruce banner and ed norton was a bit wimpy ruffalo was a combination of both  tom hiddleston did a great job as loki because despite his terrible actions you couldnt help but feel bad for how he wound up    despite already having built and developed each main character in their respective preceding films the avengers still made sure viewers could understand what drove each character and made them relatable to viewers  if done incorrectly the avengers could easily have been just 2 hours and 20 mins of comic book characters smashing each other and blowing stuff up  however joss brought his vision to life with great depth    the special effects and action scenes were simply amazing  the avengers fully exceeded my expectations of the action sequences  each hero shared a fight scene with another which was very cool  3d wasnt much different from the 2d version though at least in my opinion    the dialogue of the avengers was hilarious  this was by far the funniest superhero or action movie that ive ever seen  leave it to joss to insert comedy into lifeordeath situations in a fight to save humanity  the banter between the heroes was priceless  no part of the movie was cheesy either which was a very important aspect  on comic books its one thing but on film its another  the fact that they were able to have four superheroes each in different colorful costumes to stand together in a frame without taking away from the believably was a great feat  best movie of the year thus far  i dont see how dark knight rises will be able to top this
Jul 2 2012,positive,best movie of the early summer
Jul 2 2012,positive,this movie lived up to the unprecedented build up marvel in the previous individual superhero movies it had action seamless storytelling great lines and a credible cast of actors and the hulk was the breakout star of the movie

Jul 1 2012,positive,omg new top box office record right here this movie brought what a movie is truly about back into our lives i applaud the makers and everyone who worked on the perfect movie for me and anyone just fantastic the only thing that could have made it better would be the addition of spiderman thats it other than that i was overly impressed i expected it to be great but not over the top good actors amazing script amazing on the edge of my seat the entire time breath taking movie a must see for everyone even superhero haterz theaters againim on my way dvd too far away

Jul 1 2012,positive,i loved this movie it had great action scenes that looked as realistic as possible also the script writing by joss whedon is phenomenal he knew how to keep the characters heroic and yet full of faults it was interesting to see the characters from different movies interacting with each other i also loved the villain loki

Jul 1 2012,positive,best movie of the year no arguments yet

Jul 1 2012,positive,absolutely amazing as close to perfect as a movie can get  joss whedon is a complete genius
Jul 1 2012,positive,couldnt of asked for more superheroes comedy and the like of scarlett johanson all combine for a action packed well told superhero style action blockbuster with plenty of laughs

Jul 1 2012,positive,favorite movie of the year so far or ever
Jul 1 2012,positive,while its certainly not the best film of the year or even the best superhero film for that matter marvels the avengers proves to be a fun campy movie where fun engaging action makes up for the mediocre plotline
Jul 1 2012,positive,chris hemsworth is so dreamy dem muscles
Jul 1 2012,negative,too much over the top action and special effects the story was predictable and followed almost the same plot line of the first transformers a special item the that everyone wants and a huge fight scene at the end blah blah boring the scenes with the hulk made the movie bearable
Jul 1 2012,neutral,could have been so much better when i think of the first superman movie i saw as a kid back in the 70s with christopher reeve in it  it didnt matter the special effects were pants  it had a good story and made you care what happened the avengers doesnt 
Jul 1 2012,positive,great movie because of this marvel studios has about 4 years of sequels prequels and endings i mean they got iron man 3 captain america 2  3 thor 2  3 the incredible hulk 2  3 they can make a movie based on halkeye but not on black widow so yeah good movie
Jul 1 2012,positive,great awesome movie love it
Jul 1 2012,negative,more over hyped cgi rubbish from hollywoods fascination of comic book adaptations on a serious note hasnt this whole idea been milked to the death put a 12a on it and attract the kids with the big explosions sadly it works the plot is crap and way too predictable but hey america saves the day just for a change
Jul 1 2012,positive,its very exciting and funny
Jul 1 2012,positive,seen it 3 times in theaters best super hero movie to date do not miss out in theaters it is the best

Jul 1 2012,positive,great comicbook fun and what a buildup
Jul 1 2012,positive,really cool having all the heroes together was great the effects were bitchin and the story was interesting this will be one for the home library
Jul 1 2012,positive,it was 2 funny n good
Jul 1 2012,positive,possibly the most fun time i have had at the movies so far this year but that could also be the fact that i sat next to huge hulk fans and everytime he apeared on screen they squealed in delight  marvels the avengers surprised me and i enjoyed it enough to see it twice
Jul 1 2012,positive,the avengers is an amazing movie  from start to finish i was entertained  the cg effects looked as real as anything i have seen  it is a movie that you can walk into with out seeing a single one of the others and still follow along  though seeing the others will help you out a great deal  i did have 1 thing i was wondering throughtout the movie how did thor get back to earth  also not casting edward norton to reprise his role was imo the only mistake with this movie  i would love to only give it 4 stars out of 5 but the over all move experiance was so good i have to give it 5 out of 5  make sure and sit through the entire set of credits as there is not 1 but 2 stingers at the end
Jul 1 2012,positive,they did such a good job all around perfect cast perfect director perfect script perfect soundtrack just perfect
Jul 1 2012,positive,undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2012 exciting entertaining and a whole lotta eye candy cant complain good mix for an awesome marvel movie 
Jul 1 2012,positive,i loved it cause im a fan of these superheros and having them all together  i wouldnt call it spectacular but very good  how can i not love seeing these guys in action the hulk rocks  the actors bring life to the characters  for people who are not fans of this genre they may find it long and mediocreaverage  special effects yes very good
Jul 1 2012,positive,awesome   hope theres a second one
Jul 1 2012,positive,best summer action movie ever
Jul 1 2012,positive,visual effects extravaganza one thing i was expecting going into the avengers was a lack of character development you often run into this when you have so many lead characters the expendables i was wrong it balanced out really well and for any fanboy this was a great marvel film
Jul 1 2012,positive,super hero movies dont get any better than this
Jul 1 2012,positive,very funny and packed full of action i really enjoyed the movie and will deff go see it again

Jul 1 2012,positive,lots of action and fighting
Jul 1 2012,positive,entertaining but overrated slow start could have used a better villain prefer xmen
Jul 1 2012,positive,faultless other than it wasnt long enough
Jul 1 2012,positive,an ordinary superhero movie nothing really special
Jul 1 2012,positive,being an amazing film as the final product resulted in the idea of this being a movie sounds like a train wreck at first but due to a lot of talented writing and up beat comedy in between the serious dialogue and well choreographed action sequences that make you shout out to michael bay this is how you do it you stupid f avengers is a great movie a bit rushed near the end and a lot of convenient plot devices in between but you could say the same for batman and his belt or superman and his ability to go back in time so great movie if you havent seen it go out asap or rent it when the dvd comes out
Jul 1 2012,positive,perfect superhero movie
Jul 1 2012,positive,great family movie we all wanted to go again and again and againagain
Jul 1 2012,positive,saw this in 3d at serria vista  mall on tuesday this is a must see if not then a must buy on your list

Jun 30 2012,positive,the only thing wrong with this movie is that it had to end  bring on iron man 3 and the rest of them
Jun 30 2012,negative,fair at best kitschy at worst the avengers is overhyped and silly
Jun 30 2012,positive,best movie of the year by far better than all the individual movies of all the separate characters and thats a bold statement
Jun 30 2012,positive,it wasnt very interesting in the beginning but the last half was pretty cool
Jun 30 2012,positive,this shows great movies can be like if you take your time to make them with such a big cast this movie gives each character hisher own chance to shine great action great humor and an overall great movie
Jun 30 2012,positive,the only thing i can say is what took me so darn long to go see the movie in the first place  and i must say it was a delight to see the man of green there to make his appearancei love the way he shakes things up a bit

Jun 30 2012,positive,truly breathtaking a great blend of action humor and scifi the final action sequence is dazzling the special effects are flawless and hook you to the screen i just thought the script had a bit too much science and scifi talk for the people who dont understand it so much but well it makes the movie more credible
Jun 30 2012,positive,hulk is fantastic  both green and human  good choice with the actor  theyre all great really really liked this film a lot
Jun 30 2012,positive,agent dies sad but great

Jun 30 2012,positive,very very good movie had all the important stuff comedy drama action and a little romance to spice things up gotta love pepper my only reservation is the use of thor for the god of thunder he was pretty downplayed where captain america could have been toned down several notches if you ask me
Jun 30 2012,positive,one of my now all time favourites that is all i need to say
Jun 30 2012,positive,the perfect director  balanced movie with perfect delivery for such a big time movie  eagerly anticipate thanos

Jun 30 2012,positive,wanna know something bout me im a huge comic book fanboy ever since i was atleast 5 years old i was immersed into comic book culture for god sakes when little kids were watching big comfy couch i was watching batman or spawn or spiderman this film is what happens when you build up your characters in seperate dimensions combine them together and face a common threat you get a billion dollar grossing film and one of the best comic book films ever made marvel has its magnum opus dc your move
Jun 30 2012,positive,awesome looking forward to the sequel

Jun 30 2012,positive,great movie im utterly impressed
Jun 30 2012,positive,best action movie of 2012so far
Jun 30 2012,positive,the avengers so far is the best of the marvel superhero movies  director joss whedon has done a masterful job in corralling a stellar cast lead by robert downey jr tony starkiron man chris evans captain america chris hemsworth thor scarlett johansson natasha romanoffblack widow  however the additions of mark ruffalo bruce bannerhulk and jeremy renner clint bartonhawkeye bring together the avengers as a complete unit although be it a dysfunctional one at first but when they come together they are an unstoppable force  tom hiddleston as loki brings a wonderful performance as the main villain and he sucks you into the movie you donâtmt know if heâtms going have a change of heart or if heâtms going to cut it out  to use a quote from the film âhis minds like a bag of cats you can smell crazy on himâ   the script penned by joss whedon and zak penn was so entertaining that non comic book fans would enjoy it  there are so many memorable lines that youâtmll find yourself quoting them a lot to wrap this up the avengers by far is a very good filmno  itâtms a great film itâtms a good time at the movies so our recommendation is see it full price and if you missed it in imax 3d thatâtms the best way to see it in the 3d format otherwise see it in 2d digital and see it more than once

Jun 30 2012,positive,th action sequences are at the max in marvels the avengers and joss whedon has put together a script that is as surprisingly smart and clever as it is entertaining and occasionally hilarious the avengers takes the successes of each of its lead ins and expands on each storyline just enough to make the best entry in a long line of marvel films
Jun 30 2012,positive,the best movie in the world no movie can ever top this this movie was really amazing

Jun 29 2012,positive,this movie is nothing like nolans superhero films this movie is a fun wacky ride through the world of heroics backed up by solid acting performances by rdj both chris evans and hemsworth and tom hiddleston now mark ruffalo was good but hes no ed norton and norton portrays him much much better still an enjoyable film truly a great film
Jun 29 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this but then again i really enjoy anything with robert downey jr
Jun 29 2012,positive,a masterful movie worth every bit of the hype leading up to it since the release of iron man  all of the witty humor from each movie is combined perfectly into this single movie as well  not only extremely well written and performed but the funniest movie i have ever seen that was not classified primarily under the comedy genre  probably the most entertaining movie i have ever seen
Jun 29 2012,positive,worth watching just for the 3d effects but forget about the story line

Jun 29 2012,positive,really a nice movie
Jun 29 2012,positive,holy shit the movie that has been in the making for years delivered perfectly every superhero except hawkeye and black widow already had their own movie going into this and even they had cameos so in the end it felt like an epic collaboration of everyone from these big movies coming together in one ill go ahead and call this one of the best superhero movies of all time
Jun 29 2012,positive,i was so worried about this film  there were 100 ways for this film to fail but it worked out perfectly for one reason joss whedon  leave it to a scifi fanboy to make sure the greatest team of superheroes had a great movie  the only reason im not giving this film 5 stars is because it took alittle long to get going  the openning scene took way too long and understandably they had to introduce each hero  other then that its a great script the acting is awesome and the overall film was a fun experiance  its nothing groundbreaking but its everything i wanted transformers to be  why not reboot that and let joss whedon write and direct it  in fact if studios want to reboot anything then just give it to joss whedon  this has been a psa for everyone in hollywood favorite avenger hulk
Jun 29 2012,negative,yes the visuals are great and yes it has a lot of cool superheroes but the story is weak and the dialogue is cheesy unfunny and just plain bad the movie has no emotion and no meaning it was one of the most over hyped and irratating movies i have ever had the displeasure of seeing
Jun 29 2012,positive,totally worth every penny
Jun 29 2012,positive,me and myfamily love it
Jun 29 2012,positive,robert downey jr saved it
Jun 29 2012,positive,this movie was the bomb diggity  it made me feel 15 years old again
Jun 29 2012,positive,i like superheroes and action delivers on both fronts
Jun 29 2012,positive,despite tearyeyed performances by the majority of the cast in the vein of tobey maguire the avengers is a solid superhero mashup that isnt bogged down with origin stories for once
Jun 29 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive watched since avatar was a phenomenal adventure highly recommend to those who want to watch a great story with awesome graphic effects and action
Jun 29 2012,positive,grandiose and ambitious joss whedons the avengers raises the stakes for this seasons blockbuster showdown for supremacy its lighthearted feel and strategically placed humor mingles well amongst the urgent dire undertones while a spectacle of cgi delights promise for one behemoth of a climax still for all of its pleasures the over commitment to hollow character interactions and heavily uneven acting stay this from reaching the astronomic heights that it no doubt set out for        humanity is threatened when an alien named loki begins to execute his plan of dominance over the earth when this threat is discovered the leader of shield nick fury attempts to bring together a team of heroes to oppose the hostile take over with time running out the team of avengers must learn to cooperate and stand together as one if there is any hope of repelling the forces that aim to dominate the world they love     the practically unprecedented attempt to include such a vast amount of principle heroes into one movie warrants kudos alone especially given that most had previously boasted their own feature films whedon did a good job spreading out camera time evenly between the oversized cache affording them the opportunity to shine amongst their peers unfortunately this time wasnt used nearly as efficiently as it should have been as most scenes gave in to lapses of corny exchanges and yawnful attempts by characters to boast their superiority over one another if used sparsely it may have been a welcome relief from the severity of the story line but instead the act became tiresome during pivotal points that should have instead been building intensity into the climax    each avenger had their moments but there is a notable disparity amongst them as the movie progressed  downys iron man and ruffalos hulk for example enjoyed the best chemistry as a duo by far due to their complicated personas and skilled actors their wit and sarcasm dimmed the crowd pleasing attributes of the remainder of the cast to the point where they felt muted at times because of this the struggle of piecing together such a robust character field together in an equally beneficial way became apparent as some simply were not as effective in a group as they were when flying solo     for size and scale alone one could argue that the the avengers boasts one of the best climaxes in comic book movie history the sense of urgency and special effects bombard you at every turn as the resolution remains cloaked long enough to keep you anticipating how the day will be saved given the extended run time the script intertwines a clever mixture of intensity and humor that keep the film neither from becoming kooky or taking itself too seriously every player hero and villain alike fit into their niche just in time to deliver an ending fitting of a blockbuster movie and in true fashion of its genre the credits give a glimpse to where the inevitable sequel will be taking us next      given the uncharted territory in which this film explores and the pitfalls of such an endeavor i applaud it for succeeding more than it failed i trust that now with a canvas to look back upon and touch up that the next installment will be a marked improvement there was a lot to introduce here and being able to reach out to audiences who have seen the previous films in which these characters spawned and those who havent is a difficult task indeed    rating 710
Jun 29 2012,positive,best movie of the year do i dare say even the best movie of the decade  avengers will keep you on the edge of your seats craving for more

Jun 29 2012,positive,i loved it loved it loved it
Jun 29 2012,positive,my favorite parts were almost all about hulk played by mark ruffalo  his hulk the character played before by eric bana and edward norton was different because itâtms seriously comedic i laughed when he punched thor when they landed side by side when he woke up ironman by his loud growl when he smashed the giant fish like space ship when dr bruce banner hulkâtms human alterego arrived in the battle area by his rusty scooter and when he alternately tosses loki tom hiddleston  for the first time heâtms not the lost and helpless hero heâtms funny and in control

Jun 29 2012,positive,loved it although i prefer the previous  hulk then the new one
Jun 29 2012,positive,i liked it a wellmade movie partially undone by its shallow dialogue cheesy alien invasion premise and inexplicably resolved problems
Jun 29 2012,positive,already i can say that this movie will have no rival for the throne of summer blockbuster
Jun 29 2012,positive,words cannot describe just how perfect and spectacular an adaption this is joss whedon and his fantastic ensemble cast have crafted my favorite superhero movie nay movie ever funny chilling emotional and with plenty of spectacular action and cgi with all the hype they had dared not mess up but they went above and beyond my expectations

Jun 28 2012,positive,this movie is amazingthough unfortunately spiderman wasnt in the movie
Jun 28 2012,positive,great movie wellwritten kudos to whedon and threaded together so well that its hard to distinguish who the true icon is bit of advice for a potential sequel though avoid the repetitve alien invasion on earth which was kind of implied when all was said and done and concieve an idea that will bring these heroes along with some expected newcomers back to the forefront in stride
Jun 28 2012,positive,the avengers is big  big heroes big set piecesall as designed  its clearly the most fun of the marvel films with enough comedic moments between the characters to keep the atmosphere light most of the  time  of the main actorsand there are about eight of them plus a slew of supporting characterschris evans as captain america is the most bland  hes never quite sure about how to bring off the character like he did in his standalone film last year  robert downey jr is hands down the best actor in the film getting more than his share of one liners and moments  jeremy renner and scarlett johansson almost get the short end of the stick because they arent a list characters  the film itself packs in a lot of information into a relatively short amount of time but tries to reintroduce each of these characters on their own early on  the earlier films in the canon arent required viewing but it sure helps to know the ins and outs of the universe  the story  its standard heroes saving the world type stuff  the avengers though is fun just like it should be  and when captain americas orders to hulk are hulk smash well you know the shit is about to hit the fan  in a good way  when does avengers 2 come out
Jun 28 2012,positive,i had a boyish smile through the whole film even if i did see it 4 times

Jun 28 2012,positive,i saw this a few times and enjoyed it every time
Jun 28 2012,positive,i actually wanna watch it again
Jun 28 2012,positive,as a big joss whedon fan and a fan of super hero movies i knew this would be  a winner    its a match made in heaven downey jrs delivery coupled with whedons writing prowess well all know the basis of a great super hero movie ironman and spiderman 2 taught us that and the avengers is in the same ball park but with crisper dialogue and a rather interesting narrative theres rarely a dull moment with only the middle act sagging in parts downey is brilliant as always as is new boy mark ruffalo     the last hour or so are everything i expected from this film the use of character team work and expertly choreographed action scenes it didnt knock ironman of my no1 superhero movie but this came damn close
Jun 28 2012,positive,really good action just thought it was long
Jun 28 2012,positive,awesome action packed adventure a must see for anyone who likes comics

Jun 28 2012,positive,this is one of the best comic book movies i have seen in a while captain america is my man and chris evans did that part justice
Jun 28 2012,positive,action packed from start to finish with superb acting and visuals throughout the humour adds to the thrill of the movie and is not overdone its the avengers what more do you want whedon did an excellent jod cant wait to see what he does next

Jun 28 2012,positive,was worth the purchase but not as good as some claim
Jun 28 2012,positive,loved it it was a little cheesy in some parts but i still really enjoyed it
Jun 28 2012,negative,this blockbuster did not live up to its hype yes there are amazing visual effects and really shows the human side of the heroes but it really doesnt do more than introduce the heroes bringing them all to a predictable and boring battle with aliens much too easily defeated to be feared by the whole galaxy
Jun 28 2012,positive,greatest super hero movie thus far
Jun 28 2012,positive,this film is full of action from all the classic marvel films crammed into one place  never got bored and the story line storyline is quite easy to follow unlike some action films that loose track

Jun 28 2012,positive,i saw it and it was awesome its got all of your favorite heroes fighting as loki tries to rule the world with a legion of aliens the only small thing i dont like is that it was mainly just allout fighting
Jun 28 2012,neutral,criminally overrated
Jun 28 2012,positive,the movie was pretty awesome it was action packed and didnt give you a chance to look away the plot was clear and continuous and didnt leave any holes for questioning i have never been a big comic book guy but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie now i wait for dark knight
Jun 28 2012,positive,masterful  the avengers is something nobody will forget its a brilliantly put together movie in every way it manged to balance every character and give them all memerable moments the visuals are perfect the hulk just may be the most visualy perfect character to ever be brought on to the big screen after seeing this ive been reading marvel comics for over 10 years now and im relieved to say that watching the avengers was like waking up on christmas morning and seeing ten trees with eleven presents under each one a must see in every way for everyone
Jun 28 2012,positive,i thought it was awesome the first few minutes where slow for me then boom rockets you into excitement
Jun 28 2012,positive,now this movie was just totally epic  i liked everything about it and thats not something i say very often  i hope my boy joss whedon gets some longdeserved recognition out of this for a change  his other film this year cabin in the woods was pretty damned good too
Jun 28 2012,positive,best comic book movie after watchmen and the best hulk movie by far  although it reinforces my hate of hawkeye it continues the trend of making me like comic characters i dont really like in actual comics cpt america and thor which is pretty crazy
Jun 27 2012,positive,great movie marvel has done it again  lots of action and great special effects
Jun 27 2012,positive,just an amazing movie both action and humor on the edge of my seat from beginning to end depicted the relationship between the team very well

Jun 27 2012,positive,this movie was the bomb
Jun 27 2012,positive,a fun and energetic summer blockbuster thats actually pretty smart and witty
Jun 27 2012,positive,just awsome enough said
Jun 27 2012,positive,has to be the best movie ive seen in last 10 years  awesome job cant wait for next one
Jun 27 2012,positive,great movie to fit six stories into a film
Jun 27 2012,positive,amazing a must see
Jun 27 2012,positive,this movie was excellent i think it had almost everything i expected it to have but i did get confused with some scenes like when iron man and thor fought i thought that was foreshadowing as they might of used thors hammer on captain americas shield as some kind of weapon at the end but it turned out to be a useless scene i remember the movie having a couple of them but hey they were still pretty epic
Jun 27 2012,positive,the best and most awesome movie ive seen in my life
Jun 27 2012,positive,exciting from the beginning till the end wasnt bored at all
Jun 27 2012,positive,awesome need i say more
Jun 27 2012,neutral,idk i guess i just figured loki would be more badass especially after how it started

Jun 27 2012,negative,totally over hyped lacks an interesting story and its way too long
Jun 27 2012,positive,great movie cant wait to buy it
Jun 27 2012,positive,awesome some of the best marvel heroes all in one movie and they all get their fair share of screen time and are all equally focused on
Jun 27 2012,positive,im not sure if i was tired or if the action hero scenario is tired  to me it was just a mashup of all the other movies that came before  nothing truly original  good action though  i say give this movie a chance  you might like it for the pure action and the heroes that youve come to know and love
Jun 27 2012,positive,what a wonderful superhero romp an incredibly fun piece of cinema with lots of laughs and a great story to engage throughout
Jun 27 2012,positive,comedy actionadventure marvel three awesome qualities this movie has

Jun 27 2012,positive,whats not to like i wanted to see more
Jun 27 2012,positive,those of you who marvel  get it  at this stuff will really enjoy  while i am not a true follower of the super hero peeps i found this movie a lot of fun  robert downey jr is always fun to watch on screen  i recommend chaplin as well and mark ruffalo is awesome as bruce bannerthe hulk  its long but entertaining
Jun 27 2012,positive,great effects and comedy
Jun 27 2012,positive,hahah funny awesome go watch it
Jun 27 2012,positive,the best movie of all time
Jun 27 2012,positive,this is a good movie and also what you call an action comedy
Jun 27 2012,positive,though at first i viewed this movie as another hollywood fad to drive more comic book related films into the limelight i must admit im not an overly huge fan of comic book films  iron man and chris nolan directed ones excluded when i watched this i was pleasantly surprised to really quite enjoy this film its very cleverly done usually when you have this array of characters in one film it tends to either be a bit long and tedious whilst the director is trying to develop every characters individual emotional backdrop or it tends to do the opposite whereas one character has the main limelight and youre left wondering what is the point of having all the other characters there this one treads the background story lightly and works rather quite well obviously i check a lot of films out on flixster before i see them i try not to because its can change my opinion with this film it feels like it has been a tad bit overrated on my books like i said though im not a huge fan of comic book films but to me this film should be a standard of comic book films rather than treating it as a masterpiece the main reason why i feel like this is because there is nothing outstanding about it and there is nothing that is overtly different about it essentially if you have seen all the previous marvel films leading up to this it is a fairly similar theme and setting there is little extra to take from this film the only thing i can think of that kinda separates it apart is the freeforall royal rumble element to it where several superheros are beating the st out of each it though quite a satisfying viewing  first things first is that the acting in this is quite cool robert downey jr is awesome and smarmycocky best just like in the iron man film which i rate highly sometimes i feel like the reason why i enjoyed this film so much is because of downeys demanding presence and he is quite a central character as well he has a lot of screen time samuel jackson plays his role quite well albeit nothing too different from his usual samuel role theres a great quote in this film which highlights this no context needed nick fury  thats a stupidass plan give my team time i thought that was very typical samuel and rather funny i think though the rest of the avengers were played quite well and it felt seamless i give a lot credit for mark ruffalo as bruce banner i enjoyed edward nortons portrayal in the incredible hulk i was unsure what angle of which that mark ruffalo would approach it it worked rather nicely i thought as the calm but decidely instant moodswing manner that he had the villian in this loki was a very well portrayed by tom hiddleston he was a very cool hellbent character that seem to start of invincible and the end up laughable it was a nice villian character to have as most comic book villians tend to be laughable but insane at the very beginning and remain that way but with loki it was a nice and charismatic character to have one other point which i couldnt work out and id like people that comment me on this when i went to the cinema to see altough it was a cardboard cut out poster i saw that cobie smulders was in it and whilst watching the film she had quite a bit of screen time generally it would be a reaction shot or quick sentence or two speaking to nick fury it struck me a bit odd because her role was not that essential to film and it was not as if she was well known character i thought that the amount of screen time she had was a bit too much for her importance in the film it just struck as something that im not sure if it was just me that noticed or maybe she has got an important role i dont know  at the end of the day though what joss whedon has done with this film is very clever and although prehaps not a special film it is certainly a great film and shows that with a clever script direction and actors you can have a lot of characters in one film and not make a meal of it just look at the watchmen
Jun 27 2012,positive,this movie sews into the others like the armani suit of superhero movies
Jun 27 2012,positive,hulk smash pretty awesome and lots of laughs intertwined with the action
Jun 27 2012,positive,great comedy movie disguised as an action movie  overall very well done  joss whedon is amazing
Jun 27 2012,positive,this is a freaking kickass movie and i cant wait for the avengers 2
Jun 27 2012,positive,an entertaining movie with good effects in terms of plot not very original but a decent film
Jun 27 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie the first time i saw it as the fast paced enjoyable action was buoyed by the fantastic and funny script and really excellent casting choice for the characters of the avengers themselves however the second time around i was rather dissapointed as i realized how stupid the alien angle of the story was and really went from being apathetic towards loci to feeling like he was a pretty uninteresting villain that being said the truth lies somewhere in between and with these actors signed up for another avengers movie all that is required is a better villain and a more believablerelatable premise to make the second avengers movie a pantheon superhero movie
Jun 27 2012,positive,outstanding in action scenes and it has a lot of funny parts too it started the summer movies on a good note
Jun 27 2012,positive,a bit slow in the beginning after initial call to action there were a few bright moments and the ending was actionpacked but too many superheroes and no character development the whole thing reminded mo of one of those episodes of your favorite tv show where they spend the hour recapping the highlights of the past season youll watch it if theres nothing else on and its not a total waste of an hour but if you miss it no biggie
Jun 27 2012,positive,great culmination of the marvel universe movies not as good as the standalones sans iron man 2 however makes up for its shortcomings in terms of sheer scale and fanboy points
Jun 27 2012,positive,its a great movie but as far as comic book movies i still prefer dark knight i guess my expectations were a little too high for this one
Jun 27 2012,positive,it was cool and funny at the same time
Jun 27 2012,positive,epic    thats all i have to say
Jun 27 2012,positive,a masterpiece  i have nothing more to say about this movie
Jun 27 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in 2012 and also the best superhero movie i have ever seen
Jun 27 2012,positive,great cast director and filmography you really cant go wrong with this one
Jun 27 2012,positive,perfect the best comicmademovie yet
Jun 27 2012,positive,best super hero movie ever
Jun 27 2012,positive,never seen this but i know its absolutely good movie
Jun 27 2012,positive,phenomenal movie keeps you interested from minute one and has a solid plot watching all those solid actorssuper heroes in a joint fight together was well choreographed and filmed perfectly tons of fun and worth every penny no over the top stunts and actually for a colabo picture it actually put time into the plot which was a pleasant surprise well done joss now give us a sequel
Jun 27 2012,positive,general story had a few hiccups but the utter fact that whedon managed to infuse each avenger perfectly give them each their deserved screen time along with its amazing set pieces and the fact that the hulk was finally given justice the best marvel film since spiderman 2 455
Jun 27 2012,positive,love movies that have continuity which looks hard this one  is incredibly masterful juggling all those characters something only joss wedon could do cant wait for his next marvel effort
Jun 27 2012,positive,just raised the bar
Jun 27 2012,positive,what can i saythe best movie of the year
Jun 27 2012,positive,one hell of a ride really enjoyed when hulk is in action and when he smashes the lead villain simply astonishingvery good entertainer more than expected with all the characters especially with iron man and hulk
Jun 27 2012,positive,freaking best movie of all time hp is close but this is so good
Jun 27 2012,positive,very surprising just how good this movie was i want to see it again and im definitely buying the blu ray
Jun 27 2012,positive,the avengers was everything i expected and then some the visual effects were nothing short of spectacular and the action sequences were phenomenal i was on the edge of my seat the entire time i recommend anybody go catch this film
Jun 27 2012,positive,you know it i give this one my both thumbs up i do love my comic book movies one thing i dont like though is the loki character didnt like him in thor either what did do this movie for me is hulk was disappointed in the earlier hulk movie leads but this guy is it cant wait to see more hulk and avenger adventures
Jun 27 2012,positive,full of action and fun and thoroughly entertaining  a great flick to sit down and have fun with
Jun 27 2012,positive,it the best movies ever
Jun 26 2012,positive,best marvel movie yet looking forward to the next one
Jun 26 2012,positive,best movie ive seen in a very long time whedon did an amazing job
Jun 26 2012,positive,even if you dont like super hero movies youll love this
Jun 26 2012,positive,was better than i thought the guy playing thor made it less boring thats for sure  good movie
Jun 26 2012,positive,as long as you have seen the prior movies its a great superhero movie
Jun 26 2012,positive,sooo good but some things they fell short onpsloki was hot
Jun 26 2012,positive,this is a good movie everybody will enjoy seeing this one almost all of the scenes are entertaining it will never fails you to get bored one funny thing is that robert downey jr  is the most paid actor and yet when he is wearing his iron man suit his face is only seen
Jun 26 2012,positive,omg incredible i saw it 3 times cant wait to get it on dvd i will be glued to my tv watching it over and over and over
Jun 26 2012,positive,satisfaction from beginning to ending
Jun 26 2012,positive,everything about the avengers was fun
Jun 26 2012,positive,the ultimate blast for marvel movies fans
Jun 26 2012,positive,like most of these movies they cant include all of the serious plot lines from the comics but still a great job and well put together favorite part was hulk smashing loki in the building when he starts to pout about being a god  lol great
Jun 26 2012,positive,every ounce of entertainment value has been squeezed out of the latest marvel film and its probably the companies best theres a story somewhere in there but going to the avengers and expecting top notch story telling is like going to mcdonalds and expecting exceptional cuisine its an action movie down to its roots layered with slice and slice of awesomeness while some superheroes cough iron man cough outshine others in screen time they all seem to mesh pretty well ith each other the performances are all quirky and fun even though captain america acts like a jerk they all effectively play off each other what it all adds up to is a flabbergastingly large fight scene with amazing cg and fantastic fight choreography obviously everyone knows that the avengers will win at the end defeating the gargtuan enemy but you cant help but to have a childlike grin plastered on your face i believe that the main goal of a movie is to entertain thats what theyre made for right so on that manner the avengers succeeds in almost every sense of the word except some of the costumes those were just silly
Jun 26 2012,positive,if you like comic book type movies you will like this
Jun 26 2012,positive,the movie has holes in it like wasnt the biforst bridge destroyed and why did they still bring loki to the helicarrier despite him having an opportunity to escape while they were fighting in the woods but for some strange reason people loved it 30 minutes of action and a couple in between marvels avengers is an average movie and its success is based on brilliant marketing hopefully the 2nd installment will have a more effective heroes unlike hawkeye and black widow and last but not least the audience only enjoyed the scenes with the hulk which was portrayed accurately despite him looking a bit overweight
Jun 26 2012,positive,whedoni give you all my love for making such a great film the effects were great the super heroes stuck true to their nature the acting was superb and how can you go wrong with the hulk smashing
Jun 26 2012,positive,captain america makes it all worth it 3 3 3 nuffsaid
Jun 26 2012,positive,great movie  i was skeptical and not a superhero movie buff  but it was a fun and entertaining view  loved it
Jun 26 2012,positive,terrific movie incredible special effects outstanding acting performances by the whole cast
Jun 26 2012,positive,two wordsfreakin awesome
Jun 26 2012,positive,excellent flick would see it over and over again
Jun 26 2012,positive,loved it will buy it for sure
Jun 26 2012,positive,wonderful actionsuperhero movie the combination of multiple heros into one story makes for a wonderful film the relationships between them is evident and provides for good entertainment
Jun 26 2012,positive,i am very much so a dc comic guy this movie almost made made switch sides well done mr whedon well done
Jun 26 2012,neutral,turns out im not a huge fan of super hero moviesâ love batman tho 
Jun 26 2012,positive,i love superhero comics but somehow the craziness of the mutant superhero world doesnt seem to translate well from drawings or cartoons to live action  cgi  joss whedons version was actually one of the better attempts  i very much liked the buildup and the way the different characters are brought together  if the whole thing was like that idve given it 4 or 5 stars  but once the battle started it all became so anticlimactic  why are extraterrestrial invaders always portrayed so menacingly up until the time they try to invade earth and then when they do invade they are shown as a bunch of whimps     spoilers   a single nuke took about the alien mothership um dont they have missile defence or anything  and where was the regular army and airforce when the avengers were fighting the aliens hell shield had a whole aircraft carrier full of planes to play with
Jun 26 2012,positive,such an amazing movie if youre interested with super hereos friendship teamwork then this is the movie for you 
Jun 26 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
Jun 26 2012,positive,one of the best adventurer heroes adrenalineride actionpacked movies i have seen in a long time
Jun 26 2012,positive,great summer action movie could possibly be the biggest one of 2012 the movie had me from the start until the end whedon does a great job keeping the movie rolling like a freak train it never lets up from the beginning rd jr ironman and ruffalo hulk personally stole the show from the others great special effects acting and story made this movie a blockbuster
Jun 26 2012,positive,easily the best movie ive ever seen a nice blend of action and humor with a compelling story line
Jun 26 2012,positive,a comic book story in every way and a movie that survives and reels in big fish even with its simple and easy plot
Jun 26 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive seen this year
Jun 26 2012,positive,epic movie  the ending is a little bit bad but it is still a very good movie
Jun 26 2012,positive,avengers is the perfect summer blockbuster  funny exciting spectacular over blown clever  and a whole bucket load of fun
Jun 26 2012,positive,this was an awesome must see
Jun 26 2012,positive,we laughed all the way through it plenty of little side comments
Jun 26 2012,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Jun 26 2012,positive,im not much of a super hero lover but this movie was pretty cool
Jun 26 2012,positive,awesome and hilarious
Jun 26 2012,positive,it has a great story with it and the only super hero movie i like
Jun 26 2012,positive,joss whedon did a great job at making characters who have mostly all starred in their own extended prologue film and make them a team in the ways that marvel comics are so good at doing the graphics are of course top notch but that was granted i have some issues with the mildly sexist portrayal of black widow but considering most modern action flicks this is a minor problem  overall if you want a big dumb action movie this is the best you can get
Jun 26 2012,positive,brilliant a superhero movie that will last the ages for its ability to bring joy to its audience fanbase and still live up to the hype truly the penultimate action superhero movie the only question is how the avengers 2 can possibly hope to match it
Jun 26 2012,positive,very good movie its long but worth it
Jun 26 2012,positive,very well done  cant wait for the sequel
Jun 26 2012,positive,epic the best movie ever never will lose
Jun 26 2012,positive,absolutely one of the best superhero movies
Jun 26 2012,positive,great movie superhero frenzy
Jun 26 2012,positive,if you are marvel comic fan dont see this because is a alternative form to see the mainstream modern of this eramtv pink popcorn and lady gaga
Jun 26 2012,positive,amazing  one of the best films ever made
Jun 26 2012,positive,it was lil less good then i expected but still loved it
Jun 26 2012,positive,loved it  action packed
Jun 26 2012,positive,beautifully done  i love everything about it and plan on adding it to my library
Jun 26 2012,positive,will be watching over and over again until there is another one
Jun 26 2012,positive,pleasantly surprised by the amount of humor in the movie  felt like i was watching a comedy at times with all of the laughoutloud moments by the audience in the theater  special effects acting action comedy were all fantastic  my only criticism is that it did move a little slow at timesperhaps it was dragged out a little longer than necessary
Jun 26 2012,positive,i didnt realize the hulk was so mental
Jun 26 2012,positive,near perfect super hero film with tons of humor and charm
Jun 26 2012,positive,pure summer blockbuster fun with plenty of explosive mayhem action and gags nothing more and nothing less than what you were expecting dont bother with the 3d though
Jun 26 2012,positive,the hulk makes this film great
Jun 26 2012,positive,finally someone consulted people who actually write comics read comics or can name 10 characters they havent seen in another movie steve rodgers wasnt unfortunately underwhelming in comparison to his comic book persona but thats nitpicking why are directors not named joss whedon so pretentious to think that they dont have to utilize the wealth of knowledge available to them to make marvel movies at this caliber its so frustrating
Jun 26 2012,positive,very good storylineaction was greatwil download this one for sure
Jun 26 2012,positive,this movie is amazing
Jun 26 2012,positive,the best possible avengers movie that could have been made near flawless cant wait to own this bad boy on bluray
Jun 26 2012,positive,3 simple words go see it    2 adjectives ambitious  complex    1 name whedon    0 the excuses you should have for not seeing this movie on the big screen
Jun 26 2012,positive,fantastic moviecomedy action great acting  i couldnt find one flaw with it  it sets up a sequel very well too
Jun 26 2012,positive,all that a superhero movie should be and more
Jun 26 2012,positive,that movie was incredible best movie ever
Jun 26 2012,positive,awesome action graphics comedy all around awesome

Jun 26 2012,positive,halfway between decent and good
Jun 26 2012,positive,loved it great story cheeky characters and interesting twist to the marvel series
Jun 26 2012,positive,awesome sound fx were phenomenal action pact intense from start to finnish and another ending
Jun 26 2012,positive,excellent job by marvel studios and all marvel characters this movie was perfectly balanced with exciting action and hilariously aweing humour cant wait to bring the 3d bluray home when it comes out
Jun 26 2012,positive,sick killer storyeffectscast can watch it over and over oh and its a good movie as well
Jun 25 2012,positive,better than expectations so 3 12 stars
Jun 25 2012,positive,a brilliant personification of all that is hollywood cinema lots of cgi witty american dialogue a story that follows a template from start to finish and enough action to keep you from focussing on any form of character development  its definitely not terrible  its entertaining enough  and the direction and performances are greater than many other blockbusters  maybe christopher nolans spoiled me for every other comictoscreen flick
Jun 25 2012,positive,whats not to like bring together some of the better comic movies and even a thin plot becomes entertaining combines the wisecracking robert downey juniors iron man with the serious and upright captain america good cast of characters who put up a decent entertaining performance thought i could not figure out why scarlett johansson was needed
Jun 25 2012,positive,pretty good entertainment but all comic fans will alway think they could have done better
Jun 25 2012,positive,a great script a stellar cast and a good sense of humor you cant ask for much more from a feelgood superhero romp
Jun 25 2012,positive,the best super hero movie since superman ll
Jun 25 2012,negative,not that great the special effects were average and silly for the world or timeline they portray in the film i expect more from a film made today rdj was the best character though his script was flat gwyneth paltrow not doubt shes talented but under leveraged in this film hmm why was she in the film she doesnt add anything to the overall storyline wait until it is out of the theaters not worth the 
Jun 25 2012,positive,amazing a must see in theaters
Jun 25 2012,positive,originally posted at otherwhereco  it is no secret that i think joss whedon is pretty much the master when it comes to writing the best characters stories and dialogue hands down i dont think anybody can do an ensemble better than he since i can say with complete honesty that i have followed his work since 1997 and watched everything he has ever made multiple times in a continuous loop i can also say with just a smidge of authority that the avengers is his best work yet  the avengers has absolutely everything a summer blockbuster movie needs crazy action sick fight scenes bigger than life characters aliens gods superheroes samuel l jackson and scarlett in a cat suit michael bay could have done all that and im sure plenty of people would still have seen it joss took all this and did the one thing that makes great movies phenomenal he made it human  every character is perfectly developed nobody takes themselves too seriously humor abounds and in the end they are just people or alien gods forced to put aside their collective baggage and fight for the fate of the world sound familiar hmmmm ill give you two guesses but youll only need one  joss signature style is all over the place youll hear it in the dialogue see it in the fight scenes and glimpse it in the camera work the smartest thing hollywood ever did was hire this man to make this movie his huge respect for the characters the source material and the essence of what its all about is beyond evident i cannot wait to see all the behind the scenes and extras on the superdupereditionbluray that i will totally be preordering in like two seconds this is it folks the one we have all been waiting for its the best thing thats happened since buffy and its beautiful
Jun 25 2012,neutral,mayb i shoulda watched thor before i saw this
Jun 25 2012,positive,as this high budget film was made for pure entertainment i guess it worked there were a couple of funny lines by ironman however the continuous one on one fight scenes were way overkill reminding me of the fight scene in the movie they live a few of these should have hit the editors floor cutting the length of the film to be more desirable spoilerone scene in particular was between thor ironman and captain america in the forest as loki looked on
Jun 25 2012,positive,incredibly there are 6 superheroes and never did i think the challenges called for anything less that would be noteworthy enough in screenplay writing but it was still a phenomenal movie in all other respects
Jun 25 2012,positive,enjoyed it thoroughly would watch it again just to see thor hammer captain americas shield
Jun 25 2012,positive,its no iron man but some wellplaced humor and strong writing keep it in the ballpark  pure hollywood escapism
Jun 25 2012,positive,great addition to the marvel line up  it felt like iron man 25 which i liked  solid balance between characters and a nice lead in for iron man 3 now filming in wilmington nc
Jun 25 2012,positive,good without being great
Jun 25 2012,positive,a must watch for every die hard comic fan
Jun 25 2012,positive,avengers amazing is more like it  was fantastic with both crappy hulk movies  the subpar thor and captain america movies they left no doubts that with the correct writers on board this is a power house
Jun 25 2012,positive,i dont normally like these types of superhero movies but it was entertaining all around
Jun 25 2012,positive,changed my brown life just incredible
Jun 25 2012,positive,this was a great movie
Jun 25 2012,positive,awesomeness thats all i need to say about this
Jun 25 2012,positive,absolutely incredible forget the naysayers this movie had everything
Jun 25 2012,positive,ive seen at least most of the characters that are from this film in their respective movies but combine all of them and you get the best film yet this mashup of superheroes from different worldsthor youre awesome in a fight against many evil forces makes for a definitely awesome superhero film
Jun 25 2012,positive,mehthe comic book geeks and the action nerds wont be disappointedi just dont get the fascination with converting comic books to movies  i havent seen one of the latter surpass the former
Jun 25 2012,positive,joss whedon didnt let me down also mark ruffalo was great as the hulk
Jun 25 2012,positive,heros saves the day
Jun 25 2012,positive,a great movie ive seen it 3 times in theater and im going to buy it
Jun 25 2012,positive,yepeveryone pegged this one right  great comic book movie  and it should have been since moviemaker took the unique approach of developing most of the principle characters in their own movies before putting them all together  never the less it was a good high energy action packed with a hint of comedy movie
Jun 25 2012,positive,as close to perfect as you can get for a superhero movie in the individual marvel movies the feeling may have been some characters failed to connect with the audience as well as others but the dynamic of having all characters involved in this movie will only strengthen the net marvel movies in the series  entertaining with some fantastic humour this film could easily be watched multiple times
Jun 25 2012,positive,as good as a team superhero movie could be
Jun 25 2012,positive,i loved this movie it was a little cheesy but it was full of adventure
Jun 25 2012,positive,it was amazing to see all of the heros again but as a group great movie
Jun 25 2012,positive,awesome movie nuff said
Jun 25 2012,positive,great use of the hulk
Jun 25 2012,positive,fun and exciting  a touch long on the action
Jun 25 2012,positive,possibly the best superhero movie ever madestoryacting special effects were all in equel measures brilliantly realisediron mans one liners thor godlyness cap americas man out time and scene stealer hulk perfectably supported by an a list cast sam jackson jez renner scarlett johannson and all joined together by clark greggsaw 3 times in the cinema and pre ordered blue ray already
Jun 25 2012,positive,hit its target audience well and brought many more fans
Jun 25 2012,positive,was some what boring and i am a big marvel fan
Jun 25 2012,positive,summer movie perfection the avengers makes history    for those of you unfamiliar with the comic book world you should know that crossovers are a pretty common occurrence in fact its standard operating procedure for the two big comic companies marvel and dc to state that all of the currently running comics actually take place in the same universe   so superman is saving metropolis while batman investigates in gotham these two know each other and sometimes work together for marvel iron man and spiderman might both end up trying to save new york at the same time  with all of the crossovers that happened both companies eventually devised a series about the best of the best of these heroes joining up in a team to fight the strongest enemies for dc there was the justice league and for marvel there was the avengers   those of you following marvels comic book movies of late have probably been very aware of the plans for an avengers film for some time the seeds were planted with two iron man films thor and captain america to a lesser extent the incredible hulk though the 2008 film is mostly ignored as the actor has changed unlike the other characters  the plot of the avengers is not all that complicated loki tom hiddleston the villain from thor returns to earth with the intention of opening a portal to enable an alien armada through to conquer earth for him nick fury samuel l jackson finally puts his plan to bring the avengers together   this team consists of captain americasteve rogers chris evans iron mantony stark robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth black widow natasha romanoff scarlett johansson hawkeye clint barton jeremy renner and the incredible hulk bruce banner mark ruffalo  the team will overcome obstacles both physical and emotional in order to save the very world but first they have to learn to work together  the avengers is basically a summer movie blockbuster refined into its purest most concentrated form and it encapsulates everything an audience would want out of an action movie and especially a super hero story this movie knew exactly what it was what it wanted to be and what everyone else wanted it be and it succeeded in every category  this film succeeds for a multitude of reasons first of course we have the anticipation and build up to this movie itself which was first teased all the way back in 2007 ever since then each film marvel has released included a piece leading up to this movie there was a lot of worry coming in to this film for a lot of people people were worried the film would be bloated that it would try to do too much and simply collapse under its own weight but thanks to a masterful screenplay written by joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer and firefly who also directed the film everything works out just as it should  of course even with a great script you need a good cast to pull it off and marvel has definitely managed a triumph here robert downey jr is obviously a crowd favorite and steals many of the scenes hes in he is also given a bit more prominence than the other characters though not to a degree that he overshadows them   chris evans and chris hemsworth return to their roles well keeping things nice and consistent from captain america and thor jeremy renner is given the least development in the plot and thats unfortunate as hes a fantastic actor scarlett johansson got some very surprising character development and probably the best scene involving the films villain   the real surprise though is mark ruffalos hulk marvel has struggled to find a face for the role for a while but it seems theyve finally found a good match ruffalo plays banner in a much more mildmannered fashion when hes not hulking out at least he thankfully also turns the angst way down a trait which has bogged down the banner role for a long time  this film is also the perfect case study for how to make your action movie right compare this film to the transformers series a very common defense for those movies is that they are action films and thus can be forgiven for being dumb   here is your proof right here that you can have your big dumb action movie with all the explosions and everything you crave and you can also make it good not only are the characters actually likeable in this film but also you can actually tell whats going on in every action scene imagine that no whirling chaotic mess of cogs and cg just clearwellshot action with no shaky cam its stunning what a difference that makes  the avengers is everything you could possibly want in a super hero film its really that simple and its not secret either since this film shattered opening weekend box office records with an unprecedented 200 million dollars in just one weekend   if you havent seen this movie you should not only is everyone else seeing it but also youll have a blast the summer movie season has just started and we may have already seen the biggest film despite that though im still looking forward to what comes next and im also looking forward to seeing what marvels has up its sleeve because if this film is any indication they arent done yet  grade a  entertainment value 10
Jun 25 2012,positive,what a great superhero film should be
Jun 25 2012,positive,for what this movie is and was always meant to be and that being porn for teenage boys and geeks everywhere it hits the mark perfectly    its hard to argue with success while some of the films that developed the characters in the avengers were better or worse than others its really impossible to say the money shot film with all of them combined that they have been leading up to doesnt deliver exactly what would be expected  for a super hero action film you really cant expect or ask for anything more
Jun 25 2012,positive,it has everything a comic book fan and an action movie fan would want plus some extra smashing lets be honest we all love smashing you should enjoy yourself unless you no longer have a soul
Jun 25 2012,positive,its got ironman in it so it rocks
Jun 25 2012,positive,the perfect superhero movie
Jun 25 2012,positive,a movie that redefines how superhero genre films should look and feel  pure fun
Jun 25 2012,positive,its rare for me to give a 5 star review i dont know if its my love for everything marvel or the plain fact that this movie was excellent but it deserves each star this is a culmination of serveral great movies put together ironman and thor and captain america and so many others with an award winning cast with amazing special effects derserves a perfect score
Jun 25 2012,positive,best movie of the summer
Jun 25 2012,positive,will admit i was afraid at first of how this would turn out but like about 90 of people i absolutely loved it the hulk will always be my first love so i was a little sad to see a different actor than portrayed him in the incredible hulk but i had to concede to the fact that even in the face of a last minute cast change the right man was picked for the job what was most impressive to me is how so many comic book fans  were pleased by the final product hats off to the cinematographer that still cares about the fans
Jun 25 2012,positive,brilliant chris evans is beautiful
Jun 25 2012,positive,wow captain america done right and little to no polluting political correctness this is a great movie and makes you want to see all the rest of the avenger movies before it this movies is definitely bluray worthy
Jun 25 2012,positive,at one point iron man and captain america have a politicalphilosophical argument which amounted to the free marketeer vs the ultra nationalist
Jun 25 2012,positive,epic move a must see
Jun 25 2012,positive,could of been better
Jun 25 2012,positive,great movie got to see it if you havent yet
Jun 25 2012,positive,great movie loved the cast and great plot
Jun 25 2012,positive,i didnt think it could be done a film throwing together 7 unique characters 4 of them having already done their own individual movie but goddamn joss whedon sure knocked it out of the park not only did he create the movie that no one thought possible but he kept the characters in line with their previously set up attitudes nuances and motivations and crafted some of the most straight up badass action moments in recent history all the while he throws jokes back and forth between characters so fast that you may miss some of them because youre still busy laughing from the last one its popcorn cinema at its most clever and fun dont miss this ive already seen it three times and i still want to watch it again im hyped as hell for the dark knight rises but its going to be very difficult to follow up the avengers i wish you luck bruce
Jun 25 2012,positive,great movie saw it at the drive in it was funny but action packed
Jun 25 2012,positive,great action with a nice story but it is the typical hero movie with only some creativity liked it all around but if a sequel is to come out then it will need something else
Jun 25 2012,positive,everything that it should be for an avengers movie plenty of action and not much more
Jun 25 2012,positive,no doubtthe best superheroes movie ever
Jun 25 2012,positive,after a somewhat slow start whedon ups the pace and creates a well written well directed film it could have very easily lost its way with such a large cast but manages to bring them together well particularly impressed with tom hiddlestons loki and mark ruffalos bruce banner although much of the cast are very well suited to their roles
Jun 25 2012,positive,i liked it i didnt love it i believe if you are willing to invest a lot of time into watching the other ones then it might have turned out better than it did for me my only complaint with the movie itself is that the hulks storyline has some major logic issues though the cast is having so much fun it is impossible to not just sit back and enjoy the ride
Jun 25 2012,positive,see what happens when you get a geek to write a geek movie and dont have a studio interrupting spiderman 3
Jun 25 2012,positive,oh man did it live up to the hype
Jun 25 2012,positive,awesome ive seen this movie 4 times in 3d
Jun 25 2012,positive,greatest superhero movie ever

Jun 25 2012,positive,awesome action movie
Jun 25 2012,positive,this movie was really enjoyable my only complaint is that the beginning is too slow and isnt as witty as the second part
Jun 25 2012,positive,as long it grossed higher than harry potter
Jun 25 2012,positive,i love it has a good story and me and my hole family love i saw it 6 time with all of them if your not sure about watching i am telling you have a good time and if your there sort of people that dont like superhero you like
Jun 25 2012,positive,omg i just love marvel the sexysensible captain america and the sexysarcastic iron man in one film what more could i ask for than to see my two favorite superheroes battle alongside one another perfect makes me think about how badly i want to go to comiccon its on my bucket list question why is the hulk so invincible doesnt matter super film any comic book fan will enjoy
Jun 25 2012,positive,i have never left a cinema so disappointed
Jun 25 2012,positive,a brilliant and amazing cinematic adventure that has captivated 13yrold me and 30yrold me all twelve times this summer
Jun 24 2012,positive,the first act drags on for a bit but when it gets going the action set pieces and group dynamics whedon is known for make an amazing film

Jun 24 2012,neutral,the lineup of stars certainly did not gel  the girl from how i met your mother was awful    there is a whole lot of dramatic talking  there are quite a few funny one liners but all in all i though it was quite awful
Jun 24 2012,positive,my husband n i love this movies its awesome
Jun 24 2012,positive,purchase worthy and will rewatch as soon as possible
Jun 24 2012,positive,when demigod loki hiddleston decides to steal a powerful weapon from shield his evil plans to take over the world must be stopped and its up to the company head nick fury jackson to do the job he decides to assemble the avengers millionaire tony starkiron man downey captain america evans bruce bannerthe hulk ruffalo natasha romanoffblack widow johansson and by surprise lokis halfbrother thor hemsworth loki has already taken over the minds of the scientist skarsgãrd and hawkeye renner so in the meantime the team has to come up with a way to foil lokis plans if they can handle each other at least  marvels the avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever is it an exaggeration nope so many films of the same genre always have the same problem they either take themselves way to seriously or its the other way around but what makes marvels the avengers so great is that directorscreenwriter whedon not only serves up a plateful of welcome laughs but he creates very human characters and every battle scene or even just a conversation feels so real that its almost ridiculous and the fact that weve all grown to love all of the characters takes this twoandahalf hour long movie in a road that all too entertaining it basically serves up the whole enchilada but lets face it while this movie does have a narrative structure most filmmakers should be jealous of of course the star of the show is the terrific special effects every explosion every nasty kill and every smash is so well done that the films hefty 250 million budget is put to good use the twenty minute climax to the film is so spectacular that you always wonder if this had been filmed just a few years ago would it be the same marvels the avengers is so perfect in every move it makes joss whedon seems to be the best guy to handle it so far this gets an a for entertainment recommended
Jun 24 2012,positive,tooooo many main characters for one movie my husband and brother loved it i thought it was kind of boring and whiplashy
Jun 24 2012,positive,very cool hulk smash
Jun 24 2012,positive,yeah its a comic book movie  lets skip the part where we talk about comic book movies being a legit genre  who cares  the story was average but pretty entertaining  im sure nerds everywhere have been freaking out about having so many of their heroes on the screen simultaneously  cool  whatever  if you want to know what really makes the avengers awesome its that it was almost flawlessly executed  it knows exactly what it is and doesnt try to be anything its not  forget the subject matter for a moment and just marvel at how well constructed this film was  before the avengers i thought it was impossible to share screen time with that many characters keeping them all balanced and equally interestingimportant  seriously hats off to the team that pulled this one off
Jun 24 2012,positive,i cannot envision a more impressive and wellrounded superhero movie
Jun 24 2012,positive,best superhero movie ive seen great plot and acting all around
Jun 24 2012,positive,meant to do this a long long time ago
Jun 24 2012,positive,joss whedon does it again amazing movie best yet this year 
Jun 24 2012,positive,most entertaining movie ive seen in a long time
Jun 24 2012,positive,hulk smash and loky
Jun 24 2012,positive,i am still wondering how disney let this one out with a pg13 rating
Jun 24 2012,positive,awesome movie i cant wait for the 2 nd one and the continuation of the marvel universe avengers assemble
Jun 24 2012,positive,full of action sexy men and a big green angry monster what more could a girl want a spectacular film that kept me interested most of the time as with all superhero films it was far fetched but that what youd expect if you want reality then this isnt it
Jun 24 2012,positive,this movie really did live up to the hype i thoroughly enjoyed and it look forward to the sequel  marvel has been coming on strong lately with the likes of captain america thor and now the avengers keep em coming
Jun 24 2012,positive,its a good kids movie the movie is very overrated
Jun 24 2012,positive,avengers assemble oh and assemble they did in this smash hit blockbuster of the century or perhaps ever that has been in the works since 2008 our heroes all bask in the glory of their first outing in style as they each progress and accept that they are a team what was really impressive was the screenwrite written with such finece and so well done showing the progression of them all coming to accept they are a team and learning to act as one the cinematography was incredible just as everything about this movie but the cinematography really stood out for me introducing each character so effectively and never even throughout the entire 2 12 hours of footage allowing one or the other to hog the spotlight the characters were so fleshed out and well portrayed by such an incredible cast what i really loved was that each character was developed so effectively not just in this film but all the films in the past 5 years that led up to this each preparing the characters mentally for this moment this film draws so well on each characters personalities and their traits from previous films and as each personality clashes while they are becoming a team they all learn to put aside their differences to unite against a greater problem the transition from bickering heroes to a team was so well done while each hero would usually anchor all the films direction and hold the story up single handedly no single one had to carry to much weight and each successfully held up the film together as a team full of incredible imagery cinematography and direction it makes you believe in them and want to root for them not just because their the good guys but while this is mostly consisted of action the film is so wonderfully peppered with those little emotional ties that attach us to each character and make us want them to succeed this film packs such a punch except this time it aint hitler whose taking the blow its the other films opening this week who will feel its force because it was just so outstandingly done packed with action believable emotion and performances and comedy somehow each joke was incredibly effective grossing an insane amount of laughs and was never a flop and no matter how dire the situation their never afraid to crack a joke but it was not just jokes that were drawn from the huge crowds but applause not just at the end but throughout the whole film such a great time at the movies with so many fanboy nods this film is perfect for all out marvel fans and non fans alike making it easy for us all to put aside our differences and assemble against a common goal the no 1 spot in the box office overall the best experience you could ever possibly have at a theater for now because this was only the beginning as we all anxiously await the next few years with marvels schedule consisting of iron man 3 capt america 2 and thor 2 which will all hopefully lead up to the avengers 2 just as the others led up to this film and we cant ever forget the final shot of the film before the credits the most memorable and meaningful shot in film history containing the most memorable letter in film history as tony and pepper are remodeling stark tower with the broken sign zooming out to show us just one letter a letter that withstands the entire force of an alien army a
Jun 24 2012,positive,it had great effects acting story etc yet it felt like any other marvel super hero movie
Jun 24 2012,neutral,great visuals epic battles  funny writing but its still a marvel movie  since christopher nolan reintroduced batman to the world and gave dc a new lease on cinematic life my bar is set pretty high
Jun 24 2012,positive,it shouldnt work but it does all characters and plot elements balanced perfectly i wont know a more perfect action superhero film until i see it a great film that is truly for everyone
Jun 24 2012,positive,one f my favorite super hero movies of all time this is when they get it right
Jun 24 2012,positive,wow wasnt expecting much on this one i feel they have pulled out too many comic book heroes at this point the storyline was great the action sequences well done cg was impeccable  the 3d version was the best 3d i have seen yet cant wait for the sequel
Jun 24 2012,positive,my children simply loved this movie  my five yr old loves iron man and captain america
Jun 24 2012,positive,my whole family enjoyed this film it had the right amount of action and humor and a great cast
Jun 24 2012,positive,excellent and action packed
Jun 24 2012,positive,it was a great movie and funny too
Jun 24 2012,positive,to quote a famous song i like it i love it i want some more of it
Jun 24 2012,positive,hugely entertaining and nicely humorous the brisk pace and onthego characterization are much appreciated the action scenes are well choreographed a great way to do a fun summer boxoffice popcorn movie theres a sense of fun and humanity that most soulless  franchise movies can never seem to muster this might not seem like such a special revelation if more big budget movies werent so soulless and drab these days
Jun 24 2012,positive,ii love captain america and thor
Jun 24 2012,positive,a great movie to introduce the avengers as a unit  all of the actors did their job and it was a smash success
Jun 24 2012,positive,the best marvel movie yet
Jun 24 2012,positive,for the most part this movie provides a ton of action and entertainment with all the superheroes coming together does live up to the hype as one of the top movies in 2012 but the storyline drags it out a bit
Jun 24 2012,positive,very well done  pulled all the other films together in this first one with the whole team  did make captain america seem a little less then in his film but the over all story line was very well done
Jun 24 2012,positive,im loyal to nothingexcept the dream  captain america
Jun 24 2012,positive,very well acted very well written and splendidly well directed by uniting all that has been done it comes to heroes with action scenes as a smart script and all around a good mood there was not so much depth as it could have been asked however its was almost a new universe created for the heroes to showing the human side of them even with all its invincibility they have feelings like any ordinary person the end result is a sharp movie heroes showing the fun side of comics and putting aside all the nonsense that has been seen in the genre
Jun 24 2012,positive,a fun movie no message just action and yucks
Jun 24 2012,positive,excellent movie the way it was done tied into history perfectly
Jun 24 2012,positive,i expected more from joss whedon was there an actual script or did they make it up as they went along plot holes you could run the hulk through scarlett does look good in tights though
Jun 24 2012,positive,i am such a diehard marvel fan that i waited until the 2nd to last day it was showing in my theater to see it allright i am no marvel or comic book worshiper but i do like seeing some super hero films from time to time first id like to talk about the previous avenger films before i continue my review on the avengers in order from least to greatest this is how these five films would rank captain america bored didnt like story or characters thor better then america iron man 2 about iron man fun dialogue non memorable story  the incredible hulk sadly under the radar edward norton fun and entertaining and iron man great origin story great acting memorable action and story so i only really liked two out of the five films and wasnt overly excited forthe avengersbut i did want to see it and i am glad i didthe avengers takes place most recently after captain america chris evans human torch how can he be two  marvel super heroeshas been found frozen in ice loki thors evil adopted brother has decided to come and rule earth a team of super heroes must put their differences aside and save the human racethis is definitely ranking as one of the best superhero films ever made not only did it have great action characters and story but it had a sense of humor that is often missed in such film that try to be oh so serious this film made me like each and everyone of these super heroes regardless of how i thought about their own stand alone films but as usually robert downey jrs tony stark remain the most complex interesting and funny character he outshines the rest of his cast and not only because he has the shiniest suit but because he is probably the most talented actor in this film the only one who stood close to downeys leading charm was mark ruffalo bruce banner hulk i was initially sad to see that edward norton wouldnt be returning but ruffalo did great playing the low key easy voiced drthe avengersis one of the most entertaining films of the year that isnt just full of action and laughs but it has heart as well i highly recommend this film even if you arent a comic book to movie loverthe avengers will keep you entertained laughing and engrossed throughout
Jun 24 2012,positive,the avengers is one of the best movies of 2012 and definitly marvels best it has the perfect balance of a super hero movie including action story and lots of comedy
Jun 24 2012,positive,didnt think all these characters could be on the screen at the same timei was wrong awesome
Jun 24 2012,positive,it was good  funny adult lines
Jun 24 2012,positive,a verydifficulttofit characters combination yet precisely blended movie  marvel avengers 2012 justified all the iconic super heroes without disturbing the plot  too many cooks spoil the broth  may not be a wise saying at marvels the avengers 2012  hulk smash we have a hulk mjãlnir too heavy for hulk  and many more show stealers keep your eyes glued to the screen  best of 2012 marvels the avengers 2012  5 stars from me
Jun 24 2012,positive,this will go down as the greatest superhero movie of all time
Jun 24 2012,positive,a solid special effects event film the story is nicely paced although the plot isnt terribly strong the heros are all likable each with their own interesting quirks the inherent conflict between them makes sense given their personalities the action scenes were all very well done not just because the visual effects were so strong but because they were careful to avoid letting the fights devolve into grinding identical mooks i have to say that final battle dragged a little bit too long   all in all id say this is my second favorite of the marvel studios superhero films right behind ironman   spoiler alert  my one big complaint is the way the destruction of the mother ship completely shut down all of the alien forces first of all thats incredibly cliche second it leaves you thinking why didnt they try that to begin with whats more it doesnt just stop the ships or weapons from working it makes the aliens all drop dead at that point in the story the national guard was already there i think it would be easy for us to assume that they were able to finish off the remaining invaders while the avengers took out loki
Jun 24 2012,positive,this might as well be an oscar winner for all i care its the best film produced by marvel ever somebody get me a time machine so i can go into the future to september 2012 so i can buy this movie on dvd
Jun 24 2012,positive,seen it yesterday wiy my sonit was a great movie best part was watchn it wit my bby boy
Jun 24 2012,positive,this movie was frickin awesome a lot of times these types of movies fail to keep my attention or my interest for the whole time however this one surely did one of the best movies id ever seen
Jun 24 2012,positive,great action funny super heroes
Jun 24 2012,positive,for me its a perfect end to the first round of marvel studio flicks this is what i have been waiting so many years for and i think the payoff was exactly what it needed to be it not only satisfied my need to see all these heroes together but it created an excitement to see more solo missions for these characters in the very near future
Jun 24 2012,positive,best movie of summer 2012 can stark be to cool  can black widow be to sexy can hulk be to mashie  noway
Jun 24 2012,positive,sorry forgot to think about the plot amidst all the visuals probably so did the makers
Jun 24 2012,negative,crap didnt even leave on to see the end
Jun 24 2012,positive,super action packed losts of characters and great actors was awesome
Jun 24 2012,positive,excellent movie  the story and characters were welldeveloped though not perfect and the action sequences were well done
Jun 24 2012,positive,enjoyed watching hulk smash things around
Jun 24 2012,positive,i didnt expect too much from this superhero film scripted and directed by joss whedon even with  an ensemble cast that includes robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston clark gregg cobie smulders stellan skarsgård and samuel l jackson somehow i thought it would be way over the top with so many different characters from the marvel comics that it was impossible to incorporate them all into one story and the first hour of the movie almost prove me right from six people watching it we lost two in that first hour the story of the avengers starts with nick fury director of the peacekeeping organization shield recruiting iron man captain america the hulk and thor to form a team that must stop thors adoptive brother loki from subjugating the earth and that story was developing way to slow for people who are not into comics that the result could not be other than walk away after the first sixty minutes that was probably the reason why this film was initially promoted at the 2010 san diego comiccon international during which a teaser trailer narrated by samuel l jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast it is a film for fans    but if youre not a fan and you managed to survive 60 minutes without walking away there is a reward for you in the second part where the movie picks up the tempo and starts with action isnt that why those actions hero are called action  thats what they do best delivering more than 2200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies money well spent it became the highestgrossing film based on comics the highest grossing superhero film and the highestgrossing film released by walt disney studios    this movie provides its fans with exactly what they desire but for others there will be too many things to be desired and left unfulfilled  grinding hectic emptiness as the new york times critic wrote
Jun 24 2012,positive,go see it you dont need to be a comic book fan or to have seen any of the other marvel movies to appreciate this one action comedy suspense all wrapped with amazing special effects
Jun 24 2012,positive,brilliantabsolutely brilliant
Jun 24 2012,positive,great movie id see it again
Jun 24 2012,positive,a very fun film it was great seeing the hulk back in action with everyone else though i kept getting the another one already feel the film was very well done as joss whedon continues to deliver the goods this man can make any fanboy film and deliver
Jun 24 2012,positive,full on good times over done over the top and funny well done
Jun 24 2012,positive,youd have thought that such a cast would inevitably suffer from one stealing the scene but theyve managed to pull it off a great film and great characters
Jun 24 2012,positive,amazing i love it i want more
Jun 24 2012,positive,a comiclovers wet dream
Jun 24 2012,positive,this movie was epic i definitely recommend it especially if youre a big fan of marvel
Jun 24 2012,positive,one of the few bright spots of the cinematic year so far  funny actionpacked and true to whedon form slightly tragic in all the right unexpected places  would we expect anything less from our beloved whedon  i believe he just raised the stakes once again  i cant wait to watch it again and again and again
Jun 24 2012,negative,loud and hard to follow  too long and boring  a waste of time for me
Jun 24 2012,positive,i was shocked this movie was great could be my bias for comics
Jun 24 2012,positive,great show it had my attention from the very beginning  the only thing that could have made the movie betterwas to see more of thor  he was so gorgeous
Jun 24 2012,positive,the movie followed the comics really well and all the actors acted well
Jun 24 2012,positive,a fun well scripted film with awesome special effects in my opinion it wasnt supposed to be taken too seriously after all it does fall into the common cliches of cbms perhaps not as intellegent as the dark night or as stylish as xmen first class it is still a prominent addition in this ever growing genre
Jun 24 2012,positive,that movie is so awesome and its like a superhero movie my favourite part is when hulk smashes loki it makes me surprising
Jun 24 2012,positive,greatest superhero movie of all time
Jun 24 2012,positive,it was amazing i love this movie
Jun 24 2012,positive,brilliant in visualthats it  the only real bad part is a lame jokes by ironman i like him more in original im films
Jun 24 2012,positive,to be fair i havent seen any of the other marvel flixs other than iron man and the hulk so i felt a bit put of the loop with the back story of some of the other characters  however on that note the director of this film did a nice job at filling in the gaps of knowledge for an audience that had no previous experience with marvel movies  however this is not one of my favorite movies i did still enjoy it
Jun 24 2012,positive,must see x3 well thats how many times we watched it
Jun 24 2012,positive,awesome finally got to see
Jun 24 2012,positive,i thought ironman would be the star but the hulk took the cake
Jun 23 2012,positive,it was a great film but was a little longer than it needed to be
Jun 23 2012,positive,a flawless toss up of all the heroes in marvels movieverse electing to make the team the focus instead of dividing its attention among each of the characters the avengers is everything you could ever want from a comic book movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,in my mind the avengers is quite possibly one of the most breathtaking cinematic  technical masterpieces ever whatever flaws you may find will quickly be forgiven by the last 45 minutes which could be one of the most amazing spectacles ever imagined
Jun 23 2012,positive,hands down my all time favorite movie  ever and that is saying a lot very very well done great characters great lines excellent cinematography  cant say enough about it loved it
Jun 23 2012,positive,awesome adventure worth seeing again and again
Jun 23 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for the dvd
Jun 23 2012,positive,omg joss whedon you were put on earth to make this movie plus firefly
Jun 23 2012,positive,second only to the dark knight in the superhero genre  i saw it twice in one week havent done that since major league
Jun 23 2012,positive,the avengers is a very enjoyable and entertaining film however it fails to really give you a chance to do the characters justice furthermore the 45 minute actiongasm gets tiring after awhile loved the melding of comedy and action but could have used a little more down to earth character movies i give a b additionally loki was a very boring villain haha marvel needs to work on doing their villains some justice take heed from the dark knight joss whedon
Jun 23 2012,positive,loved it action packed funny and overall very entertaining
Jun 23 2012,positive,remember how much fun going to the movies used to be if not the avengers will bring you back to when expectations were lower and movies just seemed better  its surprisingly that good and effectively sets a new standard for the comic book movie genre joss whedon really did marvel proud on this one creating a movie appropriately better than any of the standalone character films the whole production was a total success not because of the talented cast tight script and clean plot but also because it never pretends to be something that its not nor does it ever attempt to take itself too seriously there is no false advertising here as what you see is what you getthat being the perfect summer action movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,saw it in 3damazing i loved it nuff said
Jun 23 2012,positive,fantastic visual effects great comedy from rdj   great character stories mark ruffalo was great as banner
Jun 23 2012,positive,ate all my popcorn all my favorite superheros playing well together
Jun 23 2012,positive,awesome true genius pure and simple
Jun 23 2012,positive,a very good looking action cgi effects laden movie  this is another endoftheworld apocalypse movie  there is virtually no dramatic tension in this adapted cartoonbased flic  the story is fully predictable  the dialogue however is very sharp  it is liberally spiced w comedic elements    the story and action do  unfold in an interesting and logical manner  some of the extraterrestrial space ships are peculiar  the smaller ones are open and chariotlike  the larger ones looked like metallic skeletal dinosaurinspired undulating living creatures  very odd  they could have been imagined better    it was an ok scifi flic  fun to watch but no dramatic or comedic substance to sink your teeth into
Jun 23 2012,positive,best superhero movie of all time
Jun 23 2012,positive,thats my secret captain im always angrythe hulk
Jun 23 2012,positive,this is one of my favorite movies absolutely spectacular great special effects awesome acting and its pretty long
Jun 23 2012,positive,this movie was great it was fun and good action sequences and came together well this movie had potential to flop but came together
Jun 23 2012,positive,could not have done a better job combining all the heroes  stories the storyline is solid keeping in mind its a comic book movie the special effects are incredible the best for me was the comedic moments throughout the movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,this movie was awesome
Jun 23 2012,positive,what a great movie i hope to get the chance to see it a few more times
Jun 23 2012,positive,late review  this movie definitely goes on my alltime favorite list  it will be very tough for marveldisney to top this with a sequel  nothing much else needs to be said other then see it in 3d  the depth of the scenes in 3d really make the characters pop off the screen  of course the incredible hulk steals the show and his scenes were extremely powerful  if you havenâtmt all ready run to go see this movie in 3d
Jun 23 2012,positive,i love this movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,best movie i have been to this year must see
Jun 23 2012,positive,awesome hilarious action packed instant block buster nuf said
Jun 23 2012,positive,awesome visual and storyline digitally the hulk steals the show
Jun 23 2012,positive,good fun  not as gritty as i like my comic book heroes but a fun and enjoyable romp through superdom
Jun 23 2012,positive,freaking awesome show cant wait for the dvd
Jun 23 2012,positive,i am generally not interested in action movies but if its done perfect for the genre it is done perfect
Jun 23 2012,positive,fun  needs a big screen
Jun 23 2012,positive,wickedly entertaining
Jun 23 2012,positive,great movie tons of action pulls so many characters together
Jun 23 2012,positive,probably the best superhero movie i have ever seen great acting great action great cgi great movie especially the incredible action scene in the end i just love this movie soooo much
Jun 23 2012,positive,ive since changed my stance on this one its the best marvel adaptation to date the first iron man is now in 2nd place
Jun 23 2012,positive,this is a kool movie and funny too
Jun 23 2012,positive,there are very few things that i would change about this movie and those few things i cant put my finger on this movie is wonderful for fans of the marvel superheros and those who arent  there was actually quite a bit of comedic parts  i enjoyed myself as you can tell  
Jun 23 2012,positive,loud fast clever and fun i like that
Jun 23 2012,positive,exceptional blockbuster invigorating and entertaining
Jun 23 2012,positive,loved it best movie ever  33
Jun 23 2012,positive,as a new person to the marvel universe this movie is excellent humor and action is mixed perfectly and the heroes linked together through a series of preleaded movies however a disappointment to the longstanding marvel fans due to lack of  the original story and characters to say of that is why it is a hit because most people love the new marvel and its characters hopefully a sequel to this will put in some missed characters
Jun 23 2012,positive,best film ive seen this year
Jun 23 2012,positive,amazing movie must see it regardless age or gender
Jun 23 2012,positive,best action thrill ever
Jun 23 2012,positive,joss has done it again manhatten has never been so superbly thrashed nor saved and each of the superheroes gets their time in the spotlight i can find no fault with this movie other than that there was not enough of it p
Jun 23 2012,positive,the combination of the group made this a great action film with a fantastic story and great character interaction
Jun 23 2012,negative,absolute rubbish horrible dialogue with jokes as if written for a 10 year old hulk scene comes to mind
Jun 23 2012,positive,taking a bunch of superheroes and putting them into one movie wouldve been a disaster however in this case the avengers is an action packed extravaganza with a script that manages to treat the story and its characters with care
Jun 23 2012,positive,okay action adventure comic based movies are always on the line with me  i love the iron man movies and the last batman movie  on the other hand i hated the 1980s batman movies and the hulk movies have just been a disappointment  then again loved the spiderman movies  as you can see on the line  i am alright with this movie  there is some good eye candy with the thor and captain america characters  that is worth admission price itself  the action at the end goes on a little long for me  also the hawk character jeremy renner was briefly in the thor movie but i feel he never was really developed like the other characters   on the other hand black widow scarlett jo hanson steals every seen she is in  action hero fans and marvel comic fans will not be disappointed there is great acting and a good storyline which make the movie enjoyable  its worth admission price and the up charge for 3d based on the action  i would have to get a really good price to buy on dvd and really have no desire to see it again
Jun 23 2012,positive,this movie was fantastic one of the best movies ive seen in a long time hands down i would pay to go watch it again
Jun 23 2012,positive,very well done i often felt it should have been titled iron man 3 maybe the other super heroes deserve bigger supporting roles
Jun 23 2012,negative,in the theatre people were laughing at the jokes and sounded like they really liked it i found the acting dreadful the story silly and the jokes were dreadful an ode to we got to save the world for country and king sort of nonsense to me  of all the comic book movies i have seen this was almost as bad as the fantastic four which was so dreadful as to put me to sleep  another one this bad and may swear off the genre completely
Jun 23 2012,positive,succeeds on all levels action story effects comedy and best of all the characters only thing left to say hulk smash
Jun 23 2012,neutral,hmmm captain america 15 iron man 25 thor 15 hulk er 1 again look its super hero guff and nonsense an excuse for cgi ejaculations for the most part that can carry the movie so long as the in jokes are flowing and they occasionally do so but it feels like a movie thats started 30 minutes too late its not often i feel this disoriented trying to work out the back story despite having seen all the requisite marvel movies prior to this one meh some things really irked me too hulk becomes a good guy hawk bangs his head and returns to normal black widows woeful lines about a red ledger nick furys annoying secondincommand everything loki etc
Jun 23 2012,positive,best movie ever cant wait for the sequel
Jun 23 2012,positive,very well dow movie the language was clean there is no sex and the dialogue was witty a crisp fresh taste of good quality movie in this long famine of quality film
Jun 23 2012,positive,was happy to see how all the characters came together for this one robert downey jr still outshone the rest as iron man 3ed it
Jun 23 2012,negative,i understand why some enjoy this movie  joss whedon always breathes life into characters to make the audience identify with or feel as the characters do but even he couldnt save this 200 minute long action sequence
Jun 23 2012,positive,i have seen it two times and i would see it a third time
Jun 23 2012,positive,love this movie special effects were awesome and the cast works perfectly together a greatly executed movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,best super hero movie in years joss whedon can do no wrong
Jun 23 2012,positive,watch it buy it and love it
Jun 23 2012,positive,what can i say except its pure amazingness nuff said
Jun 23 2012,negative,predictable and idiotic

Jun 23 2012,positive,wow just wow definitely worth the wait the characters were entertaining theres a character for everyone i like hawkeye for some reason i honestly have just 1 problem for a movie 2 hours and 22 minutes it feels a bit empty otherwise i recommend this to anyone
Jun 23 2012,positive,i have been waiting for this movie forever and when i finally saw it it did not dissapoint it was like a dream come true
Jun 23 2012,positive,pure satisfaction from beginning to ending

Jun 23 2012,positive,joss whedon aces this  a bit long but extremely entertaining throughout none the less
Jun 23 2012,positive,not as great as everyone else seems to think good not great
Jun 23 2012,positive,i walked into the theater expecting a pretty mediocre movie i never watched any of the other marvel universe movies iron man 12 thor hulk etc and wasnt really interested in ever watching them in the future but the avengers struck a chord with me great dialogue great cgi and intensely satisfying teamwork moments i had no trouble following the story this movie surpassed all of my expectations and kept my full attention from beginning to end i have now started watching the other movies however at the moment the avengers is definitely the best
Jun 23 2012,positive,great movie action pack and funny  seen movie twice
Jun 23 2012,positive,typical comic book plot points hold it back from 5 outa 5
Jun 23 2012,positive,fun movie  lots of action
Jun 23 2012,positive,i hope they make  a  2nd one
Jun 23 2012,positive,this is a really great action movie i thought it was action packed from beginning to end
Jun 23 2012,positive,its been said 1000 times the avengers is the perfect comic book movie it has action comedy and the characters are ripped directly from the pages
Jun 23 2012,positive,a movie ive been waiting for as long as i can remember that still somehow doesnt disappoint
Jun 23 2012,positive,loved it fun movie to watch
Jun 23 2012,positive,i enjoyed this film in almost every way  i didnt see the point of having the black widow in it though
Jun 23 2012,positive,aside from the whole thorloki story this movie was very good effects in 3d action and acting  only other nit was that it would have been nice to see ed norton reprise his hulk role but mark ruffalo did a very good job and it was nice to see hulk still look somewhat like dr banner
Jun 23 2012,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this film love the hulk
Jun 23 2012,positive,top 5 movie for entertainment  ever
Jun 23 2012,neutral,not what i expected thought it was cheesy and like the actors didnt know what to do
Jun 23 2012,positive,one of the best movie i have ever seen amazing 
Jun 23 2012,positive,wow just so much fun the effects are super worth a watch
Jun 23 2012,positive,slow beginning but really picks up in the last half of the movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,the best marvels movie so far combining all the superheroes together with their own characteristic always exciting the action is very top notch but the villain is kinda weak not is power but in personality i grown to love every superheroes from this movie cant wait for the sequel
Jun 23 2012,positive,short version     everything a superhero movie should be      an incredible movie both in terms of writing and effects  equal parts emotion and action meshed together perfectly  my only extremely small complaint is that certain elements the ending is a tiny bit contrived but its not enough to be anything close to a deal breaker  enjoyable for both huge comic book fans and people who will never pick up a comic     the long version     i am a huge comic nerd particularly marvel comics but i know that many people arent  this movie makes marvel comicsthe avengers seemingly endless mythos accesible to anyone the avengers comic book series has been running since 1963  it evens out some of the more insane elements of it comic book nerds know the kind of thing im talking about and im too embarrassed for the industry to highlight some of the more baffling arcs of the 49 years of issues      the casting is perfect its hard to pick who is the best among them if i actually lavished praise the way they deserve i wouldnt be able to fit this review in the allotted number of words allowed  the characters are believable and human even with their superpowerssuitsspecial agent training  each character is unique and given time to shine testament to this is the fact that upon leaving the theatre my four friends and i all had different favorite characters and enough material from the movie to backup our choices      plot wise the stakes are high but conceivable im not generally a fan of the marvelverses aliens but in this they work  my only complaint is that some elements of the ending seem a bit contrived  although the movies runningtime passes the two hour mark it neither feels too long or too rushed  the avengers never drags the pacing is pretty much perfect  emotional scenes are given the time they need to progress and grow organically the high tension scenes are allowed to get downright anxietyproducing and the action scenes get the adrenaline going like no other movie in recent memory    theres one thing that i really appreciated as someone who lives in new york city for most of the year at least  the city in which the avengers end up fighting is actually new york rather than just an anonymous city with the empire state building chucked in  movies and tv frequently use establishing shots to show famous landmarks to set the scene the brooklyn bridge the chrysler building the met life building and of course the empire state building but on street level the sets are obvious replicas built elsewhere anonymous cities without the unique feel of new york i know every city has its own vibe and they generally suffer similarly  but in the avengers our heroes fight nearin the actual architecture and not just the most famous landmarks  the filmmakers and the avengers themselves even think use manhattans grid in their tactics  its brilliant although streetviewarchitectural accuracy may seem incredibly minor it really made a big difference to me  it made everything more real
Jun 23 2012,positive,exceeded expectations and also a riot  story well what would you expect from it in this movie
Jun 23 2012,positive,the best superhero action in any movie ever made
Jun 23 2012,positive,this is a busy movie in the best way possible whedon manages to give us a visual spectacle without sacrificing character developement made by a fan for the fans
Jun 23 2012,positive,good movie and want to see again but to be honest a tiny bit predictable in some parts and slightly cheesy
Jun 23 2012,positive,they went in depth and also loaded this movie with tons of action
Jun 23 2012,positive,its the epic superhero crossover movie of all time especially with all the iconic marvel super heroes comes together like thor captain america the incredible hulk iron man hawkeye and black widow  the story is amazing the cast played their roles well and not to mention  everything else it has was cool too  810
Jun 23 2012,positive,one of a handful of comic book inspired movies that i actually liked almost as good as spiderman  batman  iron man first one i liked that didnt have the word man in it well cast  hard to predict it was best when tony stark  pepper potts were on screen because those two actors are awesome missed total perfection because i could never figure out whowhat that female super hero was doing there what was her power what was her relationship to the rest of the gang other than that i loved just about everything about the avengers
Jun 23 2012,positive,awesome if you havent seen it your missing out people
Jun 23 2012,positive,off the chain fabulous  nothing else can be said
Jun 22 2012,positive,cant wait for the next one
Jun 22 2012,positive,it was the best movie ever
Jun 22 2012,positive,even better than i thought itd be the introduction of loki in the beginning was fastpaced and exciting then it slowed down quite a bit into a wellacted drama more good action and then slow drama again finally the last quarter was actionpacked the movie gives all heros involved good time to shine and neglects none of them i was totally sold at loki being a very credible villain even more than he was in the movie thor
Jun 22 2012,positive,finally im suprised how good it is even with having many heroes at ones a great marvel flick this should be an example for xmen
Jun 22 2012,positive,one of if not the best superhero movies ever made funny entertaining mentally stimulating yet easy to follow
Jun 22 2012,positive,excellent film for everyone
Jun 22 2012,positive,great plot great acting and excellent directing you never get the sense that any of the actors are attempting to out perform each other like many i believe the hulk stole the show highly recommend seeing it once twice or even three times
Jun 22 2012,positive,great movie everyone looks fantastic
Jun 22 2012,positive,awesome action movie
Jun 22 2012,positive,imho its not one of joss whedons best writings eg lacked some of his clever dialogue but overall the movies entertaining  scarlett johanssons character was cool i liked watching her kick ass  tom hiddleston loki was as much of a standout as he was in thor
Jun 22 2012,positive,usual good guys vs really bad guy  plenty of action and cool effects
Jun 22 2012,positive,great movie a few times where i was like ehhh but all in all great summer flick i felt iron man was better
Jun 22 2012,neutral,its always nice to see all of the heroes got together
Jun 22 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ever made period
Jun 22 2012,negative,good overrated though which kills it but its very entertaining
Jun 22 2012,positive,so amazing brilliant funny just amazing movie

Jun 22 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this one  great action and great integration of the different characters into the plot line
Jun 22 2012,positive,this we was one of the most cinematic movies of the year
Jun 22 2012,positive,joss whedon was given a hard task take different characters from different movies all consisting of different tones writers directors and producers and make them mesh he did that and some this was easily the best iron man movie the best captain america movie the best hulk movie and the best thor movie why because joss whedon was a comic book writer he knows what these movies need and did it so epic in my eyes top 5 movies of all time if not the best movie of all time
Jun 22 2012,positive,wonderful and action packed
Jun 22 2012,positive,excellent superhero film  but dont expect the story line or seriousness you get with the dark knight series  very different type of movie  if you like superhero films go see it
Jun 22 2012,positive,way more comedy than i suspected a nice surprise
Jun 22 2012,negative,not at all important or amazing done for the bill
Jun 22 2012,positive,before seeing this film i insisted that i didnt like superhero movies the avengers seriously changed my mind awesome
Jun 22 2012,positive,lots of fun  great action and effects  love the one liners
Jun 22 2012,positive,i loved this film it hit all the marks for me action packed a decent storyline iron man  thor im just hoping when they make the next one its not a let down like some sequels can be this film has made my top 20 and will be spending extra money to have it on blu ray
Jun 22 2012,positive,amazing movie loved every second it was like they took every good fighting scene out of each movie and brought them together loved it and it even brought some comedy into the mix mark ruffalo did a great job as the new hulk i was skeptical at first to see if he could pull it offf but he did a great job great movie
Jun 22 2012,positive,loved loved loved it oh did i say i loved it a must see not just a one time view
Jun 22 2012,positive,simply put amazing
Jun 22 2012,positive,best movie ever  thats all i have to say
Jun 22 2012,positive,i like it i had some though on it but thats it
Jun 22 2012,positive,very good summer action movie  good mix of actioneffects comedy character development as far as superheros go  again though i would like to be more critical of films in the sense of holding films and filmmakers to higher standards and making each star worth more  i would actually have preferred to give it 3 star  however due to the excessive amount cinematic crap that is in theaters these days another star was warranted
Jun 22 2012,positive,superb absolutely amazing a must watch for every marvel comics fan 
Jun 22 2012,positive,what can i say that hasnt already been said about this movie its a near perfect movie for this genre they built up each of these characters in their own respective movies or tied in at least as secondary characters and then brought them together in a believable and awesome way you could only hope they could put together something this good and i hope dc is taking notes this is the way you make a comic book come to my life the stand out is easily the hulk wow is mark ruffalo good as this character his wit and dry humor stands toe to toe with robert downey jrs iron man and thats no easy task i thought ed norton had hit the nail on the head with his hulk but this was way better than that and thats saying something keep up the good work marvel
Jun 22 2012,positive,would have been hard to screw this movie up
Jun 22 2012,positive,second best movie ever
Jun 22 2012,positive,the best super hero movie  it has humor wit action adrenaline every character gets their time to shine its a very fun movie and a definite must see in imax 3d

Jun 22 2012,positive,the best marvel comic movie so far  each herovillain didnt take away too much screen time from each other  waiting for avengers 2
Jun 22 2012,positive,thank you joss whedon you and your crew have done something that was near impossible make an ensemble superhero movie with a perfect mix of action and clever storytelling well clever in a silly sort of way the film does rely on the individual films before to flesh out the characters but its worth it a rock concert of memorable moments from the whole team
Jun 22 2012,positive,just wow well worth it not just one the best comic book movies ever but one the best action movies ever
Jun 22 2012,positive,action packed movie and had humor as well keeps you at the edge of your seat fun movie to watch

Jun 22 2012,positive,really good and respectful of the franchise  loved it when loki and the hulk went at it
Jun 22 2012,positive,the only way you wouldnt like this movie is if you didnt like to have fun
Jun 22 2012,positive,one of the best superhero movies ever made  even with the very large cast whedon magnificently builds all the characters and actually builds an emotional connection to them  it is a fantastic action movie and can still be enjoyed even by noncomic book readers
Jun 22 2012,positive,super movie with super heroes best movie ive seen in years
Jun 22 2012,positive,this movie is so awsome
Jun 22 2012,positive,fantastic action a great ride
Jun 22 2012,positive,awesome movie definitely would go see it again
Jun 22 2012,positive,i didnt think it could be done  the culmination of multiple origin movies actually works  well written dialogue and amazing action sequences oh and the hulk was hilarious
Jun 22 2012,positive,the most fun i had in scifi movies since transformers dark of the moon
Jun 22 2012,negative,the last 30 minutes saved this movie but the first half bored me to tears
Jun 22 2012,neutral,begining was boring had some good action parts
Jun 22 2012,positive,great movie my son and i would watch this everyday

Jun 22 2012,positive,up there on my list of memorable comic book movies
Jun 22 2012,negative,this movie was a complete letdown it was so disappointing it was boring and cheesy i was completely psyched  to watch this movie since i am a fan and i thank god the the lady behind me was so clueless that i laughed alot in every comment she had to say if it wasnt for her this movie wouldve been complete torture only te last 30mins of the film where good the other 1hr  30min horrible
Jun 22 2012,positive,i give it a 98100 it was epic my plan is to see it 10 times in theaters before it goes out on dvd the only thing was that it was a little slow in the beginning but other than that it was spectacular its all 4 of my favorite movies combined
Jun 22 2012,positive,it was a great movie
Jun 22 2012,positive,whedons group dialogue and an amazing performance from mark ruffalo as a character thats often portrayed as pure ham make this certainly one of the best films of 2012 and a contender for best comic book adaption
Jun 22 2012,positive,excellent movie great collection of marvel franchises
Jun 22 2012,negative,predictable  slightly interesting  missable
Jun 22 2012,negative,the only good thing about this movie is its comedic moments otherwise its long sloppy and shallow a truly good superhero movie can move you to tears ie gordons anguish about harvey dents fall from grace in the dark knight this movie lacked any sort of emotional depth i dont know two of these characters black widow hawkeye have no attachment to ruffalo as hulk and hardly fear the skinny egocentric loki this movie was generic and underwhelming
Jun 22 2012,positive,the most fun ive had at the movies in a long time joss whedon you are a god among men
Jun 22 2012,positive,a brilliant and fast paced action with great development on all characters a must see
Jun 22 2012,positive,very well done movie had an absolute blast watching it and i look forward to avengers two already
Jun 22 2012,positive,cant wait until this sunday avengers assemble
Jun 21 2012,positive,joss whedon superheroes  act iii  that is all
Jun 21 2012,positive,so fantastic movie this movie had the power to stay me be sited at my sit oh what a movie it was i wish to watch it again it had the action comedy sometimes fun thriller most amazing scene was when hulk throw loki again and again ha ha ha hulk did so much comedy end the end of the movie so good
Jun 21 2012,positive,coming from a very serious reader of these characters from their source material i couldnt stop grinning at every scene and line of dialog finally someone nailed the comicbook movie fitting that it would be joss whedon
Jun 21 2012,positive,performances were greatespecially iron manit was a great mix between comedy and actiona must see
Jun 21 2012,positive,good job marvel keep it going till the infinity gantlet love the new camera angles ie driver view of cars flipping over good chemistry between actors even if iron man is the leader hulk stole the show
Jun 21 2012,positive,all i gotta say is if you havent seen this movie something is very wrong with you this movie really brings out the inner kid in you with laughs in every corner
Jun 21 2012,positive,funny i like the hulk and robert downey jr
Jun 21 2012,positive,amazing superheroes assembled
Jun 21 2012,positive,pure awesome enough said
Jun 21 2012,positive,great special effects and action
Jun 21 2012,positive,awsome movie really loved it
Jun 21 2012,positive,loads of fun and action which makes the improbably plot passable  was a real fun to watch  must see in 3d its the first movie ive seen that takes cinematography shots with 3d in mind  you will be missing out watching 2d
Jun 21 2012,positive,one of the best movies ever love the action and humor
Jun 21 2012,positive,awesome movie great graphics have really enjoyed the recent comic book movies  ever one seems to get better
Jun 21 2012,positive,a little slow to start but when the action hits man does it hit hard
Jun 21 2012,positive,saw it first day  my favorite movie 
Jun 21 2012,positive,its good but whedons fetish for killing fan favorites puts a damper on this otherwise great film
Jun 21 2012,positive,got around seeing this it was pretty good captain america is kind of a bitch
Jun 21 2012,positive,best movie ever this generations star wars
Jun 21 2012,positive,loved the movie only have small very few take aways from the movie but it is the best movie of the year so far just waiting for gothams reckoning now
Jun 21 2012,neutral,wasnt really for me  but it was definitely well made
Jun 21 2012,positive,i went and saw this with friends the night of my friends and mine open house loved it saw it again a month later with my dad and stayed for the extra scenes at the end it was well worth the wait
Jun 21 2012,positive,well worth the wait
Jun 21 2012,positive,in a word awesome best movie ive seen in a long time and a new favorite it definitely lived up to the hype and my expectations there arent many movies worthy of 5 stars from me but id give this one 10 if i could
Jun 21 2012,positive,for a movie that had a 5 movie build up  it had such a big chance of being a major disapointment good thing for us a great director was signed and it could very possibly the best super herocomic movie out there great story great action great characters finally the hulk was done right
Jun 21 2012,positive,probably the second best superhero movie of all time behind the dark knight the dialogue was great and the action and visuals were aweinspiring
Jun 21 2012,positive,the movie was awesome and at times funny love the hulk in this movie
Jun 21 2012,positive,a perfect summer blockbuster the first act has to pick up steam but once it does its an unstoppable rocket
Jun 21 2012,positive,being a comic book geek i have one thing to say to all involved in creating this movie thank you you deserve every penny you make from this
Jun 21 2012,positive,i love all the avenger and i know all of there custome the hulk iron man black widow banner jarvis the captain and captain america i think that is their costume
Jun 21 2012,positive,cool story not a superhero fan loved the music
Jun 21 2012,negative,i see a lot of reviewers who are seemingly scared to write their honest feelings about this movie for fear of public scorn  either that or they simply should not be writing reviews and found their way into the wrong job through some morbid twist of fate or other  if you want runofthemill action with the same runofthemill action plot  script but with up to date effects then this is a good film  but dont expect anything more than a modern day cliche for the same old mundane seen it a million times generic crap
Jun 21 2012,positive,love downey and hiddleston
Jun 21 2012,positive,i was really not looking forward to this thinking it would be just as bad as the other marvel movies released recently but it turned out to be one of the best movies i had ever seen
Jun 21 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies ever made and thats saying a lot considering they had to mash up four main characters cant wait for the sequel
Jun 21 2012,positive,a must see for anyone wgo hasnt seen it yet
Jun 21 2012,positive,if your a person that loves movies with action this is definetly the movie for you
Jun 21 2012,positive,action packed consistently funny and displays the super heroes like never before the avengers is sure to please everyone
Jun 21 2012,positive,i really enjoyed the continuing character development as well as the exciting action if you dont stick around after the credits of marvel movies youre missing out
Jun 21 2012,positive,seen it twice freaking awesome even my wife  kid liked it
Jun 21 2012,positive,was pretty good too long dont think i would give it 93 maybe 80
Jun 21 2012,positive,this was really good cant wait for the next one
Jun 21 2012,positive,at the end of the day i guess its exactly what i expected
Jun 21 2012,positive,probably the most fun ive had at the movies since i was a kid  a smart and entertaining film filled with great characters  not only did avengers meet its expectations but the film somehow exceeded it
Jun 21 2012,positive,great film like another iron man film but hes got a whole badass team this time
Jun 21 2012,positive,this movie validates a majority of the nerd communitys existence as if the nerds are all out there saying see i told you the avengers could fit into modern context and still be freaking awesome kudos to the top heads in this one it must have been tricky trying to fit together all these peoples storeis no matter how farfetched some of them seemed when they first came out in their own movies and they pulled it off really well in terms of the summer movie season this movie definitely kicks it all off with a bang hilarious actiony lots of great character moments plenty of tony stark witty banter its a visual wonder and every bit is great to watch i recommend this movie for just about anyone interested in it and who can get past the pg13 rating enjoy
Jun 21 2012,positive,the avengers is a truley awsome movie  the movie is action packed it deserves the 1 billion dollers it got  and all the good reviews
Jun 21 2012,positive,great movie saw it several times
Jun 21 2012,positive,marvels the avengers had every possibility of going horrendously wrong typically incompatible characters were somehow blended together into a balanced amalgamation of humour and action a couple of the characters were uninteresting enough to be lost in the mayhem but nobody cares
Jun 21 2012,positive,great movie a must see funny actionpacked and one of my top 5
Jun 21 2012,positive,one of the best comic book adaptions ive seen joss did a stellar job of giving each hero enough screen time and the humour is fantastic
Jun 21 2012,positive,good once every part of the storyline is set starts real slow and the 3d was not all that great
Jun 21 2012,positive,a good movie just dont watch it with tdkr avengers has jokes puns and classic one liners good movie
Jun 21 2012,positive,lots of action fun and amusing as well
Jun 21 2012,positive,if this was a tv show it would be a rerun of captain america and iron man and just like when youre eating a salad gotta add a toss of bacon bits hulk wonton crisp hawkeye and whatever olive or something natasha i think thats her name  if it werent for the humor i would be lost in the dark forest forever  and now for my final say yes it will be watching a rerun on tv i have a really strong sixth sense feeling that im about to watch this again real soon
Jun 21 2012,positive,wow what a wild ride this was i love marvel  beautifully shot sexy characters  a twist of humour like no other
Jun 21 2012,positive,good movie but completely overrated
Jun 21 2012,positive,i loved this movie it made me so happy

Jun 20 2012,positive,this ladies and gentlemen is a marvel masterpiece awesome story and sweet action  has brilliant special effects
Jun 20 2012,positive,this is a great ensemble movie there is plenty of action which moves the plot alibf
Jun 20 2012,positive,come on the whole world knows itthe best super hero movie everso far dark knight rises coming soon ps i had a shawarma today it was the bombi need to find tony starks yelp account
Jun 20 2012,positive,started with a bang and kept on rolling from there with an amazing cast and an actionpacked plot

Jun 20 2012,positive,joss whedon delivers
Jun 20 2012,positive,loved robert downey jr as always
Jun 20 2012,positive,amazing movie  loved every minute of it 
Jun 20 2012,positive,such a great movie not only did it have great actors but it also more or less followed the proper story keeping true to its origins it had great visual effects with an overall mindblowing feeling to it it is definitely a mustsee
Jun 20 2012,positive,one of the best comic book movies ever made there is a lot to praise here despite its epic scope the film never falls apart from its lofty ambitions partly because its packed with likeable performances and some of the funniest dialogue ever uttered in a superhero flick it takes itself seriously but just enough the film is also well aware of what it is which is at its core a highly entertaining albeit emotionally shallow superhero teamup flick on a technical level this is a significant achievement particularly the revamped cgi hulk who is several steps beyond his digital cinematic predecessors it should get oscar noms for sound editing sound mixing and visual effects but probably not anything else given current academy trends
Jun 20 2012,positive,the guys look good that was i candy for me  d even though my bf is staring at me right now but its true 1005 for that movie cant wait for the second one the hulk was hilarious may i add d
Jun 20 2012,negative,america is entirely on crack this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen virtually unwatchable liked iron man  this was atrocious
Jun 20 2012,positive,maybe im biased since i dont have a thing for superhero movies but i thought it was an ok movie in essence it was a thor sequel with a bunch of random superheroes thrown in im slightly disappointed that this film is ranked 3rd as the highest grossing films of all time though it wasnt really anything special about it
Jun 20 2012,positive,really a great movie however if you have not seen any of the other marvel movies i would suggest watching them before hand or at least watch thor
Jun 20 2012,positive,all i can say is awsome

Jun 20 2012,neutral,i just didnt understand why i was the only one in the entire 300 crowd of people sitting in the imax theater who wasnt getting the jokes whats so funny about captain america and thor fighting each other hello
Jun 20 2012,positive,i actually saw the a avengers on opening night but ive been away from writing reviews on here for a while hence the delay in this    i think ill review the avengers in four different aspects the characters contentstory action and execution    the characters i have never seen a spin off movie that takes so many different and diverse characters from other franchises puts them together and still maintains the continuity of all the characters as individuals while also giving them a great amount of development which makes them feel like they come from the same universe you have thor a demi god captain america a super soldier from a different time and age iron man a modern day narcicistplayboybillionairephilanthropoistgenius in a high tech suit of armor bruce bannerhulkwell go into more depth on him momentarily an exiled manbeast with anger issues two top assassins hawkeye and widow and all of them are more different than the sun is from the moon but theyve all been tied together so well by sgt nick fury of shield agent coulson and the other shield operatives that they feel like they all are apart of the same cohesive whole in short i have never seen a movie that takes so many well developed characters and stays true to their origins while making them feel fresh and interesting    nowi love me some iron man cap and thorbut i have to give only one character some major props in this movie review     the hulk i love the hulk and have been disappointed to an extent with the other two hulk movies the first was too mellow dramatic dark and story driven lacking action the second felt too unrealistic and the hulk looked like a abrecrombie model painted green and given an extra does of steroids but thisthis is the hulk movie first off ruffalo pulls of the mild mannered bruce banner so well he over shadows bana and norton by a mile in my opinion secondly the hulk himself not only looks like both the comics version and mark ruffalo finally a hulk that looks like the actor that plays him but he has the best action scenes and overall best scenes in general in the whole movie bar none spoiler alert    when the hulk bashes loki into the ground and refers to him as puny godi could watch that over and over for 2 hours straight    nowthe last thing on the characters in the movie i wanna mention refers to the aforementioned loki    loki i thought tom hiddleston was the best and most memorable part of thor and hes def the highlight of the avengers when it comes to the bad guys loki is such a well done villain you sympathize for him in a way but you know he must be stopped and hes fun to watch in all ways       contentstory i really was pleased with how faithful to the comics this story was using elements from the first issue of the original avengers with loki as the primary villain and combining that with the use of the chitauri armies which also segways into an awesome possibility for a sequel by including the tease of thanos in the end credits genius the big kicker for me with the story however is how well the team involved in writing this story did at meshing all the various story elements that led up to the avengers from the other separate character films mt hats off to the writers and the director joss whedon on making such an interesting and funepic story    action i have never seen a movie that handles action so well a good combination of well coreographed fight scenes plenty of explosions but not in that mindless michael bay style good cg elements and clever sets with breathtaking environments and situations the avengers delivers in a way that should make future action films stand at attention and take note    execution this is the overall shining point of the avengers all these elements are fantastic and make the movie a classic on their own the characters the memorable story and action they all rock your socks off but how the creative team actors and all other members involved with the production of this film took all these elements and brought them together into a very well made tightly knit epic movie going eperience that will go down as an instant classic and groundbreaking feat in comic book films    all in all i obviously am giving the avengers 100 ive never seen a movie that does what it did so well before and i hope that they take the same level of care and enthusiasm as well as the same amount of time for the sequel as they did with the original looking forward to more from the avengers if you havent gone to see it yet get out there
Jun 20 2012,positive,hulk done smashwell done mr whedon well done
Jun 20 2012,positive,best comic book film ever made enough said
Jun 20 2012,positive,epicthat is all i can say
Jun 20 2012,positive,awesome movie  it was action packed from begining to end also funny

Jun 20 2012,positive,perfect springsummer blockbuster  im a big fan of netflix but films like this still make theaters relevant and worth the expense
Jun 20 2012,positive,love this movie the hulk steals it
Jun 20 2012,positive,definetely raises the bar for superhero movies
Jun 20 2012,positive,of the films leading up to this one this one surely takes the cake as the best of the  avengers series of films  the only issue i would have is that if i was a viewer who hadnt seen the films leading up to this one then i would be confused about the characters in the film and why sheild  would pick them over other heroes in the marvel universe  if a sequel is made heres to hoping studio companies allow marvel characters to be shared because it would be awesome to add in certain characters like spiderman and some of the xmen to the avengers team
Jun 20 2012,positive,the movie had loads of connections to better explain the movies more  therefore a lot of fighting was on there and thats good  people love action scenes and they made it all in there  also the movie has a good sense of humor  robert downey jr did fantastic in the film as iron man and the props were perfectly made  i hope you enjoy the movie
Jun 20 2012,positive,awesomenessthat is all i can say
Jun 20 2012,positive,probably one of the best movies i have seen in a long time with awesome fighting scenes great effects  and very witty humor the only complaint is the fact that they didnt show more of hawkeye or make him his own movie  he is definitely one of my favorite characters in the avenger movie i hope they will develop his character more or at least make like an origin movie for him or something
Jun 20 2012,positive,avengers sparkles right there to its starkest gleam with its dialogue and authentic humor and lives manic energy with ginormous set pieces like the quantum of gamma of tesserac
Jun 20 2012,positive,excellent movie  one of the best movies ive seen in a long time i would recommend rewatching or watching thor and captain america and as they did with other marvel movies stay until the end of the credits  there are 2 extra scenes during and after the credits
Jun 20 2012,positive,saw it twice it was an action packed film from the beginning to the end so thats why i rated it five stars
Jun 20 2012,positive,awesome and action packed
Jun 20 2012,positive,the plot is slow and boring but the part that i like when they fight it looks really cool
Jun 20 2012,positive,its awesome i seen it plus on the other hand it has comedy too
Jun 20 2012,neutral,i dont see what all the fuss is about theres more to movies than comics when will the world realise this this movie was severely average
Jun 20 2012,positive,action was in almost every seen i wish the hulk would have gotten meaner
Jun 20 2012,positive,awesome loved seeing all of these characters together makes waiting for their next individual movies a little less painful
Jun 20 2012,positive,i did see it it was a cool movie every

Jun 19 2012,positive,it was amazing ive seen it twice since the midnight premier
Jun 19 2012,positive,this is the greatest movie i have ever seen
Jun 19 2012,positive,only joss wheadon could make this happen for a movie to bring about and fully realize a team of characters such as the avengers who better than the author of one of marvels best team based runsastonishing xmen wheadon brings to life a team of superhero misfits so organically it really is amazing to behold because of that we got more than just a movie where people in tight suits blow aliens upwhich the movie does really well also making the nonaction just as interesting as the fights
Jun 19 2012,positive,great combo of action and comedy
Jun 19 2012,positive,best movie of the year so far no contest
Jun 19 2012,positive,mmm k can we talk about the gay we are using gwyneth to cover up in this movie
Jun 19 2012,positive,great movie cannot wait until sequel
Jun 19 2012,positive,a little long bug overall pretty good movie
Jun 19 2012,positive,great movie starts off very very slow but ends with a smash
Jun 19 2012,positive,good movie kinda slow at times but definitely worth watching many more times in the future this is a must buy though if you dont have it right now get off your ass and go get it
Jun 19 2012,positive,it is definitely a must go fast paced action movie and has a plot that will continually interest you keeps your attention and contains a lot of comic relief or just flat out comedy
Jun 19 2012,positive,well done i think joss has stepped things up for this one and i like the fact they went more in depth with black widow and hawkeye
Jun 19 2012,positive,excellent effects acting  heroics
Jun 19 2012,positive,i really enjoyed the humorous mixed with the action
Jun 19 2012,positive,do you like action that taste likes cake and crack this movie is for you
Jun 19 2012,positive,great action and good comic hero hero fun
Jun 19 2012,positive,well i havent seen anything so good in a looooong time handsdown this is my fave movie of this year and probably even the last three years
Jun 19 2012,positive,worth the hype of a summer movie not worth 93
Jun 19 2012,positive,wow this is the best superhero movie ive seen this year its like a big wwe episode but with super hero asolid
Jun 19 2012,positive,this movie was freakin awesome i loved every minute of it it great action great story line it was just great i would so pay to see this movie again and i never do that
Jun 19 2012,positive,this movie was awesome theres is so much action my favorite part was when thor and hulk fought
Jun 19 2012,positive,fantastic film all characters worked well for the movie even the minor ones whedon did a great job directing pure entertainment
Jun 19 2012,positive,loved it  i grew up on the avengers  it was great to see them in action and eye candy to boot
Jun 19 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Jun 19 2012,positive,being of a film genre that doesnt usually attract my attention im glad i chose to join a friend for this fun ride with a great group of superheroes entertaining all the way
Jun 19 2012,positive,great all around i hated robert downing jr in iron man but everyone did great great action and its funny
Jun 19 2012,positive,best comic book movie ever i grew up collecting comic books and never thought id see an all star team like the avengers make it onto the screen let alone be as good as it was it was true to the spirit of the comic book had plenty of action and had the fun that is a necessity in making a comic book movie
Jun 19 2012,positive,dialog and fully humanized characters you can believe in and care for as only joss whedon can do the characters never get lost in the explosions as in some actions movies and each superhero has some spotlighted scenes where you can believe the movie is just about them then someone else shows up
Jun 19 2012,positive,i have watched it 5 times already
Jun 19 2012,positive,very funny easy to get into and the diolog was halarious
Jun 19 2012,positive,one of the top comic book movies to ever be released the movie was packed with humor action and most importantly disagrements between the avengers the movie had an outstanding cast but it diminished hawkeye my favorite avenger to a pointless character it focused too much on humor and was slow in some parts i give it 4 avengers out of 5
Jun 19 2012,positive,already seen it  thought it was very good it had some good action  an okay storyline
Jun 19 2012,neutral,a very overated superhero movie its a 710 the dark knight rises will be a much bettter movie
Jun 19 2012,positive,the greatest movie ever 13 year olds view iove this film i really cannot emphasise how great it is please dont miss this opportunity
Jun 19 2012,positive,the entire weight of this movie is founded upon the individual strengths of the indiviual movies leading up to this point so if you liked iron man thor captain america than you will have an absolute blast with this movie it is surprisingly funny and it is quite amazing how each hero was so well balanced in screen time and buttkickery alike my gripe with this movie is not with the movie itself but all choices leading up to it but whedon took lemons and made lemonade i will save my nerdy arguments about the actor choices for each hero their physiques costumes abilities personas back stories etc for a more appropriate audience but let me finish with this  considering its all we have its pretty damn good
Jun 19 2012,positive,favorite movie of all time
Jun 19 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Jun 19 2012,positive,the avengers takes everything good from the superhero action hit films and expands upon them so much so that i was nearly crying during this movie nearly losing my voice and sight from tears of laughter and even sitting in a monotone seriousness for other things   this movie was the best theater experience ive had yet the 3d while not too overbearing but also not nonexistent really was done well and beyond that the plot and characters were thought out perfectly for a movie of this magnitude in a movie theater movies are great because theyre on such a large screen but this one really put me in the film and made me enjoy spending my time and money to go to the cinemas i dub it best theater film ive seen not because i loved just the movie but because as an experience it was done right  i hate so much that the avengers took so long to come out because i have several friends who just plain dont like the superhero flicks because theyre cheesy or done wrong well let me tell you if all of them had seen this first there would be no comparison
Jun 19 2012,positive,a big comic book fan for years not anal dont mind changes different outfits ages or what is supossed to be from comics  from time to time someone gets it really right not only was i impressed about how much fun this movie was but i think people who dont even like comic book movies will like it has action humor great cgi acting and a decent story  women will love the cut men and men will love the sexy women  and when it takes off it never looks back as a comic book junky the action scenes were straight out of the comics  loved it saw 3 times already and would see it again
Jun 19 2012,positive,marvelmarvelmarvelhooray and about time  this time round the movie makers have done the superhero genre justice on their own only downeys iron man character stood out but in this movie all characters shone  great movie keep it up 5 stars here
Jun 19 2012,positive,watch it like seriously it is a totall must see omg

Jun 19 2012,positive,i enjoyed this movie but i feel there was too much hype and killed it a bit for me
Jun 19 2012,positive,seen it but would love to watch it again and again
Jun 19 2012,positive,dont know why everyone loved this one sooo much its too flawed the first 40 mins are completely boring
Jun 19 2012,positive,the greatest film i have ever seen the acting is flawless the dynamic of the cast can really be felt every character gets screentime good lines and action scenes tom hiddleston is perfection hes so beautiful and talented ive seen it 5 times will be seeing it more what i also liked was it was genuinely funny too just amazing go see it
Jun 19 2012,positive,waited for a long time for this one and it was well worth the wait best action movie i have seen in a long time will definitely be buying it when it comes out on dvd
Jun 19 2012,positive,my daughter saw this movie and said it was really awesome
Jun 19 2012,positive,i loved it it was a  awesome sci fi flick
Jun 19 2012,positive,greatest joss whedon movie ever made
Jun 19 2012,positive,a great film which has brought together all the superhereos of recent times the hulk is the best played character and provides nearly all the laughs i think captain amercia could have been portrayed a little better but overall still great
Jun 19 2012,negative,not enough fightingavengers is supposed to be fighting this movie had too much background on the characters
Jun 19 2012,positive,you know i only have one thing to say on marvels the avengers                  go see it
Jun 19 2012,positive,its a summer super hero film that shouldnt be missed   not a life changer but an entertaining way to spend 2 hours
Jun 19 2012,positive,best movie yet its at the top of my list
Jun 19 2012,positive,this movie was awesome
Jun 19 2012,positive,the second best superhero movie ever made
Jun 19 2012,positive,best movie ever just love rober downey jr in this move he is so funny
Jun 19 2012,positive,so good i watched it twice
Jun 19 2012,positive,amazing movie downright hilarious action packed and has a decent story line a must see
Jun 19 2012,positive,would i watch it again hell yeah
Jun 19 2012,positive,move over the dark knight we have a new best superhero movie candidate its been 4 more or less years since we saw mr robert downey jr as iron man and looking over like five movies of buildup i think we can agree that marvel has accomplished so much since 2008 weve got the invincible iron man the mighty thor first avenger captain america the incredible hulk and newcomers black widow and hawkeye who are even more badass in the comics of course i would be giving this movie a perfect score given the fact that im such a comic book maniac but if i were the average biased critic that hates superhero movies in general id say hey this is actually pretty damn good why is it so good anyway if youve been following the marvel movies since 2008 not counting xmen no offense to them then youll definitely be excited that these various superheroes are finally teaming up to stop a common foe really i cant say anything good about it that hasnt filled up a barrel already youll have to watch it yourself listing the bad aspects is a lot easier since its really just nitpicking and its going to be a rather short list anyway spoilerfree the biggest criticism is actually the plot itself because of how straightforward and simple it is lokis attacking and the avengers have to stop him but thats how all superhero movies are so you shouldnt complain about it other bad things include well thats it really you have to be a real nerd to point out anything bad about it simply because its inaccurate to the comics ex chiatauri aliens dont shapeshift and look like kree not to mention that they werent in the original story antman and wasp arent in it being replaced by hawkeye and black widow iron man isnt using his golden mk i armor hulk doesnt talk much thor doesnt have his helmet nick furys black instead of white in the comics except in the ultimate comics blah blah blah nothing really bad about it so why dont you get the hell over to your nearest theater and watch the damn thing already im still waiting for the next big comic book movie the dark knight rises isnt it
Jun 19 2012,positive,good god what a film perfect
Jun 19 2012,positive,awesome ã movie cant wait for the second ã
Jun 19 2012,positive,the avengers is an actionpacked heart filled thrill ride the 4 years leading up to this have been totally worth it the acting was spoton the story was great everything i knew joss wheadon wouldnt let me down this movie is 1010 55 and 100 nonrotten
Jun 19 2012,positive,great superhero action flick
Jun 19 2012,positive,natural progression for marvels flicks lately  the source material from the previous movies thor captain america first avenger iron man played really well together  i think hawkeye could have used a little more character development since the backstory isnt really fleshed out muchbut the portrayals of hulk iron man and captain america were spot on
Jun 19 2012,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time
Jun 19 2012,positive,absolutely amazing action packed and extremely funny
Jun 19 2012,positive,just a bunch of fun great cast great dialog decent story
Jun 19 2012,positive,the best marvel super movie i have ever saw the acting action hilarious all were soo good especially iron man and hulk those two were funny love this movie
Jun 19 2012,positive,awesome movieexciting from the start
Jun 19 2012,positive,maybe the best superhero movie ever made good solid story and tons of action only minor flaw is the part in the battle in the city when the aliens have cap by his head and his mask comes off why are studios always doing this in a superhero movie  just leave the secret identity stuff alone  cant wait for a 2nd one
Jun 19 2012,positive,the avengers or as it is know in the uk avengers assemble is the culmination of what started back in 2008 with iron man back then the avengers was a distant dream that no one could have predicted would have ended with one of the greatest superhero movies of all time from its spectacular visual effects to its laugh out loud humor the avengers lives up to its incredibly high hype and raises the bar for all superhero movies
Jun 19 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Jun 19 2012,neutral,for me the marvel films have been hit or miss and the plots and overall flow tend to be really lacking flow is one of the big problems avengers has the flow is forced even after half a dozen movies if you include ang lees hulk we still have a lot of back story left untold and to assemble the team and arrange events for our climatic action packed fight sequences were sped through a bunch of montages and some hackneyed plot points  as an ensemble super hero team picture i rather preferred foxs xmen films the key to a superhero movie in my opinion isnt the mask its the man behind the mask and here the men behind the masks are shortchanged so that we can rush them all together and see what happens when earths mightiest heros assemble the final action sequences are indeed epic but they just didnt erase the bitter taste from the first half of the film which didnt have quite enough development  in general ive found both dc and marvels animated offerings tend to exceed their live action productions perhaps buoyed by the fact that its okay to have an occasional miss in the animated genre but a flop in live action causes heads to roll the avengers cartoon series despite not meeting the level of the justice league or 90s xmen standards for an ensemble cast still has a better overall flow and development than what is found in whedons script thats the advantage of a serial but theres also more to it that series is just more character focused look at foxs xmen lots of characters but we have one character to focus on and even the auxiliary characters are all there for a reason until the third film there was simply no interesting character development in avengers thor starts in asgard ends in asgard tony starts out selfish displays some self sacrifice but weve already seen him do this before in nearly an identical set piece in the first iron man so thats no development hawkeye similarly just goes full circle and hulk is simply comic relief not the heart of a character arc cap coming into the modern world is the obvious character plot that should be at the heart of this movie but it seems as if a lot has been left on the cutting room floor in that arc  perhaps a directors cut will put some of it back in and give it a little more of the heart this film is lacking
Jun 19 2012,positive,very entertaining throughout awesome fight scenes i was worried that because i didnt see a few of the individual superhero movies id be lost but that wasnt the case at all
Jun 19 2012,positive,great movie action packed with a few humorous parts this is a movie to buy on bluray

Jun 19 2012,positive,its absolutely perfect just perfect it blends comedy action drama in a way that is so rare to find you will love this movie    it will be hard for the amazing spiderman to top this
Jun 19 2012,positive,it was worth the wait two thumbs up
Jun 19 2012,positive,what a superhero movie should be excellent visuals and whedonesque humor

Jun 19 2012,positive,slick action great chemistry between the actors witty and funny at times solid performances tremendous special effects and overall a great film whedon was able to blend these characters together smoothly while staying true to their individual back stories and is able to give out enough screen time to each star without losing track of the story the newest superhero portrayals hawkeye and hulk are nice editions mark ruffalo is the best bruce bannerhulk yet undoubtedly marvels best film adaptation to date

Jun 18 2012,neutral,this overrated superhero movie thats had me excited since ultimate avengers release ended in disappointment after almost two and a half hours of action scenes and special effects if you want to see this because you liked the captain america or iron man plots you wont like the avengers for theres no scene that makes you think the characters wouldnt succeed in their goal of defeating lokis army the 25 stars are for the hulks funny moments

Jun 18 2012,positive,amazing movie need to see i dont even have words to decribe this movie perfect cast
Jun 18 2012,positive,checklist for avengers movie okay here we go character development and exposition check done in the individual characters leadup movies 4year buildup check a new actor to play bruce banner check alright then now its time for the avengers to assemble squabble amongst themselves a bit get their team groove on to fight a titanic threat fightand fight some morewith lots of obligatory eyecandy thrown in for good measure see shield helicarrier i had fun watching marvels the avengers it was great to see cap shellhead thor and company together on the silver screen doing their thingquite well i might add there were some scenes that i especially enjoyed such as thors little tussle with the hulk the characters are all faithfully handled  minispoiler alert i loved the hulks solitary line of dialogue its nice indeed to have comic book lover joss wheden at the helm but on the whole there were no real suprises for me and in the arena of big 2 dc and marvel superhero movies the marvel entries still havent reached the epic stratosphere for me on an emotional levelnot say like superman the movie and christopher nolans batman movies which i think aimedhave aimed higher of the marvels sam raimis spiderman as well as ang lees hulk a movie that many reviled though not i have come the closestand perhaps captain america the first avenger make no mistake about it taken on its own merits the avengers is a good fun popcorn movieand there surely aint nothin much wrong with that but sorry marvel  dcs aforementioned iconic characters still own the edge in my book at least cinematically
Jun 18 2012,positive,this is good movie but their us so many heros movies out their but when we went to see it but of geeky fans where their dressed in thor and hulk suits

Jun 18 2012,positive,entertainment in full throttle
Jun 18 2012,positive,this weekend marvel is releasing one of the most anticipated films of the year the second avengers film as we count down the days until launch i wanted to review the original film that had fan boys drooling all over themselves its no secret that many consider this movie to be the greatest comic book film of all time i do not necessarily agree but this is a damn fun movie to say the least the avengers is directed by joss whedon and boasts an incredible all star cast chris evans robert downey jr scarlet johanson jeremy renner mark ruffalo chris hemsworth and samuel l jackson  early in the marvel cinematic universe the tesseract was introduced in this film it is the crown jewel the long lost god of mischief loki tom hiddleston is up to no good when he is brought to earth by the power of the cube he yearns to rule over the pathetic human race lokis plan is to bring an army from outer space and subdue the earth he needs the cube to do so however he may be in a little over his head nick fury jackson a member of the shield program is assembling a team of earths mightiest heroes captain america evans iron man downey black widow johansongood lord the incredible hulk ruffalo hawkeye renner and the god of thunder thor hemsworth together these avengers must fight for the people of earth and thwart the puny gods plan they only have to learn to work together first  when your making a superhero team up movie you have to have the right cast they have to work well together be likable and they have to be people you root for this film accomplishes these three things perfectly the chemistry between these characters and actors is unparalleled chris evanswho everyone loves now as capleads the team in the battle to save earth downey and ruffalos characters work amazingly well together the two of them share multiple scenes all of which are great captain america and iron man obviously bash heads with each other they are polar opisates of one another it was great watching the banter between everyone but especially those two what i think was so impressive about the charactersdespite the shallow character developmentwas just how well the writing picked at who they are as characters iron mans flaws are brought up and so are the captains it was brilliant writing and i applaud whedon on this honestly the only characters they were pushed to the side were thor black widow and hawkeye unfortunately hawkeye lovers may feel upset at how little hes in this film thor is not really a big part of the movie either black widow is there more than both combined there just isnt much for them to do character wise however each does get their own great little moments so the script doesnt completely forget them  so far we have very good performances so lets move on to the filmmaking standpoint joss whedon hasnt made many films at all he has written and directed a few television shows however ill be honest as a director i dont love whedon when i think of iconic directors his name never comes to mind from a writing standpoint whedon is fantastic the scriptwhile not deep and somewhat shallowis full of fantastic dialogue and witty banter the humor is always present and is always fresh i wouldnt recommend watching this film over and over however i think some of the humor becomes dull after to many viewings personally i would watch it sparingly so as not to become annoyed with the humor if you watch it once or twice a year its great moving on we have some great sets its blatantly obvious allot was put into the impressive set pieces they are very well crafted and made with care however the horrible cinematography makes the sets look to much like sets if there is one major criticism its definitely the camera work the film was shot by seamus mcgarvey a praised cinematographer who has won awards and been nominated multiple times his work here however is just nasty there are many ugly dutch angle shots and plenty of awkward shots that are at awkward angles just to show off the sets the result is that the camera work looks too much like a reality television show and the sets look like sets sometimes  not surprisingly the action mostly delivers very well i must praise the visual effects department for their incredible work the cgi looksmost of the timestunning it does hurt knowing there arent many piratical effects sadly allot of it is just fake cgi however it does look very sleek so it somewhat makes up for the fakeness watching these guys kick ass together was the most thrilling thing about the film admittedly whedon does a great job bringing these heroes together i admire him for that seeing as that is a very difficult task to accomplish seeing these guys interactwhether it be when they are quarreling or working togetherwas a joy  amidst all of this greatness there are flaws every film even the great masterpieces of cinema have flaws the avengers has a very shallow plot motivations of the characters arent fully realized whilst the villains motives are clearly painted the film doesnt develop its characters very much but rather lets the stand alone films do this instead towards the end the action goes into transformers territory i still cringe at the dark of the moon alien war machines there are so many conveniences in the plot and throughout the film i fear that if we removed the witty one liners and action the film would fall apart however there are brief moments where the film hints at themes that arent really exploited like they should be people need a little bit of old fashioned is a line delivered by colseson a noble theme that unfortunately is lost amidst the flurry of explosions and jokes there is a great line delivered by loki you were made to be ruled which is possibly the most powerful theme in the entire movie i think this is what kept the film together the idea of a god that wants to rule over and subdue much like the totalitarian rulers of the pastand present in north korea is the crown jewel that still stands amidst the rubble if we take out the jokes and action that core theme stands there and saves the movie  the avengers is what everyone hoped it would be fun funny and full of action watching this team on screen together was amazing the chemistry is there the humor is ever present and the action is fun the direction is solid the writing is brilliant the performances are great and the sets are well made despite how shallow the plot is and despite all the shortcomings under the surface this is a wildly fun film that everyone can enjoy
Jun 18 2012,positive,what can i say that hasnt already been said its a nerds wet dream come true no director knows comic books like joss whedon the tone of the film is perfect its humorous throughout but has juuust enough seriousness so that we care about the story and characters the set pieces are brilliant and just about every actor brings something great to the table its nothing groundbreaking but its executed so well that i cant help but love every minute of it
Jun 18 2012,positive,the perfect summer movie

Jun 18 2012,positive,great moviethe best i have seen
Jun 17 2012,positive,the 5year culmination of marvels superhero film universe marvelss the avengers represents arguably the biggest and riskiest attempt at franchise domination since christopher nolans batman series the avengers has also been considered the only major competition of the caped crusader in terms of box office success it seems it is marvel vs dc once again  but back to the actual film the avengers is a superb and expertlycrafted action movie that fires on all cylinders and hits on every beat pacing is excellent here and the film is clearly divided into three distinct acts aside from the action which is expectantly exciting fun and not too cheesy the dialogue courtesy of writerdirector joss whedon is sharp witty and when coming from the mouth of robert downey jr especially funny there are a few plot holes and characterpower inconsistencies to speak of but overall these are minor complaints compared to strong story and character arcs present in the film i only wish all megablockbusters were this good the avengers lives up to the hype
Jun 17 2012,positive,joss whedon is a fellow fanboy nuff said

Jun 17 2012,positive,in my opinion this movie is overrated the action is its strong point but the movie had some feeble comedy attempts which really i do not think worked out the acting was quite mediocre except for robert downey jr mark ruffalo was a present surprise as the hulk though other than that the plot was flawed and hard to understand you really dont know whats going on with loki before the time of the movie

Jun 17 2012,positive,it is refreshing to see a superhero film made by a comic book  film geek  whedon gets it right  just enough additional character development mixed with classic marvel humor  the visuals ate tight without looking forced  considering the director worked with a cast chosen by previous films he did an amazing job of creating cohesion
Jun 17 2012,neutral,loved the action wasnt keen on the storyline mainly enjoyed it for chris hemsworth
Jun 17 2012,negative,fell asleep during the movie woke up to a funny moment puny god thats the extra half point
Jun 17 2012,positive,me and my family miss the beginning before they showed the title i honestly love hulk he was so funny the fact that they took the characters from pervious movies and they still kept the people who played them i know its not a big deal but it is im so glad they showed the ending and left u guessing such a good idea
Jun 17 2012,positive,i think this movie was amazing the best one i have seen it was also very funny and it shows that no matter how different they were they were able to team work they did have some difficultys but it all worked good i hope they make advengers 2 or something

Jun 17 2012,positive,nothing mindblowing no amazing story line or plot the comedy in the movie makes everything worthwhile
Jun 17 2012,positive,its pointless at this stage to write a review on the avengers or avengers assemble for brits it has now become the third highest grossing movie of all time and has received almost unanimous critical acclaim for being the no holds bar action packed summer blockbuster that weve all been waiting for more importantly it represents a resounding success for the now 4 year long build up that consisted of 5 theatrical features that represented origins for a collection of super heroes that are now able to finally throw down together comic book fans obviously love this movie but even myself not being a comic reader would find it extremely hard to find fault in what is a more or less flawless recreation of the marvel superheroes on screen and the best comic book adaptation to date in the purest sense of the word  the story deals with the god of mischeif loki continuing his pursuit of the all powerful tesseract energy source which will allow him to unleash an extraterrestrial army onto the earth that will ravage it and subjugate humantity to his leadership not being successful in protecting the tesseract the high tech government funded organisation shield now needs to harness the combined forces of the earths greatest superheroes to fight the common enemy and save the world iron man captain america black widow hawkeye thor and the hulk being able to reign in such massive forces of nature and heroism however turns out to be a much harder exercise than once thought  joss whedon the fanboy writer whos had several high profile projects under his name deserves massive credit for reigning in a film that juggles a big larger than life cast of super heroes all of which have their fans to please off the screen and their own personal stories and journies to allude to on the screen directing and writing he balances the film just right allowing all the players their time to shine giving them enough time to grow an attachment to the audience and to perform all their heroic special effects laden derring do in ways only the best summer blockbusters deliver whedon both treats his subjects with due respect while also having fun with them some of the best moments in the film deal with the various members of the team meeting up for the first time and inevitably coming to blows with each other due to their various insecurities about themselves and everyone around them the collective egos have a hard time letting each other breath when they fight for space this leads to moments of hilarity and dramatic weight all combining to create a cast of highly volatile yet likeable individuals this is important for any massive action movie like this to get right since when we get to the smackdowns were invested in whats happening to everyone which in turn raises the tension and excitement otherwise its just pointless audiovisual noise  all the performances are fine even though some characters end up having a lesser impression than others due to the structure of the story the two standouts are for one the always great robert downey junior who steals scenes effortlessly as tony starkiron man even though hes perhaps downplayed a little more than in his own movie the other is mark ruffalo as bruce bannerhulk the newcomer amongst the group as the banner character has gone through the rockiest changes of all in his cinematic history being the third to play the role theatrically ruffalo nails the meek awkward but blazingly intelligent bruce banner someone who fights to hold back the rage that boils within but has also learnt to control it for good another welcome angle is that the hulk alter ego is also played by ruffalo through motion capture allowing the actor to play the full spectrum of his characters attributes the others carry on from their previous outings without a break and deliver where it counts  any faults with the movie mainly pertain to nitpicks and personal preferences for what it is the avengers is near flawless it does exactly what a movie like this needs to do to work and work well anyone interested in this kind of movie will not be disappointed my problems mainly have to do with the limits of a movie of this nature by its nature big superhero mashup films like this are going to suffer from length and an overabundance of action and visuals on the screen on the whole the film doesnt feel long for its almost 2 hours and 30 minutes running time but there were moments particularly during the action scene in the middle and during the massive climactic one where the film dragged and it felt like it was just running on autopilot with everyone fighting an ongoing army of generic looking aliens or eating up time having to perform a certain task integral to the plot plus as is the case for an action blockbuster particularly one that has so many characters emotional attachments or an edge of the seat sense of peril and danger arent really present here neither are there any provokative ideas to think about there are some contemporarily based points about manufacturing wmds and renewable energy thrown around briefly the emphasis is mainly to give the characters space to set themselves up for a huge fight while intercutting their personal relationships with each other it works fine for what it is but it doesnt reach anywhere further plus it could be said that while the visual effects and action are all first rate nothing about them stuns you its all delivered with workmanlike efficiency letting the action taking place to breathe on its own shot smoothly and coherently it does what it needs to do nothing more  ultimately the avengers is exactly what youd want from a movie like this delivering on all cylinders its a testament to joss whedons direction and writing that he makes delivering a movie of this quality look so easy it successfully shows up all the lackluster lazy amateurish attempts at action blockbusters that plague cinemas nowadays with the massive success of this film hopefully others will step up their games and try harder to deliver the goods this is unadulterated summer movie madness at its best a pure beast that has no pretentions for anything else but to entertain and it does it really really well
Jun 17 2012,negative,no story  just blow it up for 2 hours and cheesy lines
Jun 17 2012,positive,worth it in every way coming from me who is clearly not the target audience
Jun 17 2012,positive,basically a perfect superhero movie

Jun 17 2012,positive,best movie of the summer
Jun 17 2012,positive,holy crap that was awesome best way to described the movie hulk smash
Jun 17 2012,positive,extremely entertaining the very definition of a summer blockbuster do not expect any character development as all of the prequels did this already   the action sequences while similar in style to transformers 3 are filled with subtle throwbacks to video games such as ultimate alliance
Jun 17 2012,positive,one of the best super hero movies i have seen
Jun 17 2012,positive,probably the best super hero movie of this age
Jun 17 2012,positive,amazing combination of characters robert downey jr shines as always

Jun 17 2012,positive,amazing cool fun funny and lotsa crazy good action see it
Jun 17 2012,positive,some cheesy moments but overall great movie could have spent a little more time explaining the hulks new ability to control his anger and transform when he feels like it but by far the best hulk smash movie to date the other characters were great great action awesome plot i cant wait for the next one
Jun 17 2012,positive,epic as usual i love how all the other movies were tied in
Jun 17 2012,positive,goig to see it again
Jun 17 2012,positive,flippin outstanding  i had my doubts that they would be able to maintain the action as well as coordinate the connections between the various team members but they did it without drawing it out through several sequels  there was even some wellplaced an well timed comedy thrown in  i was also impressed that they were able to introduce and bring level two fairly new characters hawkeye and black widow without the story or other characters suffering
Jun 17 2012,positive,great film would i watch it over and over again eh im not sure ive already seen it twice in theaters it was really good but im not sure its one i would choose to buy and rewatch like the individual heroes films it definitely has its classic moments as well as some dull even cliche ones overall though i think it would be difficult for any superhero movie fanatic not to love this flick truly enjoyable and definitely worth seeing
Jun 17 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Jun 17 2012,positive,perfect movie luved it
Jun 17 2012,positive,great movie lots of action and very funny great movie all around didnt spend too much time on one character
Jun 17 2012,positive,i didnt see all the prequels to this but didnt need to in order to understand all the avengers  movie had humor adventure and good effects
Jun 17 2012,positive,see all the iron man movies the newest hulk captain america and thor before seeing this movie will help you understand all the events in this movie
Jun 17 2012,positive,wow i can see this one again and again and whens the dvd out
Jun 17 2012,positive,the movie to which all other action movies will be compared
Jun 17 2012,positive,the avengers is an interesting entertaining and wellmade movie it has that balance between a drama and an action movie its unpredictable funny and clever
Jun 17 2012,positive,love it a must see over and over lol
Jun 17 2012,positive,you really put a lid on it  whats your secret  mellow jazz  bongo drums  a big bag of weed
Jun 17 2012,neutral,totally mediocre  way over hyped  some comical moments a good action scene at the end but i spent most of the movie being bored  i think its high ratings are a classic example of people forcing themselves to like something that they had high expectations for
Jun 17 2012,positive,this the best and the best and the best
Jun 17 2012,positive,was a really great movie kinda could have done with out all the quiet moments of just jibber jabber the action rocked
Jun 17 2012,positive,fantastic story combined with wonderful special effects make this film teriffic
Jun 17 2012,positive,if only all summer movie going fare was on caliber with this film a vastly entertaining film about the power of a community made up of powerful people full of deeply human moments as well as crowd pleasing superhuman ones joss whedon has delivered the finest super hero film next to the dark knight
Jun 17 2012,positive,fun but certainly not something i would watch twice still it works in with the rest of the never ending seriesand scarlett johansson is still hot   the hulk is the only standout really
Jun 17 2012,positive,this movie rocked my socks
Jun 17 2012,positive,when i first heard of this movie i was curious to see if marvel could pull it off  well they did it with flying colors        looking forward to the sequel
Jun 17 2012,positive,i loved the movie  kept me interested till the very end
Jun 17 2012,positive,saw this wen it came out effin awesome saw it 5x
Jun 17 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time if you havent seen this run dont walk to go watch it today  funny action packed really good plot  it has everything a summer movie should
Jun 17 2012,positive,there are two movie adaptations that hollywood needs to set as their templates for success in the future the dark knight is one for its gritty film noiresque take on the batman franchise and the avengers is the other for its masterful concentration on character dialogue and story while still being able to bring in scifi entertainment such as superpowers and aliens
Jun 17 2012,positive,fun with some humor the movie keeps you interested and you dont notice the near 2 and half hours fly bye
Jun 17 2012,positive,my favorite movie of all time
Jun 17 2012,positive,very good action scenes
Jun 17 2012,positive,yeah big studio big smash em but a great load of fun
Jun 17 2012,positive,loved it action humor story it was all there made me go back to my childhood marvel books very entertaining awaiting the next one
Jun 17 2012,neutral,ive seen this film 4 or 5 times now and every time i do i find something else to not like about it   first of all its extremely messy and way too crowded joss whedon did the best he could im convinced if anyone else had directed avengers it would have been a complete wash there is very little character development and an extremely thin plot that deals with the tesseract opening up a portal to allow an army of faceless chitari warriors in to take over the earththats it   the film suffers from having to establish characters and mythos in a very short space of time it felt disjointed and out of place amongst the other movies that take place in the marvel cinematic universe as a popcorn blockbuster it is awesome and fun but for me the avengers is a severe disappointment  heres hoping joss and the team can build from it and produce something more impressive for avengers 2
Jun 17 2012,positive,not as good as it could have been
Jun 17 2012,positive,nearly everything works in this perfect popcorn movie  the allstar cast is a joy to watch and they have plenty to work with thanks to joss whedon
Jun 17 2012,positive,fantastic superhero film perfectly executed laughs action and samuel l jackson with an eye patch all the elements there
Jun 17 2012,positive,its filled with action also a dash of humor most of all has a great storyline
Jun 17 2012,positive,such an exciting funny movie i loved it and would watch it again in a heartbeat
Jun 17 2012,positive,it is nice to see good scripted movie with a blend of witty banter
Jun 16 2012,positive,best movie i have ever seen in my life
Jun 16 2012,positive,best marvel superhero movie funny smart entertaining interesting wellacted action packed 2 and 12 hrs
Jun 16 2012,neutral,at this point ive had my fix with superheroesjoss has a great comedic voice but all in all i found this movie long arduous predictable andlong
Jun 16 2012,positive,nice hodgepodge of characters and convincing but the cgi and constant noise dulled ones senses  always love the little scenes after the credits
Jun 16 2012,positive,fast paced and action packed the avengers epitomises what having fun at the movies is all about the quintessential summer blockbuster
Jun 16 2012,positive,wow just amazing funny scenes as well im planning to see it again but this time in imax 3d hell of a movie here
Jun 16 2012,positive,i thought it was ok kind of a weaker plot compared to the other hero movies ive seen
Jun 16 2012,positive,everything i hoped it would be
Jun 16 2012,positive,this movie is so epic and amazing seen it 3 times and getting it on blue ray
Jun 16 2012,positive,a must see for this summer
Jun 16 2012,positive,noticeable bloopers still a movie ill enjoy for years to come thanks stan lee for sharing your world with us
Jun 16 2012,positive,great movie  enjoyed the plot and filled with action
Jun 16 2012,positive,the most amazing movie ever i absolutely loved this movie its up there with the dark knight as best super hero movie of all time i was laughing sad and all other emotions at once had some of the coolest action effects etc ever even if you dont like super heroes watch it even if you dont like action watch it even if you have no desire to watch this watch it its that good
Jun 16 2012,positive,saw this one in imax 3d i really enjoyed this movie it was an fun ride almost from beginning to end
Jun 16 2012,positive,best of the marvel movies  i believe introducing all of the characters in their own movies aided in the flow of the film there was no need for extensive film consuming character development
Jun 16 2012,positive,predictable but carries a strong cast and is quite entertaining
Jun 16 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Jun 16 2012,positive,just see it wonderful balance of characters comedy and drama loved it and will own it
Jun 16 2012,positive,good but slow in the beginning
Jun 16 2012,positive,phenomenal movie to start the summer with i although wish i would have gone to the bathroom before watching i found myself scavenging for a spot where the plot to slowed down but there was none the avengers was funny fast entertaining and actionpacked  i never got bored needless to say i had to run to the bathroom like flash exiting the theater i would have joined the avengers but they dont seem to be quite fond of flash
Jun 16 2012,positive,had a blast with my niece watching this movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,the marvel fan in me thought it was awesome and the kid in me wanted to go buy an iron man action figure afterward
Jun 16 2012,positive,it was okay lots of action but nothing new
Jun 16 2012,positive,i think this was a great movie it was very exciting but the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because now if they make another movie with one of those characters it will seem boring compared to this one so bad planing ahead but it was a good summer selling block buster i liked how it wasnt all we dont like each other because were super heros this was a great movie its amazing
Jun 16 2012,positive,best action movie in quite some time with some very memorable moments liked hulk and iron mans characterization
Jun 16 2012,positive,good oldfashioned fun in the mighty marvel manner  the action is entertaining and coherent the comedic bits are just right and the acting is aboveaverage  robert downey jr is great as always playing iron man and chris evans really impressed me as captain america  im not a fan of joss whedon but i have to give him credit for pulling this off
Jun 16 2012,positive,anytime you bring together a handful of a comic nerds favorite characters for a movie hes going to be partial  watching the avengers was a dream come true for a guy who waited 30 plus years to see it onscreen  the hulk was awesome and mark ruffalo grew on me and i was very skeptical  robert downey jrwas amazing as tony stark once more  it was also great to see each hero get his 5 minutes of special time on screen  still the film was not perfect  there was a long period of little action in the middle of the movie and some of the origin and character setup may be too much for non comic book movie goers
Jun 16 2012,positive,i loved it one of the best marvel movies and superhero movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,absolutely a most see
Jun 16 2012,positive,best movie ever funny and packed with action
Jun 16 2012,positive,i loved it this is by far the best super hero ever made as it has everything a super hero movie needs actionsome witty humoran all star cast and great cgi
Jun 16 2012,negative,i didnt like the movie  too much cgi  everything is cgi  the comics were never written with such catastrophic nonsense
Jun 16 2012,positive,best of all team avenger movies
Jun 16 2012,positive,everything a summer movie should be it deserves every penny it has made at the box office
Jun 16 2012,positive,the best film ive seen this summer
Jun 16 2012,positive,good albeit predictable  i thought the main villain was disrespected a little too much to really be taken seriously  it was awfully exciting seeing so many protagonists from different movies thrown together
Jun 16 2012,positive,finally a movie that delivered exactly what it said on the tin minus 5 points for occasionally poor cgi
Jun 16 2012,positive,great cast that performed beautifully great script with tons of lines that are memorable
Jun 16 2012,positive,i can see why this movie broke the box office records soeasily its a non stop action packed thrill ride from beginning to end and the cat is so star packed its insane and theres enough comedy to keep everybody entertained so go as it if you havent and go see it again if you did its definitely the movie of the summer
Jun 16 2012,positive,fun but redundant how many different ways and for how long can you watch them display their super fighting powers before it gets boring  i did like robert downy though he was hilarious i understood this movie better once i saw thor think i would have liked it better if i had seen any of the super hero movies first
Jun 16 2012,positive,oh yes yes yes perfect  besides not having edward norton
Jun 16 2012,positive,fun action entertainment  hulk needed a bigger role
Jun 16 2012,positive,humor action and a few tense moments combined with a great set of actors and joss whedon made this a suprisingly great fucking movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,absolutely awesome
Jun 16 2012,positive,very surprised to totally enjoy this 
Jun 16 2012,positive,best movie of the year
Jun 16 2012,positive,very action filled and great
Jun 16 2012,positive,me and my son went to watch this epic movie we both thought it was excellent the effects were out of this world if you are a marvel fan this is a must see you and your kids will be talking about it for weeks all i can say is hulk smash
Jun 16 2012,positive,the absolute best movie ive ever seen there are small little jokes implanted in the movie never a dull moment
Jun 16 2012,positive,it was fab got my copy ordered for september
Jun 16 2012,positive,the avengers lives up to my expectations it gives the audience a two and a half hour thrill ride and doesnt forget to add a bit of plot here and there although the climax was a bit disappointing the avengers does its job the major problem i had with the film was loki he seemed tough then weak then tough again the whole alien invasion was overused and predictable avengers had good action and humour but not good story
Jun 16 2012,positive,the movie was amazing from the first minute to the last the movie had the suspense like no other and was full of extraordinary surprises the avengers had so much action and a few moments of comedy i also think the actors were perfect for their characters the actors were robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america chris hemsworth as thor scarlette johanson as black widow and mark ruffalo as the incredible hulk i highly recommend this film due to its stupendous actingincredible action and awesome graphics the avengers is a movie i would definently see again
Jun 16 2012,positive,loved it funny all great heros villian
Jun 16 2012,positive,this is a very fun movie dont leave the kids at home
Jun 16 2012,positive,the best movie from marvel
Jun 16 2012,positive,presently surprised
Jun 16 2012,positive,seen it really good in 3d
Jun 16 2012,positive,effin robert downey jr is the man the plot was like whatever but it was assembled pretty well felt like a 200million movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,one of the strongest superhero movies ever
Jun 16 2012,positive,fantastic  the impressive cast make it perfect
Jun 16 2012,positive,save for captain america this was the best of the marvel movies so far sure the storyline was well barely a storyline but in a film like this it really doesnt need one the enthralling action and toocoolforschool characters really did make this an enjoyable film to watch especially via stereoscopic vision courtesy of imax terrific stuff
Jun 16 2012,positive,great film impressed with the way they squeezed in enough story to address all of the heros without shortening anyones story too muchsome cheesy moments but great overall
Jun 16 2012,positive,in 3d it was really good loved seeing all the characters on one screen
Jun 16 2012,positive,loved loved loved this movie  i just dont understand the importance of scarlett johansson role other than eye candy that is subjective  other than that the cast played really well off each other  as always robert downey jrs acting  rocked  along with mark ruffalo
Jun 16 2012,positive,who has seen this movie if so how good was it
Jun 16 2012,positive,awesome movie definitely a must buy
Jun 16 2012,positive,the comedic timing throughout was perfect
Jun 16 2012,positive,comedic relief saves this movie horrendous hollywood scripting of course increases the tackiness saved by robert downey jrs lovable quick wit the enemy army couldnt of been less scary never seemed as though the avengers or the world were in any kind of harm film time seemed to be the only reason the avengers hadnt already won
Jun 16 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen literally
Jun 16 2012,positive,fantastic  had lots of humor as well as the typical summer explosions
Jun 16 2012,positive,very good what more can be said very good though scarlett johansson russian speaking was rather offensive i hate that americans assume that east europeans are just another form of white
Jun 16 2012,positive,worthy of 3d excellent
Jun 16 2012,positive,action packed great special effects from start to finish
Jun 16 2012,positive,because of movies like this 3d cinema was invented big action fun
Jun 16 2012,positive,better than expected
Jun 16 2012,positive,excellent in just about every way except 3d that was unnecessary
Jun 16 2012,positive,amazing action has some comedy
Jun 16 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is a movie that kicks into high gear from the getgo and it doesnt stop there a rarity in summer blockbusters of recent years a wellacted wellshot superhero movie that is smart enough to balance fun adventure genius wit and a terrific  sometimes dramatic story
Jun 16 2012,positive,i absolutely loved watching this one the only element marring its entertainment value is the fact that it draws from the thor hulk ironman and captain america movies none of which ive seen its still a great movie that i would very highly recommend seeing stay until the very end after the second set of credits
Jun 16 2012,positive,i require a good bad guy to enjoy a movie and loki was extremely lacking in this movie especially compared to his performance in thor in which he seemed powerful and played mind games  that said the avengers team was a joy to watch
Jun 16 2012,positive,marvels the avengers is a very good movie  i recommend to go watch it
Jun 16 2012,positive,fantastic film perhaps the best superhero movie of all time
Jun 16 2012,positive,great movie all movies tied in well
Jun 16 2012,positive,hands down the best marvel film to date and one of the best action films of the last decade exceeded my expectations in every way
Jun 16 2012,positive,one of the best comic book movies  so much fun
Jun 16 2012,positive,awesome movie not much of a plot but doesnt need one the previous marvel movies had all the backstory so this one could start fast and finish faster
Jun 16 2012,positive,by far the best action pack flim
Jun 16 2012,positive,surprised how much i enjoyed it
Jun 16 2012,positive,superb imagery combined with compelling action with subtle hints of comical devices
Jun 16 2012,positive,i want more awesome movie lots of action lots of superheros lots of bad guys
Jun 16 2012,positive,fun exciting the time flew by cant wait for more installments of this franchise
Jun 16 2012,positive,what a fun summer movie all the comic book movies of recent years wrapped into one and you cant go wrong with robert downey jr
Jun 16 2012,positive,awesome moviefunny a must see movie for any marvel buff
Jun 16 2012,positive,excellent an overall blast go see with your friends
Jun 16 2012,positive,truly one of the greatest superhero movies of all time there was a slight lack of depth to anything beyond the exterior of smoke and mirrors effects and at points the suspense they are trying to build falls flat overall a great film and definitely my favorite so far this year
Jun 16 2012,positive,marvels the avengers was a fantastic compilation of some of the greatest heroes in modern history i was slightly worried going into the film wondering if each hero would be given an appropriate amount of screen time and if the film would show favor to one hero or another i was pleasantly surprised to see that each hero was given his or her due and the chemistry displayed between them was nothing short of brilliant of course rdj stole the show for most of the movie with his quickwhited humor but each character displayed why they were an integral part of the marvel universe if anyone reading this has not gone to enjoy this film i highly suggest itmaybe the best superhero movie of all time save the dark knight of course
Jun 16 2012,positive,i loved the movie but if your not a marvel fan stay away
Jun 16 2012,positive,awesome movie loved it
Jun 16 2012,positive,i was expecting to be moderately entertained by another league of extraordinary gentlemen as i think captain america iron man 2 and thor did a good job on lowering my expectations instead it was a grand time with a fun villain solid writing and performances and was extremely entertaining the avengers was a perfect balance of the basic storytelling elements of plotting action and character admittedly thats a good thing for an ensemble this big whedon did the right thing making simple character interaction the bulk of the film there were some pretty well played fight scenes in there  lokis first capture thor fighting iron man but the best parts came from banner and stark interacting lokis relationship with thor black widow doing reverse interrogations and of course the all around genuinely funny one liners the fact that whedon was able to balance each of the superheroes both in their motivations and in their style of action in a massive franchise film like this with a coherent plot and ample stakes is pretty impressive its kind of sad that this brilliant man has had to wait so long to be handed a bigbudget film i also loved the casting of ruffalo as hulk this was definitely the best representation of bannerhulk i have seen and the best thing i will take from this film is hoping that there will be a ruffalo standalone hulk film
Jun 16 2012,positive,my new all time favorite movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,the movie was fun and creative but the only downside to me was that it was too slow
Jun 16 2012,positive,joss is my hero this is now one of my alltime favs loved it
Jun 16 2012,positive,very well done and so funny too
Jun 16 2012,positive,just to throw my 2 cents in yep as far as comic book super hero movies go it pretty much rocks  sure if you take about 3 seconds maybe less to pick it apart its full of ridiculousness really its not a true story and predictability  but whatever for a saturday afternoon popcorn flick it totally delivers  im sure there will be a sequal or 8 and ill be there to see itthem
Jun 16 2012,positive,was a really good movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,it was the best movie ive ever seen because it was funnywell madeand had the best actors and the best charaters
Jun 16 2012,positive,great movie most of it was very funny with lots of action as well as a good storyline
Jun 16 2012,positive,exceptionally action packed i like single hero movies better because the storyline can develop better and the characters have deeper personalities but this still caught my attention
Jun 16 2012,positive,all you joss whedon fans will enjoy this movie  our audiende was cracking up at his very witty humor and it is fun
Jun 16 2012,positive,great fun love this movie it bring back the fun of going to a movie
Jun 16 2012,positive,best comic book movie to date epic film
Jun 16 2012,positive,mindblowing nonstop action
Jun 16 2012,positive,its the second best super hero movie behind the dark knight assembling all of the guys for such a huge movie could have gone very bad and it was exactly the opposite from beginning to end it was about as perfect as you can make a movie of this genre had heath ledger not turned in one of the best acting performances of all time regardless of genre for the dark knight this one would reign supreme   my biggest concern was how they brought in mark ruffalo to play hulk he was flawless so much so that this movie indeed is better off without edward norton being able to say that is a damn fine compliment to the movie   should eclipse the 600000000 domestic mark probably end up around 1500000000 internationally
Jun 16 2012,positive,the best superhero movie ever made
Jun 16 2012,positive,this movie was fun with lots of great one liners  both visual and vocal
Jun 16 2012,positive,a personal childhood dream comes true as joss whedon directs this starstudded adventure flick of marvels mightiest heroes wow
Jun 16 2012,positive,best movie of the summer
Jun 16 2012,positive,crowd pleaser show stopper brilliant setpieces epic oneliners kickass humor all concocted together to make this a winning formula  note but it aint no nolan superhero film
Jun 16 2012,positive,done well  great cast  shouldve been longer though
Jun 16 2012,positive,this is the best superhero of all time i really love it
Jun 16 2012,positive,must see movie two thumbs up 
Jun 16 2012,positive,great mix of action and humour
Jun 16 2012,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Jun 16 2012,neutral,not all that impressed but im not sure why i thought i would be when half this movie is based on failed franchises and the iron man crew can only take up a certain amount of time intriguing us before the other interwoven failed characters confuse us by trying to fit squares into circles they just dont work an uncontrollable rage monster and a powerless propaganda agent have no place with superheroes
Jun 15 2012,positive,just about the coolest movie ever
Jun 15 2012,positive,best movie of the year loved every minute of it
Jun 15 2012,positive,poor storyline with frequent dull dialogues compensated by a stellar cast some great timed humor and action for me   hulk stole the show
Jun 15 2012,positive,this movie redifine how to do comic book movies  i see a lot of up and coming movie directors studying this one to see how the story telling acting worked just right for years
Jun 15 2012,positive,the king of superhero movies
Jun 15 2012,positive,this movie was perfect summer escapism a wonderful mix of action comedy and character great script sets and overall production do not miss this movie
Jun 15 2012,positive,best movie in a long time
Jun 15 2012,positive,its thor part 2 very good and the hulk wins the oscar
Jun 15 2012,positive,plain and simple the greatest super hero movie of all time
Jun 15 2012,positive,am entertained i think that is just about it p thor and captain america are hopelesshelpless  they should not have existed in the first place ugh my eyes wandered towards hawkeye hulk and lokiin fact loki still has the most interesting story behind
Jun 15 2012,positive,if i could give more stars i wouldthis movie is simple amazing whedon did an amazing job i am a comic book person and although i was slightly disappointed with the fact that antmangiantman and wasp were replaced as soon add i saw the movie i instantly didnt mind no matter who you are you must see this movie do not believe the naysayers
Jun 15 2012,positive,loved the actors the whole movie actiony so awesome xd 
Jun 15 2012,positive,pretty entertaining and full of action the story line was ok
Jun 15 2012,positive,i loved this movie i have always been a marvel fanand to have them all together is awesome i cant wait to see it again
Jun 15 2012,positive,seen this at the drive in great edge of your seat laughing the whole time
Jun 15 2012,positive,as complete a film as you are going to get with such a large cast of main characters  that is to say it excels at it  satisfying yet still a sense of more to come
Jun 15 2012,positive,awesome amazing definitely recommened  funny throughoutheld my atention 
Jun 15 2012,positive,now thats how you make an action film terrific special effects plenty of funny oneliners and lots of bangs booms whirs zips whooshes and kathunks i especially appreciated the kathunks overall the entire series thus far was awesome and this was a worthy tube of icing im waiting impatiently for more  thor have care how you speak loki is beyond reason but he is of asgard and he is my brother natasha he killed 80 people in two days thor he is adopted
Jun 15 2012,positive,definitely the best superhero movie the screenplay itself is entertaining you add up the special effects and other cgis then this becomes the superhero movie of the year
Jun 15 2012,positive,exactly as advertised awesome
Jun 15 2012,positive,i grew up as a kid watching star wars and indiana jones  my kids will grow up watching the avengers
Jun 15 2012,positive,best movie ive seen all year best superhero movie period awesome
Jun 15 2012,positive,this movie could never live up to expectations but it sure tried its best to an edge of your seat thriller to the very end with a cast of characters that were made to fill the shoes of their respected hero or heroine robert downey jr was always an exceptional pick to play iron man but until this movie i hadnt exactly found an iron man movie that really lived up to the hype that all changed in this movie as he rocked that iron man suit and  willed this movie to greatness samuel l jackson and chris evans were also fabulous in this movie even the hulk had a few great one liners tom hiddleston makes for a villainous but at the same time misguided and misunderstood loki his ability to make loki into someone you love and despise at the same time is brilliant the plot was excellent and to this point the best superhero movie ever made
Jun 15 2012,positive,whilst its not one of marvels better films avengers opens new doors in the super hero universethe avnegers is filled with superb acting especially by mark ruffalo brilliant visuals and great camera work but it cannot save the film from its rather pedestrian plot
Jun 15 2012,positive,the avengers was a pleasure to watch and the storyline was complete this movie is everything a superhero movie should be
Jun 15 2012,positive,it was ok definetely overrated
Jun 15 2012,positive,whedon manages to juggle an enormous cast effortlessly making us understand each character and their motivations the film would have a hard time standing on its own without the previous entries or at least would lose a lot of the fun much has been said about mark ruffalos hulkbanner and he is the standout of the film especially considering how many times the hulk has been done wrong the third act threatens to collapse under its own weight but somehow manages to stay afloat despite itself pure fun
Jun 15 2012,positive,i love this movie
Jun 15 2012,positive,action filled it exceeded my expectations
Jun 15 2012,positive,awesome movie how could it be bad
Jun 15 2012,positive,it is what it iswise cracking super heroslots of movie magic and all that but somehow uninteresting
Jun 15 2012,positive,10 stars  cant wait to own it and watch it over and over and over again
Jun 15 2012,positive,great summer fare  lots of blowem ups and larger than life literally characters  mark ruffalo as simmering anger iethe hulk is amazing robert downey jr is a wonderful screen personality  scarlet johannsen is made to play action heroinesshe never looks like she breaks a sweat  and that schtickt of playing the innocent girl to get info out of men was brilliant really  it did take a while for me to get into it  actually i was ready to walk after 20 minutestoo much talkeytalk and backstorybut it was a hundred degrees outside and the theatres air conditioning was working and then thor started smashing some heads so i happily stayed  funny lines  when stark wakes up with all the other avengers around him  did somebody kiss me  thor when told his brother loki was a homicidal maniac  he was adopted   its a hard concept to pull togetherwho are we cheering for and whyand they almost did it
Jun 15 2012,positive,took my kids to see it and i loved it great movie lots of action and some funny parts
Jun 15 2012,positive,loved it even if your not into super hero marvels its still a great movie
Jun 15 2012,positive,has to be the best movie in decades action and humour all rolled into one love how the superheroes all kind of dislike each other especially iron man
Jun 15 2012,positive,this was fantastic they whole family enjoyed it action packed with humour must go see
Jun 15 2012,positive,if you have liked any other superhero movie this is a must see
Jun 15 2012,positive,a great fun and a little laughter movie  a must see
Jun 15 2012,positive,this is the greatest movie to come out this year as of june 15th waiting for dark knight rises i cant put into words how awesome this movie was so worth every penny spent on the imax 3d ticket
Jun 15 2012,positive,avengers assemble thanos is here to wreak havoc
Jun 15 2012,positive,an amazing movie that did not fall flat on its face during the battle scene at the end humor combined with action and an extraordinary cast makes the avengers a must see and own movie
Jun 15 2012,positive,the perfect balance of humor blood shed explosions and heart the avengers assemble in an amazing way
Jun 15 2012,positive,i thought it was going to suck bigtime but it was pretty darn hilarious and awsome
Jun 15 2012,positive,the hulk nuff said
Jun 15 2012,positive,the avengers movie was fun lively energetic and actionpacked  i think the movie needs actors who are more ethnically diverse to portray some of the super hero characters overall this is a fun movie and the 3d visuals are colorful and really help the action scenes especially the fight scenes with iron man and thor then thor and the hulk and finally an epic battle with iron man captain america thor the black widow and hawkeye against transformersstyle villains  dont think too much about the plot and enjoy some summer escapist thrills
Jun 15 2012,positive,a fun film from start to finish thoroughly entertaining with a great cast
Jun 15 2012,positive,it was very goodalthough i would not recommend unless you have some background knowledge of the characters i did notso i was completely lost in the beginning
Jun 15 2012,positive,joss whedon pulled out all the stops mixing together a movie that blends comedy drama and action into a easily palatable experience for both fanboys and fangirls and casual observers
Jun 15 2012,positive,outstanding movie better than all the other marvel movies combined
Jun 15 2012,positive,best movie of all time period
Jun 15 2012,positive,fantastic moviecant wait for the sequel
Jun 15 2012,positive,a fun romp but nothing quite new under the sun  ok the aircraft carrier was cool but battle scene at the end could have had 5 minutes chopped off
Jun 15 2012,positive,a really fun movie with a lot of action and humor the only reason i gave it 4 12 stars is that the main villains plot and motivations are a bit week
Jun 15 2012,positive,a strong cast with some surprisingly witty repartee helps to really lift this film above the usual superhero bumf the plot isnt anything we havent seen before  but who cares theres something here for everyone
Jun 15 2012,positive,such an amazing movie
Jun 15 2012,positive,joss whedon did an excellent job love it
Jun 15 2012,positive,not enough stars to rate this loved it all i can say is amazing loved the hulk the best oh and iron man  and thor well just everything and everyone
Jun 15 2012,positive,one of the best movies of the year so far great action sequences with good character development is what a superhero film with multiple protagonists needed script was well done and they no one else could direct this film like joss whedon did hopefully he returns for the sequel
Jun 15 2012,positive,terrific fun so happy for whedon
Jun 15 2012,positive,one of the best movies ive seen definitely a must see

Jun 15 2012,positive,great movie action and story telling you will connect to one of the superheros if not all must see
Jun 15 2012,positive,it starts a little slow but as the movie progresses it becomes amazing
Jun 15 2012,positive,whoa this thing was overhyped for sure i dont care if it had thor ironman the hulk and mace windu from star wars this thing is not what its projected as being yeah now we get to see a sticker slapped on every box of lucky charms too however the script is cleverly written and it is just a fun popcorn budget movie not the masterpiece people are claiming it to be
Jun 15 2012,positive,without a doubt the best film ive seen in 2012 go see it now
Jun 15 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever
Jun 15 2012,positive,filled with action character development and humor that every movie needs
Jun 15 2012,positive,before i go into details i will say this was a great movie the action and humor carried this movie and made it a 4 star for sure the basic plot blue cube stolen superheroes recruited to retrieve blue cube safe the world from blue cube blue cube found world saved by superheroes you cant get any simpler than that but they could have done better if you enjoy robery downey jrs comedic oneliners this movie is full of them my personal favorite when ironman refers to thor as point break if youve seen the movie youll get it
Jun 15 2012,positive,first half dragged a bit but worth watching iron man  the hulk made the movie the other characters were so so

Jun 15 2012,positive,excuse me while i turn fanboi for a moment  joss whedon is a freakin genius hes pulled off something nearly impossible here  a bigname ensemble cast where everyone gets their moment in the sun with snappy intelligent dialogue big visual effects a satisfying story and something that retains the fidelity of the comicbook characters for the fans stunningly good my pick of 2012 so far  and possibly the whole year
Jun 15 2012,positive,the way comic book movies should be

Jun 14 2012,positive,huge smashing entertainment great direction fantastic dialogues and great casting  remember it comes from comics so dont expect deep political reviews of the financial crisis in wall street during last year  joss whedon was able to bring the best from every character with the right dose of nerdiness every marvel fan needs few rare slow moments but actually very well cut hmm not good for too little kids
Jun 14 2012,positive,huge smashing entertainment great direction fantastic dialogues and great casting  remember it comes from comics so dont expect deep political reviews of the financial crisis in wall street during last year  joss whedon was able to bring the best from every character with the right dose of nerdiness every marvel fan needs few rare slow moments but actually very well cut hmm not good for too little kids

Jun 14 2012,positive,perfect mix of action and humor every hero has their own spotlight and it was melded together in the end to be the best team to ever assemble joss whedon has me wanting to watch his other project he has worked on
Jun 14 2012,positive,just a great comic book adaptation can not say anything bad about this film
Jun 14 2012,negative,all of that money put into one of the most dissapointing films ive seen in a long time i really thought this movie would be pretty acceptable because i liked the hulk and iron man movie but this film was a whole other piece of paper from the smartass comments and witty jokes that caused awkward laughing to the excess amount of talking that was possibly 90 of the movie this shouldve been called heros therapy because all it was was every character being hostile towards each other and then finally realizing that everybody has their own story and should be treated equally and they should actually work together to fight the villian because it was just soo hard figuring that out earlier
Jun 14 2012,positive,its good for what it is a simple action movie not focus on plot i must say that the hulk stole the show well him and scarlett johanssons booty
Jun 14 2012,positive,a stunning finale to a marvelous set of movies cant wait for more marvel
Jun 14 2012,positive,love it end of story xd
Jun 14 2012,positive,i was expecting a bunch of story lines crossing over and fighting for attention and didnt expect to like this one loved it super fun action great comedy and character development  only a few minor holes in the story that were easily forgotten when hulk smashed things  cant wait to buy the bluray and own it
Jun 14 2012,positive,the best film experience ive had in a long time
Jun 14 2012,positive,this movie was awesome
Jun 14 2012,positive,awesome movie somebody finally did the hulk right
Jun 14 2012,positive,this movie is relentlessly in motion which may sound very cool but it becomes tiring all one speed and youve got scarlett johansson and no one tries to get it on with her no way
Jun 14 2012,positive,one hell of a ride very well done
Jun 14 2012,positive,this is a movie i could watch over and over again 
Jun 14 2012,positive,too damn good to pass up
Jun 14 2012,positive,super hero team saves the world  the special effects were pretty awesome but grew tired of one hero trying to outwit the other  there were some really funny parts
Jun 14 2012,positive,i saw this movie opening night and it is my favorite movie as far as right now this movie is full of action and has allot of funny moments haha
Jun 14 2012,positive,an epic action film worth waiting and watching for

Jun 14 2012,positive,one of the greatest movies ever made
Jun 14 2012,positive,joss whedon is a genious
Jun 14 2012,positive,excellent the hulk rocks again
Jun 14 2012,positive,so awesome
Jun 14 2012,positive,its humorous and visually entertaining but feels like something is missing throughout the entire film it lacks heart and any emotion whatsoever while it is an actionhero movie id rather go see a sappy chick flick than sit through a 2 hour long action fest with no interesting point in the end while i didnt connect with the film others may enjoy it and i suppose depending on the person i would recommend it to a friend
Jun 14 2012,positive,one of the most awesomest movies i have seen this is the kind of movie where you can rewatch again and again well maybe not that frequent  it changed my perception on 3d movie the tech has matured so much that i might consider buying a 3d tv
Jun 14 2012,positive,if i could i would add more stars it was awesome
Jun 14 2012,positive,very entertaining must see again
Jun 14 2012,positive,the most amazing super hero movie that ive ever seen

Jun 14 2012,positive,great movie glad i went to see it

Jun 14 2012,positive,the third best movie ever love it
Jun 14 2012,positive,it was a brilliant film love the iron man
Jun 14 2012,positive,action packed movie with engaging dialogue  somehow found a way to split screen time between 6 superheroes and still keep the movie balanced  it was also surprisingly funny for an action movie  marvel got it right if only all there other movies could find the right balance in action and writing that the avengers has
Jun 14 2012,positive,the best marvel output yet
Jun 14 2012,positive,fanboys and casual moviegoers alike will both find something to love in this amazing summer movie kickoff jampacked with action humor wit questionable physics and characters you genuinely care about you have to be one serious stick in the mud to not thoroughly enjoy the avengers experience
Jun 14 2012,neutral,kind of boring should have had more action in the beginning i was falling asleep when they just kept talking and talking it was also confusing in some parts
Jun 14 2012,positive,best superhero movie ever although their are plenty of other really great superhero movies out there batman trilogy iron man captain america this movie has a compound effect having all the superheroes together with a talented directer amazing storyline awesome action scenes great actors and hilarious moments sprinkled throughout this is a must see for any action and superhero fan
Jun 14 2012,positive,better than all the films leading up to this one combined
Jun 14 2012,positive,great movie will land in my top 10 list for this yr for sure 
Jun 14 2012,positive,my new favorite movie the avengers is action packed along with some humor and a must see movie
Jun 14 2012,positive,gave it a 4 for not messing this film up could have received another star if they hadnt poorly portrayed hawkeye  yawn
Jun 14 2012,positive,so many great characters playing off each other so well funny exciting and a fun time it never hurts to have so many prequelesque movies prior to draw characterization from
Jun 14 2012,positive,this movie is greateven for fans that are not too big on marvel like me worth the watch
Jun 14 2012,positive,simply the best movie since star wars  nuff said
Jun 14 2012,positive,this movie carried the torch into the summer with its head held high i give a big kudos to director joss whedon for knowing the strengths and weaknesses of his actors and characters also for knowing what the audience was looking for in such an epic story more hulk but less bruce banner more iron man and more stark banter less captain america  i am a huge chris evans fan the character is kind of boring compared to the rest a moderate amount of thor since he is one kick butt super hero however his character no offense to chris hemsworth is a little bit lacking in the fun department hes a bit too serious add a few dashes of hawkeye and black widow for introductions sake not to mention i cant imagine a dude on the planet who would turn away a sexy scarlett in leather i cant wait to see where they take all these superhero series maybe joss can direct them all
Jun 14 2012,positive,the perfect popcorn movie
Jun 14 2012,negative,wasnt the best movie disappointment
Jun 14 2012,negative,the movie is fucking terrible  i have no clue as to why this movie has such a prominent fanbase  the avengers is just bland  none of the character psychologies in this movie are ones weve never seen before  they should have called this movie marvels delta flight movie  all of the characters seem the same  theyre all snooty  they act like a bunch of smartasses in the film  now i know the argument could be made that theyre superheroes and theyve done this before so they have the right  but there is no real character development in the movie  the only character i felt that had a story arc was thor  hes not even that interesting  also hawkeye and black widow are basically far from memorable  hulk dr banner cant break a single octave with his voice  hes like the william hurt of superheroes  iron mans stuck up attitude is tiring after 3 movies and just gets a bit annoying  the villain is a joke  locke was just not a suitable villain for such a massive production of marvel heroes  he himself is also bland and his motives are lame take over the world  in fact ive never seen another movie with so much emphasis on taking over the world  not only is this coffee bland but its also spattered into your face  i understand how when you compare marvel and dc movies together you find that batman is structurally superior and the marvel movies are just more fun  mindless fun that is  correction just mindlessness
Jun 14 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  a good balance of witty banter and action  in this day and age with high priced stars i was shocked to see all of the major actors come together for this film  i am ready for a2
Jun 14 2012,positive,good fighting scenes great cg  the story was lacking in originality and the antagonist of the story loki played tom hiddleston was just a big cry baby he couldnt be the king of his home world so he decided to make people from a whole other planet suffer  i think the villain should be more complex  interesting  i just felt loki wasnt a big threat to man kind avengers had its moments but the movie is ok the kids will love it if your a comic book fan you wont be impressed by avengers  iron man was much more entertaining to watch and thats just one super heroi give this movie  68 out 10
Jun 14 2012,positive,a feel good movie with lots of action and humor i liked it
Jun 14 2012,positive,awesome movie  hope they make more
Jun 14 2012,positive,best movie of 2012 thus far
Jun 14 2012,positive,marvellous brilliant as alwaysthe actors and actress have done good considering the pressure of presenting the super heroes
Jun 14 2012,positive,this was fun and hilarious
Jun 14 2012,positive,the missing half star from this rating comes from the questionable bias placed on iron man on the producers part despite better performance potential from the other stars
Jun 14 2012,negative,i was a bit disapointed in the advengers  i felt that i was watching another iron man movie with the other characters having guest spots  i expected the others to play larger rolls and not appear as sidekicks to iron man
Jun 14 2012,positive,a flabbergasting movie which entertains even those who have not seen the previous films with the marvel characters  i was left wanting more
Jun 14 2012,positive,awesome loved the hulk
Jun 14 2012,positive,excellent entertainment  this film does it all
Jun 14 2012,positive,this movie is over the top in everything and that is exactly how a marvel avengers movie should be
Jun 14 2012,positive,best movie of summer 12 action suspense comedy and scifi all rolled into one captain america shines as the leader of the avengers
Jun 14 2012,positive,i was sure that juggling this many characters couldnt be done especially knowing the main villain was from the clusterfuck that was thors big screen debut but joss whedon has delivered beyond reasonable expectations the avengers is about as good a  blockbuster as you could hope for  not content to merely have all the characters present and engaging in action set pieces the avengers earns trust early on with each character gradually pulled into the story with motives that stay true to their characters previous films and print legacy and allegiances forming despite initial conflict rather than being the status quo from the outset whedon manages to make the formation and idea of this team of misfits feel relateively organic despite them all coming from seemingly unrelated stories of their own  tom hiddlestons loki is far more menacing and wellused here than in thor providing palpable stakes while having as much fun as anyone else performances from all key players are uniformly on target even hemsworth  who ive made no secret of hating in thor  not only feels more at home in this film but manages to land a few laughs  while the film does struggle somewhat to wring tension from this many characters with seemingly invincible powers there is a sense of another plate ready to be spun at any moment without ever feeling excessive anything can happen but it has to happen for a reason fans of any single character checking the movie out only for them may feel shortchanged but given the complete mess this could have been its a minor miracle that it works as well as it does
Jun 14 2012,positive,joss whedons the avengers is a blockbuster in every sense it spends half of its time to build a premise only to deliver an astonishing third act that can very well be one of the best choreographed action sequences in comic book movie history that actually can be followed by the audience following five marvel movies that gave glimpses of a buildup to this it has satisfied not just the comic book fans but also the general audience for blockbusters in its gargantuan implementation    the plot is a nobrainer a cosmic level threat that endangers earth a group of heroes brought together to tackle it they fight amongst each other at first before joining hands and facing the enemy you can say its an amalgamation of roland emmerichs independence day and stephen norringtons the league of extraordinary gentlemen only sweeter the film fulfills its true purpose of entertaining the audience with superheroes performing various feats with the help of cgi effects while delivering punch liners there are scenes after scenes where we see either of the hero talking with another and delivering a line that cracks up the cinema hall tony stark aka iron man has most of them because hes played by robert downey jr there is also captain america chris evans a super soldier thor chris hemsworth a norse god bruce banner aka hulk mark ruffalo whose anger turns him into a huge green monster scarlett johansson and jeremy runner play natasha romanoff aka black widow and clint barton aka hawkeye they do not have superpowers but they are effective assassins watching over them all is nick fury samuel l jackson the head of shield who has finally got sufficient screen time than only appearing in postcredits    the main villain is loki tom hiddleston who by the end of the film thor has come to earth hes after a tesseract introduced in the film captain america that is in possession of shield and captures it along with converting some scientists and assassins to his side via hypnosis he uses the tesseract to open a portal that can bring the alien race chitauri to attack earth these monsters which are brought to earth solely to be blown up by the superheroes in various ways are not introduced until the third act so we are stuck with loki for the major part of the movie and expect him to do some bad hiddleston does a better job here to keep himself a threat against the heroes maintaining his characters wily reputation hes got some nice scenes one with black widow and another with agent phil coulson clark gregg it is a very funny sequence when he gets defeated in the end    for a superhero action movie it has some interesting scenes that has to do with the actors than special effects there is one where tony stark and bruce banner both scientists but people with deformities in their own ways discuss each others work as well as their problems another notable one would involve clark gregg and his deep reverie towards captain america    the tesseract and the alien beings chitauri are what plotgenerators call macguffins they have enough significance to be mentioned by every major player involved but lacks any importance than to be destroyed magnificently the climax takes place at manhattan which is destroyed by heroes and villains equally during the fight if the aliens cannot get hold of even manhattan whats the point to call it an earth invasion    there are enough places in the movie for the comic book fans to induce nerdgasm joss whedon himself a comic book writer whose work on xmen is said to be one of the best has understood his target crowd well to deliver an actionpacked catchphrase filled superhero lollapalooza    genre superhero action    running time 143 min    directed by joss whedon    story by zak penn joss whedon    music alan silvestri    cinematography seamus mcgarvey    cast    robert downey jr     tony stark aka iron man    chris evans                 steve rogers aka captain america    mark ruffalo               bruce banner aka the hulk    chris hemsworth      thor    tom hiddleston          loki    scarlett johansson   natasha romanoff aka black widow    jeremy runner           clint barton aka hawkeye    samuel l jackson    nick fury    clark gregg                  agent phil coulson    stellar skarsgard       dr eric selvig    cobie smulders          agent maria hill
Jun 14 2012,positive,it was great worth the time and money to go see it
Jun 14 2012,positive,awesome film best of the year thus far
Jun 13 2012,positive,instant classic period
Jun 13 2012,neutral,the movie wasnt completely awful but its ending was so predictable its final battle was just like transformers 3 the final battle ending was just like the phantom menace closing the portal was way too convenient hulk controlling his anger was convenient and why does fury keep saying fight the battles that we never could obviously its possible for you to you have 2 agents who seem to be taking care of things just fine one guy was super weak until you pumped him on steroids do that again its bull  that no one can replicate a formula created in the 1940s and the alien army dying out when the mothership blew up was the most convenient thing that has ever happened at least in the phantom menace the robots shutting down made sense because they are computers the evil alien army shouldnt have died when the mothership was destroyed if you knew they would all die then why would you send the mothership to the battle in the first place everyone talks about the dark knight rises having plot holes look at this thats why i only gave this mess and 2 out of 5 because its only strong mount is its michael bay styled action there is no complexity and no new plot it was made to entertain you with explosions for 2 and a half hours if you get it on dvd or bluray then it will probably end up on a shelf gathering dust
Jun 13 2012,positive,truly an amazingly contrived action flick
Jun 13 2012,positive,i thought this movie was amazing the 3d effects were average but the movie was awesome
Jun 13 2012,positive,excellent movie  robert downey jr really pulled the whole film together and the hulk was hilarious
Jun 13 2012,positive,the best movie of all
Jun 13 2012,positive,wow words cant explain the awsomeness that this movie holds
Jun 13 2012,positive,was oki fell asleep
Jun 13 2012,positive,just under the dark knight for best superhero movie
Jun 13 2012,positive,amazing i am still surprised with how well whedon brought all of these characters together this movie is absolute genius
Jun 13 2012,positive,sickest movie in a long time
Jun 13 2012,positive,i knew there was a reason i loved whedon absolutely loved the movie it definitely incorporated all the characters quite well and had a decent story line adored loki and the new dr banner
Jun 13 2012,positive,this movie is super
Jun 13 2012,neutral,what this is it underwhelmed to say the least    obviously the verbal sparring is fun  but loki is a terribly wimpy villain hulk got that right cant wait to see michael shannon as general zod  now that should be one helluva opponent  everyones indestructible so wheres the sense of danger that one of them might get hurt or die  hell they dont even get nose bleeds  even the more human super heroes capt america and black widow take blasts that would have killed anyone else  love how black widow jumps off a flying speeder drops 100 does a tuckandroll and gets up like no big deal  and lets compound all of this with the fact that most of these super heroes are more intent on beating the crap out of one another before even airing a cursory discussion about whats their beef  thin characters bonehead plotting  good special effects but the whole affair runs about 15 minutes too long  glad so many others enjoyed this but wow  was this ever just ok to me  for far better points of reference see xmen i and ii and iron man i these are indeed super movies
Jun 13 2012,positive,loved itaction packed funny 3d effects were cool
Jun 13 2012,positive,i just loved it saw it twice at the theater already ill buy the blu ray 3d and watch it so many times p
Jun 13 2012,positive,despite being dragged out at parts uneven and blind to some great opportunities this movie is still quite a blast the characters are wellwritten and interact amusingly the acting is not quite as uneven as the plot though it ranges from pisspoor ie cobie smulders to pitchperfect ie mark ruffalo the majority of players lean towards the latter cliches and plotholes riddle the drab story but the execution action and character play deflect those bullets
Jun 13 2012,positive,pure hollywood entertainment
Jun 13 2012,positive,awesome movie however i am more of a dc comics fan and being how good this movie is if dc ever decides to do a justice league movie they have a high bar to beat
Jun 13 2012,positive,easily the second best super hero film behind the dark knight  the way joss whedon interweaved these stories together was impressive  the depth in the story line was a little underdeveloped and cliche which was the one thing that prevented this from surpassing the dark knight as the best super hero film  i am sure the sequel will go beyond this film much like the dark knight was a better film than batman begins
Jun 13 2012,positive,just a whole lot of fun amazing special effects and action funny and entertaining
Jun 13 2012,positive,great points the heroes disappointing points the villain
Jun 13 2012,positive,this movie was excellent and a must for all comic book nerds i wouldve liked to see a little less of the punch lines and more of the story behind each superhero but overall well made
Jun 13 2012,positive,the movie was exceptional this is a must see if you have not seen it yet  i thought the combination of actors and their characters were well managed and merged perfectly with the visual effects  the one character that pushed it over the top for me was the hulk who in my opinion was the best
Jun 13 2012,positive,amazing wasnt even looking forward to this but turned out i loved it good movie

Jun 13 2012,positive,actioncomedygreat movie
Jun 13 2012,positive,loved it i wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over
Jun 13 2012,negative,very disappointing the story was almost nonexistent and it was so boring that there was a steady stream of people wandering out  it was saved by the ending which was mediocre by todays standards very little tension and far too much motion blur 310
Jun 13 2012,positive,i havent been so thrilled to see a superhero movie since iron man 1
Jun 13 2012,positive,im not sure what everybody is raving about it was good but it wasnt the dark knight  i think maybe im just tired or superhero comic book movies all style and very little substance  for what it was it was quality so i guess that bumps it up to 35 stars
Jun 13 2012,positive,epic amazing incredible
Jun 13 2012,positive,easily the best film of the year joss wrote perfectly for all the characters

Jun 13 2012,positive,most entertaining flick ive seen in a long time
Jun 13 2012,positive,awesome love you joss
Jun 13 2012,positive,well it was pretty much what i expected  fans of the long list of recently rushed marvel hero films will be satisfied with this bloated nobrainer action flick i was reminded a lot of the transformers films as it pretty much consists of non stop cgi fuelled action and explosions for the full two and a half hours  it had plenty of funny bits thanks to the influence of joss whedon but the fact that all the super heroes are virtually invincible and will have to appear in the next 2 films they make completely saps any tension from the movie yes they are going to all survive yes they are going to win  also i understand why they changed the actor for bruce banner and ruffalo is perfectly acceptable but i prefered edward norton
Jun 13 2012,positive,i know what all of you were thinking they dont show the hulk that much in the commercials well hulk has plenty of amazing scenes the avengers was hands down the best movie ive ever seen in my entire life and will be the same for many years to come it gives each character equal time and equal wittyaction scenes mostly all together it concludes very tastefully and leaves u wanting more which well get in a year or two a must see for anyone
Jun 13 2012,positive,a perfectly exciting action movie mixed with humor all together great movie
Jun 13 2012,positive,awesome just awesome
Jun 13 2012,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a while the only thing that turns me off is nick fury samuel l jacksons increasingly cliche superhero movie saying through out the whole film tom hiddleson is a stunning super villan ruffalo seems made for the hulk role evans and helmsworth work for their respective roles robert downy jr is a natural fit as tony stark jeremy renner is a pleasant surprise as hawkeye showing of his inner bamf scarlet johannson serves no real purpose in this movie except to be a pretty face joss has set the standard for what a superhero movie should be 45 stars
Jun 13 2012,positive,everything looks right out of the pages of this marvel franchise best 3d experience till now
Jun 13 2012,positive,its insane how good the movie is
Jun 13 2012,positive,the avengers has what every superhero movie needs with nonstop action spectacular visual effect solid acting solid script and laughable jokes it really gives fans what they have waited for since the 2008 iron man
Jun 13 2012,negative,not good at all crap in fact
Jun 13 2012,positive,off the chartscant wait for the next one
Jun 13 2012,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its amazing
Jun 13 2012,positive,if the hobbit doesnt blow me away this movie is the greatest movie of the year
Jun 13 2012,positive,great all around movie it had everything all action movies should model off the avengers
Jun 13 2012,positive,great movie not gona lie but my boy spiderman no1 will ever touch those yep the 3rd 1 as well of course it was 2 rushed like im 2
Jun 13 2012,positive,i wishh i could rate this 10 stars i loved every bit of this movie from robert downey jrs comedy to the hulks action there was a lot of pressure on this movie to be good and for the producers to get it right and they did a very good job in making this as alive as can be
Jun 13 2012,positive,the film isnt perfect as its destructive reign at the box office might lead you to believe ill get it out of the way im a dc fanboy batman and superman have consumed more time in my life than id care to divulge  i entered to john williams superman theme at my wedding my wife the much more traditional canon in d im not one of those who is so biased he cant see the competetitors merchandise for what they are avengers is a substantial achievement interweaving multiple films with a multitude of stars and hex woven into a singular narrative a robot man a norse god and a super soldier walk into a bar is no small feat marvel set the bar high when iron man stormed the gates in 2008 it was a sight to behold rdj defined the role in a way that was going to make it difficult for any actor choosing to take the mantle when he inevitably steps down a task the superman franchise has yet to successfully accomplish after reeves stepped down as the last son of kryptonin 1987 incredible hulk was amusing if forgettable captain america and thor were both superbly fun and well crafted they simply felt like they had just come off the superhero assembly line i dont mean it in a cruel way theyre good films they just arent superb ones avengers was more than the sum of its parts thanks in no small part to joss whedon if you dont know who that is and call yourself a nerd get out now his ability to tell stories with a massive cast in tow is well documented firefly dollhouse astonishing xmen buffy angel as a matter of fact id say the only other one to successfully do so would be bryan singer on his xmen films sorry ratner i really really liked this film but i wanted to love it there were so many moments i wanted to stand up and cheer but i dont think i ever connected personally with the characters it was a rollcoaster ride and a d fine one to be sure i just wanted some moments of subtlety something personal i know what youre thinking shut up nerd nothing makes you guys happy not true x2 superman the movie and batman beginsthe dark knight are just about as close to movie making perfections as you can get i can watch any of these at the drop of a hat and be roughly as amused as i was the first time i saw them just bc joss didnt get the brass ring this time doesnt mean he cant reach for it next time
Jun 13 2012,negative,i really dont know if i am mad or the people who are liking it  seriously immensely  overhyped filmdont get me wrong i love superhero moviesiron man 1 is marvels best movie 2 stars 1 for hulk 1 for effort 
Jun 13 2012,positive,too much like the last transformers
Jun 13 2012,positive,great super hero movie to think the guy that directed buffy and angel pulled this off just amazing
Jun 13 2012,positive,i like super heros movies all the characters were great just hope they can keep it going and keep all the same actors come on justice league
Jun 13 2012,neutral,was so bored the first hour in i turned it off
Jun 13 2012,positive,it was a really good movie a lot of unexpected scenes id watch it again
Jun 13 2012,positive,what more is to be said its the avengers man  kick ass
Jun 13 2012,positive,loved it cant wait for a sequel
Jun 13 2012,positive,despite having our theaters stuffed with an annoyingly overabundant amount of superhero movies the avengers reminds us why were so drawn certainly entertaining for all ages you cant help but keep in mind who will really enjoy this film kids marvel sets the perfect stage for the dreams of any youngster brings to life our own inner childhood fantasy injects steroids into it and calls it a movie
Jun 13 2012,positive,as always good action scenes
Jun 13 2012,positive,it was just i had expected it to be weak storyline amazing action and campy humor somehow in the small gaps between the action sequences you could hear crickets chirping and there were quite a lot of technical errors on the whole its a nice summer movie where you put on the 3d glasses shut down your brain sit back with a butload of popcorn and cola and enjoy  imo xmen first class was much much better but thats just my opinion
Jun 13 2012,positive,highly enjoyable superhero romp with a nice injection of silly humour
Jun 13 2012,positive,in a film like the avengers which brings together strands of several prior pictures into a mostly cohesive whole it is arguably inevitable that individual pieces will end up working better than the sum of its parts that the film works at all is almost a miracle and its so purely entertaining and contains so much that works like gangbusters that its tempting to ignore what doesnt work and merely salute the enterprise it is a relentlessly engaging and confident motion picture boasting a cast that in a more respected genre would make it an oscarbait film but the film comes so close to outandout greatness that its almost disheartening to point out the core issues at fault both because it feels petty and because its almost a genre masterpiece still there is much to like and quite a bit to love about joss whedons the avengers on a pure popcorn spectacle scale i cant imagine anyone feeling that they didnt get their moneys worth as a piece of art however its a trickier proposition  im forgoing a plot synopsis because i cant imagine anyone reading this who doesnt have a general idea of the film and its characters first of all the initial twelve minute precredits sequence is absolutely terrible its a poorly written stiltedlyperformed setpiece that artlessly reintroduces tom hiddlestons loki thors turncoat brother and establishes the mcguffin the rediscovered tesseract from captain america its byfar the worst sequence in the film so its mostly uphill from there anyway the rest of the first act is spent reintroducing our favorite marvel heroes and reestablishing relationships captain americahimself steve rogers chris evans gets somewhat less to do in this early chunk as the film makes it clear that he is a supporting character in this superhero teamup its no secret that a scene involving rogers trying to reconnect with his old life didnt make the cut for continuity junkies like myself it is a thrill to see tony stark robert downey jr and pepper potts gwyneth paltrow in a mutually beneficial romantic relationship and starks recruitment moments with shield agent phil coulson clark gregg crackle with familiarity and genuine friendship among all three of them the introductory bits for black widow scarlett johansson and bruce banner mark ruffalo are filled with intelligence and wit while the somewhat delayed entrance for thor chris hemsworth provides one of the most emotionally compelling moments in the film the genuine brotherly love that thor and loki share gives the herovillain relationship a deeper shading and hiddleston once again refuses to play a purely stock villain his confidence and certainty is a bluff  this first act ends with most of the heroes introduced to each other and coexisting as they attempt to decipher lokis master plan its this middle 45minute chunk where the picture soars the highest the dialogue is vintage whedon even while every character speaks in a voice uniquely their own tony stark is genuinely thrilled to be conversing with a scientist of banners capabilities and banner warmly embraces at least one person who cares more about the scientist than the monster inside of him downey jr gives a better allaround performance here than he did in iron man 2 while mark ruffalo once again proves how effortlessly he elevates every film he appears in johansson gets several enjoyable moments including an interrogation sequence that both reveals backstory and establishes character with all the talk about how notedfeminist joss whedon would handle a brofest like the avengers the answer is simple neither natasha romanoff ie  black widow or shield agent maria hill colbie smulders are remotely sexualized and their skills are completely taken for granted moreover if you look around the shield aircraft about half of the onscreen agents just happen to be women    anyway this second act is where the picture shines perfectly balancing character interaction with token plot advancement while climaxing with a spectacular action setpiece that is both viscerally exciting and emotionally engaging  hemsworth gets surprisingly little screentime overall considering that the film is most closely connected to thor but he gets far more of an opportunity to bring the thunder than he did in his debut picture at least they bother to explain why natalie portman isnt around  clark gregg basically operates as the coolheaded professional amid the carnage as well as occasionally as the audience surrogate as thrilled to see these guys all in the same room as we theoretically would be  smulders is basically an exposition device while jeremy renners barton ie  hawkeye spends so much time under the brainwashing control of loki that he doesnt really get to do more than cut loose in the action climax  still pretty much everyone enjoys interacting with everyone else and the fun is supremely contagious  truth be told the secondact conflict doesnt make sense in hindsight were told that these superpowered heroes cant get along yet they only come to blows when nick furys a frankly slumming samuel l jackson subterfuge is revealed they seem to work together just fine except when shield gets in the way  still the secondact climax pushes a token emotional button and the film even acknowledges that the wouldbe heros journey is somewhat fabricated for the sake of uniting these damaged souls and the whole concept of these grand heroes coming together to solve a problem seems unnecessary point being if aliens invaded the earth would it not be expected that iron man captain america thor and the fellow agents of shield would make a choice to at least pitch in and prevent widespread carnage the idea that nick fury has a grand idea to unite these heroes and that these heroes have to put aside their differences to work as a team seems like an attempt to graft an overriding theme to a story that really doesnt have one its a minor quibble but the whole avengers initiative that nick fury endlessly babbles about seems like a solution to a nonexistent problem  furthermore like so many wouldbe event pictures the films storytelling basically ceases at the 23 mark so that the big climactic battle scene can begin if youve seen any of the marketing you know that the film ends with an alien invasion in downtown manhattan the action itself is fluidly shot creatively staged and coherently edited and while it avoids repetition because it has enough recognizable combatants to always have someone different to cut to the climax is a purely visceral exercise with just enough crowdpleasing moments to overcome its familiarity to last summers transformers dark of the moon unlike last summers michael bay fx demoreel the invading aliens seem to go out of their way to not vaporize civilians and bystanders onscreen to the point where their shoot to miss strategy becomes noticeable and while alan silvestris score is serviceable its badly missing some kind of unifying theme andor emotional chorus that would give the pyrotechnics a jolt when required steve jablonsky may have cribbed the zeck hemsy inception trailer music for the transformers 3 climax but it damnwell worked and the logistics of lokis plan call into question the basic intelligence of our heroes as we ask ourselves why they didnt realize where lokis attack point was going to be right from the start andor why that specific building doesnt seem to have even basic security measures still the film does right by each of its heroes giving them each multiple chances to shine yes the hulk does indeed smash and it is pretty terrific when he does  the climax also highlights the inherent danger of having a shared universe as you have to somewhat explain why every capable hero doesnt pitch in when the chips are down as we see human avengers like black widow and hawkeye doing a perfectly fine job fending off the invaders we have to stop and wonder why other equally capable reinforcements didnt show up to help why are none of the other shield agents defending the city why didnt stark call in rhodes to man the war machine battlesuit why doesnt odin conjure up some dark magic and send asgardian warriors since its his son thats causing this chaos in the first place and without a superpowered villain to fightdestroy in the finale loki is around but hes basically watching his handiwork and sneering or any kind of statusquo changing moment to end on the film lacks an emotional climax of any kind spoiler  the film needs to end with the heartbreak of thor killing loki but marvel doesnt have the courage for that kind of finality its all about watching people in candycolored suits blowing up a vaguelyrobotic army considering joss whedon is known for his unabashedly operatic season finales for buffy the vampire slayer and angel it is borderline shocking that the film lacks any kind of story or characterdriven climax to go along with its largescale action beats the film further annoys in this regard by threatening to kill the one character who you mostcertainly know isnt going to die  so if the film lacks the heart and narrative discipline of joe johnstons captain america it is easily better smarter and justplain more entertaining than any marvel studios production not set in the 1940s the dialogue is generally whipsmart and laughoutloud clever at the same time all of the principle performers are in peak form and the picture has a scale that does its fourcolor origins proud and while i may have desired more than just fireworks during the third act those fireworks are quite impressive and are truly cinematic in nature but the plot is a bit confused with much of the film spent jogging in place for the inevitable climactic smackdown promised in the trailers the film opens and ends pretty terribly with an epilogue that has a bunch of news footage praising and criticizing the newly revealed heroes plus fury babbling yet again about how the heroes will return when they are needed while brushing off the shocking realworld implications of what just happened both the invasion and the response  but the middle twohours are rocksolid entertainment throughandthrough tony stark is allowed genuine character progression while mark ruffalo is such a fun bruce banner that id gladly watch a solo hulk film where he never actually hulkedout when the avengers highlights the character interaction that makes up the soap operaish world of comic books with great actors digging into genuinely meaty characters its firing on all cylinders and the action sequences even when they are purely about the action choreography and special effects are topnotch even the 3d looks great longstory short i wish the avengers was a truly terrific film but ill have to settle for it merely being a darngood movie

Jun 13 2012,positive,brilliant movie favorite movie of the year
Jun 13 2012,positive,really enjoyed this the dynamics between the heroes are entertainingly explored and the film doesnt lose momentum at any point  the 3d aspect wasnt necessary as i didnt feel it was utilised well kept me engaged for the whole 142 mins
Jun 13 2012,positive,enjoyable fun reasonable storyline whose twists and turns werent totally predictable good action scenes

Jun 13 2012,positive,awesome movie in 2d but it is even better in 3d
Jun 12 2012,positive,good action ok story should see it in 3d didnt like the kiddy humor
Jun 12 2012,negative,completely stupid action rubbish bored of enless sequels marvel have now moved into a tagteam style format the individuals dont really have interlocking abilities though usual bad man is bad plot daddy didnt love him enough  diddums and the usual massively overpowered heros ensures success before the film even begins unexpected glee when black widow lol tricks the bad man into telling her a secret and some excellent cartoonlike slapstick moments from the hulk also a flying aircraft carrier no really
Jun 12 2012,positive,loved the plot best movie hulk yet
Jun 12 2012,positive,movie was very drawn out  hulk made it worth it  robert downey jr was awesome and scarlett is always great to look at
Jun 12 2012,positive,greatest movie i have ever seen so far it combines action suspense comedy and a feel for characters other movies tried so hard to do and fail iron man was great but avengers is greater and its the only movie to get the hulk right and show how he cool he is

Jun 12 2012,positive,seen it four times so far will most likely see it again before it leaves theatres
Jun 12 2012,positive,great apex after all the build up movies that came before
Jun 12 2012,positive,the most solid ensemble heroes flick of the last decade  joss whedons trademark wit and pacing mark this film as a keeper  everyone pulls their weight from iron man to the recently unthawed captain america and even hawkeye and black widow  worth the big screen bucks
Jun 12 2012,positive,best  superhero  movie  ever    thank you joss for restoring my faith that such films are still possible
Jun 12 2012,positive,good fun show lol several times

Jun 12 2012,positive,honestly one of the best movies ive ever seen every single character had a perfect character arc and every one got great screentime visual effects were second to none and every actoractress is at the top of their game really really good movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,great movie loved it
Jun 12 2012,positive,loved this movie it was the best 3d movie i have seen yet  lots of 3d though out the movie
Jun 12 2012,neutral,the appeal of this movie lies in the action sequences the characters are played well namely the hulk but if you like movies with deeper meaning iron man was a movie about weapons manufacturing xmen first class was about the cold war avengers will disappoint because its all about mindless violence
Jun 12 2012,positive,best movie ever i know that there wasnt really anything to avenge but an epic movie topped with some awesomness funny too but the action was the best i think the hulk will smash if you hate on him
Jun 12 2012,positive,best movie of the summer
Jun 12 2012,positive,best superhero movie of all time without a doubt the movie poster will be listed with blockbuster inside the dictionary

Jun 12 2012,positive,excellent movie good storyline and lots of action
Jun 12 2012,positive,better than i imagined it would be
Jun 12 2012,negative,i just saw with my wife scarlet johannsens unbelievably brilliant performance in lost in translation and would die to see her like that again i didnt hate this but i am so sick of cg efx sick sick sick all the movies out of hollywood are crap these days and the rt critics have lost their taste barometers completely 93 positive horrid
Jun 12 2012,positive,takes what made it predeceasing films work and puts it all together the chemistry of this team is simply perfect they may not get along but theyd take a bullet for each other havent seen it yet what are you doing reading what other people think i know this much this is one movie released in my lifetime that is destined to be a classic

Jun 12 2012,positive,the best movie out there lots of funny moments while still delivering non stop action
Jun 12 2012,positive,was freaking awesome hulk kicked butt
Jun 12 2012,positive,it was pretty great
Jun 12 2012,neutral,as much as this film was hyped up i feel that this film falls over the first hurdle right at the early stages which really disappoints me as this was involving many of the marvel universe characters to be teamed up for the first time that had done so well on their own from previous blockbuster films        i found that the pacing of the story was very slow and was very mellow and really didnt have the same sort of tension youd normally find from the characters from the comics plus at times i felt it lacked any sort of direction   the only positive side is the companies like double negative had really put together some top notch vfx especially during the climatic battle at the end id also like to add that the hulk character is a significant improvement from past films in aspects of animation there were times however when there was a lot of green screen moments which looked really awkard on screen as it felt a bit off minor speculation   what i really hope to see from the next film is that they focus more on the story and the character development between one another rather than focusing on the vfx which we know they can already deliver
Jun 12 2012,positive,great action scenes but couldve used more the middle gets a little slow
Jun 12 2012,positive,awesome superhero movie excellent action and graphics
Jun 12 2012,positive,probably the best movie this year bringing together a wide range of cast and joining four separate movie heroes in a seamless and believable story i am soo watching this one a few hundred more times when its released in dvd
Jun 12 2012,positive,the powerful cast excellent graphics and brilliant directions makes this film a splendid summer viewing
Jun 12 2012,positive,action packed witty and incredible i dont usually watch superhero movies but im glad i saw this one
Jun 12 2012,positive,legan  wait for it  dary
Jun 12 2012,positive,the comic movie ive been waiting 20 years to see
Jun 12 2012,positive,not the perfect marvel filmbut darn close to it
Jun 12 2012,positive,put together very well  i loved it
Jun 12 2012,positive,loved the cinematography make sure you stay through the credits for an extra scene
Jun 12 2012,negative,this is the most overhyped overrated and blandly created movie ever created if you like superhero movies watch this movie because you have terrible taste in cinema if you dont like superheroes and have good taste in cinema go watch something else anything
Jun 12 2012,positive,worth the wait seen it 4 times and still not enough i can not find anything really bad to say about it
Jun 12 2012,positive,thats was amazing movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,from the point of view of a noncomic book fan i thoroughly enjoyed this movie  a long running time combined with a great deal of scene setting dogged the first half of the film which has prevented me from giving a full 55 but once the scene was set and the film fully kicks into top gear it is utterly flawless in execution   show stealer mark ruffalo  inspired choice for the hulk
Jun 12 2012,positive,after five years of waiting and 5 other movies it is finally here and man was this movie awesome i was honestly expecting to be disapointed just because this movie was so hyped and to think about it it was the 6th film in a series but it was really good loki as the bad guy i thought before it was a poor choice was dead on he was much more evil compared to more jealous and trickster like in thor all the heroes were good and it didnt feel all mashed together they all kept their induviduality which i was afraid wouldnt happen but robert downey jr steals the show but not too much that he over shadows everyone else plus there are some sweet fight scenes between the heroes hulk vs thor thor vs iron man and we were kind of robbed of iron man vs captain american but i guess ill forgive them also mark ruffalo was a much better bruce banner then i thought he would be the movie is just shy of 2 and a half hours but its not draggy whatsoever i honestly wished it was longer minus the dark knight the avengers is my favorite super herocomic movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,great movie for the nerd on all of us
Jun 12 2012,positive,amazing it takes your expectations for a superhero movie let alone marvel film and blows it out of the water sky high the characters were perfect the story was perfect the effects where perfect i have not one complaint if i did it would come across as nitpicking and when it comes to film its not how i play
Jun 12 2012,positive,best movie i have seen in a very long time amazing
Jun 12 2012,positive,the first marvel film that manages to balance action and comedy combining characters that didnt work too well in their own films captain america and thor that work well in this one
Jun 12 2012,positive,i was great action packed and funny awesome movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,action packedawesome
Jun 12 2012,positive,awesome movie action packed funny i didnt want the movie to end looking forward to a sequel

Jun 12 2012,positive,greatest comicbased movie ever
Jun 12 2012,positive,wonderful full of excitement
Jun 12 2012,positive,liked it good in jokes and ties in the characters well  not sure about the whole loki as a bad guy thing too wimpy but overall it was a good film
Jun 12 2012,positive,awesome movie  besides a little dawdling in first half the movie made a huge stride in second half action was top notch great humor and hulks smash were inevitably the main highlights of the movie two thumbs up
Jun 12 2012,positive,awesome movie love captain america
Jun 12 2012,positive,the best super hero movie to date
Jun 12 2012,positive,f awesome robert downey jr always gives us one hell of a performance i wish though the new hulk had his own movie like all the others i could see him being a good hulk but hes drowned out in this film because of everyones else presence which just made me miss edward norton that much more that would have been one hell of a movie to see robert and edward look out i really like how this series is going adding each characters own movie then adding em into the fray with the others
Jun 12 2012,positive,very actionpacked must see for marvel fans
Jun 12 2012,positive,really good actors very good plot very good movie
Jun 12 2012,positive,with the release of iron man in 2008 marvel studios ignited an unprecedented plan in movie marketing  instead of simply commissioning another super hero teamup film and inundating the public with commercials web banners and billboards marvel decided to âdouble downâ  in an effort to separate themselves from other marvel properties licensed out to 20th century fox such as xmen and the fantastic four marvel studios spotlighted each major character from the avengers in their own feature film  the five films iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger all achieved moderate to great success at the box office  but their individual accolades were simply byproducts of their primary function extremely expensive and wellmade commercials to generate unparalleled anticipation for an oceanâtms elevenesque super hero extravaganza that could blow the mind of even the most critical of all fan bases  marvel studios placed its fate in the 220 million hands of this film trusting it will serve as the lightning rod for the next round of individual sequels as well as new projects  but first the avengers must make the dollars assemble  iron man thor captain america hawkeye black widow and the hulk must unite as a team to fight off the alien invasion attempt by thorâtms adopted brother and the god of trickery loki and secure the cosmic cube before he    oh does the synopsis really matter itâtms the avengers for god sake  earthâtms mightiest heroes come together to save the world duh  with a builtin audience of this proportion that wouldâtmve purchased tickets before there was even a capital âtâ on the scriptâtms title page itâtms the âhowâ not the âwhyâ thatâtms important  joss whedon revered for his scifi television work on buffy the vampire slayer angel and firefly is the very brave soul who took on the directing and screenplay writing for this incredibly ambitious project  before whedon even uttered the word âactionâ for the first time on set his biggest challenge would be obvious allocate ample screen time for all of the characters while simultaneously keeping them relevant to the plot  the xmen franchise failed in that attempt with major pieces feeling like they were crowbarred into the story like halle berryâtms storm and james marsdenâtms cyclops  whedonâtms result  well say alltime great and hall of fame baseball player mickey mantle hit a ball out of yankee stadium then the hulk who just happened to be standing right outside eating hot dogs and smashing the cart jumps up and thunderclaps the ball into outer space at which time superman on a slow crime day flies by during a âcleanup the orbitâ walkathon catches the ball and flings it into the next galaxy as he very irresponsibly litters across the universe    it would still not match the mammoth home run that is the film the avengers  in creating this film whedon has reveled his own super powered alter ego  he is simply âthe maestroâ  every character no really every character is integral to the story  much like the hulk himself the filmâtms bmi is 0 itâtms pure muscle not an ounce of fat added or a second wasted  even unheralded characters like jeremy rennerâtms hawkeye and scarlett johanssonâtms black widow are emphasized with paralleled importance and captivation to the main players within the plot  whedon conducts a master symphony for how to incorporate a large cast into a heightened reality without losing the individual relationships and genuinely humorous moments between the characters  no one is going to mistake lines from the avengers with the shawshank redemption however the the avengers script carefully walks the tightrope between movie and comic book quality dialogue  the intangible and sometimes corny feeling of a comic book is present when characters like captain america speak but the syntax is ampedup to match the grandiose stage of the film  as important as good dialogue is to a film a comic book movie is doa without great fight scenes  the action in the avengers is the stuff of pure geek dreams with special attention paid to the hulk  as with every hero teamup in comic book history the characters are not friends right away first they must have a misunderstanding and square off against one another  itâtms just an old but necessary tactic in comics so that fans get to see how one hero would do in battle versus another  kudos to whedon for keeping that timehonored tradition and having the wherewithal to know that much of what makes a successful comic book film are the things you donâtmt change  of course for the film to even have a prayer at joining the upper echelon of super hero cinema the avengers need to battle an exceptional villain  loki played once again by tom hiddleston from thor gets to flex his âevil muscleâ even more than in the characterâtms previous film  in one particular standout scene hiddleston exhibits lokiâtms power of breaking down a personâtms psyche in such a menacing way that it temporarily revs up the characterâtms âevil meterâ to jokerlike levels further exemplifying the pain and unraveling loki continues to deal with himself  as for the heroes the chemistry between the big four of iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth the hulk mark ruffalo and captain america chris evans is quite impressive  fittingly the mood and conversation is very awkward when they first meet but by the end of the film itâtms as if theyâtmve known each other for years  downeyâtms 11 depiction of tony stark from the comics is once again unsurpassed but to spotlight another performance and perhaps the most challenging to convey in all the scifi madness is chris evans captain americasteve rodgers  rodgers not only has to deal with an alien invasion trusting new teammates and the fate of the world but heâtms also still grieving over the loss of everything heâtms ever known from his life in the 1940âtms  the introduction of a new and confusing world in 2012 is as alien to him as lokiâtms army  evans is able to incorporate a believable innocence and ignorance for captain america galvanizing the team at their most difficult moment and elevating to the levelheaded and courageous leader everyone respects  earthâtms mightiest heroes were already smashing box office records around the world before day 1 on us screens  even more important this film will earn repeat business that could rival titanic or avatar making it the 12th film to break the billiondollar mark  that kind of revenue would prove the formula used by marvel studios to set up this film is an unmitigated success green lighting each of the individual avengers sequels scripts for lesserknown characters in marvelâtms gallery and an inevitable counter reaction from rival dc comics to finally bring the justice league to the big screen  story               85 acting             85 writing            85 captivation     10 replay value  10  total             91 out of 10    epilogue  five years later  after the avengers 2 and the justice league rake in a combined total 1 zillion producers from each studio will be taken by stealth submarine to a secret meeting with director james cameron at the bottom of the mariana trench to negotiate a deal for the avengers vs the justice league in super imax 5d hologram resulting in a paradox that will turn hair white and burn out the eye sockets of every geek in the world a la what the âburning bushâ did to moses in the ten commandments and the ark of the covenant to the nazis in raiders of the lost ark respectively  canâtmt wait
Jun 12 2012,positive,fantastic edge of your seat kinda stuff good all rounder
Jun 12 2012,positive,when i see the movie i felt like this is iron man and hulk movie the other heroes arent that important good comedy cool cgi and actually its already expected to be good just lack of overwhelming sequence its only whelming and although its a great family movie but absolutely isnt the movie of the year or something
