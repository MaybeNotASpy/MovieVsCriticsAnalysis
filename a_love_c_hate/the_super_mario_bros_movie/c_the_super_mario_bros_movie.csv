"Dec 22, 2023",neutral," Ever since the success of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider making $275 million at the box office back in 2001 it has felt that Hollywood has realised that the gamer’s buck is one worth chasing. The only issue during that time is that ‘good’ movies based on video games have been incredibly difficult to make. While some – like Resident Evil and Unchartered seem to have one people over – there have been a myriad of lovers that have been universally caned for either not capturing the game properly or even just being a ‘bad’ film. With that in mind you have to consider that Nintendo’s move to make The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a pretty brave one. On one hand you have one of the most popular video game franchises, which should ensure an audience for the film, but the other hand that means there are a lot of gamers out there expecting perfection from this film… and they already had one false start with the woeful 1993 film adaption of the games which only manage to save face because it has slowly become a cult favourite over the years. Directed by the team that brought us the brilliant Teen Titans Go! To The Movies – Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic – The Super Mario Bros. Movie begins in New York with Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt – The Guardians Of The Galaxy) and Luigi (Charlie Day – The Lego Movie) trying to set up their own plumbing business – despite everybody including their parents telling them they should give up on the dream. When a major sewer emergency suddenly occurs Mario leaps into action deciding that this is the moment where the brothers can prove their worth. However instead they find themselves sucked down a supernatural pipe and find themselves in a strange new land. However, while Mario finds himself in the beautiful Kingdom ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy – The Witch) Luigi finds himself in the Badlands and soon a prisoner of the evil Bowser (Jack Black – School Of Rock) who is planning on world domination even if that means crushing everyone in his way. There is a lot to like about The Super Mario Bros. Movie. It is bright, it is flashy and it has some pretty decent action sequences mixed in with humour but the film does have an obvious weakness – it feels like it is aimed at a younger market which might make some of the older games who have grown up playing the Mario Bros. games feel a little awkward in the cinema. To be honest there is a lot more to like about this film than what there is to dislike. The story, although thin, does hold up and the screenplay, written by Matthew Fogel (Minions: The Rise Of Gru), brings in some really important lessons for the younger audience members. Plots revolving around things like never giving up on your dreams and always being their for your friends are never a bad thing to have in a movie. There are also plenty of laughs to be had throughout the movie especially once Mario meets up with Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen – Superbad) and to be honest it is the relationship between those two that holds the audience’s interest once the action pieces begin to become a little mundane. One of the things that Matthew Fogel does need to be congratulated about though is the fact that he turns the story around a little. This could have easily have become the stereotypical Mario and Luigi are sent to rescue the damsel in distress plot but instead Fogel reimagines that with Luigi being the character in danger Princess Peach becoming a kick-ass heroine determined to not only rescue him but to save her Kingdom – it is a nice touch that works well. By now you have probably heard the buzz online about the voice cast attached to the film. While Chris Pratt and Charlie Day may not have been the ‘ideal’ choices to voice Mario and Luigi they do an okay job with what they have been given to work with. The big winners though in that department are Seth Rogen and Jack Black. Rogen takes the character of Donkey Kong and runs with it – not only does he have fun with it but it feels like he totally becomes the much-loved character. Likewise it seems that Jack Black was given free reign with the character of Bowser and the result is something kind of special – with some songs thrown in to make use of Black’s musical talents as well.  Is The Super Mario Bros. Movie a great film? No. Is it worth going to see? Yes. While it is obvious that the movie is aimed for the younger gamers out there those older members of the audience that have grown up playing the games all their lives will find enough easter Eggs throughout the film to keep them happy, but they may find themselves wishing there was a little more to the plot at times. One hot tip though – make sure you stick around to after the credits because one of those easter eggs hints at something pretty special for the sequel."
"Dec 19, 2023",negative,Scientifically designed in a lab for the broadest possible appeal and the least offense that could possibly be made.
"Dec 8, 2023",positive," There were a lot of animated films this year. While that seems to be the case every year this past decade, 2023 has a lot of big-name titles. And despite having caught up with most of the non-Hollywood titles (NIMONA, SUZUME, etc.), I needed to catch those others. ELEMENTAL last week. MARIO, TMNT, and WISH this week. And there’s still THE BOY AND THE HERON, ROBOT DREAMS, THE MONKEY KING, and CHICKEN RUN: DAWN OF THE NUGGET to go. Add the live-action screeners to that list and it really is impossible to see them all. We’re less than two weeks from the GWNYFCA vote, so I’ll be focusing on English-language most since the group doesn’t generally watch many foreign films. Then I’ll pivot to the International Oscar submission before the OFCS voting window that starts 1/1/24. There’s always a strategy. The order of watching does matter. I only hope that Searchlight hits my inbox with POOR THINGS and A24 hits my mailbox with THE IRON CLAW soon. Both open Buffalo on 12/21 … two days after the nominations cutoff. It really is wild that a major Hollywood studio and multi-billion-dollar toy company allowed something like BARBIE to be made. The self-awareness and self-parodying on display is of the sort that would normally be quashed via legal jargon in whatever contract director Greta Gerwig had to sign before starting to write the script with Noah Baumbach. If that doesn’t show you the power of sitting at the table, whether it comes to box office take or Oscar nominations, I don’t know what will. Gerwig took her clout and turned it into that rare product-placement tie-in that actually has something valuable to say. Don’t call the result a message movie, though. It never stands on a soapbox or demeans one side in order to champion another (I’d honestly argue it could have done a lot more to skewer Mattel executives with purpose rather than merely jokes). It simply allows its characters to naturally evolve by way of providing necessary conflict. Because none of these dolls have ever faced that sort of existential crisis before. They’ve all maintained their pristine utopian forms in Barbieland as they were passed from child to child so their innocence could become a personality trait. So, throwing a curveball like depression or fallibility proves to be a monumental adjustment. You’re going from zero (a record loop of routine complacency) to sixty (questioning the very fabric of your reality) in an instant. No wonder it throws Barbie (Margot Robbie) off enough that her body chemistry shifts. Give a perfect imaginary ideal a whiff of the cesspool that is human biology and everything falls apart. Because it also falls apart that fast for us. One setback can spiral into years of torment. That yo-yo-ing ruins lives because we crave normalcy. To start over? To realize we’ve never actually begun? That’s too daunting to even consider. What’s ingenious about Gerwig and Baumbach’s story (say what you will about the whole, but you cannot deny the best part of BARBIE outside its immaculate production design is its script) is that they kill two birds with one stone via their conceit. Not only is the idea of Barbieland being a literal manifestation of a child’s imagination allow them to dig into a Barbie’s potential to empower (connecting each doll to the many youngsters who have indelible memories of them), but it lets them comment on the ways in which the toy’s reductive nature in a patriarchal, capitalistic world is problematic for those gains too. Barbie awakens to the fear and anxieties of being a woman in a man’s world just as Ken (Ryan Gosling) opens his eyes to the possibilities of having autonomy after a lifetime of always being relegated as the plus-one. We begin to see that neither end of the spectrum is perfect (although we should all be able to agree that Barbieland is much closer) and that the real lesson is realizing empathy and originality is key. And that it’s not always external forces that delude us into thinking conformity is better. Oftentimes our worst enemy in that regard is ourselves. Can dolls made real who bring back what they learned to their fictional existence teach that lesson alone? No. They get halfway with some wonderfully witty humor capped off by memorable turns from Michael Cera as Allan and Kate McKinnon as “Weird” Barbie, but we need someone on the other side to complement and bolster that journey. Enter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) and her mother Gloria (America Ferrera)—two women fighting for their place in a world that treats them like second class citizens. Two women who can educate the Barbies about reality and reclaim a bit of magic by remembering what it means to dream. The result is inspiring. It’s also heartbreaking (yes, Ferrera’s monologue is that good and hopefully turns her into a dark horse Oscar pick). For all the great things Robbie and Gosling are doing on a comedic level of committing to the bit, their brilliance lies in the ability to also bring pathos to a narrative that never shies away from the complicated nature of listening to, understanding, and ultimately accepting another’s lived experience and desires. Because we all deserve to exist as our own person outside the shadows of utility, ownership, or conditions. We all deserve the opportunity to love ourselves and have that be enough. For those who don’t understand that THE WALKING DEAD is about the living monsters rather than the undead ones, director Tae-hwa Eom and co-writer Lee Shin-ji’s CONCRETE UTOPIA might be able to drive the point home. Why? Because the living monsters are the only ones available in their webtoon adaptation (Kim Soongnyung’s “Pleasant Bullying”). The horde of murderous outsiders looking to take over apartment complex delegate Yeong-tak’s (Lee Byung-hun) home aren’t zombies. They’re desperate men and women just like those inside the walls. They simply weren’t lucky enough to reside within the only building spared from an apocalyptic earthquake. So, is it really a utopia? Or a fortress under siege? Are the inhabitants worthy of the comfort and security fate let them retain while the rest of the city freezes amidst the rubble? Or are they tyrants monopolizing their fortune and using delusions of grandeur as “the chosen” to steal and kill with impunity? It truly is the same central question behind Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard’s comic books. Is Rick Grimes really any different than the Governor or Negan or whomever else his band of survivors happen across? Or is he merely benefiting from his position as our protagonist? Eom and Lee deliver the end of days for these Koreans and let us watch whether compassion or greed rules the day. The residents coexist with the “outsiders” (soon to devolve into the label “cockroaches”) at first. Not necessarily by choice since they storm the doors out of necessity for shelter, but well enough to be civil until a food shortage starts turning everyone feral. Suddenly it’s “Us vs. Them.” A resident-only meeting is called to vote on what to do and Yeong-tak becomes their unanimous leader after selflessly running into a fire to protect them all. Cue the inevitable “evictions.” What follows is the usual chaos this archetype produces. It didn’t quite mark me as effectively as HIGH-RISE or ANIARA, but its slow descent into Hell as tensions and betrayals mount is effective. Credit the de facto leads in Min-sung (Park Seo-joon) and Myung-hwa (Park Bo-young) as a young couple that isn’t quite as easily swayed to the side of cutthroat tyranny as most. She’s a nurse who wants to help from the beginning. He doesn’t, but his conscience stays intact to ensure his many mistakes supply sufficient guilt. Will they be able to stop this out-of-control locomotive once it gets going? I won’t spoil things by answering that question. Just know CONCRETE UTOPIA doesn’t shy from the dark depravity we know the actions of “ordinary people” in such extraordinary circumstances will reach. Not that this choice isn’t without complexity, though. Eom and Lee don’t have a season or more to play with the duality of “violent good” and “violent evil” via separate factions with character development. So, they portray it through one man: Yeong-tak. Lee Byung-hun is up to the task. He’s a very determined and very impassioned leader with a strong personality hiding his secrets. He’s hero and destroyer both. How the film plays that conflict out isn’t surprising in its overall arc or demand that we question whether loyalty and protection negates the opportunism and deceit that allows it to flourish. The specific things that occur, however, can be quite shocking. There’s one moment towards the end that made me gasp as loudly as Myung-hwa. Despite being totally in character and believable in the moment, you don’t want to accept it. You still want to give these people the benefit of the doubt because you’d hope others would give it to you in the same situation. Sadly, it doesn’t take a long time looking outside the window onto our own turbulent reality to admit that, these days, the benefit of the doubt is a luxury few if any deserve. Despite the very sharp turn towards dissent that caused me to forget to even put Gareth Edwards’ THE CREATOR on my watchlist, I found the film to be both exciting and affecting. My favorite science fiction works are those that mine down from their high concept conceit to provide character-based drama instead. So, where you might think this is a story about war between humans and AI, it’s actually a potential redemption arc for a man who lost everything as a result of his fealty to a government wielding fear as a means to control its citizenry. Joshua (John David Washington) had a choice, though. While the events of the prologue (quick hits of humanity creating AI, AI evolving into human-like simulants, and the inevitable rubicon crossing that was a nuclear blast in Los Angeles) inspire him to fight for his species, years undercover gave him an out. Tasked to follow Maya (Gemma Chan), daughter of the so-called Nirmata, or “Creator” of New Asia’s free race of simulants, Joshua falls in love. The two marry. Maya becomes pregnant. And it seems all is well until an unprovoked attack reveals he’s been playing both sides. Cue tragedy. Pain. Regret. Edwards and co-writer Chris Weitz flash-forward five years to find Joshua broken and alone when the real plot begins. The US Army (led by Allison Janney’s Howell and Ralph Ineson’s Andrews) still wants to find the Nirmata—now more than ever since intel says he’s created a weapon that will give simulants an unequivocal victory. So, they recruit Joshua to lead the mission back to his old stomping grounds. They promise him he might even be able to reclaim what he lost. What none of them could guess, however, is that he’ll actually get the opportunity to find even more. How? Via a young simulant girl (Madeleine Yuna Voyles’s Alphie). The US calls her a weapon. His old New Asian allies (including Ken Watanabe’s Harun) call her their savior. Joshua simply sees a means to an end—a way to find Maya again. Whether or not it’s just because she’s a child, his old rhetoric about simulants being “programming” gradually fades. He feels something for her. Maybe it’s pity at first, but it blossoms into respect and perhaps even acceptance. Because her innocence somehow renders her “real” in his eyes. And watching humans try to kill her renders them into the monsters they’ve always been. The result is thus less about the dangers of artificial intelligence and more about America’s growing lack of empathy for those it deems foreigners (abroad and domestic alike). It’s about our ease at projecting our own violence and aggression onto our victims in order to justify our increased vitriol towards them as if it was us who was harmed by their very existence. The messaging and themes become closer to colonizers versus colonized. It’s Americans going to distant lands under the auspices of protecting home. Murdering with impunity and bloodlust in response to a tragedy they refuse to acknowledge their own complicity in igniting. Sound familiar? So, much talk tried to connect THE CREATOR to the Hollywood strikes and the risks of AI displacing artists when its narrative more closely aligns with the current Palestinian plight against the globally-backed Zionist state of Israel. When do we finally recognize what’s happening? When the body in the crosshairs is no longer an adult we can imagine as the enemy. The same happens here. Joshua has extenuating circumstances as far as not putting a bullet in Alphie’s head straight away, but her being a child quickly becomes as much a deterrent as the possibility that she might take him to Maya. I’ll leave why that duality means more in the context of the whole to the film itself since elaborating would create spoilers. All I’ll say is that it hit me exactly how Edwards and company hoped despite what I had read about it being a cold, emotionless affair. I will even disagree with comments about Washington being an unfeeling protagonist too since this might be his most three-dimensional and human performance yet. Add the gorgeous production design, breathtaking special effects (on a relatively tiny budget compared to its ilk), and a pitch-perfect ending and this thing is firing on all cylinders. Here’s hoping more people watch it sans expectations to discover just how good it really is. It’s a new beginning for Mom (Jodie Comer) and Dad (Joel Fry). Their home is set in the heart of London and they have a baby on the way. Unfortunately, this chapter starts for them just as another ends for the entire world. Relentless storms and flash floods become so destructive that I thought the beginning of Mahalia Belo’s THE END WE START FROM was a metaphoric hallucination about childbirth for its main character. Only after young Zeb’s birth is crosscut with water crashing through a window do we realize it’s really happening. London is gone. Adapted by Alice Birch from Megan Hunter’s novel, the narrative moves to its logical next step: a parent’s house. Luckily, Dad’s parents (Mark Strong and Nina Sosanya) are borderline survivalists living high above sea-level with a stronghold of provisions. But even those must deplete at some point. Eventually, those who were privileged enough to ride out the early chaos become the ones unprepared for what the world has become in the meantime. The story shifts to one of protection. Delusion. Nightmare and fantasy. Some can push through. Others cannot. Belo’s film is slow-moving as a result. What began with a rousing couple of scenes with some real electric drama settles into a series of ordeals that want to be more confrontational than they are actually shown to be. More than once Mom and Dad get into a disagreement that ends with a jump cut to her having to fend for herself. Eventually she meets an ally in O (Katherine Waterston), another mother with a toddler, and we follow them as they move between shelters and chase the pipe dream that is an island commune seeking to forget the past while building a future. Comer is very good in the lead. It’s easy to underestimate the performance since the whole turns into a one-woman survivalist show for long stretches. So, while it feels like we’re just watching the same thing in different forms over again, there is nuance if you’re willing to look. Even so, it’s the supporting characters that stick to your memory since their impact is more explosive. Waterston is fantastic—especially in her final scene. Strong too. Even Benedict Cumberbatch steals a moment via a brief cameo. They each shape Mom’s decisions to move forward by either allowing herself to look back or rejecting the urge. Those who can take something more from the themes of motherhood and separation will surely come away with a lot more to say and like about the overall film. I personally found myself appreciating the journey more than taking anything away from what ultimately proves to be familiar tropes within the post-apocalyptic genre—albeit much quieter and more introspective than usual. It’s a solid story that looks and sounds great, but I wouldn’t be surprised to discover it works better on the page insofar as digging further to unearth the weight of emotion that’s ravaging Mom’s heart. You can't really blame the filmmakers for going full fan service with THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE. I would have liked a story, but loosely connected action set-pieces within Nintendo's sprawling Mario-adjacent universe is still fun. And that's what the young kids in its target PG-rated demo want anyway. Because this isn't for nostalgic Millennials and Gen-Xers. This is an advertisement for new generations to board the bandwagon. So, we get a Mushroom Kingdom obstacle course complete with every power-up imaginable. A battle royale with Donkey Kong, Mario Kart race on the Rainbow Road, dungeons, water boards, and even Brooklyn with varying camera shifts to make the screen look like a side-scrolling platformer. Add a decent classic rock soundtrack, some interesting remixes of the original score, and a mostly passable voice cast and this low stakes romp excels at superficial entertainment. Does it also disappoint? You bet. Especially on the level of being a real movie rather than episodic introduction with more loose ends (Is Peach human?) then concrete mythology. The whole multiverse angle has been played out too, but ... whatever. That's the easiest way to juggle multiple ""stages."" The real head-scratcher, though, is an end stinger that epitomizes this mixed result's weirdness by teasing a character (Yoshi) whose world they literally showed an hour beforehand. Two things: Love a reboot of a known property that doesn’t default to origin story (even if MUTANT MAYHEM is the origin story of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ coexistence with humans, it keeps their first fifteen years post-ooze a fun flashback montage) and love that director Jeff Rowe, producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and that trio’s other co-writers let the “heroes-in-a-half-shell” be teens (what a great, young voice-acting cast to make it believable too). The story itself is a nice entry point into this new TMNT world (very reminiscent of the grunge animation popularized by the SPIDER-VERSE films). It introduces the idea of ooze, throws a bunch of mutants that haven’t been in previous films on-screen, and gives the leads a trial by fire confidence boost to prepare themselves for the fights ahead (watch the credits for a Shredder tease). The action is slapstick-y and kinetic with great choreography and the tone never falters in large part due to making April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri) a teen too. Jackie Chan as Splinter and Ice Cube as the big bad Superfly are both inspired choices and the needle drops are memorable (give Four Non Blondes their royalty check), but I will say that the joke construction gets very grating. Rogen and company went heavy on the name dropping and pop culture references that seem to scream “hey, we’re hip!” in the kind of way aging dudes who aren’t hip anymore would. I kept waiting for one of the turtles to actually turn to the camera and wink, that’s how cringey it became. Hopefully they can shore that up with the inevitable sequel. A people duped into believing their once benevolent king still has their interests in mind despite falling prey to ego and avarice must rise to defeat him by following the one person able to see through the deception because of her selfless heart. Directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn along with screenwriters Jennifer Lee and Allison Moore pretty much deliver everything you'd want from an old school Disney film—complete with over-the-top villain (Chris Pine is having lots of fun as Magnifico) and talking animals and objects (Alan Tudyk is great as Valentino the goat, but nothing beats the mushrooms). It's big on emotion and message yet very short on plot (Ariana DeBose's Asha leads a rebellion of the soul to take back the wishes her neighbors volunteered to Magnifico under the auspices that he was ""protecting"" them and not just hoarding them for loyalty once he loses himself to fear). Neither is necessarily a bad thing. I would have liked better songs, though, since they range from catchy (""Knowing What I Know Now"") to obvious (""This Wish"") to mostly forgettable (""This Is The Thanks I Get?!""). The real draw is the animation. It's like WISH took 2D cell paintings and modeled them in 3D. The backgrounds are simultaneously flat watercolors and 3D-rendered rooms with perspective depending on the camera's angle. Same with the clothing, hair, and faces. The duality can be jarring at first, but quite beautiful the more you sit with it. “Moshfegh and Oldroyd [reach a point with the climax] where the curtain must be lifted to show the scars this world has etched upon the bodies of those we'd like to believe still maintain a semblance of innocence.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “Coon and Kozak show that The Star Wars Holiday Special truly exists on an island alone as an unwitting cautionary tale never to be repeated again.” – Full thoughts at The Film Stage. “Scorsese understands he can't truly tell [the Osage's] story as a white man in a way that gives them the voice they deserve. So, he tells the tale of their oppressors instead. And he does so with zero sympathy for even their most sympathetic members.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “The result is entertaining and not without its dramatic reveals. [But,] while a good time was had, I can't shake the sense that there was potential for so much more.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “Some of what results can be confusing, but all of it is dramatically potent. And it's mostly due to a wonderful performance from Zalopany.” – Full thoughts at HHYS."
"Sep 29, 2023",positive," A comienzos de los 90, los jugadores de consolas de todo el mundo se ilusionaban con la idea de ver en la gran pantalla al gran personaje de Nintendo: Super Mario. Pero lo que les ofrecieron los productores de Hollywood Pictures fue una extraña versión con Bob Hoskins como Mario y John Leguizamo como Luigi. Han transcurrido 30 años para que los aficionados puedan disfrutar de una película que respete a los personajes creados por Shigeru Miyamoto. Y es que sí, estamos ante la mejor obra basada en un videojuego que se ha hecho hasta ahora y es todo lo que los fans podían desear. Super Mario Bros. La película es un homenaje a la saga más relevante de Nintendo, que ha generado numerosos videojuegos distintos y se ha convertido en la más duradera y exitosa de la historia de la empresa. Llena de guiños para los fans y mucha aventura para los más pequeños, es el gran evento animado de 2023. Con menos humor que otras producciones de Illumination como Los minions: El origen de Gru, las bromas -que no significa que sea una película seria ni mucho menos- dejan espacio a mucha acción y algo de drama para dar más consistencia al conjunto. Al fin y al cabo es una producción para los aficionados al personaje y para los más pequeños, que quizá aún no han podido disfrutar de una videoconsola."
"Sep 20, 2023",positive,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a DREAM COME TRUE for lifelong Nintendo fans and PERFECT DOWN TO THE LAST PIXEL. With gorgeous animation and unforgettable music, Nintendo and Illumination have made a delightful family film filled with heart."
"Aug 23, 2023",positive," It’s the summer of 1983, and I am on my bicycle in the Seminole High School parking lot, having been summoned by fellow students for a business proposal. They soon arrive at the prearranged rendezvous point, and I follow them down 86th Avenue to a single-family home on a cul-de-sac in the Bay Harbor Estates neighborhood. I am taken to an upstairs bedroom — the walls of which are completely obscured by countless Rush posters — where three computer whiz kids unveil their handiwork: They have created a series of video games. Remember: This is 1983. These games are barebones at best. By today’s standards, they are hopelessly low tech, visually crude and thematically derivative. But for a bunch of high school kids in the early 1980s, they are an absolute triumph. That afternoon, I became part of their ambitious cooperative: They needed someone to create artwork for them so they could package the games and sell them in local computer stores. Over the next few weeks, I delivered cover art for games such as “Popcorn” and “Dim Sammath.” The whiz kids found a business willing to add the games to their inventory on a trial basis. We were on our way to entrepreneurial success! Even though I did contract work for an independent video game company, it would be another five years before I finally bowed to peer pressure and started playing video games regularly. Sure, I spent time watching friends play various games at Aladdin’s Castle — the preeminent shopping-mall arcade chain of the era — across from the movie theater at Tyrone Square Mall. I even joined in an occasional King’s Quest marathon at the home of another high school friend who owned an Amiga (and who coincidentally bore a striking resemblance to the kid on Rush’s “Power Windows” album). My first video game addiction was Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Except, I quickly realized I wasn’t any good at it, so I moved on to other games, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid. In terms of commercial success, in the mid-1980s, Super Mario Bros. reigned supreme. The classic 8-bit, side-scrolling platform game pitting Mario and Luigi against King Koopa — later renamed Bowser — sold more than 58 million copies worldwide. It resurrected the flagging video game industry at the time and spawned a multimedia franchise that is still going strong almost 40 years later. The most recent manifestation of that franchise is the new computer-animated feature film “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” released in theaters April 5 by Universal Pictures. Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, the film is a partnership between Nintendo and Illumination, the computer animation studio behind films such as “Despicable Me,” “The Secret Life of Pets,” and “Sing.” “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is exceptionally unexceptional. For a film based upon a classic video game, it delivers exactly what fans of the franchise expect, without pushing any genre boundaries and without any serious attempt at innovation or improvement. The target audience is two-fold: Its action, color, and silliness will appeal to kids while adult fans of the franchise will enjoy all the nostalgic connotations. It manages to tell a coherent, albeit forgettable, story with ample charm, thrills, and humor. It is undeniably entertaining, but it doesn’t feel like it is likely to become a cherished component of a beloved media empire. Then again, it is infinitely better than 1993’s abysmal “Super Mario Bros.” Not even Dennis Hopper could save the 1993 live-action feature film based upon the Nintendo game from insipid mediocrity. The new adaptation is lighter, more faithful to the source material, and refreshingly family-friendly. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” follows Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) when they find themselves mysteriously transported into a magical world. Separated, Mario meets Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), who warns him that his brother Luigi is in the Dark Lands ruled by the evil Koopa king Bowser (Jack Black). Mario seeks the help of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, who is preparing for war with Bowser’s forces by seeking an alliance with Kongs, led by King Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) and his son, Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). While most of the film’s voice actors dissolve into their characters with little eloquence or distinction, Black’s Bowser and Taylor-Joy’s Princess Peach both stand out as solid examples of adding layers of complexity through outstanding performances. Black’s Bowser may be a tyrannical bully, but he is also a hopeless romantic. Taylor-Joy delivers a princess who is the antithesis of the damsel in distress. No need to overthink a PG-rated, playful, predictable, immersive adaptation of the much-loved video game. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is brimming with delicious eye-candy and evocative nostalgia. Yes: It is formulaic, but it doesn’t really need to take many risks to charm audiences. No: Pratt doesn’t seem like the best choice to voice the protagonist, but other members of the film’s cast more than make up for that weakness. It’s fun, it’s faithful to the franchise, and it makes me want to break out my NES Classic Edition console and play the classic game."
"Aug 16, 2023",positive,Simple but effective for anyone who grew up with Mario in their lives.
"Aug 8, 2023",neutral," BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — Ten minutes into “The Super Mario Bros Movie” there will be an overwhelming desire to pull the plug on seeing the production. There really is no reason to stick around and keep watching a  movie that only exists to promote Nintendo games and toys. After “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” showed how cleverly a game could be adapted to the big screen, there was hope for the efforts to do that with “Mario Bros.” Any chance of that happening fades quickly as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic have opted to merely take sections of the video games and bind them together with a plot so thin you could read the instructions on a cereal box through it. Here’s what to expect. The majority of the movie is made up of sequences of Mario or Princess Peach jumping from blocks to girders to floating items and then back to blocks and girders. When this isn’t happening, the group speeds across the rainbow road on carts. Both are key elements of the video games and should be part of the movie. There are just too many of the lifted moments in the film devoted to these scenes. Making a movie that is nothing but a big-screen version of the game takes away the major element of what has made the “Mario Bros.” games so popular – interactivity. It is a lot more exciting to be guiding the colorful heroes through multiple gaming adventures than to be sitting back and passively watching the tales unfold. The film opens with a television commercial featuring Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) pitching their new plumbing business. They are speaking with very stereotypical Italian accents. This section exists to explain why the characters don’t have an accent throughout the rest of the film and why plumbers wear white gloves. The action picks up while they are trying to fix a water main break that threatens to wipe out Brooklyn. It seems like it would have been a better joke if they were trying to save Flushing, a neighborhood in Queens. Mario and Luigi are sucked into a magic pipe under the city that takes them to two different video game worlds. Luigi ends up in the Dark Lands and gets taken prisoner by power hungry – and lovesick – Bowser (Jack Black). Mario lands in the world ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) where he tries to enlist her to help him save Luigi. She has her own problems as Bowser plans to wipe out her kingdom. That is as complicated as the script by Matthew Fogel (“The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part”) ever gets. There is an obligation by the production team to keep in mind that there will be young audience members seeing the film. It is the fact that they went to such a simplistic level with the story that it ended up with only a marginal amount of entertainment value. Efforts to appease older audience members include a soundtrack that along with a variety of versions of the “Mario Bros.” theme music, includes songs by AC/DC (“Thunderstruck”), A-ha (“Take On Me”) and Bonnie Tyler (“Holding Out for a Hero”). Those are great songs but just don’t fit the vibe of this production. That’s also the problem when it comes to the voice casting. There was an explosion of negativity online when it was announced Pratt was the voice of Mario. They were justified in their concerns as he doesn’t have a distinct enough voice for the role. Day is much stronger as Luigi. Taylor-Joy is a top-notch performer, but her voice is not her strength. The star of “The Queen’s Gambit” and “The Menu” has an expressive face that should always be seen in her work. It is obvious that in an effort to appeal to a wide demographic, the movie fails on all counts because of a weak script, an over dependence on elements lifted directly from the video game and several voice casting mistakes. It is game over very quickly with “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Jul 25, 2023",positive," Illumination Entertainment isn't exactly an animation studio I appreciate that much. From their animation style to their various movies made before this year, I was never really convinced by the company, especially when it comes to being able to make some of the best animated flicks of the year. That said, my expectations for The Super Mario Bros. Movie remained incredibly high during all of these months of anticipation leading up to its release. Neither the divisive critics' reception nor the permanent doubt surrounding the voice cast reduced the enormous excitement I had for this film. And I was right to stay true to my feelings. For those who have been following my writing for some time already, you know that I always begin by trying to place any readers in my own shoes. Regardless of the type of film, I argue that any critic should make this effort, otherwise, they risk losing the reader's understanding. It's impossible to write something about The Super Mario Bros. Movie without first explaining my connection to the source material. In the case of this adaptation, it's not just a Mario game, but countless Nintendo games, characters, and worlds. I've noticed a more repetitive use of the expression ""remove the nostalgia glasses"", especially to bring down movies and, in many cases, invalidate and diminish more positive opinions. The truth is that nostalgia is a term associated with the past, but in my particular situation, Mario and Nintendo are still in my present. Every year, without exception, my brothers and I pull the Nintendo 64 out of our parents' basement, blow the dust off, and spend hilariously unforgettable hours playing Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart, and more. In addition to this experience, new games featuring Mario and his friends continue to be developed and released for modern video game consoles. Therefore, criticizing The Super Mario Bros. Movie for being a film that heavily relies on the nostalgia factor is such a predictable, cheap negative argument that, for many viewers, just won't make any sense. Another issue commonly associated with this type of adaptation is related to misleading expectations. In my 29 years of life, I've never played a Mario game for its story. Not me, not anyone, because it was never a series with that purpose. The Super Mario Bros. Movie contains a generic, formulaic story that brings absolutely nothing new to the world of animation. The messages for kids are simple and fairly straightforward, none of which will change anyone's life. The narrative structure follows the most obvious path without major surprises, focusing on the typical adventure of an unexpected hero against a cliched villain with world-domination motivations. All of these are more than valid reasons for someone to not enjoy the movie. My question is: what did you expect?! Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and screenwriter Matthew Fogel didn't deceive anyone, delivering precisely what was asked of them: an entertaining flick with characters and worlds that marked and continue to mark multiple generations. Bashing a movie as vehemently as I've seen critics doing when it accomplishes all that it promises is, to say the least, strange. Obviously, no one expected a masterpiece, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is far from being one, but that was never its purpose. The main mission was to please the target audience, which, as the box office numbers prove, was more than successful. Claiming The Super Mario Bros. Movie is generic is something that could be written even before watching the film, like many other superficial, ""easy"" criticisms thrown at an adaptation that at no time planned to be more than pure entertainment for children of all ages and families of all sizes, as well as for all those who consider Mario and Nintendo important parts of their lives. Personally, ""removing the nostalgia glasses"" means erasing a large part of my life, past and present, as well as my personality. It's simply not possible. Illumination's animation style turns out to be one of the highlights. Initial concerns are quickly forgotten due to the visual quality that surrounds the entire movie. The world-building is phenomenal, with reference after reference to so many Nintendo games worked into every frame, but anyone who thinks these are forcibly ""thrown"" in the viewer's faces is entirely wrong. It's all part of the narrative, and the way they insert the various elements from the games is to be commended. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is undoubtedly a love letter to all of Nintendo's immersive, playful worlds. From action set pieces to leave viewers grinning from ear to ear – the Donkey Kong fight scene, Mario Kart racing sequence, blocks/obstacles training montage – to the iconic music that Brian Tyler mixes brilliantly into his wonderful score, The Super Mario Bros. Movie left me astonished and sent chills all over my body during several moments, especially in the more energetic second half. This kind of humor is precisely what makes me laugh the most, with Mario's classic expressions being used in quite a hilarious manner. The cast was another aspect that resulted in division at the time of its announcement, which is yet another thing I'll never understand. Complaining about an actor's casting before even knowing how they will play the character? It doesn't make any sense, and the truth is that the cast is even better than I expected. Personal favorites are Charlie Day (as Luigi) and Jack Black (as Bowser), but everyone delivers excellent performances. Anya Taylor-Joy has a lot of screen time as Peach and proves to be up to the challenge, and I don't understand why there was so much buzz around Chris Pratt. The actor is perfectly decent as Mario. Ignoring people who don't want the actor's success for external reasons, I understand those who might be disappointed that Mario doesn't have that original, recognizable voice from all four corners of the planet. However, one must be aware that Mario was never a dialogue-heavy character. In the games, Mario rarely speaks, expressing himself only through his overly-stereotypical Italian reactions. I imagine that having to listen to this voice for an entire movie wouldn't be that pleasant, as it could easily become insufferable. Therefore, I believe The Super Mario Bros. Movie made the right decision in the end to choose actors with ""normal voices"" to play all of the characters. Mario's classic expressions are taken directly from the games, so these moments won't be ruined in any way. As mentioned before, the story isn't a problem for me at all. In fact, I believe it has a lot more heart than many people have been conveying. What did affect me were some pop music choices that left me baffled – I don't think they belong in the Nintendo universe – and the first half has some pacing issues, wasting too much time to get to where it needs to go. By this time, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has already broken dozens of box office records and will become one of the most successful animation flicks ever made. Personally, I couldn't be happier, as the chances of watching other Nintendo stories in the big screen have increased exponentially – I'll be the first in line to see an adaptation of The Legend of Zelda! May they continue to conquer audiences all over the world! The Super Mario Bros. Movie delivers everything I wanted. Packed with fantastic references that will warm the hearts of those who lived and still live with Nintendo and Mario up close. Along with energetic action, dazzling animation and world-building, and iconic music – Brian Tyler's score goes straight into my Spotify playlist. Mario and Co. marked my childhood, and, still today, continue to offer me wonderful memories for life. As a viewer clearly belonging to the target audience, I couldn't have left the cinema more joyful. Ya-hoo!"
"Jul 25, 2023",positive," MAINE, USA — [Editor's note: This article is a critical analysis of a film and does not represent the views of NEWS CENTER Maine, but that of the author.] Nintendo teamed up with Illumination, the animation studio behind ""Despicable Me,"" to bring the popular video game franchise to life in theaters. Chris Pratt stars as the titular character in ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" Much like the video games that started this massive franchise and helped put Nintendo on the map, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" starts off with Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) beginning their plumbing business in Brooklyn.  They're optimistic and energetic, but things don't seem to be going their way. After a sewer pipe breaks while they're trying to help repair a massive leak, the brothers find themselves sucked into the world fans recognize as the Mushroom Kingdom.  Well, Mario ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi appears in Bowser's kingdom and is soon imprisoned by the giant evil turtle. Bowser (Jack Black) is moving across worlds, destroying everything in his path on the way to the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy).  Mario meets Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), who introduces him to Peach in hopes she can help him find Luigi. Of course, Peach has her own crisis with Bowser on his way. So, after giving Mario a quick rundown on how power-ups and platforms work in this strange world, Peach leaves with him and Toad to find help.  For decades, this series has made its fortune and fame off a repeat formula: Bowser abducts Peach, and then Mario and Luigi rescue her — and the story here doesn't get any more creative than that.  The pacing is a little awkward until Donkey Kong shows up, injecting more fun and humor into the film. Of course, with Donkey Kong comes the most enjoyable moments of the movie, the kart racing previewed in the trailer, along with all the chaos of the Mario Kart games. From there, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" becomes more entertaining, the characters find their rhythm, and the film transforms into a love letter sent directly to fans of the games.  By far the best performance in ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" comes from Black, who was the perfect casting for Bowser. Fans worried about Pratt's Mario impression can relax knowing he certainly does a serviceable job.  Illumination brought the movie to life with shiny and colorful worlds lifted straight from the games. The animation is where this film excels, along with a wonderful score and sound design that'll feel instantly familiar to—again—fans of the games.  And that's really what will determine how much viewers enjoy ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" If folks grew up playing the games (or still do), and already treasure everything Mario, this is a must-see movie. For everyone else, the mileage in their kart will vary. "
"Jul 22, 2023",positive,PHENOMENAL ANIMATION!  Short & Simple (too short if I’m honest) Chris Pratt is honestly PERFECT as MARIO (yes I’m as shocked as you) Jack Black might steal the show as BOWSER. But Brian Tyler’s SCORE is so GOOD
"Jul 11, 2023",negative," Since its release, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, directed by Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic, Pierre Leduc, and Fabien Polack, has assumed a divisive position in the modern zeitgeist. Critics were quick to lambast the feature, while fans were equally as swift in lionizing it. As a lifelong fan of Mario, having played nearly every game in the franchise, I was curious about where my opinion would land. I did not expect to disagree with both critics and fans. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not terrible, far from it. It is a visually vibrant adventure that is also unexpectedly funny. But it’s certainly not great. It’s not even good, strictly speaking. Screenwriter Matthew Fogel created derivative characters and a paper-thin plot. This fantasy action film is utterly generic, a cinematic blank space that neither offends nor thrills. Brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are two plumbers living in Brooklyn. One day, while attempting to fix a broken water main, they are unwittingly transported to a fantastical realm. In their descent through the magical portal, the siblings are separated. Lugi lands in a lava-laden land filled with scary creatures. Mario ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom and must aid Princess Peach (Anya-Joy Taylor) in her fight against the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black) in order to get his brother back. In commissioning Illumination to produce The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo inadvertently opened a Pandora’s box of Americana. In some aspects, this was beneficial. The animation is wonderful, with a surfeit of resplendent, candy-colored environments. Further, the voice acting is reasonably well done, with Black serving as a genuine revelation as Bowser. However, some of the creative choices are inexplicably poor. The decision to integrate commissioned music into the proceedings, rather than relying fully on an orchestral score, awkwardly distorts the experience. While such a choice has worked for tonally irreverent movies like Shrek, it proves awkward in a film that, while it has humor, takes its story seriously on a certain level. And yet, the worst aspect, by far, is the hollow narrative. The feature exists exclusively to satisfy an endless list of referential checkboxes. For instance, Donkey Kong shows up, but his presence is wholly incidental to the plot. Another section is inconsequentially devoted to Mario Kart. While tips of the hat are welcome, and a few land with poignancy, they are no substitution for an actual story. Illumination has contrived from the most visionary video game ever made something strictly superficial. For their part, fans have rhapsodized the dizzying volume of easter eggs as an indicator of quality. But that is akin to considering the movie a success simply because Mario is in it. In fact, the titular brothers are somewhat redundant in their own features. Luigi is mostly absent from the proceedings, and Mario is rendered superfluous by Peach’s unerring self-sufficiency. Ironically, the one reference most vital to the video game is the one absent from the film: Mario never actually saves Peach. All of these elements, when combined, make The Super Mario Bros. Movie a rather forgettable affair. Almost impossibly, this is a flick without inspiration. While the 1993 Super Mario Bros. is remembered for how laughably bad it was, this 2023 adaptation, though less egregious than its predecessor, will barely be remembered at all. NOW IN THEATERS! Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, would be a great film if it... NOW IN THEATERS!

"Jul 8, 2023",positive," Let’s face it. The majority of video-game-to-film adaptations have been garbage. The list of these adaptations read like the programme of the Hell International Film Festival, with House of the Dead, Doom, Max Payne and Pixels (which manages to ruin several games rather than just one) all proving consoles and cinema don’t always mix. But when a new Super Mario movie was announced there was cautious optimism. Maybe it was because it would be an animated affair, allowing the aesthetics of the beloved game franchise to translate to the big screen. Maybe it was the fact that Sonic the Hedgehog had shown that game adaptations could still be – if not world-beating – fun. Maybe it was the knowledge that there is no way it could be as bad as the infamous 1993 live-action film with Bob Hoskins in the lead role and Dennis Hopper playing a lizard. Given that 2023’s The Super Mario Bros Movie is currently the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time – and one of the highest-grossing animations of all time – it seems that the cautious optimism was founded. Brothers Mario (Chris Pratt, who does a fine job, albeit one where he is basically Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) prepare to strike out on their own with their own plumbing business in their native Brooklyn. But after a massive water leak threatens the city, they find themselves transported to a mysterious new world and are promptly split up. Searching for his brother, Mario ends up at the colourful Mushroom Kingdom where he meets Princess Peach (Anna Taylor Joy), who reveals that the evil Bowser (Jack Black) – now in possession of a powerful Super Star – will destroy everything in his path to gain her hand in marriage. The two head off to stop Bowser and find Luigi, meeting Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan) and a whole host of others on the way. Some films trade in nostalgia. This film trades it, puts it in a bank account, lets it accrue in value and then trades it in again for even more nostalgia. From the very beginning, the film is reference after reference to the franchise and related games. A Jump Man console (Jump Man being one of the original monikers of Mario). A ‘Punch Out’ diner (referring to the classic Nintendo boxing game). A sequence showing off Mario’s athleticism, which mirrors the classic first level of the original Super Mario Bros game. Charles Martinet (the original voice of Mario) showing up twice, with one of his roles as Mario’s father. And all that is in the first 10 minutes of the movie. It’s manna from Heaven (or mushrooms from blocks) for fans looking for nods to the games they grew up with. One can’t help feel that the non-stop fan service pushes some important elements – such as character development – out of the way. Compared to other animated movies that are entertaining and emotional, The Super Mario Bros Movie sometimes feels a bit thin. There are basic beats – Mario’s desire to be taken seriously, Peach’s search for belonging – but they are never really fully explored. The film lurches from one set-piece to another without much time for reflection. We’re never really told how this world – full of blocks that float in mid-air and mushrooms that give magic powers – has come into being or who the inhabitants really are. Thankfully, those sequences are done really well, capturing the exhilaration that one gets from playing the Mario game, a sense of freedom and discovery found in both the 2D and 3D games as well as the thrills and spills of Mario Kart. With plenty of gorgeous visuals and plenty of sight gags, the plentiful set-pieces shine. While perhaps not a richly satisfying as it could have been, The Super Mario Bros Movie is still a barrel load of enormous fun that does the world’s most famous plumbers – and the video game pantheon – some much needed cinematic justice.

"Jul 3, 2023",positive," Happy Fourth of July weekend!! Wow, can’t believe we’re done with the first half of the year! Honestly, June was such a blur, and this recap is late as I went on a weekend getaway to my neighboring state. I’ve lived in MN for 3 decades and for some reason never visited Door County, Wisconsin. It was a charming place and I’ll definitely be back one day, probably in the Fall season. I wasn’t planning to see this but got sent a screener via email, so I decided to give it a watch. I’m not at all familiar with the game, so I definitely have no clue about any references made in the movie. I do enjoy animated movies, and though the visuals are great with astounding details and eye-popping colors, the plot is pretty simple, playful and ultimately predictable. I remember people complaining about Chris Pratt, who’s not Italian, being cast to provide the voice for Mario, which I think is just absurd. I think he did a pretty good job, as did Anya Taylor-Joy and Charlie Day. Overall though, it’s pretty average and forgettable, definitely not as innovative as other Illumination Studios, but then again, I’m far from being the target audience. Paris is always a good idea, and that applies to the movies as well. I’ve been wanting to see this for some time as I always enjoy Romain Duris in pretty much anything. Here he plays Gustave Eiffel in a mix of historical drama about the building of the famous Eiffel Tower and the forbidden romance between him and Adrienne (Emma Mackey in her French-language debut). While I don’t think it was the best idea to mix the two storylines, Duris and Mackey have feverish sexual chemistry together. I’ve since learned that the romance is highly fictionalized, which is hardly surprising, but the two actors sure look convincing as star-crossed lovers. My biggest issue is with the editing which makes it so utterly confusing when things actually take place. Even with the use of super, director Martin Bourboulon‘s way of jumping back and forth between timelines isn’t very seamless. Overall it was worth watching for the cast and I’m even more convinced Mackey has that star quality just like her ‘twin’ Margot Robbie. I started watching this in mid-May on a plane but didn’t time it right so the flight landed before I could finish watching. Well, I probably don’t need to bother. Despite having big names like Diane Keaton, William H. Macy, Richard Gere, and Susan Sarandon, this talky movie wastes all of their talents playing unsympathetic characters. The script could’ve originated from a play, which could’ve worked better in that format, but here it feels pointless and boring. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey (who I learned was in Netflix’s Holidate, which I haven’t seen) have absolutely no chemistry at all and I often find Roberts to be annoying in rom-coms (i.e. Little Italy). She certainly doesn’t have that same winning charm as her famous auntie Julia. I think the only saving grace was the scenes between Keaton and Macy, the only moment offering a semblance of warmth and humor. I read a review that says that if the filmmakers were to film ALL of the cast members sitting around and talking about scenes from their previous movies which they collaborated on, this would’ve been a more entertaining movie. I couldn’t agree more!! I don’t know what compelled possessed me to watch this movie when it popped up on Netflix, I guess I was curious since I saw a clip of this very scene not too long ago. Without context, the scene seems ravishing, but can’t say the same about the movie itself. I had seen a few excellent good rom-coms lately (Isn’t It Romantic, Always Be My Maybe, Rye Lane, among others), but The Wedding Date is one that gives this genre such a bad name. Completely riddled with clichés, implausible (unfunny) situations, and an awful plot that puts a sour taste in your mouth. I don’t normally like to say a movie is rubbish, especially one directed by a woman, but this one is a real travesty. Boy, Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney deserve SO much better, oh not to mention the talented Amy Adams (yikes!!) Avoid at all cost if you haven’t already. This doc is fascinating to me as I grew up listening to David Foster’s music, both my hubby and I are fans of his work. Foster is certainly a musical genius when it comes to composing and arranging music. Interviews with superstars like Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Natalie Cole, Michael Bublé and Josh Groban offer interesting tidbits about his influence in the music industry. Dion, Bublé, and Groban (whom Foster discovered at age 17) undoubtedly owe their massive success to him. Having just seen the Whitney Houston biopic recently, I was most curious to learn about Foster’s collaboration with her on the movie The Bodyguard. There are fun tidbits from Clive Davis as well on the project. The soundtrack ends up winning Record Of The Year For and the song I Will Always Love You (that Foster rearranged) went on to be #1 on the Billboard Chart for 14 weeks!! Foster was also responsible for the innovative Unforgettable ‘virtual duet’ of Natalie Cole and her father Nat King Cole. What I wasn’t aware of (since I don’t follow frivolous celeb gossip) is that Foster was once married to the mothers of the Kardashians AND the Jenners, which apparently makes him more famous for being a reality TV star than for his music, ahah. Thanks to Elemental, I was in the mood to revisit some of my favorite Pixar movies. Boy, it’s been ages since I saw Wall*E and that movie still holds up amazingly well. The environmental message is pretty potent but yet it doesn’t feel preachy at all. That one and the first Toy Story are definitely top tier Pixar and delightfully rewatchable. I finally finished the entire season of SILO, which is one of the best sci-fi series I’ve seen lately. It’s such a great pairing with the hilarious mockumentary Jury Duty. I’ll do a double review of both of these later this month, but both are definitely worth watching! So I’m continuing the 52 Films By Women challenge I started on International Women’s Day a few years ago. Per Women In Film (WIF) organization, the basic rules are simple: watch 52 films directed by women within the course of one year and share what you watched on social media, using the hashtag #52FilmsByWomen to spread the word, and get more people talking about the women filmmakers that don’t always get attention. I’ll be doing a half-year tally of this challenge later this month but I’m feeling optimistic I will complete all 52 movies by end of the year! Another strong month in June as I got to see five movies #directedbywomen The Colour Room, The Mother, Past Lives, You Hurt My Feelings, and The Wedding Date. This was an easy clear winner of the month! I have nothing more to add except to say GO WATCH THIS FILM in the theater!! I sure hope this film will keep its traction all the way through award season next year, because it so deserves sooo many nominations!! Since I finished my home theater and haven’t traveled at all last month, I watched quite a bit of movies and shows. On Netflix, I watched Arnold’s new show Fubar, Extraction 2, The Mother and Blood & Gold. Only saw one movie in theater, the new Transformers. Rewatched 2001: A Space Odyssey, X-Men: Days of Future Past (3D), Avatar 2 (3D) and Fast Five. I’m almost finish with Picard season 3 on Paramount+. Once I’m done with that, I’ll start on Silo. It’s so weird that I’ve only seen one movie in theater and it’s summer season. But there aren’t that many movies in theater that I’m interested in. I’ll probably see Mission: Impossible 7 and that’s it this summer. I’ve been wanting to check out Fubar, is that worth watching? I’m thinking of watching that in between Jack Ryan S4. I still haven’t seen the first Extraction yet, somehow just never muster enough interest. SILO is a good one Ted, and the ending makes you curious about the expanded dystopian universe the story is set in. Rebecca Ferguson is amazing! I see Fubar is sort of an extension of True Lies. It’s a lot of fun and Arnold’s great in it, but the real revelation is Monica Barbaro. She and Arnold had great chemistry and I hope she becomes a super star soon. Her character in Top Gun: Maverick, Phoenix, was supposed to the lead had Tony Scott was still alive and made the film. I watched the first two episodes of Jack Ryan S4, kind of boring so far. Hopefully, the story gets moving soon. I like that they finally introduced Chavez, I assume he’ll appear in the recently announced Rainbow Six film. Extraction is basically Netflix’s John Wick and I think you enjoyed most of those those films right? So, you’ll probably like Extraction. Other studios are still looking for their John Wick, so far only Netflix found theirs. Ok yeah, I was curious about Fubar because of Monica Barbaro, she’s awesome in TG: Maverick. Boy she would make an intriguing lead if they had stuck to that script. The first two eps of Jack Ryan 4 are slow, but I wouldn’t call it boring. Michael Peña’s casting is interesting, so he’s a prominent character in the books then? Sadly, I don’t think Barbaro would’ve been cast as the lead in Top Gun 2 had they stuck with the original idea. If I remember correctly, Jennifer Lawrence was on the studio’s top list of actresses to be the lead. Yeah, Chavez is a regular character in the Jack Ryan and John Clark novels. He and John Clark (Michael B. Jordan), are the muscles to Ryan’s brain. In most of the novels, Ryan never took part in any of the action scenes, it’s all Clark and Chavez. Really? I somehow thought you’re a fan of Hemsworth since you’re into Thor, right? But if I remember, I’ll write a review of Extraction 2 after I’m back from my trip. Yeah I suppose Barbaro didn’t have star power. Ugh, glad they went with Cruise as the lead again, J-Law wouldn’t have been a good fit for it. I’m looking forward to more Chavez this season. What do you think of Michael Peña’s casting? He’s not someone I normally associate with action thrillers but maybe that’s the point? I like the Thor movies mostly because of Taika’s direction. Hemsworth is only fun to watch in the MCU and maybe in the small comedic roles like The all-female Ghostbusters, but I’m not fond of him generally. I might give Extraction a shot when I’m bored, LOL. And yes, please do write the review of the sequel when you have a chance, thanks Ted!! It’s Cruise that stalled Top Gun 2 for years, he didn’t want to play a side character. The project was announced in the late 2000s when Cruise was in the middle of box office misfires. He waited until he gained his box office power again before the went into production. Of course, Tony Scott passed away and Cruise became a box office powerhouse again. I’m not a fan of Michael Peña casting, he’s way out of shape in the show. I thought the actor that they cast in Clear and Present Danger was the perfect Chavez. Unfortunately, he only appeared in one film. Hopefully, Michael Peña gets in better shape for the Rainbow Six film. Lol! For sure, you won’t be bore if you watch Extraction. Ha ha! I’m back home on Sunday, I’ll send the review to you sometime next week. I kinda liked The Wedding Date just for how ridiculous it is.  My pick of the month is Spider-Man:  Across the Spider-Verse as it’s just a grand work of art. I have no interest in that David Foster documentary as I saw clips of it and why would I waste my time watching some asshole sucking his own dick.  I saw the clips comedians talk about and he comes off really smug.  I read reviews where people trashed the fuck out of it and he is like “Hey, look at all of the Grammys I’ve won”.  I’m like…. “oh wow, who fucking cares!”  Greatest music producer my ass.  I can name 20-30 who are better than him. Ahah, I hear ya about David Foster. He IS totally smug in the way he describes himself in the doc, I kept saying to my hubby that this guy needs a huge dose of humility. That explains the kind of women he married, I mean the mothers of the Kardashians and Jenners produce the worst kind of people in our world today!! Having seen the doc makes me want to learn more about Clive Davis, now he seems like a much more gracious man on top of being a phenomenal producer. And here is another thing.  Bruce Jenner married Elvis’ former girlfriend Linda Thompson and a had a few kids with her but he left her for Kris and she was with Foster for a few years.  Hollywood.  What a shithole.

"Jul 1, 2023",positive,"This second big-screen adaptation of the popular video game series (after the ill-fated 1993 film) is vibrantly colored, speedily-paced (and not too long), and pleasantly diverting, if rather unremarkable in the long run. "
"Jun 27, 2023",neutral," THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI (1955). While Samuel Fuller’s 1951 The Steel Helmet was the first Hollywood film about the Korean War and the 2022 Jonathan Majors starrer Devotion was the most recent, The Bridges at Toko-Ri can count itself among the most commercially successful. William Holden, yet to attempt to blow up the bridge on the river Kwai (that would come in 1957), here takes a crack at five such structures — he plays Harry Brubaker, a WWII vet, Naval Reservist, and civilian lawyer who’s incensed that he’s been called back to active duty to fly fighter jets during the Korean War. His upcoming assignment involves destroying the titular bridges, a dangerous mission he initially keeps hidden from his wife Nancy (Grace Kelly). Some of the speeches delivered by a well-meaning Rear Admiral (Fredric March) could stand to be less patronizing, and the comic relief offered by Mickey Rooney (as a quarrelsome flyer) and Robert Strauss (as a landing signal officer known as “Beer Barrel”) only interferes. But look closely and an antiwar message emerges — less jingoistic than many of the era’s WWII flicks, this one doesn’t shy away from taking a dour look at the pointlessness of the conflict. The excellent aerial and combat scenes earned this an Academy Award for Best Special Effects, with the film also picking up a nomination for Best Film Editing (beaten by an even bigger Holden hit that year, Picnic). THE COVENANT (2023). The Covenant is also known under its official title Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant, although I suppose a more accurate moniker might be Guy Ritchie’s The Killing Fields. Like that magnificent 1984 feature, this one also centers on the relationship between an American in a war-torn foreign land and the local man who assists him. Unlike that earlier work, though, this one isn’t based on a true story, which means there’s more maneuverability to include an action-packed finale. Set toward the end of the War in Afghanistan, this centers on the relationship between Master Sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter, Ahmed Abdullah (Dar Salim). More bullheaded and independent than the other interpreters, Ahmed tests Kinley’s patience on more than one occasion. Yet when the Taliban sets its sights on the pair, their shared loyalty and mutual respect are what lead them to take turns saving each other’s life. The second and superior of Ritchie’s two 2023 releases (the first was Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre), The Covenant often plays like a Peter Berg picture minus the simple-minded nationalism (e.g. The Kingdom) — while it generally steers clear of politics, it does acknowledge (via closing text and a few scene fragments) America’s failures when it comes to its Afghan allies. Above all, this is an action-laced drama, and it works just fine within these parameters, with Gyllenhaal and Salim both delivering excellent performances in between several intense set-pieces. INSIDIOUS (2011). While it’s long been time to call a moratorium on both haunted-house thrillers and creepy-child sagas, Insidious milks a bit of innovativeness from both these sub-genres before self-destructing. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne make a believable couple as Josh and Renai Lambert, who move into an old mansion with their three kids in tow. An accident in the attic leaves son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) in a comatose state; soon afterward, all sorts of supernatural shenanigans occur. The Lamberts pack up and move out, but when strange things start happening at their new abode, they realize it wasn’t the former house itself that was haunted. Rather than relying on gore, director James Wan and scripter Leigh Whannell manage to conjure some genuine tension by keeping characters and viewers off-kilter for much of the running time. But the film slips drastically with the introduction of two paranormal investigators (Angus Sampson and Whannell himself) whose unfunny comic relief (we’re not talking Bill Murray or Kate McKinnon here) disrupts the unsettling mood. Late arrival Lin Shaye is excellent as the two clods’ all-knowing boss, but her elaborate — and exceedingly daft — explanations regarding the otherworldly occurrences further deflate the project, and the frantic finale is simply overkill. And the less said about the awful last-minute twist, the better … although it did get the ball rolling on the sequels, including the upcoming Insidious: The Red Door. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Steelbook edition include a behind-the-scenes piece; an interview with Wan and Whannell; and a look at the film’s various spirits and demons. LOONEY TUNES COLLECTOR’S CHOICE: VOL. 1 (1945-1959). This collection of vintage toon tales doesn’t harbor many (if any) acknowledged classics, instead showcasing lesser known efforts (including some that have never been released on home video). Nevertheless, the Warner A-listers (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, et al) are on hand, and there are enough buried treasures to make this an easy buy. Twelve of the 20 selections were directed by the usual suspects (Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng), but two were helmed by Frank Tashlin before he made the successful move from animator to feature-film writer (The Paleface, etc.) and then writer-director of such hits as The Girl Can’t Help It and The Glass Bottom Boat. Tashlin’s The Unruly Hare (1945) is a hilarious battle royale between Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, while his Tale of Two Mice (also ’45) is an amusing cat-and-mice romp featuring Babbit & Catstello, rodents based on you-know-who. Speaking of puddy tats, another winner is Freleng’s Greedy for Tweety (1957), in which Tweety, Sylvester, and Hector the Bulldog all share the same hospital room while laid up with injured legs. Jones’ Beanstalk Bunny (1955) is a ferociously clever take-off on Jack and the Beanstalk, with Daffy Duck as Jack, Elmer Fudd as the giant, and Bugs Bunny as, well, Bugs Bunny. Freleng’s A Mouse Divided (1953) is a joy, as a drunken stork leaves a baby mouse with Sylvester, who grows attached to the little fella and must protect him from all the neighborhood cats. Others featured in various cartoons in this set include Porky Pig, the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, and Foghorn Leghorn. THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962). John Frankenheimer’s Cold War gem may hail from 1962, but it’s frightening how it appears as if the movie has been ripped from the headlines of today: right-wing zealots who would corrupt the process in order to win the Oval Office; a populist political hack who often acts like a bratty child (“Run along; the grown-ups need to talk,” he’s told at one point); a conservative party that uses fear tactics to keep a nation on edge. Based on Richard Condon’s novel (with a script by George Axelrod), the film stars Frank Sinatra as a Korean War vet who, plagued by nightmares, begins to suspect that something’s not quite right with a former member (Laurence Harvey) of his platoon, a decorated hero who’s constantly having to contend with the political aspirations of his ruthless mother (Angela Lansbury) and her Senator husband (James Gregory). It’s heady stuff in a nail-biting chiller that still has the power to make viewers perspire profusely. Lansbury earned a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the monstrous mom, yet she’s matched by Harvey in a superb characterization as her aloof son, a tortured man whose humanity ironically only emerges once he’s turned into an unblinking political pawn. The 2004 remake (starring Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Schreiber) isn’t bad, but it’s no match for this gripping classic. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray edition include audio commentary (from 1997) by Frankenheimer; a conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer, and Axelrod; an interview with Lansbury; and a pair of outtakes. QUEEN CHRISTINA (1933). When the American Film Institute’s “100 Years” series ended the 20th century by picking the top 25 male and top 25 female stars from the golden age of cinema, Greta Garbo impressively landed in the #5 spot on the female side — only Katherine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, and Ingrid Bergman ranked higher, with such superstars as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, and Judy Garland actually placing underneath. So popular in her day that she was frequently billed on posters as simply “Garbo” (see also “Karloff” and “Chaplin”), she wowed audiences and peers alike (Gregory Peck once called her his favorite actress), but try to find anyone agreeing on which film houses her best performance. Anna Christie? Anna Karenina? Camille? Ninotchka? For my money, it would be her magnificent turn as the title character in Queen Christina, a satisfying (if dramatically shaky) biopic about the Swedish ruler who abdicated at the age of 27. Under the skilled direction of Rouben Mamoulian, Garbo (who herself was 27 when filming began) once again uses minimal movements to maximum effect, often allowing only her eyes to convey meaning and emotion. John Gilbert, her frequent leading man back in the silent period, co-stars as the Spanish ambassador who leads her to question her life as a bachelorette — he’s adequate, but this really is a one-woman show that just happens to include a cast of hundreds. That lengthy final close-up, as much an affirmation of the actress as of the character she plays, remains a classic snatch of cinema. THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE (2023). Well, at least it’s better than that godawful live-action bomb from 1993, the one that featured a bewildered Dennis Hopper as King Koopa. And it’s certainly a must-see for present fans of the video game, for nostalgists with fond memories of endless playing, and for small children, three factions certain to award it four stars without hesitation. For most others, however, it’s an alarmingly flat endeavor that dutifully gets the job done and not much else. It’s basically Easter Eggs: The Movie, providing so much fan service and brand stamping that very little genuine wit or imagination makes it into the finished product — on that front, it pales next to the recent Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and the Wreck-It Ralph duo. I absolutely loved the nihilistic Lumalee (voiced by Juliet Jelenic), and Seth Rogen, Jack Black, and Keegan-Michael Key manage to inject some personality into their interpretations of, respectively, Donkey Kong, Bowser, and Toad. But in the central roles of plumber siblings Mario and Luigi and Princess Peach, Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, and Anya Taylor-Joy are so colorless and bland that the filmmakers might as well have hired Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Marjorie Taylor Green just to see if they could have fared better. The visuals are colorful and occasionally clever — indeed, there are a handful of bright bits strewn throughout, but this ultimately registers as harmless and charmless. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include a making-of featurette; a piece on the cast members and their characters; and the lyric video for “Peaches.” TIME BANDITS (1981). Given its year of release, this offbeat yarn stands as a gateway between the absurdist skits of Monty Python’s Flying Circus in the 1970s — no surprise, since it was written by Python members Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin and directed by Gilliam — and the string of off-kilter fantasy flicks that would dot the ’80s landscape (The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, Labyrinth, etc.). A box office hit that also managed to earn a reputation as a cult film, this finds a young boy named Kevin (Craig Warnock) joining a group of little people as they travel through time and become involved with such figures as Napoleon (Ian Holm), Agamemnon (Sean Connery), and Robin Hood (John Cleese, another Python alumnus). All the while, they’re being pursued by the Supreme Being (Ralph Richardson), who’s seeking to recover the magical map they stole, and the Evil Genius (David Warner), who’s hoping to claim said map for himself. Gilliam’s films tend to be either awe-inspiring or overbearing, and this one manages to dip into both columns, with some brilliant bouts of fancy occasionally undermined by inane overkill. Incidentally, this was one of the first films produced by George Harrison’s HandMade Films, which had initially been created to finance 1979’s Monty Python’s Life of Brian and later backed other successes like Mona Lisa and Withnail and I. Extras in the 4K UHD + Blu-ray edition include audio commentary by Gilliam, Palin, Cleese, Warner, and Warnock; a conversation with Gilliam; an appearance by Shelley Duvall (who has a supporting role in the film) on a 1981 episode of the late-night talk show Tomorrow Coast to Coast with Tom Snyder; and a gallery of behind-the-scenes photos. UP IN SMOKE (1978). My, how the times do change. In 1936, Reefer Madness showed how just one puff from a single marijuana cigarette could lead to murder, suicide, insanity, and — gasp! — overly exuberant piano-playing. In 1978, Up In Smoke showed how smoking a joint the size of a football could at worst lead to a severe case of the munchies. In short, Nancy Reagan wouldn’t have found much use for this cult hit in her “Just Say No” campaign, as Cheech Marin and Thomas Chong (making their film debuts after successful stand-up and recording careers) prove to be irresistible anti-establishment figures in this consistently amusing dum-dum comedy. With a script as aimless as its protagonists, Up In Smoke (billed in theaters with the great tagline, “You’ll be rolling in the aisles!”) drifts from one comic vignette to another, as stoners Pedro (Cheech) and Man (Chong) are constantly on the prowl for their next high. Their odyssey leads them to the home of Pedro’s Vietnam-scarred cousin Strawberry (Tom Skerritt), to Mexico to pick up a van made entirely out of weed, and to a rock club to perform in a “Battle of the Bands”-style contest. Up In Smoke is sloppy, crude, and decidedly non-PC, but just try not to laugh when a coked-out partygoer unwittingly snorts a few lines of Ajax (“Good shit!” she declares), or when a police dog is glimpsed after its encounter with the marijuana-van, or when Pedro explains that his undocumented relatives purposely called Immigration so they could get a free ride across the border into Mexico to attend a wedding. RAMPART (2011). Dave Brown, the corrupt cop at the center of Rampart, is described by one of his own daughters as “a dinosaur … a classic racist, a bigot, a sexist, a womanizer, a chauvinist, a misanthrope, homophobic clearly.” Why stop there? He’s also a bully, a thief, a murderer — and one of the most compelling cops seen on screen in some time. Dave Brown is played by Woody Harrelson, who earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his supporting stint in writer-director Oren Moverman’s 2009 drama The Messenger. Whereas that film found Harrelson playing a decent man grimly doing a dirty job — an army captain tasked with informing families of the deaths of their loved ones who were off fighting for God and country — this Moverman movie finds him cast as an indecent man happily tackling a dirty job: serving as a “soldier” (his word) in an effort to cleanse the Los Angeles “jungle” (ditto). With a real-life 1999 LA police scandal serving as the backdrop, Rampart follows Dave as his life begins a downward spiral. Caught on camera savagely beating a civilian and later involved in a highly questionable shooting that leaves a Hispanic man dead, Dave becomes the poster child for everything that’s wrong with the police force. With a supporting cast that includes Sigourney Weaver, Steve Buscemi, and Ice Cube, and a rare screenplay from L.A. Confidential novelist James Ellroy that he co-wrote with Moverman, Rampart is more of a character study than any sort of crime procedural, and it’s all the better for it. Let me preface by saying that I think that you are one of the best film critics writing today. Your depth of knowledge and breadth of appreciation, both in decades and genres covered, are massively appreciated. My personal watch-list has grown tremendously by following your “From the couch” posts. It’s one thing to talk about how politics inform decisions about which movies are made, how those films are perceived (then and now), and how these politics reverberate through the story-telling (for good or bad). But no one cares about YOUR politics. It’s clear that you think your political positions are just, humane and unimpeachable. Good for you. But harping on these debatable positions, in an otherwise cogent critique, is obnoxious, condescending and pedantic. Politics in the modern era is poisonous. Party, candidate, platform makes no difference in the lives of the vast majority of Americans. Nothing ever changes for them, except that things look more hopeless every year.  Real Clear Politics has been tracking “direction of the country” surveys since January 2009. In that time, 2,884 surveys have been conducted across a variety of polling organizations. During this 14 year period the average percentage of Americans who believe that the country is moving in the wrong direction is 61%. Only 22 polls have shown Americans feeling positive about the direction of the country. Of those, only 8 polls have shown positive feelings above 5%.     …ripped from the headlines of today: left-wing zealots who would corrupt the process in order to win the Oval Office (Zuckerbucks); a corrupt career political hack who often acts like he has lost his mind completely to Alzheimer’s (“We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean.” To pick one quote at random); a liberal party that uses fear tactics, decisiveness and corporate media stooges to keep a nation on edge. If you had, MORE people likely would have agreed with you. Although they (and you) would be dismissed as conspiracy theorists, and you would be demonetized by the elites. Hi, Ignatz; thanks for writing. And thanks for the very kind words; plus, it’s always nice to hear from someone else who appreciates all manner of movies. Before Film Frenzy, I spent the entirety of my decades-long career as the film editor / critic at an alternative newsweekly. I don’t know how familiar you are with the alternative press — current and former weeklies and websites like the Village Voice, the Boston Phoenix, the Stranger, Slant, etc. — but it is expected and encouraged (heck, maybe even required by some) that their critics bring real-world politics, history, issues, controversies, etc., into their arts coverage (not just movies but literature, theater, music, etc.). Yes, it’s a more irreverent and often inflammatory brand of criticism than what’s offered in mainstream media (although Roger Ebert was notorious for injecting leftist politics into some of his reviews, and he won a Pulitzer), but it’s what’s in my blood. And movies don’t exist in a vacuum, instead reflecting the world around them, even if their sociopolitical slants are usually unintentional. A romantic comedy where the heroine’s best friend is a gay guy probably isn’t trying to be political, but just that inclusion makes it so (after all, do you think those GOP monsters passing / supporting all those grotesque anti-LGBTQ laws would include such a sympathetic homosexual character if they made a movie?). And if movies don’t exist in a vacuum, then neither can coverage / criticism of such be expected to do so. Kyle Smith (to name one) gives me a headache with his political digs at liberals in his film reviews, but that’s his right and I wouldn’t want him to change. At any rate, from a political standpoint, there’s no critic as obnoxious and foaming-at-the-mouth (not even me!) as one on the right: Armond White, who compounds it by having often terrible taste (who could forget that week in Summer 2010 when he mercilessly trashed TOY STORY 3 while raving profusely about JONAH HEX? Yikes!). Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply. I must confess I was unsure that you would reply. I am used to writers and publications on the left simply shutting down conversations, rather than engaging with someone who veers, even slightly, from the formally accepted narrative. So, thank you. I grew up in LA during the 70s and 80s and witnessed all that was on offer until I moved, shortly after the turning of the new century. I spent years reading the LA Reader and LA Weekly. As a huge repertoire film and small venue music fan, they were required reading. I even worked for the LA Weekly for a few years as a courier/messenger, shuttling print ads to and from advertisers. I met a lot of great people. I also met Harlan Ellison (what a piece of work, good writer though). Good times. I was born very liberal, but in recent years I’ve found that the left has become extremely illiberal. Also, as I have grown, I have learned that not all the values of the right are completely suspect. I might have also been influenced by witnessing the brutal fall of Portland, Oregon. I had hoped to make that distinction in my comments. Politics and culture infuse all works that proport to examine the human experience. What I was trying to call out was the gratuitous point scoring against political “boogie men” (anti-vaxxers, mask refuseniks, MAGA Americans). It seems that despite the elite left’s love of all things “non-binary” they are absolutely Catholic in their approach to politics. Even if you acknowledge the miraculous boon from vaccines for small pox, measles, mumps, etc. Even if you share that you, and your children are fully vaccinated against these scourges. The moment that you confess serious doubts about the covid “jabs” (they are not vaccines and I refuse to call them that) you are branded a backwards, science denying, troglodyte. Same thing if you say, “you know, it appears that all the REAL scientific research suggests that wearing masks AT BEST makes no difference, and at worst poses serious heath risks”. Same thing if you say, I am all about equal rights for enthusiasts of all manner of human coupling but perhaps we should not race to irreversibly mutilate children who may just be experiencing the pangs and confusion of, well, being children. No, just by saying that, I, and people like me are declared irredeemably evil, and the only right and good thing is to shut us down. That’s the feeling I get when you parenthetically take me down for a difference of opinion in a Richard Matheson/Vincent Price review. Is that really “politics”? Nuance, packages left half-wrapped, sentences that trail off, a vague sense of moral ambiguity, these are things of effective story-telling. They can be richer still if the themes of Politics, human politics, is worked into them. What they do not need is pure partisan politics. That’s just propaganda, dogma. Oh, and I completely agree with you about Armond White. I am not convinced that he even likes movies. I am even less convinced that he is a writer of any quality.  If a critic uses their platform to issue political screeds with movies as a mere launch pad for their agendas, I’d be sure to avoid that critic. But to me a well-written, well-reasoned review/analysis isn’t spoiled by a few pointed political pokes, of any stripe. For the record I’ve always loved reading Armond White’s pieces, back to his NY Press days, though he and I exist on near opposite ideological poles. I can’t imagine a review of Michael Moore’s movies, or Dinesh DiSouza’s, that didn’t focus largely on their makers’ politics. That’s the entire point of their films. Of course any good critic is also going to focus on whether those movies work effectively as the agitprop they were clearly intended to be. And a really astute review would try to zero in on whether their creators were bending the truth (or, in the case of DiSouza, waterboarding it to death). But even criticism of mindless escapist flicks destined for the summer multiplex could maybe do with *more* politics rather than less. I was struck by author David Sirota’s take on the original “Ghostbusters” as largely buying into the Reaganite hatred of government, with government employees portrayed as officious bureaucrats who are trying to lord their power over the heroic entrepreneurs. Granted, this was a lightweight comedy that was likely not intended to advance any particular partisan agenda. But it seems odd for critics not to interrogate the movie’s taken-for-granted assumption that public servants are by definition the bad guy. Most works of art and/or culture are a product of politics… either conscious or unconscious. It is a political statement in itself to not comment on politics, or to avoid it as being “inappropriate” in a certain situation… or to comment that someone is being too political in their writing. Politics is avoidable… but at our peril."
"Jun 13, 2023",neutral," After thirty years, countless games, and even a few films, Mario and Luigi get the animated Hollywood treatment with The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023). It’s evident right away that writer Matthew Fogel and directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic are huge fans of the property they’ve adapted. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is packed to the gills with all of the characters (major and minor), kingdoms, and power ups that fans of the beloved franchise could hope for…for better and for worse. After a cold open in which Bowser (Jack Black) attacks the Penguin King to claim the Ice Kingdom, the movie opens with struggling Brooklyn brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) trying to get their new plumbing business off the ground. Their family doesn’t support them (an ambitious, but terrible and expensive TV promo isn’t helping) and their first gig ends in comically predictable disaster.  All of these insecurities are fairly typical set-up en route to a journey of discovery and self-actualization. The inciting incident occurs when the stoplight coloured plumbers discover a secret pipe that warps them into a whole new world. They’re separated en route, with scaredy-cat Luigi sucked off to the Darklands where he’s immediately captured by Bowser’s henchmen and imprisoned for the remainder of the film. That leaves Mario to go off on a heroes quest with his new self-proclaimed best friend Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). The latter’s Mushroom Kingdom is under threat from Bowser because the turtle king is determined to marry her and conquer her land in equal measure.  From there it’s a race – sometimes literally – against time to prepare for war. The intrepid trio must travel to the Jungle Kingdom to recruit an army from its fickle leader, Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) and his warrior son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan), who doesn’t lack for vanity or hubris. The resulting arena-style battle between Mario and Donkey Kong is appropriately epic and highly enjoyable, if only because it best exemplifies the film’s capacity to balance its action, comedy, and nostalgia in equal measure.  Other notable sequences include a Mario Kart-style chase on Rainbow Road and a final battle set aboard Bowser’s floating castle/ship. The former is curiously stilted and lifeless, while the latter is so frenetic, it feels like the visual embodiment of Adderall.  Both contain amusing moments and tips of the hat to the game’s extensive mythology, but they’re also reflective of the film’s weakness: The Super Mario Bros. Movie is too desperate to pack in game references. Combine this with the film’s break-neck pace, and the whole enterprise feels entirely too frenetic and amped up. There are barely any moments of levity where the characters (or the audience) can simply catch their breath and enjoy the experience; the film operates at a 10 the whole time. The speed of the narrative, combined with its short runtime and the humour’s emphasis on physical pratfalls and slow-motion, confirms that this is a property aimed predominantly at children. That’s not a bad thing, but it differs from most contemporary animation, which appeals equally to kids and parents. "

"May 23, 2023",negative," Video game adaptations are having a bit of a moment. In the last few years, we've seen beloved franchises brought to the big screen with irreverent flair in Detective Pikachu and the Sonic movies. We've seen action-packed sci-fi worlds hit the small screen with impressive scale in Showtime's Halo series. Most notably, earlier this year, HBO’s The Last Of Us gave us the first prestige TV series adapted from a popular game. Not to mention a few forgettable, empty action vehicles along the way (Uncharted). There's even a Tetris movie out right now. (Yes, fine, that one’s a drama about the making of the game, but I just wanted to include it okay?) Enter The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Based on Nintendo's smash-hit game sensation, the 3D animated adventure brings our favourite floating-box jumping, gold-coin-collecting plumbers to life. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic’s film follows the fantastical origin story of brothers Mario (Chris Pratt, whose voice thankfully doesn’t attract too much attention to itself) and Luigi (the far more capable voice actor, Charlie Day, who should be the lead of this movie, but more on that later). We open in Brooklyn, New York where Mario and Luigi are actual plumbers who actually call themselves the Super Mario Bros. Having opened their own plumbing business, the two struggle to make a name for themselves. This quieter NYC-based opening leg of the film is dangerously at risk of being more interesting and enjoyable than any of the magical fantasy stuff that follows. The misadventures of two wacky, sincere plumbers trying to be taken seriously in the big city? Give me that movie. While trying to fix a burst pipe under the streets of Brooklyn, true to the game, our two Italian plumber protagonists discover a secret gateway to a magical world where they must defeat the evil turtle-bad-guy-leader Bowser (Jack Black) who’s threatening to take over the place. (Seriously, who first came up with this stuff, what were they smoking and where can I get some??) Right on queue, as if the movie was pre-empting my question, Mario lands in the “Mushroom Kingdom”. But he’s been separated from Luigi, who got lost on the way and landed up in Bowser’s territory. To save his brother, Mario must find Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to help him rescue Luigi and defeat the evil Bowser. There’s no lack of visual flair in The Super Mario Bros Movie. The vibrant colour, the familiar whimsical world full of floating blocks, power-ups, and secret tunnels. It also has the right level of kinetic energy to keep things constantly in motion, jumping from one gag and/or action sequence to another. But it’s far less imaginative and encouraging on paper. Everything that takes place between the initial setup to the (mostly) fun final battle (which takes us from a Mario Kart race to a climactic fight on the street of New York) plods along with little personality. We get Mario and Princess Peach going on an “adventure” across different landscapes made up of shoddy worldbuilding that can only be described as blurry-non-descript-much-wow-magical…stuff. While the pointlessness of a tired 30-year-old film critic writing about a harmless, cosy, kids' movie isn’t lost on me - we also happen to live in the golden age of kids' movies that are just as appealing to adults. Granted, The Super Mario Bros movie was never going to have the heartbreaking sincerity and emotional ambition of a Pixar film. But what it is missing is the zany, self-aware comedy that has made the made-for-children genre so enjoyable in recent years. We live in a post-Shrek world. In the twenty years since our favourite ogre, DreamWorks animation has given us the likes of Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, The Croods, the delightful and sorely underrated gem that is Monsters Vs Aliens, and a whole lot more. Even Illumination Entertainment, the studio behind this Marios movie has mastered the art of funny, fuzzy, feel-good flicks with the Despicable Me and Minions movies. But we see none of that here. The Super Mario Bros movie is lifelessly low on laughs in its staunch refusal to poke fun at its inherently ridiculous world. Writer Matthew Fogel's script is desperately in need of what Hollywood calls a punch-up - getting comedy writers in to funny up the proceedings. And there’s so much untapped comedic potential here with many inherently funny ideas that are lightly danced around but barely explored. Fred Armisen as the lovably theatrical leader of the apes. Seth Rogan as the self-obsessed, showboaty Donkey Kong. Keegan-Michael Key as the wonderfully weird, desperate-for-company Toad. Or the fact that what the evil Bowser wants most is to have “a fairy-tale” wedding with Princess Peach. For what it’s worth, I do appreciate the film’s attempt at making the Princess a badass warrior with plenty of her own ass-kicking to do rather than just another damsel in need of saving. Instead, the damsel duties here are awarded to Luigi. He's the far more interesting, endearing character with the more touching arc - stumbling, constantly nervous, plagued by fear and forever relying on his brother to back him up. That is until he's forced to rise to the occasion and find his courage. But here, he’s sidelined by his blander, more uninteresting brother. (I can’t believe I have a hot take on the The Super Mario Bros movie of all things. Send help). A harmless, generic blur of kids “content” (I hate that word, but it feels painfully apt here), The Super Mario Bros movie isn’t one to enjoy with your kids, as much as it is one you’re forced to sit through because of them. Do children not deserve better than a 90-minute blur of cotton candy action? I guess the bajillion dollars this movie will no doubt do at the box office suggests otherwise."
"May 20, 2023",positive," As we get ready to officially kick off the summer months, it’s worth asking what good movies there are to watch in theaters and at home. While it’s easy to know about the latest Marvel film, it’s sometimes hard to really dig into the wide array of movies past and present. We here at For the Win want to give you a weekly opportunity to get 10 quick movie recommendations of movies that have just come out and movies that came out long ago. You might like our suggestions, and you might scroll right past them. All the same, we hope that you find something on this list that piques your interest. BlackBerry made me want to run through a wall and scream about the beauty of movies for adults until I was hoarse. This really is one of the year’s best movies. It’s truly the Canadian spin on The Social Network, so you know they’re going to nail the “ah no, shouldn’t have done that, pal” parts better than we did. This is an electric cocktail of Christopher Nolan mind-bending and Troublemaker Studios exploitation ridiculousness. You’ve had this concoction in better forms, but the ice cubes light up in this drink, and there is sugar on the rim. Ben Affleck knows exactly what kind of movie he’s in, one that just relishes in trying to pull out the rug from under you every 5-10 minutes. This one just moves without much concern for spending too much time on an exposition dump, even if that is like half of the dialogue. The other half is just Affleck and the cast quipping wise with each other and giving each other tough guy looks. You can’t really say this film isn’t riffing on better movies because it absolutely is, but it’s still got a silly streak that’s really exciting. It’s a film untethered to anything but whatever would be the next insane twist you couldn’t see coming. Robert Rodriguez still knows how to give the audience a good time, and he’s in enough control of the material here to make it stick. The opening bank heist is as good as advertised with real explosions. Real explosions! I had a great time with this. You have to be willing to suspend your disbelief a bit and embrace the corniness of the dialogue, but Rodriguez knows what he’s doing. He always has. It’s rough around the edges, but dang it, it still tastes great even if it’s just a DIY imitation of what’s come before. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is going to have the same effect on today’s kids that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom had on kids in the 80s, and I mean that as the highest compliment. If James Gunn really is the heir apparent to Tim Burton, this is his Edward Scissorhands and his Batman Returns all rolled up into one big, messy, heart-wrenching hug from a Rocket Raccoon. Also, this is Chris Pratt’s best performance since Parks and Recreation. All about this movie. The rare biographical documentary that seeks to understand the subject rather than showcase them. It makes smart decisions with how to tell Blume’s story, and the stylistic flourishes don’t distract in the slightest. The interviews are all worthwhile, and the modern ties feel relevant and urgent. I was quite impressed by this. I’m glad Mrs. Blume got the quality documentary she deserved. It’s basically a Gen Z spin on Stanley Kubrick’s The Killing. It’s a much more complicated film than it might seem, and it’s all the better for it. This is one of 2023’s best. Taron Egerton is a darn movie star, even if by textbook definition he’s not. This is just a good, mid-budget adult drama about an optimistic American entrepreneur racing against the clock and against the USSR and shady business guys to win a Tetris contract, so it’s Miracle with video games rights, which heck yeah, man! It might be a wee bit too cutesy for its own good, but it’s also a stunning testament to just picking a good story not a lot of people know about and telling it seriously with a imaginative director, a rocksteady script and reliable actors. It’s a darn good time at the movies (on my TV). Harmless; it amounts to a Burger King kid’s meal and night of Nintendo 64. I’m not sure Illumination will ever take one single risk, but I do think their cheery, color-splosion style for 7-year-olds works for a movie about Super Mario Bros. Jack Black is really the only voice actor who goes the full mile, even if I think Chris Pratt is doing more than you’d expect. I had much more fun watching this than I am thinking about it, but I’m not going to sit here and act like I didn’t take that 90-whatever minutes I spent in this and put it into a Nintendo Switch for my house. Am I stooge for commercial intent? Sure, but I also had fun playing Mario Kart for the first time since college, so who’s the real loser? Exquisite filmmaking: we’re all going to die one day, and your spouse is quite literally one of the only things you can cling to while you’re here to grapple with that mortality. The secret to a happy marriage: going to Italy and being pushed to the brink of divorce and then at the last minute finally realizing that a small conversation about how you actually feel would’ve solved everything years ago. It’s only fitting that Chris Pratt honors his place among the Schwarzeneggers by doing the kind of sci-fi action movie Arnold would’ve done in the 90s. Is Pratt miscast here? Sure, but so was Arnold in Kindergarten Cop. Being miscast is okay if you kind of know you’re miscast, and Pratt is good enough to realize that and just do his thing anyway. This isn’t a great movie, but it’s a pretty good one. It’s got some really intriguing ingredients (the aliens! the plot! the family dynamic!), but it’s also never compelling enough to really make that leap into the next echelon. However, it’s technically original, and it’s trying to go for some grander emotional beats. Chris McKay is a solid live-action director, and while I preferred Renfield to this, I don’t think he missed the mark at all. Some of the alien fight sequences are pretty engaging, and much more cerebral than your typical Transformers fight. I didn’t see this two years ago because I heard it wasn’t good, and now I kind of wish I’d watched it then. It’s solid! I’d watch another Tomorrow War. I wouldn’t want to be in a Tomorrow War, and maybe that’s the most effective thing about it. It’s good enough at the world building and the action that it’s worth your time. Holes still rocks all these years later. It’s thorny, emotionally resonant young adult storytelling with a good filmmaker behind the wheel and a deep cast. We really didn’t know how good we used to have it."
"May 17, 2023",positive," The Gist: We get the ball rolling in another world or dimension or something, where we meet Bowser (Jack Black), a very large imperialist turtle who enslaves a race of small penguins and conquers/destroys their icy lands. And then he finds a ? box and smashes it and takes control of the super star inside of it, which is this movie’s MacGuffin. CUT TO: Modern-day Brooklyn, where plumber brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) have just launched their own business with a TV commercial that makes the Ghostbusters’ ad look like La Dolce Vita. But it works, because they get their first call and rush out to fix the leak, their side-scrolling journey accompanied by Slayer guitarist Kerry King’s shredding guest solo on the Beastie Boys’ “No Sleep Till Brooklyn,” proof that what was edgy and cool several decades ago will eventually be tamed by the pop-cultural blandification machine and assimilated into the deathless nostalgia borg (and pad the musical artists’ bank accounts with “passive income”). Not only do our guys wrestle with persnickety pipes, but they have an encounter with an aggressive dog, a sequence that has nothing to do with anything whatsoever, but hey, at least we have something amusing to look at, with the bright colors and goofy characters and zany action, right?  Then Mario and Luigi go home. They’re two adult men still living with their parents, and everyone doubts their ability to maintain reasonable self-employment. Here, we learn that Mario thinks mushrooms are yucky, and won’t eat them, which is what you call an inside joke. Suddenly, an opportunity for our boys to prove themselves pops up when a Brooklyn water main breaks and they rush off to help – but they end up being sucked into a magic pipe and deposited into a strange world chock-full of spinoff-able intellectual property. Luigi finds himself in the Dark Land, where Bowser’s minions scoop him up and imprison him. Mario drops into the Mushroom Kingdom, where he meets a little weird guy named Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), who takes him to his leader, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who’s shocked to see another human in… what exactly is this place called, anyway? Mario World? It can’t be, not yet, because I’ve just realized this movie is, insert deep sigh here, an Origin Story. I digress. Mario wants to find Luigi, which dovetails with Peach’s desire to vanquish Bowser before he lays waste to the peaceful and benign Mushroom Kingdom. But first, she has to train Mario in the art of platform gaming, which involves leaping on little blocks and ducking under things that wallop you and busting ? blocks that give you extra powers, and all that. She zooms through the training course – in heels, even! – lickety-split, while Mario trial-and-errors his way through it, failing and starting over and failing and starting over and failing and starting over like he’s in a… a… what do you call it… time loop? Is that right? Maybe not. Anyway, before they face Bowser, Peach determines that they need to get help from the Kongs, a conglomeration of apes who include Cranky (Fred Armisen), Donkey (Seth Rogen) and Diddy, although the latter only makes a brief cameo and is probably being saved for the sequel. And then comes the Super Smash Bros. part, and then the Mario Kart part, and then the big boss battle, which occurs during Bowser’s attempt to force Peach into marrying him. Meanwhile, where the hell is Yoshi? I could answer that but, you know, NO SPOILERS. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Is it sacrilege to say Wreck-It Ralph? Kind of. It’s definitely sacrilege to say Wreck-It Ralph is the better movie, but the truth cares not for context.  Memorable Dialogue: Praising the Mario Bros.’ TV ad, Luigi makes a probably unintentional thou-dost-protest-too-much meta-joke about the movie itself: “That is not a commercial. That. Is. Cinema!” Our Take: Allow me to push past the Mario Movie’s obvious crowd-pleasing nature and cheery escapism for some typical film-critic pedantry: This thing feels like it was written by a calculator. It’s less a screenplay and more of a loose outline, a list of inter-franchise references strung together by the flimsiest of plots and hits-of-the-’80s needle drops: There’s a nod to an old TV cartoon, there’s a recognizable character making a cameo, there’s ‘Holding Out for a Hero,’ there’s some action inspired by one of the video games, and hey is that Seth Rogen’s voice I hear? It dashes along lickety-split and only slows down for a brief intermission in which Black-as-Bowser-but-mostly-as-Black croons a torch song for Princess Peach, which is one of the movie’s rare moments of inspired comedy. It’s all so transparently mechanical in its structure. And that’s the issue with longstanding franchises-slash-intellectual property – it once was the product of inspiration, now it’s just a product.  But it’s easy to be of two minds about the movie, because it’s lively, expertly animated, energetic, lightly amusing and modestly ambitious. If there’s anything resembling a message here, maybe it’s the portrait of Mario as a man of perseverance (although you’ve already learned that lesson if you’ve been tempted to wing your $80 joy-con through the window after being killed by Bouldergeist for the 116th time in a row.) Nobody’s trying to change the world here, or invoke the tragedy of the human condition. It’s not Pixar, it’s the company behind Minions delivering a bullseye for eight-year-olds who will giggle and whoop for 92 minutes, then go home, snug their plush Shy Guy in the crick of their arm, pick up the Nintendo controller and launch a campaign to spend $60 of their parents’ money for a new game. It’s perfectly fine with adhering to the relentless-joke-factory-with-celeb-voices formula, and executing it for maximum appeal. As for the “controversy” over Pratt voicing Mario – did you really want to hear an obnoxious faux-Italian stereotype voice IT’S-A-ME!-ing in your face for 92 minutes? That was the smartest calculation of all. Our Call: STREAM IT. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is entirely acceptable family entertainment. It also leaves plenty of room for improvement when the inevitable sequels, spinoffs and series are launched in a quest for the next billion dollars. "
"May 8, 2023",positive,"I think it did a good job of appealing to both older and younger fans of the ""Mario"" video game franchise. It hit all of the points and gave you all the IP that a viewer could have wanted. That's why it's such a huge hit."
"May 8, 2023",negative,I didn't have high expectations but do feel like it could have gone a bit deeper beyond eye candy and easter eggs. However it is enjoyable as a kids movie meant to hit all expected Illumination tropes. 
"May 4, 2023",positive," Everything fans complained about Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) not having is on full display in the new Universal/Illumination movie, The Super Mario Bros Movie (2023), but if you’re not a fan of the video game series, there’s not much left for you. The first 15 minutes establish Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) as loveable lugs with big hearts who want to do the right thing at the expense of common sense and property damage. The Mario Brothers have left their former employment of the Wrecking Crew to branch out on their own as plumbers in Brooklyn. Their new commercial has aired and it’s as cringeworthy as you could imagine, but in that fun way that says “WE KNOW”. Their first official call certainly doesn’t make them any friends but sets up some basic gameplay, such as jumping to avoid obstacles and the brothers helping each other out. When the City experiences an unexplained water main break, Mario and Luigi leap into action and insert themselves into a situation being mishandled by DPS. Shortly, they find themselves inexplicably sucked through sub-level tunnels and the brothers are separated into different parts of the same world. Luigi, the lesser brave of the two, has been sucked to the Koopa Kingdom, ruled by a giant spikey turtle named Bowser (Jack Black). Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, a place full of Toads/Mushroom People/ Kinopios (whatever your Mario-kink), and ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), a human. This is briefly explained later. Mario implores Princess Peach to help him save his brother, and she needs him to save their kingdom from Bowser. Bowser has recently come into possession of a Super Star that will help him defeat the Mushroom Kingdom and marry his crush, Princess Peach. No one wants this. With me? It’s a lot if you’ve never played or are expecting something different, but on the surface, despite the paper-thin story no deeper than the cut scenes normally seen in video games, it’s not terrible. Our heroes have to make alliances, gather an army, and defeat the Boss. There are powerups, jumping, running, while battling Kongs, Penguins, Koopa Troopas, and Shy Guys. If it was an NPC (non-playable character), you’re probably going to see it. For a movie aimed at kids, a lot of people are threatened with open murder. Perhaps this is part of regular gameplay and maybe I’m overreacting, but it was jarring in a movie so big and bright. Oh, there is a fatalistic blue Luma, Lumalee (Juliet Jelenic), who due to its long-term incarceration over lava, is either terribly pragmatic or quite insane. If there is a sequel, here’s hoping we get more on that backstory because Holy Toledo, keep that one clear of sharp objects. The Super Mario Bros Movie is beautiful, and Illumination never fails to bring spectacular animations and eye-popping imagery to its films. It’s as immersive an experience as you can get in 2D, and the action is smooth and engaging. If you’re a fan of walk-throughs on God-Mode, this is definitely the movie to see. It really is like watching a skilled player work through the levels. That said, Super Mario Bros is light on actual plot and story, and most of the humor is only really funny if you’re 10. Because The Super Mario Bros Movie spans several storylines across 20+ games, fans will find easter eggs throughout. I am not a player so I cannot point them out, but if you take a gamer you may hear occasional squeals of delight. For how it’s presented, which is honestly nothing more than promised, The Super Mario Bros Movie might be a worthy way to spend an afternoon. The Super Mario Bros Movie (2023) is rated PG for videogame action and violence, such as getting repeatedly punched in the face, tumbling off rainbows, violent cart demolitions, explosions, dangerous romantic obsessions, and the forced captivity of penguins."

"May 1, 2023",negative," “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is now playing in theaters to packed audiences. It’s animation and based on the popular 80s video game of two brothers, Mario, voiced by (Chris Pratt) and Luige (Charlie Day), from the Nintendo game corporation in Japan. Wow, the film is colorful and eye-popping, especially with the rainbow speedway track. Although, I can’t recommend the movie as it’s too dark in tone for kids and has way too much violence. I’d say skip it in theaters. 
Mario Bros, unfortunately borrowed Guy Ritchie’s playbook from his disaster of a movie “Aladdin.” Yep, there’s torture in ” Mario Bros,” just as in “Aladdin,” it mirrors electric shocking Toad until Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) agrees to marry Bowser (Jack Black) or King Koopad, just as “The Sultan” ruler of Agrabah, Princess Jasmine’s father is tortured until she agrees to marry Jarfar. Physical bullying to get your way is never okay. Hmm…what does that teach kids? I’ll tell you…it teaches kids to bully to get their way! Nope, not on my watch."
"Apr 28, 2023",positive," I respect an actor or actress putting it all on the line for a role, even if it’s just sitting on a chair naked. While it helped that Alison Brie is a nudist-favoring lady in real life, playing one on screen and showing it all for the rewindable world to see is quite a feat.  That’s the part that will grab the attention of most movie lovers when they scroll across Somebody I Used to Know on Amazon Prime. Dave Franco’s latest follows through on many methods used in the Julia Roberts favorite, My Best Friend’s Wedding. In fact, a character here actually references that movie to Brie’s Ally in the movie when it comes to stealing her fiancé (Jay Ellis, Top Gun: Maverick). Ally and him have history, the kind that can ruin weddings, hint-hint, etc.  That’s the hook of Franco’s film, who once again has chosen to point his cinematic lens towards his longtime wife, Brie. They couldn’t deny the fact that there’s a lot of them in this movie, having written it together. With the lead character’s name being the name of the actress playing her and the nudist link, the director and star are giving us a glimpse. Anyone not see that hilarious full monty sprint down the hotel hallway from Brie?  The relatable ties work for the film, and also against it in spots. If Somebody I Used to Know has a weakness to contend with its witty dialogue and free spirit cast work, it’s a predictable thread that becomes apparent halfway through. It’s memorable (from other movies) moments that hit the nail too straight on the head. Instead of standing out more like his recent film, The Rental, Franco’s latest disappears into that late night streaming service pile of goods. Brie, Kiersey Clemons (HEARTS BEAT LOUD!), Danny Pudi, Haley Joel Osment, and the always good Julie Hargerty enliven the material. Pudi and Brie played together on Community, making their dialogue exchanges ping and pong naturally. Osment gets to unplug a little here, ironically in the shoes of a character who likes to make constant movie references and puns. It speaks to my heart, actually. Serviceable in a general way with some intuitive parts, Somebody I Used to Know isn’t a bad way to spend your time, but I think there was something more there. Stay until the very end for proof that Franco didn’t just ask his lovely partner in crime to embrace her inner nudist. That one’s for parents after the kids go to sleep, or into their games and controllers. The next one is what you do a few hours earlier on a weekend. Take the family to see The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Thankfully improving on the atrocious live action take from the 1990s-less said, the better-the animated adventure film is a nice 90-minute diversion. The adults who once were kids and loved this game will get a kick out of this much-better game adaptation. Their kids will like it too.  We’re in easy-to-please territory here with on-the-nose voice choices of Chris Pratt and Charlie Day as our principal heroes. The additional pleasures of Seth Rogen’s laugh and Anya Taylor-Joy’s Princess Peach round out an impressive voice cast. For the record, Keegan-Michael Key could show up in anything, physically or even just a voice, and be great. That continues here. There wasn’t a real urge to rush out and see this one when it came out two weeks ago, but my arm didn’t need to be twisted when Little Buffa asked to see it. Watching movies with your son, especially in the speed-of-light time warp we seem to be stuck in these days, is a thumbs up experience before the movie even begins.  He loved The Super Mario Bros. Movie; I thought it was fine. There were a boatload of game references he caught that flew over my head. By last night, the wife and Vinny were playing, take a guess, Super Mario Bros on Nintendo. Movies and their effect: it’s a real thing. Also, Pratt has to be printing money at the moment. Good for him. Having Arnold Schwarzenegger as a father-in-law can’t be easy.  ~Cinderella Man is still a classic film wrongly released in the summer. Why don’t you hear more about Ron Howard’s underrated (59% on RT) true story boxing drama? It came out in June amongst a sea of blockbuster dummies, got torn up by critics, and reminded people of the (not so) Great Depression. Making Max Baer more of an antagonist for Jim Braddock was a risky move, but it worked with the dreary backdrop. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti are absolutely phenomenal too. The power of release dates.  ~Bob Odenkirk joining FXX’s The Bear for Season Two is excellent news. No matter who he plays, the Better Call Saul master player will elevate one of the best television shows to come along in a good while. Succession and Barry are rhythmic sensations, but Christopher Storer’s raw and lucid kitchen drama is something else. Odenkirk will only enhance the goodness. Give this man good writing and it’s like watching a delicious cocktail being mixed in real time. ~Here’s the thing about The Flash and all the spoilers rolling out on Twitter after the first screening at Cinema Con this week: don’t act surprised. If you show people a movie that isn’t coming out for seven weeks and release them to their smartphones, plot twists and points are being distributed. Quietly, Warner Brothers loves this. The Ezra Miller-led superhero film needs all the good vibes it can generate after Miller’s off screen chaos.  In case you’ve lived under a rock for the past three years, Miller has been slapped with all kinds of charges, many of which stem from violence and hate. They, Miller’s preferred pronoun, own a large piece of land in Vermont, and have taken groups of people up there for parties and such. It didn’t go well. There have also been a series of altercations and assault accusations in public places with them. Miller is finally acting right, and this movie is coming out. Expect the kitchen sink of promotion. The studio doesn’t mind reviews like “the best superhero movie since Endgame,” or “holy shit, I believe in life again.” To me, it’s the DCEU’s restart button ripping a few pages from the Marvel notebook on how to reset a universe. I’m there for Michael Keaton’s older and wiser Batman. "
"Apr 27, 2023",positive," After his one-time rival Sonic became a box office hit, it seemed inevitable that Nintendo mascot Mario would get his own movie. Illumination, the animation studio behind Minions, will be hoping this animated adaptation fares better than the 1993 live action disaster with Bob Hoskins. Taking inspiration from 40 plus years of gaming history, The Super Mario Bros Movie centres on Mario and Luigi, voiced by Chris Pratt and Charlie Day. The Brooklyn plumbers embark onwhat seems like a routine job, only for Luigi to be sucked into another realm known as The Mushroom Kingdom. Mario arrives soon after, learning that Luigi has been kidnapped by Bowser (Jack Black), the maniacal leader of the Koopa Army. Teaming up with Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), he must fight Bowser to save the kingdom, and his sibling. The casting of Pratt as the traditionally Italian character was controversial but the film builds in a reason for his American accent, while still throwing in the odd “lets a-go!” along the way. This will no doubt enrage purists, but  this wacky quest is aiming to please audiences born after Mario had already become a console favourite. The colourful, creature-filled world of Mario is perfect for the animation genre, with potential for numerous spin-offs and sequels. But the script plays it safe with an unsurprising 90 minute romp. Whether it’s racing down rainbow roads or facing haunted mansions, there are lots of nostalgic moments that will make gamers smile. It doesn’t elevate the subject matter, but the target audience of families on Easter holidays won’t mind.  Pratt makes for a dependable lead who allows his supporting players to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Taylor-Joy’s Peach is a tough leader who stands beside Mario against Black’s villain, who is surprisingly menacing. The always-entertaining Keegan Michael Key as sidekick Toad, and the unmistakable tones of Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, both give well known characters a fresh coat of paint.  It’s a shame Day’s Luigi isn’t featured as much, given he’s fun than his co-star. The Super Mario Bros Movie is ultimately a film intended for kids, and in that regard it provides enough laughsto make this another success for Illumination. Older fans might be disappointed in the surface-level storytelling, but it’s hard not to smile at the affection shown for the games’ legacy."

"Apr 25, 2023",negative," ¿Se nos alecciona ya y cada vez más a generar y consumir exclusivamente cine hecho a la medida, que no cuestione ni se salga del margen?..."
"Apr 25, 2023",neutral," Desde que comenzó a hacerse con, curiosamente, la delirante 'Super Mario Bros' de 1993, adaptar videojuegos a un medio narrativo pasivo, ya sea el cine o la televisión, se convirtió en poco menos que una actividad de riesgo marcada por la sucesión de batacazos creativos. Una dinámica que, por suerte, comenzó a cambiar con el paso de los años hasta desembocar en joyas como la reciente 'The Last of Us' de HBO. Uno de los retos más desafiantes que se enfrentan al gestar este tipo de producciones se esconde en el delicado equilibrio que debería existir entre el fanservice destinado a deleitar a los aficionados al material original, los añadidos que expandan su universo y enriquezcan a sus personajes y, en última instancia, una narrativa de calidad que trascienda a la de de sus contrapartidas jugables. El caso de 'Super Mario Bros: La película' es un claro ejemplo de la dificultad que encierra encontrar este balance y trasladar una franquicia de este calado a la gran pantalla; ofreciendo una suerte de sueño hecho realidad para los parroquianos del fontanero bigotudo repleto de guiños, detalles y devoción, pero lastrado por unos cimientos narrativos lo suficientemente endebles como para enterrar sus encomiables esfuerzos por divertir sin complejos. Hay que reconocer que pocos títulos homólogos han logrado capturar tan bien la esencia de su material de referencia como 'Super Mario Bros: La película'. Este logro comienza por un diseño de producción y una factura técnica deslumbrantes que beben del pasado y el presente de la obra de Shigeru Miyamoto para ofrecer un espectáculo animado sólo al alcance de estudios como Illumination Entertainment. De este modo, el dúo de directores compuesto por Aaron Horvath y Michael Jelenic se las apaña para transportar al patio de butacas a un Reino Champiñón más vivo y colorido que nunca; todo ello mientras evoca el espíritu plataformero del videojuego en pasajes que parecen extraídos directamente de un gameplay —las escenas 2,5D son, sencillamente, magníficas—. A esto debemos sumar el que, por suerte o por desgracia, termina convirtiéndose en el leitmotiv y, a su vez, el gran reclamo de la función: un tsunami de easter-eggs y referencias ya no sólo al mundo de Mario, sino a Nintendo en general, que termina devorando el relato y que, en mi caso, resultó tremendamente indigesto pese a mi longeva simpatía por la licencia. Hubiese sido fantástico que, apuntalando esta oda a la compañía nipona, existiese una historia ya no interesante o profunda, sino mínimamente trabajada. En su lugar, nos encontramos con una trama tan esquelética como un Dry Bones, un sentido del humor de parvulario —recordemos que esta película adapta una franquicia de con 35 años a sus espaldas y con un espectro de público potencial muy amplio— y un desarrollo de personajes nulo. Algo especialmente sorprendente si tenemos en cuenta que Horvath y Jelenic son responsables de la magnífica 'Teen Titans Go!' catódica. Por supuesto, en este punto, muchos podrían rebatir mi opinión con un socorrido ""qué esperabas"", a lo que puedo contestar, simple y llanamente, con ""una película"". Porque, a última hora, 'Super Mario Bros: La película' no deja de ser una suerte de cinemática estirada, mucho más hueca de lo deseable y tristemente decepcionante en términos generales. Pero esto no quiere decir que sus ajustadísimos 90 minutos de duración no cumplan con su cometido de entretener entre sucesiones incesantes de gags, secuencias de montaje que intentan aportar algo de pegamento entre escenas inconexas —incluyendo un entrenamiento al ritmo de 'I Need a Hero' como colmo de la pereza creativa— y un reparto de voces original en su salsa —tremendo Jack Black—. Simplemente, significa que todos los que queramos un largometraje a la altura del legado de Mario, Luigi y compañía, tendremos que seguir esperando. Con suerte, no serán otros 30 años."
"Apr 24, 2023",positive," If you didn’t have a Nintendo Game Boy with Super Mario Brothers or Tetris automatically installed you were not one of the cool kids.  And…before that you had to hit the video arcade and play hoping you didn’t run out of change before beating your own record or someone else’s.  In the world of video games you were your own personal hero.  So, when Illumination Studios announced they were bringing Super Mario Brothers to the big screen, this girl over here was beside herself. While working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt) and brother Luigi (Charlie Day) are transported down a mysterious pipe wandering into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario is on a mission to find Luigi. With the assistance of a Mushroom Kingdom resident Toad (Keegan Michael-Key) and some training from the strong-willed ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Mario taps into his own power. Baby, you are not ready when first five minutes, put you right back into the game and being 12 years-old, while illustrating a love letter to Brooklyn. However, I will say that most of these video game movies have a tendency to run a little on the long side while providing beautiful animation.  Not to mention, that with this one, there are s few inconsistent screenplay slip ups.  Like Princess Peach proclaiming to not know Mario then moments later treating him like an old friend.  For adults, this was confusing.  For the kids watching, I doubt they will notice or even care. Bruiser (Jack Black) and his ballad for Princess Peach not only made me giggle out loud, but stuck in my head on a loop! Loved the talking toad and the whole Moby Dick vibe with a bit of Smash Gorilla mixed in for measure. Many critics will lament about how this film didn’t resonate with them.  They might have to duke it out with the gang of kids sitting behind me at recent media screening, who repeatedly howled with laughter throughout. Just saying. With its message to siblings everywhere of nothing can hurt us as long as we’re together,  The Super Mario Brothers movie is endearing, great fun for families to ingest and enjoy."
"Apr 24, 2023",positive,"Mario delivers on looks and nostalgia, and whilst there is enough for adults and kids to enjoy here, a deeper story seems to have been kept in another castle."
"Apr 22, 2023",positive,I'm not sure what high-art some of these critics are looking for but The Super Mario Bros. movie works for both fans of the long-lasting game franchise and people who want an entertaining escape. This is the best video game movie yet!
"Apr 21, 2023",positive," When ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" opened in theaters earlier this month, the experts were ready to count out the computer-animated film as another disposable video-game byproduct like the colossally awful, 1993 live-action take on the 1985 Nintendo game. Not so fast. Critics jeered, but audiences came in droves. Having already cleaned up with more than $700 million worldwide, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is now the biggest box-office hit of 2023, setting records for the largest global opening ever for an animated film. How far can it go? Do I hear a billion? Easy. What happened? Parents starved for family entertainment, that's what happened. There's also the fact that ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is way more fun even for non-gamers than skeptics predicted. Repeat business is off the charts. So get over your hesitation and jump aboard. Don't expect miracles. Even at 93 minutes, the movie can drift into dull and derivative. Still, I think it's an asset that ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is aimed at 5-year-olds of all ages, meaning the child in all of us. Look elsewhere, maybe ""Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,"" for winking adult references. It's the dedication to silliness that makes ""Mario"" such an impish delight. As directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, from a script by Matthew Fogel, the film doesn't even try to reinvent the genre. It only wants to capture enough of the joystick energy of the game to cover the sins of merch pedaling and thin plotting and characterization. Fears about ethnic stereotyping emerged from the voice casting of non-Italian Chris Pratt as Mario. Relax. Pratt uses his own voice to play the mustachioed Italian plumber in overalls. Ditto Charlie Day as his shy brother Luigi. Both put on exaggerated Italian accents in a TV ad for the bros' Brooklyn plumbing business, then revert to normal. Problem solved? Pretty much. Trouble starts immediately as Mario and Luigi go underground to fix a manhole leak and are sucked into a warp pipe that sends them into two separate universes. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy in fine, frisky form). Poor Luigi is zapped into the Dark Lands controlled by the evil King Koopa, Bowser, a kind of demonic turtle with red eyebrows who finds the perfect verbal pairing in wild man Jack Black. Bowser yearns for Princess Peach and will destroy her kingdom if she refuses to marry him. Mario, who is also hot for Peach, can't have that, plus he needs to rescue Luigi from Bowser and form an alliance with the Kong family of gorillas by showing that he -- even in a cat suit -- can win a fight with the king's son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen doing a great Seth Rogen). Got that? No matter. The plot is just a flimsy excuse to have these characters mix it up one more time on the big screen. Live action can't cut it. The first ""Mario"" movie proved that by staying rigidly earthbound. The real secret behind the unexpected and staggering success of ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is animation, which niftily catches the anarchy of gaming. It creates the illusion that anything is possible. It's also the next best thing to playing the actual game, which continues to thrive and multiply."
"Apr 21, 2023",positive," Super Mario Bros. is one of the world’s most beloved video game franchises, so it’s somewhat surprising it took 30 years for Mario and Luigi to return to the silver screen after their disastrous live-action film from 1993. Now Nintendo’s signature characters are back, starring in a beautifully animated feature film from Universal Pictures’ Illumination.  The action starts in New York City where Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) attempt to start their own plumbing business—without much success. The hapless brothers get sucked into a magic sewer pipe that deposits them in the fantasy world first introduced in the classic NES game from 1985.  The two brothers are separated, and the evil King Bowser (Jack Black) captures Luigi. Mario looks for friends in this strange land to help him rescue his brother. Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) acts as Mario’s guide, and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who’s trying to defend her kingdom from Bowser’s Koopa army, decides she and Mario should work together. Throw in Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) and some go-kart racing to juice up the gaming nostalgia. The Super Mario Bros. Movie will appeal to many parents and kids through a shared attachment to the characters. Adults with fond memories of dodging turtle shells in the ’80s and ’90s won’t mind watching the movie with their children, many of whom have dodged turtle shells in updated versions of those classic games. The studio should be applauded for keeping the story sweet and family friendly. The most progressive thing about this movie is that Mario and Peach must rescue Luigi rather than the boys needing to rescue the princess. There’s no attempt to grab adults’ attention with edgy humor. Instead, grown-ups can focus on identifying the countless Easter eggs packed into each scene. Despite its delights, the movie has its pitfalls. The script is paper thin, seemingly written to hit certain video-­game environments rather than create a satisfying story, and sometimes one scene jumps to the next without much sense of connection. The film also indulges in the clichéd admonition to believe in yourself even when no one else will. The cast contains numerous stars, but the voice work from Pratt and Taylor-Joy falls flat. On the other hand, Key’s Toad offers a couple of inspired moments, and Black’s Bowser has a couple of showstoppers. It’s hard not to compare The Super Mario Bros. Movie to The Lego Movie. Both star Chris Pratt, and both feature internationally beloved intellectual property. The Lego Movie is inventive, clever, and exceedingly funny, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie avoids risks, playing it safe and allowing nostalgia to do all the heavy lifting.  Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Apr 20, 2023",negative," ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" hits the ground running from its first frame, throwing video game and pop culture references at you with such relentless abandon that you're left gasping for air. It whizzes by at breakneck speed, so much so that it neglects to slow down and find an identity of its own. It won't take long for viewers to notice that the animated new release, which Universal Pictures plopped into thousands of multiplex screens on Wednesday to take full advantage of Easter weekend family crowds, is less a movie than a string of callouts and Easter eggs. It's engineered to elicit Pavlovian glee from multiple generations of viewers who grew up playing the video games featuring the titular siblings, first in video arcades and later on decades' worth of game consoles. But despite its compact running time (92 minutes, a throwback to a time when family films clocked in way south of the two-hour mark), the frisson of pleasure from catching all the Nintendo shout outs goes from amusing to grating pretty quickly. Viewers looking for a little narrative meat, or at the very least characters worth caring about, will likely walk away disheartened and dissatisfied. Memo to directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic: seeing corporate symbols go through the motions of a half-baked story isn't much fun. And it really didn't have to be this way. Illumination, the animation studio behind the “Despicable Me” and “Sing” movies, seemed to be a good fit to bring the adventures of spunky plumber Mario (the voice of Chris Pratt), his fragile and nervous baby bro/business partner Luigi (Charlie Day), no-nonsense Mushroom Kingdom ruler Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), comic-relief sidekick Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), and simian adversary Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) to the screen with the kid-friendly pizzazz the material begs for. Chris Pratt is Mario, a struggling Italian-American plumber, and Anya Taylor-Joy is the voice of Princess Peach in ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" (Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures). Sadly, the end result is trapped in an aesthetic tug of war between the cartoonish character design and the more photorealistic action that undermines the movie's appeal over and over again. It boggles the mind that the filmmakers took a look at this intellectual property and said, ""Yep, mind-numbing destruction porn is precisely what this material needs to make it pop."" ""Super Mario Bros."" makes its first mistake right out of the gate, with a prologue that tips its hat to Tolkien while draining the mystery and sense of wonder the movie could have possessed if it had allowed viewers to discover its magical realms through Mario and Luigi's eyes, “Wizard of Oz”-style. The very first shot shows chunks of lava falling on the ground like embers with the texture of feces, a harbinger of things to come. Bowser (Jack Black), a fire-breathing destroyer of worlds and, as screenwriter Matthew Fogel keeps reminding us, the king of the turtle-like Koopas, razes the ice castle of some cute anthropomorphic penguins to the ground in seconds, allowing the power-hungry antagonist to grab a star (think of a horcrux in the “Harry Potter” movies) that could potentially deliver the colorful Mushroom World, with its shades of Emerald City, into his paws. Jack Black is the voice of Bowser and Charlie Day is the voice of Luigi in ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" (Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures). ""Super Mario Bros."" then sends viewers to Brooklyn, where Mario and Luigi struggle to find customers for their plumbing services, to one-dimensional derision from a local bully and underdeveloped disappointment from their father. The joke here is that the stereotypical Italian accents are an act, something the brothers play up in their TV ad. Alas, like most of the movie's stabs at humor, it lands with a dull thud. The sole bright spot in this section is a sequence that shows Mario and Luigi dealing with an entitled dog while attempting to fix a leaky bathroom faucet in an upscale home. The canine in question is reminiscent of Illumination's successful but somewhat underappreciated “The Secret Life of Pets,” and some of the sight gags here suggest the movie that could have been if Horvath and Jelenic weren't so hellbent on jamming their reference checklist down viewers' throats. Wandering into what seems like an abandoned building in an attempt to fix a water main rupture, Mario and Luigi are whisked into an alternate dimension via what looks and feels like a wormhole. The inseparable brothers are split up in the process, and it's up to Mario to save the day. The vertically challenged New Yorker with the paintbrush mustache seeks help from Princess Peach and embarks on a journey that will bring the ultimate test of his character. Problem is, the movie zips from one scene to the next without leaving much of an impression, prioritizing its parade of artifacts over the brothers' fierce bond and the characters' respective arcs. Viewers impressed by how closely the characters look to the way they do in the games may not mind how the movie squanders its potential at just about every turn. Maybe they should care, because the word that comes to mind when reflecting on the artistic commitment on display is lazy. And the void at the center of this shiny fan-service trinket is Pratt, a woefully uninspired choice to voice Mario. The “Guardians of the Galaxy” star is just as generic as he appears in the trailers and is an all too appropriate representation of how unremarkable this movie is. (Day, by contrast, acts circles around his co-star, but his character is given short shrift, sidelined for far too long.) Joy and Rogen do what they can, but the writing simply does not give them much to work with, leaving Black to chew the scenery while neglecting to flesh out his lust for domination and unrequited feelings toward Peach. A widely lambasted 1993 live-action adaptation of the games, unseen by me, starred Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi and Dennis Hopper as Bowser. It was dismissed as bizarre and nonsensical at the time of its release, but it's clear the older film's directors, Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton, opted against playing it safe the way the new production does. But credit should be given where it is due, and for several enjoyable minutes, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” comes to life when it pays tribute to “Super Mario Kart.” Instead of a race track, Mario and the other drivers glide across a rainbow speedway, with visual cues from the “Mad Max” movies and, for older viewers, Blake Edwards' “The Great Race.” The sequence's DayGlo hues stand out in sharp relief to the dearth of creativity to which the film frequently falls prey. This synthetic and half-hearted concoction made a killing at the box office this weekend, to the tune of an estimated $204.6 million in its first five days of release in North America, but it fails to fire up the imagination. Hobbled by wafer-thin characters, a shell of a boilerplate narrative and cringe-inducing needle drops, it settles for giving mass audiences of various age groups what they want, and that's just depressing. It amounts to insipid gamer catnip with nothing to say, when it could have been so much more. Can I have my quarters back?

"Apr 20, 2023",positive,"Encapsulates charming classic video game characters within a fun, yet generic, plot that has a cult-classic worthy song stuffed in the middle and doesn’t overstay its welcome."
"Apr 19, 2023",positive," Ever since Mario, the over-confident plumber from Brooklyn, and his dopey brother, Luigi, made it big in 8 bits back in the 1980s, the world of video games — and the Mushroom Kingdom — has never been the same. But few video games have taken the world of film by storm. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the new collaboration between Universal Pictures and Illumination, is a beautifully animated and amusing but mostly empty film that will provide catnip for hardcore gamers and Nintendo devotees but not much in terms of a story for casual fans. When the adventure begins, Mario is struggling to find a purpose at home. The mustachioed plumber is voiced by Chris Pratt, and that is the film’s first problem. Pratt is funny as far as animation goes, but when Mario first learned to speak it was when he turned himself into 64 bits in Super Mario 64 and was voiced by Charles Martinet. “It’s a-me, Mario!” may have been the single most important phrase in the history of video games, and while Martinet appears in various supporting voice roles in this film, the choice to give the lead to Pratt exposes what the studio really cares about — profits instead of fans. Accordingly, the rest of the familiar characters, from Luigi and Princess Peach to Toad and Bowser himself are also voiced by Hollywood heavyweights — Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, Keegan-Michael Key, and Jack Black, respectively. This star-studded voice cast is meant to appeal to mainstream audiences rather than fans of the games, which would be fine if the approach wasn’t totally at odds with the rest of the movie. In screenwriter Matthew Fogel‘s version of the story, Mario and Luigi head down the wrong pipe and find themselves lost in the mysterious Mushroom Kingdom, where Princess Peach rules, anthropomorphic creatures like Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) abound, and the evil Bowser wants to take over with the help of his wizard adviser Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson). This is similar to the story told in the original cartoons featuring these famous characters, which is fine as far as it goes, as is the conceit of Luigi’s disappearance, which is the plot of at least a couple of the Mario games that don’t put the Princess in peril. The more original plot element here is the concept of Mario having to find his power — his firepower, his raccoon/Tanooki power, and other abilities he has gained throughout the decades and the consoles, though even that device is well-worn within the modern comic book movie. Soon, Mario, guided by Peach and Toad, is off on his multilevel adventure to stop the evil Bowser. At every stop, Fogel and Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic make sure to insert Easter Eggs (’tis the season!) and cute references to plot points in the dozens of games that the devoted Mario Bros. disciples have played to exhaustion. The whimsical, playful score by Composers Koji Kondo and Brian Tyler is a definite highlight almost from the get-go, considering that the former is the brilliant creative talent behind most of the music in the console versions of this colorful world, as well as the Legend of Zelda franchise. Mario and his buddies encounter a bevy of characters that range from cute (the little penguins that showed up in Mario 64) to menacing, and there are mini-games and vignettes like the Mario Kart racing scene that make the movie feel at times like an extended round of Mario Party. As in the Mario games, you know the outcome even if they do the whole “the Princess is in another castle” routine for a while. But it feels more satisfying to get even to a predictable resolution when you have to work hard for it, and the reward is in the journey. When you are being spoon-fed the steps to get to the finale in a multiplex, it seems infinitely duller. If it sounds like I’m down on The Super Mario Bros. movie, it is only because I’m a tremendous, lifelong fan of these characters and the various products that bear their names. Mario always finds a way to reinvent and reassert himself via new adventures, stronger challenges, and more textual worlds. The film, by contrast, appears lost amidst a sea of superhero adventures, and never quite finds its footing as something anyone except the diehards should care about. In fact, even the video game can actually end in “game over” for a player who’s unable to surpass a certain obstacle. In Hollywood, by contrast, the only thing that actually signals “the end” is a post-credit scene, which, of course, this film features, too. Ultimately, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a terrible exemplification of a studio resting on the laurels of the popularity of a brand rather than expending any real creative effort. This approach is a startling and disappointing one to have connected to a franchise that has been persistently and rightfully successful because of its indelible work ethic and endless creativity. After the colossal failure of the 1993 live-action movie, Nintendo was understandably reluctant to go back to the well of feature films. After all, it didn’t need the money, nor the boost to Mario’s core product — video games — which are already wildly successful. The company’s skepticism was proven correct in this instance, for however well-intentioned The Super Mario Bros. Movie is, and no matter how much I sincerely hope for a sequel, the film’s ultimate execution makes you wish that someone at Universal or Illumination had taken out the cartridge, blown on it like a hot pizza, and pressed the reset button at some point in the process."
"Apr 19, 2023",positive," Everyone is familiar with Super Mario Bros. in some capacity, so it's no surprise THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE is banking at the box office. Itsa time to dig into all the discussion surrounding this one, right here with your friends at MAM."
"Apr 19, 2023",positive," Those Gen-Z brothers from Brooklyn, Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), plumbers in this world, superheroes in the Mushroom Kingdom, star in their own big screen adaptation, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (“Teen Titans Go! To the Movies”) which will appeal most to fans of the video games and young kids. The animation is so true to the Nintendo franchise that you may feel lost without a controller, and for the grownups, the soundtrack features AC/DC, a-ha, Bonnie Tyler, and of course Beastie Boys’ “No Sleep Till Brooklyn.” What about the accents? When the film’s trailer arrived, fans were concerned with Chris Pratt’s casting as Mario, who up until this point was known for saying “Mama mia!” and “It’s-a-me, Mario!” in a heavy Italian accent. Good news. The brothers’ accents are there (kind of), at least for their television commercial as they try and attract customers by using exaggerated accents to highlight their heritage. FYI: It’s not working. So, Pratt and Charlie Day’s Luigi speak in their regular voices in the film. Perfect casting as far as Day is concerned. While trying to repair a broken water main in the city, the brothers are sucked into a pipe that jettisons them into an alternate universe. Mario lands in the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom, filled with colorful pipes, golden power-up blocks, floating brown bricks, and human-mushroom hybrid citizens called toads, their unofficial leader, also named Toad is voiced by Keegan-Michael Key. However, the kingdom is ruled by the very human Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) who lives in a Disney-like castle. Meanwhile, Luigi ends up in the scary Dark Lands which gamers will associate with “Luigi’s Mansion,” the video game that helped launch the GameCube in 2001. Luigi gets captured and is held prisoner by the film’s villain Bowser, a fierce Godzilla-like turtle with fire-breathing capability who intends to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom unless Princess Peach agrees to become his bride. Jack Black gives 110% in a vocal performance that includes hammy songs written by Bowser to woo the princess. The actor-comedian’s personality comes blazing through as the leader of the Koopas. As news of Bowser’s imminent attack reaches Peach, she and Mario enlist the help of the Kongs ruled by Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) who agrees to lend his army to the cause if Mario can defeat his son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan) in a battle. Rogan, by far delivers the funniest vocal performance and the battle scene with Mario is one of the best moments in the animated film as Mario becomes Cat Mario (a power-up that gives our hero cat-like reflexes plus he looks adorable in what looks like kitty pajamas). The film’s best scene is the exciting “Mad Max” race sequence straight from the Mario Kart games as the characters race in customized souped-up go-carts which will have you scrambling for a controller. It feels like you’ve rented out the theater to play the game.“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is primarily for fans of the Nintendo games or young children who may become new fans of the franchise. It’s a safe family film with nothing risqué (no adult humor) or too violent. If you’re not familiar with video games, there’s little here that will spark your interest. Older moviegoers may compare it to the 1993 live-action film “Super Mario Bros.” which stars Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi. It’s cheesy, over the top, and many fans of the games consider it an abomination. I enjoyed it in a “so bad it’s good” kind of way plus Dennis Hopper’s outrageous performance is entertaining. Still, it had little to do with the franchise created by Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.

"Apr 19, 2023",neutral," One of my favourite childhood memories is growing up playing the classic Super Mario Bros. game back in the ’90s. It was a fun video game that allows me to navigate Mario through different stages, running and jumping over the terrain, knocking down enemies (Goombas and Koopa Troopas are some of the villains that quickly come to mind) and of course, hitting the coin blocks that may give the player coins or a mushroom power-up. The latter gives Mario a temporary special ability to transform himself into a bigger size. So, when Hollywood decided to adapt Super Mario Bros. into a big-screen adventure, I was looking forward to seeing whether they can pull off the first-ever live-action video game movie. The 1993 movie of the same name boasts the right casting decision of enlisting (the late) Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo to play the iconic Brooklyn plumbers of the Mario brothers. But the husband-and-wife directing team Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel made a colossal mistake of re-imagining the video game’s otherwise bright and colourful vibes into a surprisingly bizarre and gritty version. The word “faithful” was certainly thrown out of the window, resulting in one of the worst video game movies ever made that Hoskins himself labelled Super Mario Bros. a f*****’ nightmare a few years later. For those who have seen the 1993 movie, you may or may not recall the ending where Samantha Mathis’ Princess Daisy shows up at the front door of Mario and Luigi’s apartment asking them to help her on a new mission. That “new mission” would have paved way for a sequel if it wasn’t for the first film’s critical and financial debacle. It would take the popular Nintendo video game series not a few years but rather almost 30 years later to finally come up with a new Super Mario Bros. movie after the notorious 1993 flop made its debut back in May 1993. So, here we are — The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which arrived in a computer-generated animated form rather than a live-action take just like the 1993 version or even a live-action/CGI hybrid seen in the first two Sonic the Hedgehog movies. At the time of writing, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has already made over US$700 million in just two weeks and still counting. But as usual, the mammoth size of its box-office earnings this far doesn’t always equal quality and I hate to say that The Super Mario Bros. Movie happens to be one of them. I have high hopes for this new movie after seeing how faithful it has shown in the trailer, which successfully captured the look and feel of a Super Mario Bros. video game. The story — credited to Matthew Fogel, who previously wrote the formulaic Minions: The Rise of Gru last year — however, falters the most. I get that the movie may have been designed for kids and as family-friendly entertainment. And I understand the story shouldn’t have to be complicated or something that resembled “Oscar-winning material”, considering the video game series itself is a straightforward fantasy adventure. Keeping it simple and accessible is the way to go and while it does strike a chord among many audiences who have already seen it, I wish I could share the same sentiment. But this is a movie we are talking about and not a video game I have a joypad in my hands to control the player (Mario, that is) throughout the journey. Without the interactive nature of a video game, it has to rely entirely on the actors, screenwriter and director — in this case of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we have co-directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic of the sadly underappreciated Teen Titans Go! To the Movies fame — to bring the movie to life. Problem is, The Super Mario Bros. Movie plays it too safe for its own good: We first see Brooklyn plumbers Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) has been struggling to start their own business even after they made a commercial. Then one day, their opportunity arises when a broken water main made the headline, prompting the Mario brothers to fix it. While working underground in the sewer, they find themselves sucked into the mysterious green pipe that leads them into a fantastical realm. Mario ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom while Luigi got separated and captured by Bowser’s (Jack Black) minions. As Mario tries to make sense of the Mushroom Kingdom, he met a few characters along the way, namely Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). The latter turns out to be the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, where Mario and the princess agree to help each other to save Luigi and also her kingdom from Bowser. Well, that’s about it. The entire movie is basically about saving Luigi and the Mushroom Kingdom and of course, defeating Bowser and his minions. Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic’s overall direction is more dutiful rather than bringing a sense of creativity and inspiration into the movie. I don’t mean something as misguided as the one seen in the 1993 version but at least, it helps to step up a few notches above in terms of storytelling. Fogel’s screenplay is as utterly predictable and banal as it gets. I find it hard to care about Mario and Luigi’s fates throughout their treacherous journey into the unknown since these characters are more like charisma-free, walking-and-talking avatars than someone with distinct personalities, unlike Hoskins and Leguizamo who actually did a better job nearly thirty years ago. It also doesn’t help when Chris Pratt’s voice performance as Mario, who barely sounds like an Italian while Charlie Day’s Luigi is mostly undermined throughout the movie. There are a few things I do like about The Super Mario Bros. Movie, though. The animation is vibrant and colourful as it should be and I love how everything looks game-accurate from its character designs to the various backgrounds reminiscent of the Super Mario video game worlds. Fans, in the meantime, will have a field day spotting plenty of Easter eggs and references, covering Punch-Out Pizzeria to the Super Mario veteran Charles Martinet’s recognisable voice acting and the brief sight of Donkey Kong’s brother, Diddy Kong from Donkey Kong Country, just to name a few. Credits also go to Horvath and Jelenic for painstakingly re-creating some of the familiar moments from the game. This includes the Super Mario Bros. 2 training montage revolving around Princess Peach and Mario, the one-on-one Mario vs. Donkey Kong battle and the Rainbow Road chase setpiece straight out of the Mario Kart game. Interestingly enough, the supporting cast steals most of the show here with Anya Taylor-Joy’s feisty turn as Princess Peach and Keegan-Michael Key’s hilariously deadpan role as Toad both deserve equal mention. Jack Black’s scenery-chewing antagonist character Bowser is a spot-on casting choice and we even get to see him performing the now-popular piano-laden “Peaches” song. Not to mention the familiar sound effects and musical motifs from the Super Mario video game that can be heard throughout the movie. Don’t forget to stick around for the mid-credits and particularly the post-credits scene. Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has a few worthwhile moments but it wasn’t enough to overcome the sheer banality of its storyline. Here’s hoping the inevitable sequel can improve better in this area."
"Apr 19, 2023",positive,"The script may be thin, but getting to spend 90 minutes in this world of Mario certainly put a smile on my face and made me feel like a kid again."
"Apr 18, 2023",positive," “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is smart and emotionally nostalgic. It’s also a simple and easily digestible animated film that will entertain viewers, young and old, with a fresh adventure.


Chances are if you’re a Gen X or Millennial parent, then you have some familiarity with two Italian, overall-wearing brothers who collect coins, eat mushrooms and fly through green pipes like they’re slick as water. Mario and Luigi were a staple of many pre-Y2K childhoods. Now they are returning to the big screen with an animated film that bundles up every iconic turn the pair have taken into a short, but sweet jaunt through Mushroom Kingdom and beyond.



Classic characters
Produced by Despicable Me-mainstay Illumination Entertainment and from a script by “Minions: The Rise of Gru” writer Matthew Fogel, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” reimagines the siblings as Brooklyn plumbers. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) stumble upon a portal that spits them into a magical world filled with mushroom people and spear-wielding turtles. Minus Yoshi, all of our old avatars are here: Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) rules over her pint-sized mushroom-capped subjects. This includes brave and loyal Toad (Keegan-Michael Key); Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) and his chest-thumping son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) oversees their own kingdom of monkeys.



The crux
It is Bowser (Jack Black), the fearsome, spiky-shelled King Koopa, who threatens the balance of the mystical worlds. He has captured a beloved Super Star, an energy force that allows him supreme power and destructive capabilities. Mario must team up with the princess and crew to save her world and prevent kingdom-wide devastation.


The Super Mario Bros. Movie, despite having the heavy prerequisite of rebuilding these many fictional worlds, reestablishing the characters, and fitting in the many inside jokes and hidden treasures sourced from the various video game iterations over the years, manages to do it all. The backlash at Pratt’s casting was all for naught. He rules as Mario, and Black’s spirited Bowser keeps his sharp-toothed bite with a charmingly brainless underbelly. Kids are sure to be enchanted by the various colorful, sometimes frightening lands. The plot requires no attention span to follow.

No gaming experience necessary
If you don’t have any previous experience with Mario in video game form, there is still plenty of comedy and delightful action to keep both child and parent engaged. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is concise, but packed with wholesome jokes in line with what you’d expect from an Illumination creation. Think anthropomorphic dogs, ironic pairings like a small penguin with an unnaturally deep voice, and an overarching approach to animation that focuses on symmetrical, round, attractive features.


It is particularly fun, however, to have knowledge of the video game and experience behind the console to fully appreciate the Mario Kart allusions. It’s also helpful to have some experience so you too can chuckle at the various jokes informed by a collective experience shared by an entire generation of former players. You don’t have to blow the dust out of this cartridge; Mario is ready to jump, high kick and spin back into action. Let’s-a-go!


Cut to the chase:
MPAA Rating: PG for action and mild violence


Recommended Age: 6+


Runtime: 92 minutes


Nightmare inducers: When Bowser first joins the scene, he is spiky, menacing, and in midair on a floating lava prison. His appearance, coupled with his cruel treatment of his opponents, is sure to initially frighten those who are easily scared. Luckily, he is softened as the film progresses and is a far less sinister villain. By the film’s end, he’s belting out love ballads and proving not nearly as invincible as he seemed in the final battle on N64.


Difficult concepts or emotions: There aren’t many hard-to-grasp ideas floating in this film. Good and evil are clearly designated, and there is no outcome that is totally unexpected. There also are no concepts that will confuse or overwhelm young ones.

"Apr 17, 2023",positive," There’s no doubt that the new box-office champ is “The Super Mario Bros. Mo vie,” a computer-animated comedy adventure. Based on the popular video game, this family-friendly film has redeemed the Nintendo franchise’s reputation after its catastrophic 1993 live-action movie adaptation. Scripted by Matthew Fogel and directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, it’s the hectic origin story for mustached Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and his younger brother Luigi (voiced by Charlie Day).  They’re New York plumbers who decide to start their own business, even as they’re mocked by their former boss, Spike (voiced by Sebastian Maniscalco). At first. they’re ridiculed for making a television commercial in which they speak with fake Italian accents, but then they descend into the sewer in an attempt fix a broken water main beneath the streets of Brooklyn. Suddenly, timid Luigi tumbles down a mysterious pipe and disappears. Immediately, Mario dives in after him, only to discover he’s arrived in the magical Mushroom Kingdom. Befriended by Toad (voiced by Keegan Michael-Kay), Mario is determined to rescue Luigi from the Dark Lands, where he’s in the clutches of evil, fire-breathing Bowser (voiced by Jack Black), the ferocious, gap-toothed  turtle leader of the Koopas, who plan to conquer the entire Mushroom Kingdom. So Mario teams up with the Kingdom’s Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy) – which infuriates lovesick Bowser who is utterly infatuated with her – and then Mario must face off against Donkey Kong (voiced by Seth Rogen), cheered on by his dad, Cranky Kong (voiced by Fred Armisen). It all adds up to 90 minutes of spirited fun, particularly for gamers who can spot the Nintendo-referencing Easter eggs placed for their psychedelic enjoyment.  As Mario says, “Let’s-a-go!” FYI: Universal Studios’ theme parks’ ‘Super Nintendo World’ is a whopping triumph with early entry tickets sold out every day since it opened on Feb. 17. And the telephone number blasted in Mario & Luigi’s TV commercial is (917) 555-0185; ‘917’ is the area code for New York City’s five boroughs, while ‘555’ is a famous fictional number used for many TV commercials."
"Apr 16, 2023",neutral," Universal and Nintendo’s animated collaboration brings the venerable Super Mario Bros videogame series to cinemas for the first time since 1993’s abortive live-action effort starring Bob Hoskins. Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (Teen Titans Go) the film presents a mish-mash of popular characters and situations drawn from Nintendo’s long-running franchise of games, animated by Chris Meledandri’s hugely successful studio Illumination (Despicable Me). The film has certainly struck a cord with a mass audience, since its grossed more than half a billion in its first two weeks. The critical response has been less enthusiastic, of course. It is easy to dismiss the critics, since The Super Mario Bros Movie is clearly not made for an adult audience. Going by the pre-teen viewers with whom I watched the film today, it is hitting its target pretty well. Familiar characters behave in familiar ways, and there is a pleasing consistency in watching Mario jump between platforms, Donkey Kong throw barrels, and Luigi cower in fear in a haunted mansion. Bottom line? If you’re a kid who spends half your time on a Nintendo Switch and the other half watching cartoons, there is plenty in Super Mario Bros to satisfy. If you’re the parent of such a kid, who are you to tell them what they should and shouldn’t be enjoying? Ultimately, however, is it fair to dismiss critical opinion? On the one hand there is a tendency for many film reviewers, critics, and academics to either ignore or underrate children’s cinema. On the other, some of the very best feature films ever made were produced with children in mind. The Super Mario Bros Movie is bright and colourful, wonderfully animated, and amusing in fits and starts, and a perfectly reasonable way to spend 90 minutes entertaining a child during school holiday time. Does it stand up against a children’s classic like The Wizard of Oz, The Dark Crystal, The Lion King, or My Neighbor Totoro? Of course not, but then again how many films do? As might be expected – mainly because this is almost always the case – the faults lie in the screenplay. It is credited to Matthew Fogel, although like most animated features the storyline was almost certainly developed by committee. It does not adapt an existing story so much as a style and a character set. Mario is one of the most lucrative and widely-known pieces of intellectual property from the past half century, but what actually created his success was innovative gameplay, and not plot or character. There is a pleasing simplicity to Nintendo’s characters, and a valuable superficiality that removes a need to explain a human princess being kidnapped from mushroom people by a fire breathing lizard and a pack of anthropomorphic turtles. So how do you explain it in a narrative feature? Two choices are clear: either warp the existing characters into a narrative and world that makes some kind of internal sense, or warp a narrative and world to accommodate a disparate set of characters. The 1993 Super Mario Bros movie, which was directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, definitely took the former approach and that partially led to its commercial failure (the other part being that it is so jaw-droppingly poor that some film enthusiasts are actively trying to bestow it with cult status). Horvath and Jelenic’s take goes the opposite way, and is perfectly satisfied to take the shortest, most superficial routes to justify its string of videogame tribute sequences. There is a third option: a much more complicated middle route that carefully stitches together disparate elements and instills them with depth and heart. In 1979 James Frawley’s The Muppet Movie managed to take popular variety/sketch series The Muppet Show and establish them for the first time in a real world context. It not only honoured the anarchic humour of the Muppet characters, but successfully wove them into a three-act narrative for the first time and gave them an emotional resonance that their TV escapades never required. Entirely by coincidence I recently rewatched this film, and was struck all over again by just how effectively its key elements were adjusted to shift from one media to another. The care taken in its development and production is why The Muppet Movie is still a five-star masterpiece, and The Super Mario Bros Movie is at best a three-star diversion. There is clearly a mass audience for whom Mario works, and honestly good for them, and I suspect it works via a pleasing recognition of and nostalgia for the original videogames. When Mario runs along a two-dimensional obstacle course it has a pleasing effect because it reminds us of how great the original Super Mario Bros and its sequel games were. When an army of Koopas descend on the heroes in a frantic kart chase, it reminds us of the fun we have had played against one another in Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, and their various follow-ups. This carefully engineered nostalgia is emphasised by Brian Tyler’s loud, emphatic score that cribs relentlessly (thankfully with on-screen credit) from original games composer Koji Kondo. As a creative work the movie honestly disappoints; it fact it positively flounders. As a carefully engineered piece of corporate IP it is difficult to fault. It is so bright, so energetic, and so completely and cynically manufactured. The difference between art and commerce is vividly clear in the film’s English language voice cast, which includes Jack Black, Anya Taylor-Joy, and – most divisively – Chris Pratt as the titular Mario. To be clear, no one sounds bad or distracting, but at the same time no one particularly stands out. They have been cast for their names and prestige rather than their talent. They are a dot point on a middle manager’s marketing summary, designed to hook an audience quadrant in to giving the film a chance. The emphasis in casting is not on what works, but what sells. To be completely honest, it’s not the film itself that disappoints me, but rather Nintendo’s co-production of it. For the past 50 years or so Nintendo has been among the highest echelons of videogame design. Its reputation for quality has been the result of rigorous quality standards. The company has a well-earned reputation for delaying releases until they are in the best possible shape they are in, based on designer (and Mario creator) Shigeru Miyamoto’s oft-quoted claim that ‘a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad’. When Morton and Jankel’s Super Mario film failed, Nintendo famously pulled any chance of Hollywood adapting their properties on an indefinite basis. That this new attempt even exists is down to a personal encounter between Miyamoto and Meledandri, and their mutual agreement to take another crack at Mario on the big screen. Their end result is certainly more competent, but given the standards of Nintendo the gaming company competent really should be exceptional. Nintendo design and release some of the highest quality games in the world. Given they are listed alongside Universal Pictures on this film, and Miyamoto is a credited producer (not executive or associate – an actual on-the-ground producer), it is on Nintendo’s brand that the film should be just as good. Given the commercial success here, it’s as good as certain that we will be seeing spin-offs and sequels for many years to come, not to mention similar attempts at The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Nintendo’s other key franchises. It seems equally inevitable that they will be very successful and, to put in plainly, not very interesting. Did I go and see this movie because Chris Pratt and Jack Black were in it? No I didn’t. I saw it because it was a Mario movie. I’m 44 years old. Am I outside the target audience? Absolutely. Am I alone in my opinion? Not even close. I am a realist though and I had real concerns for this for many of the same reasons as you, video game movies are often very bad. So with some hesitation and my expectations being slightly better than the original Mario Bros movie, I took a chance. Here is my assessment of your review. You focus too much on who is in it and why they were cast as well as piddly things like Nintendo being an executive producer … FOR A MARIO MOVIE! Of course they are producers, are you daft? You didn’t like it (oh it’s fine) and you think Nintendo movies are uninteresting. Then stop reviewing my favorite movies! This movie had so many fun Easter eggs specifically designed to call out the great history of Mario that people for generations love. A true Legend of Zelda movie sounds fantastic. A movie adaptation of Metroid could be amazing. You think this movie was meh at best? Look at the audience score. You are a bit out of touch dude. We fans want this. and at the end of the day, fans will make this a thing. And if Nintendo doesn’t deliver, that will be one thing. This was an AMAZING movie. And for you to have missed that means you are just another critic who hates movies. Do me a favor and fade into obscurity. You make movie critics look bad. Honestly it’s great that you enjoyed it, and clearly with box office approaching a billion dollars it’s clear many others do. And as I noted up-front, it’s a perfectly fine movie and does its job. I’m just very surprised that with Nintendo’s huge reputation for quality it wasn’t better. And I promise you there isn’t a critic alive that actually hates movies. No one goes into a cinema for two hours actively wanting something to suck. The trick to reading critics is to find the ones who like what you like, and keep reading them. Here’s the problem with that. Lately critic have been dumping on great movies like this saying it is lackluster for one reason or another and making movies and series fail as a result. I’m not saying that you have to like a movie, but look at the score. 96% audience score says it’s great. In this case, we likely will get a sequel or another in the Nintendo franchises despite critic like you pooping on it. I was being a little facetious about the critics hate movies comment, but I was trying to make a point. I’m tired of seeing movies and series fail as a result of movie critics claiming it isn’t a good movie when the audience says it’s great. I’m also tired of crappy movies getting critical acclaim and succeeding as a result when the audience hates the movie. You happen to be the first “rotten tomato” that I saw and I wanted to see what you wrote. You were surprised the quality wasn’t better? Audience score of 96% disagrees with you there. This is why moviegoers are starting to hate critics. You give our favorite movies crappy reviews. You say it was not the movie that you were disappointed in … BUT YOU ARE REVIEWING THE MOVIES! You say you were upset that it wasn’t higher quality having Nintendo involved. If you actually look at the movie, you will see the opposite is true. Nintendo gave illumination the green light to go with it. Sure they probably had a hand in suggestions as they do. But after the flop that was Mario Bros 1993, can you blame them? Your statement destroys from your review. The actors were picked because of popularity and not talent? I say again, 96% disagree. The voice acting was pretty great. I was unsure how I felt about Jack Black as Bowser, but he pulled it off. All the other voices were great too. Chris Pratt wouldn’t have been my first choice for Mario but he did well enough. You weren’t the worst critique of the movie, just the first one I clicked on when trying to find out why the critics hated this movie when the audience loved it. You say that you are happy I enjoyed it, but we still have the issue of criticism destroying the possibilities of the future. Think about wether it delivers to the fans and does a good job at it. The answer is yes it does 100%. This movie doesn’t deserve a low critic score. Anything below a 7 doesn’t make sense. Your critique tells me you weren’t vested in this movie and were already judging it before you sat down to watch it. You were already uninterested before it started. If you are uninterested in a movie, it wasn’t made for you and you shouldn’t criticize it because you will have a skewed view. Nintendo isn‘t exactly known for publishing games with innovative stories (e.g. mario kart or any super mario bros game). I mean you even mentioned it yourself. Animation-quality wise, the film is undeniably perfect, so clearly you‘re just looking for faults because you think the film is just a cash-grab or a calculated nostalgia trip for fans.  RT’s binary rotten/fresh system only takes you so far. It’s why I don’t assign scores or stars to movies in the actual reviews, because I think they’re ultimately unhelpful. This one is a 5/10 film in my opinion, which is therefore “rotten” – but it’s a fair way more enjoyable than a 2/10 movie. I believe you that you’re not just the target for this movie, which is fine, but that is having you be biased towards the review, hence giving it a bad score. What is sad about it is that when you look for scores online is that your review, will stand out more than others. Even if is just subjective like in this case. Couldn’t the super-fans here accept the fact that some peoples might criticize this movie without being monstruous being? This is getting ridiculous. None of you actually adress actual elements of the critic made here. Instead, you are complaining about the fact that a “child movie” shouldn’t be badly rated, because it is for children… What a laughable argument when you consider the diversity of Pixar, Ghibli and other “kids movies” that actually can adress grown-up problematics and create somptuous setting without burrying themselves in non-ending goofiness, nor by throwing cultural references at the face of the spectator for an hour and half. The movie has some great ideas, but is so fast-paced and willing to show us his comitment to the video-game that it ends up being disappointing. The kart-centric Kong society, the struggling Mario Brothers and their relationship with their family and themselves, the antagonistic relationship between Mario and Donkey-Kong, the hopeless love of Bowser for Peach, the exploration and wonder one could have discovering this strange, new world… So many possibilities that could have been deepened to create a tounching movie, but who were ultimately left-away, because we absolutely have to show everything from the game in a short amount of time, and all of it shall be goofy as hell! And no. We fans don’t want this. Don’t pretend you can speak for a whole base of player while dismissing the critics as exogenous to this same player-base. I myself are fond of the Mario Galaxy franchise and the Mario&Luigi RPG franchise. I have played numerous game from Super Mario Bros to Mario 64, to Mario Party, and so on. Yet, I still consider that a movie have to be a movie, not a fan-service mess deep as a puddle."
"Apr 15, 2023",positive,Okay for the adults and a pure delight for the kids.
"Apr 15, 2023",negative," It’s a sacred text, but not one with any depth. The saga of Super Mario, told through dozens of video games over roughly four decades, should not be plumbed—yes, that’s right, plumbed—for richness that does not exist. In its surface-only fairy tale is a perfect simplicity, regularly used as framework for interactive platforming adventures that are, since they’ve existed, some of the most broadly shared experiences of joy on earth. As a movie, the whole Mario thing will probably never work, but it would be interesting to see a version that makes no effort to explain what everyone already knows—that he’s a fast little dude in an inexplicable psychedelic hollow earth called The Mushroom Kingdom, jumping his way to Jesus status as he topples monsters and restores innocence. Among the many errors of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, screenwriter Matthew Fogel (formerly of Minions: The Rise of Gru and The Lego Movie: 2 repute) plops him and his brother Luigi into a milquetoast Brooklyn family that doubts them and disrespects their small-business dreams. Who cares? Boring stuff. Get to the action. Don’t try to make these guys more real, because that was never the point. The more human the brothers and their Princess Peach are made to be, the more dull. Let ’em fight! Let ’em fly! When the movie focuses on this, it’s fun—a movie that only focuses on this, closer to YouTube-able speedruns than paint-by-numbers IP origin story chum, would be better.  The lone exception to its failures at cramming in charisma? Jack Black as Bowser; he gets to sing lovesick incel ballads, mewling about how Peach doesn’t love him enough, angry that the tiny courageous Italian has her heart instead. Black remains a performer who, no matter the stakes, brings the full experience. Bless him for doing that when no one else could. PG, 92 min. "
"Apr 14, 2023",positive,I've been wanting a Super Mario Brothers movie like this for a long time... I was smiling the entire time I was watching this movie.
"Apr 14, 2023",positive,"Is this the greatest movie that is worth all those years of hype and anticipation? Honestly, no. Is it still a fun adventure to see the beloved games adapted to the big screen? Oh, absolutely!"
"Apr 14, 2023",neutral,"Crisp animation, mostly strong voice acting and fun for the entire family. No doubt Mario is a juggernaut franchise for Illumination and Universal. But overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is nothing groundbreaking and can be very generic thematically. "
"Apr 14, 2023",positive," Eight years after the idea was originally discussed, the animated ‘Super Mario Bros.’ movie is finally in cinemas. And, after the unusual absurdity of the 1993 live action film, I was sceptical of this adaptation right up until the trailers were released. Since then, my excitement has been high, but was it worth the wait? ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ stars Chris Pratt and Charlie Day as Mario and Luigi, two brothers who start up their own plumbing business, only to get accidently sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom. Once there, Mario is tasked with working alongside Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy – The Queen’s Gambit, New Mutants) to help stop the Koopa King Bowser (Jack Black – Kung Fu Panda, School of Rock) and save his brother. After seeing the film, my scepticism was pushed aside completely: ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ is an extremely enjoyable adaptation, even if it has one or two issues. Illumination Studios and Nintendo are behind this adaptation. Whether you like the Minions/‘Despicable Me’ or not, it can’t be denied that Illumination are amazing when it comes to their animated visuals, and ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ is no exception. The animation looks incredible and is very detailed, e.g.: Bowsers hair or the fabric on Mario’s clothing are incredibly detailed to the point where individual hairs can be seen on Bowser. Plus, various locations within the film looked gorgeous: the introduction to Mushroom Kingdom was wonderous and amazing to see, while Bowser’s Castle looked creepy, and Rainbow Road looked bright and vibrant. It’s clear that care was taken to make sure the locations, characters and overall settings were accurately portrayed, and Illumination Studios have done an incredible job at bringing the world of the Super Mario Bros. to life. After hearing the announcement that Chris Pratt was going to voice Mario, reception was less than positive, especially since Charles Martinet, who has voiced Mario since 1989, was only going to have a small cameo. But, while Chris’ voice wasn’t anywhere near the resemblance of the video game voice, I didn’t dislike his performance as the red plumber. His voice actually worked for the film and fit the character comfortably as the film went on. Plus, I liked how the film did incorporate the brothers’ Italian accents. The brothers’ only use the accent during the commercials for their plumbing business, which was a nice inclusion, and helps push the plot along to an extent. But Charlie Day was perfect casting as Luigi and gave the fearful character a likeable personality the moment he appeared on screen. Both of these actors had fantastic onscreen chemistry with each other, making what could’ve been a strange film to watch a delightful one. While the casting may have appeared strange when first announced, Chris Pratt and Charlie Day worked perfectly together, and the brothers’ relationship was convincing straight away. The rest of the voice cast were also great. When casting announcements were made, it seemed that an unusual choice had been made, especially with Bowser being voiced by Jack Black and Donkey Kong voiced by Seth Rogen. But these performances are just as great too. Seth Rogen was the biggest surprise personally because, just like with Mario, his voice fit comfortably with the character. Not only was it a surprise because of the choice in casting, but it’s the first time Donkey Kong has spoken proper sentences. So, while Rogen had a blank slate to work with, it was uncertain to fans whether giving the ape a voice would really work. But it does and it works really well; he gives the ape a humorous performance but is also able to showcase the character’s rage and short temper when needed. And, when there is a sombre moment involving him, Seth Rogen is great at giving Donkey Kong an emotional, or heartfelt moment.  But the character that stole the show was Bowser. Voiced by Jack Black, the actor fully embraced the role, and was perfect casting as the Koopa King. He made the villain surprisingly terrifying when the narrative asked for it, but was also able to bring in his comedic talent too. This is especially the case given that Bowser’s character arc is him wanting to rule the world, while being in love with Princess Peach. A couple of sequences revolving around the latter called for some very funny moments. And there was even a sequence where the actor was able to showcase his vocal range (yes really!). With Bowser being my favourite character in the Mario franchise, I was highly sceptical of how this character was going to be portrayed, but Bowser was perfect. He was shown to be a terrifying foe when needed, but also brought some humour into the film when his love for Peach was revealed.  And, it wasn’t until I watched the movie that I realized how strange the plot of the Mario franchise actually is. But, unlike the ’93 adaptation, ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ doesn’t try to ground anything into reality. Instead, it tells the story of the game accurately, for the most part; with the only exception being the plot detail of Peach being kidnapped. And the story is very well executed because of this. Even when the film is packed with various references to different Mario games, the story is easy to follow, and the references don’t intrude on the plot.  This review won’t be revealing all of them, purely because it will spoil some of the film, but the film was packed with references from various Mario games, as well as a couple from the spin-offs. These were delightful to see and blended into their environments brilliantly. An example is when Mario and Toad are travelling through the Mushroom Kingdom, and fans are shown how the city is laid out, which includes floating platforms and even a shop that’s selling a SNES game cartridge. Not only were the references fantastic to see, but I’m convinced I didn’t see all of them throughout the film, giving it a rewatchability factor.  But the score for ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ did include some strange choices, which felt jarring. Throughout a couple of scenes, a random 80’s song will suddenly appear, but would only play for under a minute. These all felt out of place, even if the actual scene itself was fun to watch. Compared to the rest of the score, it felt very strange to have these songs appear out of nowhere. I would’ve preferred the musical score to play throughout, without the need for these songs. Like previously mentioned, the plot detail of Princess Peach being kidnapped has been removed, a choice I am happy with because this gives Peach time to shine as well as properly develop a relationship with Mario. However, the ‘damsel in distress’ detail instead is given to Luigi, who spends the majority of the film in a cage. I would’ve liked more scenes involving Luigi and Mario working together in Mushroom Kingdom, especially when the start of the film emphasizes Mario and Luigi’s sibling relationship really well. I would’ve preferred it if Luigi had been rescued earlier, and the brothers had worked together to defeat Bowser.  However, these issues aside, ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ is a very enjoyable and fun film. The cast, though it may have seemed strange at first, are fantastic and fit their characters comfortably. The visuals are incredible and the references, both visually and musically, are aplenty. It’s clear a lot of care has been taken to create this film and it shows, even if some of the music choices were strange.  Along with ‘Sonic the Hedgehog’, ‘Arcane’ and ‘The Last of Us’ to name a few, it really feels like the film/TV industry has finally learnt how to do great and enjoyable video game adaptations. And, with more on the way, I’m very excited for the future of this genre. Furthermore, with Charlie Day interested in a ‘Luigi’s Mansion’ film and Seth Rogen wanting a ‘Donkey Kong’ film, it looks like this won’t be the last animated Nintendo adaptation, something I am very excited about.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Apr 14, 2023",positive," I remember being in 2nd grade (1992), my brother was visiting and walked me down to our local Subway for a sandwich. We used to order our hero then play as a hero on the arcade while we waited for our order. That hero was Mario in Super Mario World. A few months later, I wouldn’t have to go outside to see Mario & Luigi. They were in my living room on the Super Nintendo. I remembered how big a difference the game looked compared to its predecessor Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Thirty-one years later, I think the same thing again while watching The Super Mario Bros. Movie.  Before I get into this review, let’s give respect to where it’s due. The first Mario Bros. related movie was the 1993 live-action Super Mario Brothers: The Movie. Feel however you want about it. Good or bad, it happened. But thirty years later, Universal Pictures said, “Gentlemen, we can rebuild them. We have the technology… ” and that they freaking did. The Super Mario Bros. Movie does an incredible job of translating the lore from the Super Mario franchise on screen while also knowing when to deviate. The movie is filled with homages, Easter eggs, and most importantly a great time for friends and family.  We meet the not yet iconic Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charles Day) as two plumbers in modern day Brooklyn (Buk Buk / Fire Flower SFX x 2) trying to strike it out on their ownn. They put out a very campy (but earnest) commercial for their plumbing business, and we see their old boss Mike laughing in their freaking faces. From jump, we see the courage and love Mario has as he defends his brother from Mike’s insults. It’s established early on that both brothers are underdogs. Mario for his small stature, Luigi for his fear, and both of them for dreaming big.  When the brothers get their first client, we see them navigate through the busy streets of Brooklyn. Mario been out here competing in Red Bull parkour tournaments cause that man can freaking move, while Luigi careful and less gracefully trails behind him. Things get messy with the client which leads to our protagonists feeling down. Their family (aside from their mom) doesn’t do much to help either. A major leak on the news is what gets the events of the movie underway. In trying to fix this leak that threatens to flood Brooklyn, Mario and Luigi get sucked through a warp zone pipe into a whole new world and then separated. Mario lands in the mushroom kingdom where he befriends Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), while Luigi lands in the territory of the big bad Bowser (Jack Black). It is here where Mario learns of Bowser trying to take over Mushroom Kingdom which means he’s gotta find a way to rescue his brother. I mentioned earlier how things are different from Mario lore we grew up with. The Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) we meet in The Super Mario Bros. Movie ain’t no damsel in distress from the video games. She’s Super Smash Bros. gang gang. Princess Peach got hands like you wouldn’t believe and here she is the one that trains Mario for survival in this world. We see Mario trying to platform in a tester course and coming close to getting it but not quite. As opposed to Peach who grew up in Mushroom Kingdom. Let’s put it this way, if there was an Olympics in Mushroom Kingdom, then Princess Peach is Carl Lewis and Flo Jo. Peach is shown to be a great leader an ambassador for her people.  Through the movie, Princess Peach is really in her Kuvira the Great Uniter bag… just without the fascisism and locking people up. Mario is the main protagonist of this movie, but we see Princess Peach legit getting busy throughout the film. Of course, Mario is going to have his moments of triumph, but I am very happy to see that Princess Peach who is from the mushroom kingdom, was raised in the mushroom kingdom, is portrayed as a strong  character that has “Mushroom Kingdom” tatted across the belly (metaphorically) as a leader that rolls up her sleeves and gets to work for her kingdom. This was a great pivot from the lore we know and a liberty for all the right reasons. I mean the absolute same can be said for Bowser as well because looooooooooooooord. I mean Jack Black’s Bowser… What can’t I even say, man?! Bowser doesn’t really speak much (until Mario Sunshine), so it’s not only funny but cool to see Jack Black use his comedic range with this character but also show that even when being funny, Bowser is still a sinister problem. Bowser’s whole motivation for getting a certain item and seeking Peach out for a specific reason may feel like a deviation from the lore, or as if fan theory is coming into play, but Nintendo never truly specified why Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach in the game. The only deviation here is that Bowser isn’t a one note evil villain. I see that as a good thing. Who doesn’t love a villain with range? If anything, Bowser displays  some low key elements of that 80s villain toxic masculinity in a funny way. This Bowser sees Princess Peach as a damsel, gets jealous at her walking round with Mario, believes an item and his show of power will win her over…. all while in a Diddy all white part suit and top hat. You gotta love’em man. I keep focusing on his range but when he sings, when he’s practicing how he will approach Princess Peach, all these humorous things that get dropped at the drop of a (top) hat when Bowser shows folks whose really in charge here.  I love a villain that can switch in an instant between goofy and “I am a whole threat to you.” Bowser is as big and as bad as we remember from video games, and this is a final boss that will beat the plumbing outta ya. This is a villain that is a threat, ain’t no redemption for him (I mean maybe in later movies), and ain’t no qualms about it. Bowser is here to take what he wants, consequences and mustached men be damned.  There are a lot of faves from Super Mario that appear in the movie as well. I ain’t even get into my guy Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). My primate’s entrance was spectacular, and I’m so happy that he and Mario were beefing on sight. Toad is such a fave cause he is really here and bout that action, and that’s all he’s got to say about that. Oooooh, and how at first, I felt bad for Luigi, but by the end with his own lil arc, I was screaming for the  Player 2 / Younger Sibling Gawd! The Easter eggs and homages didn’t feel forced in this movie (to me at least). One of my favorite things was seeing the boxers from Super Punch out as celebs in the Punch Out Pizzeria at the beginning of the movie.  Which brings me to how the background and environment feel like their own character in the movie as well. The way Mario, Peach, Donkey Kong, and Luigi interact with moving around their surroundings is already dope but to then see the camera move out then reposition itself so that the screen becomes a 2-D side scroller? Come on man. Little intricacies like that kept me engaged and also just lemme know when we reached an “it ain’t sweet” moment. Visually, this movie is just amazing and don’t even get me started on Rainbow Road! I mean, the Mario Kart folk know what it is! I’m just saying Fast & Furious is a cool franchise, but Mario and the gang were catching bodies on a whole rainbow. I–*throws hands up* there’s levels to this racing and I live my life one dropped banana peel at a time.  Listen this is a movie for adults, children, teens, and anyone that ever rocked with them Mario Bros. This movie was some thirty plus years in the making and worth the wait. If you got the time, I think this is a movie you should see because the amount of fun in it is ridiculous. This movie had to go hard but damn man, I didn’t know it was going to go THAT hard but I am big glad that they did."
"Apr 13, 2023",positive," **** Recent films to tangle with uncivil climate resistance—First Reformed, Night Moves, Woman at War—tend to weigh the meaning and cost of radical activism through their characters’ sometimes intense subjectivity. In How to Blow Up a Pipeline, ideological development is yesterday’s news. Per the title, director Daniel Goldhaber (Cam) unfurls a steely and process-driven thriller about eight activists attempting to detonate a West Texas oil pipeline. With Gavin Brivik’s Tangerine Dream-esque score guaranteed to quicken heart rates, Pipeline (which is based on a nonfiction book by Andreas Malm) thrives on ratcheting tension and detail: It’s all titrating, wiring and metadata editing. For amateurs, the activists are remarkably capable, but it’s bracingly apparent their sabotage has zero safety net—even in cinematic terms. When characters defy realistic authority to this extent, the audience has no playbook for what happens next. One by one, the story flashes back to reveal how the activists arrived in arid oil country, but the vignettes are finely calibrated to suggest the various righteous rages without turning polemic. As in the conspiracy itself, every actor knows their precise role, with Forrest Goodluck (playing a self-taught demolitions expert) achieving the deepest impression. His permanently furrowed brow is a sculpture of maniacal determination, and like How to Blow Up a Pipeline, he never flinches. R. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Cinema 21. *** On the one hand, there’s something disturbingly cynical about The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s threadbare plot and paper-thin characters, as if the exercise is less a standalone film and more a pitch document for a forthcoming Mario Extended Universe. On the other hand, it’s hard to argue with the results. Thirty years after their first cinematic outing, Mario (a shockingly serviceable Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) return to the big screen in a lovingly made animated extravaganza. There’s a clear passion for the material that directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic bring to the proceedings, blending the vibrant colors and iconic architecture of the Mushroom Kingdom with kinetic visuals that are a genuine treat to behold, buoyed by Brian Tyler’s score and its clever incorporation of Koji Kondo’s iconic chiptune orchestrations. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is certainly lacking in depth or narrative complexity, but like Star Wars or Avatar, it uses the basics of the monomyth as a jumping-off point to create a world that captures the imagination and leaves the audience begging for more. Older moviegoers will likely be turned off by the simplicity of it all, but for fans who are young or young at heart, it’s an entertaining trip down the warp pipe. Let’s a-go! PG. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

The question is a bit of a rhetorical one: He just works in China now outside of occasional voice work. But Ride On posits a world where Jackie Chan was never anything more than a stunt man trying to repay his debts by getting people to take pictures of him wearing a racist Native American costume with his horse, Red Hare. Emphasis on the horse. Ride On is a love letter to stunt men as a concept writ large, but the emotional arc of the movie is centered on a man who calls his horse his son, and is so sincere that even his estranged daughter is moved by the sentiment. Ride On tries to do a bit too much, juggling parental growth, cool-looking horse-adjacent stunt work, and a heavy dose of melodramatic backstory. But that’s to be expected from a full-course sentimental film—the kind that’s increasingly popular in a Chinese film market that’s mostly lost interest in superheroes. While there’s not too much here to appeal to anyone aside from admirers of stunts, horses, and Jackie Chan, Ride On certainly makes a strong effort to sell what it’s offering (with no villains, no less). NR. WILLIAM SCHWARTZ. Cedar Hills. ** Kristin never even knew she was out; still, they pull her back in. While the mob comedy may have peaked three decades ago, in Mafia Mamma, star Toni Collette and director Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight, Lords of Dogtown) attempt to create a new kind of “girl boss.” Kristin (Collette) is a suburban empty nester married to a cheating deadbeat, so when she’s mysteriously summoned to Italy and discovers she’s the heir to a criminal empire, she dives into the family business. Like the setup, the execution is shamelessly hokey. Colette, one of the most versatile actors of the past 25 years, is often reduced to a rambling, mouth-agape American out of water, and even The Simpsons’ Fat Tony would probably call the mob lieutenants (Monica Belluci, Eduardo Scarpetta) she encounters cartoonish. But to Mafia Mamma’s credit, it commits to the bit. Kristin’s new reign comes with surprising viciousness and terrific mafiosa jumpsuits, and in a standout sequence, she’s greeted by successive underlings on a canopy bed in an outdoor courtyard. By that point, every character seems nonsensically horny and wine-drunk, and it’s as though time has stopped completely (à la the Twilight gazebo scene, Hardwicke hasn’t lost the ability to make the perfunctory feel surreal). Mafia Mamma may not be a great movie, but it has the vibe of a not-bad vacation. R. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER.

"Apr 13, 2023",negative,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the Illumination style done at its absolute worst.
"Apr 13, 2023",positive," You can’t expect a lot out of a Mario movie, especially right out of the gate. Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie stays true to the games in the narrative. Meaning, there really isn’t one. Simple amusement is what gamers go to Mario for and that’s exactly what the film is. But as it transitions into a new medium, there are both expectations and opportunities. The expectation is a good story because no movie can succeed with window dressing. While Mario has never been about its story, that doesn’t translate well to film and this offers the opportunity to expand upon its lore and characters in new ways. The directors and writer Matthew Fogel didn’t grab that opportunity this time around, but if it has its audience yelling “Yahoo!” on their way to the video game store, it did what it came to do. The film opens with Bowser (Jack Black)’s fury. Power-hungry and lovestruck over Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), he’s on the hunt to find the Super Star. With its invincible powers, he hopes to not only take over the world but impress Peach enough for her to agree to marry him. If she doesn’t agree, he’ll have no choice but destroy her home, Mushroom Kingdom. Knowing that Bowser is a threat to her and her precious Toads, Peach seeks to form an alliance with the Kong Army. She also finds an unlikely ally in a short, overalled, Brooklyn-Italian plumber named Mario (Chris Pratt), who is propelled into this world through a warp pipe. It’s all very simple, but it’s also Mario. As said, there’s nothing much to expect in terms of narrative when speaking of the games. Franchise creator Shigeru Miyamoto has even stated that story and Mario never really mixed. In reference to Super Mario Galaxy’s plot, Wired’s Chris Kohler remarks in a 2009 interview with Miyamoto that it’s more than the “window dressing” we were used to. In response, Miyamoto explains that he likes to go with “as little story as possible.” “I’ve always felt that the Mario games themselves aren’t particularly suited to having a very heavy story, whereas the Zelda series is something that lends itself more naturally to that idea,” he says. In that respect, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is very much the way Miyamoto likes it. However, a bare-bones story doesn’t translate well to film. Like video game cut scenes when you skip over dialogue, it moves quickly. So quickly that it all feels rushed. The film sticks to the simplicity of most of the games that just follow Bowser repeatedly kidnapping Peach and attacking her kingdom. While the latter is still true here, the film can be lauded for the fact that it takes a departure from the classic rescue-the-princess formula. But that’s really the only thing the film does to spice things up as Peach is the one who drives the story (or lack thereof) and propels the action forward. Mario hasn’t always just been about defeating an enemy and saving the day, either. Some plots of the games do have narrative heft to them. Take the poignant story of fatherhood between Bowser and his son in Super Mario Sunshine or Super Paper Mario’s meta take on gaming culture with a complex journey into heaven and hell for the characters and dark twists and turns. Mario hasn’t always been just silly, light-hearted fun, and while the film does incorporate the franchise’s darker elements – the Mushroom Kingdom is the poptastic side of Bower Castle’s metal tracklist – it doesn’t do anything plot-wise to impress. The film does manage to stand out most with its characters, especially in the introduction of Mario and his brother Luigi (Charlie Day). We see them out in the human world, Brooklyn to be exact. Their Italian accents are only put on for a commercial to promote their new plumbing business. When fans heard the lack of Italian flavour in Chris Pratt’s voice for the first time, it caused a big uproar like Sonic’s teeth. Some even went so far as to dub Mario’s original voice over the trailer. Surprisingly, Pratt’s voice acting doesn’t turn out to be a distraction at all and he does a fine job. The same goes for Day in the Luigi role. Their voice performances make the characters easily recognizable. Mario is cheerful and courageous, while Luigi is still timid and scared in most situations (but shows great bravery in the end). Our introduction to the film versions of these iconic characters finds them struggling to get their plumbing business off the ground and make a name for themselves. When we finally see them get a gig, it serves as an excellent bit of slapstick with everything turning to chaos like Paddington in a bathroom. Seeing the brothers working together in the real world results in a desire to explore their bond more deeply; their life more deeply. We are given brief glimpses of them with their family and them as their Baby versions, but there’s a missed opportunity to bring more depth to their characters as we are quickly propelled right into the Mushroom Kingdom and the subsequent action.  Despite a narrative that could have used a power-up or two, it’s still very much a Mario movie. It has more Easter eggs than the Easter Bunny has supply. And even if you’re just a casual fan who has only played Mario Kart, you’ll still find so much to love in its charming humour and first-rate animation. Like the games themselves, Illumination creates an expansive visual feast that makes you wish you lived in that world. It’s stunning work with some cool camera tricks up its sleeve, with certain scenes being filmed like the side-scroller games. The production design and character movements mimic that classic style of gameplay impressively. There’s tons of action and an epic Mario Kart sequence that not only shows the mechanics of picking your kart but racing as well, shells and all. While the film is plagued by a random, overused selection of ‘80s hits that don’t fit their scenes very well, its score with integrated themes and retro music and game cues add to its overall goal of just trying to be a fan crowd-pleaser. For a general audience, it’s proving to be just that and that’s fine. A first entry in a Mario franchise can afford to meet the expected, but if it doesn’t take a Super Mushroom for the potential sequel, this franchise won’t stay fun for long. The Spiny Shell is ready to launch."
"Apr 12, 2023",positive," When the live-action Super Mario Bros. movie came out in 1993 (I was twelve), I remember being excited to see it but feeling highly disappointed when I walked out of the theater. It was almost nothing like the games I adored. As an adult, I appreciate this film for how campy and bizarre it is, taking the source material and transplanting it into an edgy cyberpunk aesthetic. That being said, I hoped the newest attempt at a Super Mario Bros. movie would be more faithful to the source material. Produced by Illumination, Universal Pictures, and Nintendo, this had some big bucks and players behind it. Thankfully, this new adaption is excellent and captures the fun and whimsy that Nintendo is known for. The story follows Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), two brothers trying to get their struggling plumber business off the ground in Brooklyn. There is a catastrophic flood in the middle of the city, and when the bros investigate the issue, they are sucked into a warp pipe and end up in the colorful and magical Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and Luigi get separated during the warping process, and on top of that, the Mushroom Kingdom is being invaded by Bowser (Jack Black), a giant fire-breathing turtle who will stop at nothing to take over the entire world. Now Mario has to find his brother and help Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, defeat Bowser. The Mario games have never had deep narratives (outside of Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG), and often the only lore available was a paragraph in the instruction manual. In comparison to that, the story here is quite fleshed out, but if you compare it to other contemporary animated films, it feels sparse. The pacing is also breakneck, and the movie runtime is just over an hour and a half, so there is little time to spend on character development. It's clear the writers depended on the audience to fill in some of the blanks with their familiarity with the source material. While it doesn't ultimately ruin the film, it could have used a little extra room to breathe. Aesthetically, Super Mario Bros. is gorgeous, and it's exhilarating to see the Mushroom Kingdom rendered in all its surreal glory. There are visual references everywhere, from almost every single mainline Mario game and Easter Eggs all over the place. One fun little connection is that although Nintendo does exist in this universe (Mario is seen playing an NES), instead of Mario games, they have Jumpman, an early name for Mario's character back in the Donkey Kong arcade days. This attention to detail is all over every design aspect, and it's nice to see the directors and writers respect the source material. There was a lot of internet chatter about Chris Pratt doing the voice of Mario and the lack of the accent, but it sounds natural and not as flat as it sounded in the trailers. The original voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, plays a different character, and it's nice to see he was included because his Mario performance is truly iconic. Jack Black as Bowser is inspired casting, and he hams it up at every opportunity. It's apparent Black had an absolute blast, and he even gets to use his singing pipes once or twice. The soundtrack, in general, is excellent, mixing Koji Kondo's melodies with new material from Brian Tyler. Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a light affair that doesn't add much to the established Mario canon but is a delightful low-stakes film that adults and children alike can enjoy."
"Apr 12, 2023",neutral," Thirty years ago, Disney subsidiary Hollywood Pictures produced a big screen adaptation of the popular Nintendo game Super Mario Bros., taking the sparse existing story content and extrapolating it into a bizarre and outrageous urban fantasy that ultimately bore little resemblance to the source material. This wasn’t all that unusual at the time, when film adaptations of novels, comics, and TV series commonly retained only the broad strokes of their parent works. Still, people hated it. Critics found it a weird and disjointed commercial cash grab, and fans of the games found it unrecognizable. In the years since, however, as film adaptations have become more slavishly loyal to their plots and established iconography, big, weird swings like that ‘93 Mario Bros. have been reevaluated within Millennial film crit circles. Directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel brought a great deal of imagination to their take on the portly Italian plumber’s adventures through the Mushroom Kingdom, the kind of oddball creativity that, by and large, studios do not permit anymore, especially when it comes to adapting established properties. THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE ★★ (2/4 stars)
Directed by: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic
Written by: Matthew Fogel
Starring: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen
Running time: 92 mins. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the new animated film from Nintendo and Illumination, is the 1993 film’s exact opposite. It is a completely on-model, by-the-numbers translation of the Super Mario Bros. video-game franchise, incorporating as much familiar imagery as possible while adding practically nothing. For the Mario fan in your household, young or old, it’s likely exactly what they want it to be. However, if you’ve somehow managed to go through life without having any attachment to the character, there is absolutely no reason for you to watch it. Mario (Chris Pratt doing a voice, but not the voice) is a friendly but scrappy plumber from Brooklyn who’s recently started his own business with his cowardly brother, Luigi (Charlie Day). In an effort to prove their worth and drum up business, the Mario Bros. delve deep into the sewers of New York and discover a hidden portal to a colorful world populated by adorable mushroom people and one human woman, Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), whose action hero hypercompetence has earned her a place as their Princess. Luigi gets kidnapped by Bowser (Jack Black), a giant turtle monster who wants to rule the world, but not quite as much as he wants to marry Peach. Mario and Peach team up to defeat Bowser and save his brother and her kingdom, respectively, facing a variety of challenges that happen to represent different types of Mario games and stages. There’s a contest between Mario and boastful gorilla Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan) that’s a cross between the classic Donkey Kong game and Super Smash Bros. There’s a street race down Rainbow Road that incorporates all the latest gameplay gimmicks from Mario Kart 8. There’s a throwaway joke about a mini game from Mario Party called “Toad Scramble.” If none of what I just said makes any sense to you, then you are not the audience for this movie. That’s not to say that little kids won’t have a good time, even if they don’t recognize that Peach’s Castle in this film is exactly as it appears in Super Mario 64. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a totally functional animated kids movie. It’s silly, it moves fast, it has a million little guys in it whose toys are on shelves now. I saw this film in a theater packed with kids, albeit the kids of parents who felt motivated to bring their toddlers and preschoolers to the earliest possible screening of the new Mario movie on the Thursday morning of its release. They all had a terrific time. The kids pointed excitedly at the screen and said “That’s Luigi!” each time Luigi appeared. The adults chuckled when one of Peach’s royal guards said “Your princess is in another castle.” It’s fundamentally the same experience for either age group. The more familiar you are with Mario, the more little coins of recognition you’re going to collect, and the higher the movie will score with you. That is, unless you’re like me, a curmudgeon who dislikes being pandered to. (See: my reviews of Star Trek: Picard, The Mandalorian, The Last of Us, etc.) Of course I recognize the dozens of musical motifs from the 35-year history of the Mario franchise that are scattered throughout the film, and of course I love those tunes, and of course I jotted them all down in my little notebook. I appreciate that even newer characters like Mayor Paulina and the Lumas make appearances alongside ubiquitous classics like Parakoopas and Shy Guys. But that’s most of what The Super Mario Bros. Movie is: a massive assemblage of things you already like, arranged into a coherent order for digestion as a single, 92-minute product. It is the laziest possible version of a Mario movie, and for most viewers, young and old, that’ll be totally acceptable. Hang onto your joycons, because I, a film critic, am about to say something nice about those Sonic the Hedgehog movies, and here it is: They’re movies. Both the 2020 Sonic film and its sequel have their own story that is unique from any of the games, cartoons, or comics that make up the Sonic franchise, introducing their own characters, settings, setpieces, and ideas. They’re not a total reinvention like the 1993 Super Mario Bros., but they do have a spark of originality to them. They are distinct products from the works that inspired them, and they have a reason to exist, outside of the context of Sonic fandom. And, cumulatively, they have grossed over $700 million. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not so much a movie as a speedrun through the history of Mario, from the Donkey Kong arcade cabinet to the Nintendo Switch, a crash course for people who, by and large, do not need it. They’ve either already lived it or are currently immersed in it. Will they enjoy the experience? Sure. Even I had a pretty good time, and I’m busy here constructing a rant protesting it. Will it make a billion dollars? Almost certainly, and you can look forward to seeing a new one of these every two to three years, and a Legend of Zelda movie, and a Metroid movie, and a Kirby movie, until the bubble finally bursts in 2038 and we start getting movies based on TikTok memes instead. What I’m saying is, we can and should expect more from a movie than a recital of things we already love. I’m not asking for Children of Men; I know I’ve just bought a ticket to the cartoon plumber movie. I only ask that you add something to the recipe you’ve inherited. It can be done. Look at Into the Spider-Verse. Look at the goddamn Lego Movie. Hollywood has given you a blank check. You don’t have to write it out to “Cash.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

"Apr 12, 2023",positive," Mario stands up for himself and his brother when it comes to villains and those who bully others, and he doesn't let teasing or mean comments get the best of him. When it comes to achieving his goals, he puts in hard work and never stops trying. He also shows great courage when it comes to taking on a new world and obstacles. Princess Peach is brave, proactive, and relentless when it comes to defending her land and the creatures in it, putting their needs before her own. Mario and Peach have different goals but work together to achieve them. Mario and Luigi are White, of Italian descent. The movie's take on their over-the-top Italian accents is that they're just for show, but Mario's time with his family reinforces some Italian American stereotypes. Though most of the actors who voice Mario's family are of Italian descent, Mario himself -- Chris Pratt -- is not. The movie's magical worlds feature almost all non-human creatures, but three Black actors voice key characters. Princess Peach is a skilled, brave female leader who leads an army to defend her kingdom. But as fierce and courageous as she is, she's the only female character in any of the lands and is portrayed as a love interest for both Bowser and Mario. In Brooklyn, a wealthy Black couple hire the Mario Bros. for a plumbing job. The creator and some film executives are Japanese. Fantasy animated action violence: missiles being shot, fingers being crushed in a piano, talk of ritual sacrifices, chases in which characters are in peril. Extreme falls. Character put into intense pain through magic (they're never physically touched). One scary sequence plays like a horror movie, with skeleton zombies that have glowing red eyes chasing a terrified character, crawling out from the ground and eventually capturing him. Dog attack. Spaceship has horns and glowing red eyes. A menacing villain burns down a kingdom and threatens or attempts to kill positive and/or adorable characters. Mean, bullying behavior. Explosions. Adorable character is the voice of doom, making dark comments with the voice of a young child. Bowser's one-sided interest in marrying Peach is at the heart of the plot, and he uses violence against another to coerce her to agree to marry him. Insulting, bullying language used to humiliate and put down main characters includes ""idiot,"" ""shut up,"" ""stupid,"" ""worthless,"" and ""you're a joke."" The ableist term ""crazy"" is used to describe a character. Based on the hugely popular Nintendo video game/entertainment franchise. The story weaves together various iterations of the video game and is essentially a commercial for the property. Extensive merchandising in conjunction with the film. Parents need to know that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is based on the hugely popular Nintendo video game/entertainment franchise. Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) team up for a quest that involves elements from several of the games, including Donkey Kong, Mario Kart, Super Mario 3D World, and more. The movie is a bit edgier than the games when it comes to cartoon violence, scares, and bullying. Expect missiles, explosions, a well-landed punch, and a plan to make ""ritual sacrifices."" While Mario and Peach are brave, they and other characters are often visibly panicked and are in constant peril from villain Bowser, who burns down the walls of a kingdom and issues deadly threats to those in his way. Some kids may be frightened by a scene in which Luigi is chased by zombie skeleton turtles with glowing red eyes that creep out of the ground en masse and eventually capture him. The Mario Bros. also hear a lot of insults and are the targets of bullying behavior by a former employer and get teased by family members (""idiot,"" ""stupid,"" ""shut up,"" etc.). And, of course, there are those magic mushrooms. But ultimately themes of perseverance, courage, and teamwork are clear.

MOVIE, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and his younger brother, Luigi (Charlie Day), fall down a mysterious portal and wind up separated inside a magical world. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who's strategizing how to prevent her land from being conquered by the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black). When Mario realizes that Luigi has likely been taken prisoner by Bowser, he and Peach team up to save his brother and her people. Nintendo fans will feel like they grabbed a Super Star while watching this brightly colored magical adventure, which mashes several Mario games up into a full storyline. But for viewers who are less familiar, sitting through The Super Mario Bros. Movie may feel like watching a second grader play a Mario game: It's cute, but you can't help thinking about all the other things you could be doing with your time. Making movies based on video games that have beloved characters and a built-in fan base seems like a natural choice, but not many do it well (exceptions include Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu), and The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn't depart from that norm. While it is fun to see the brothers in their ""real life"" environment in Brooklyn -- working as plumbers and living at home with their big Italian family -- as well as how the filmmakers incorporate elements of the games, the film isn't funny or creative enough to satisfy most teens or adults. Moreover, the child-friendly animation style is a tad misleading, as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic up the scare factor, making Bowser and his minions more terrifying than they need to be. There's plenty of excitement, nonstop action, and colorful images, but this project as a whole doesn't exactly level up. Families can talk about how the cartoon action in The Super Mario Bros. Movie compares to that of others you've seen. Does this kind of violence have more or less impact than what's in live-action movies? What moments did you recognize from the games? If you're a fan of the games, create your own story about Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Talk about the behavior Mario and Luigi experience in Brooklyn. Is Spike bullying them? Is there a difference between that and how Mario's family speaks to the brothers? What's the difference between bullying and razzing, if there is one? What should you do if someone is trying to put you down? How do Mario and Peach demonstrate perseverance, courage, and teamwork? Why are these important character traits and life skills? Do you think video games teach you perseverance? Why, or why not?

This big-budget animated family film inspired by the Nintendo characters that harkens back to the earlier days of computer gaming has strong appeal for a younger audience. With big, expensive actors - Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy - doing the voice work, and with a handful of generations having now grown up on these characters, it should also have strong appeal to those Gens X, Y, Millennial and Centennial who played Mario in his various forms from 8-bit to HD, many of those folk now the parents or grandparents taking their kids to see something at the movies across the Easter school holidays.  The missing ingredient for those adult audiences is any kind of wit or clever dialogue in the film's screenplay penned by Matthew Fogel - I mean the witty banter between characters in Pixar films like Ice Age or Toy Story, with layered characters and with emotionally charged stakes.  For those living under a rock since the first Mario Bros. computer game was released in 1983, players of this Nintendo game use the characters of moustachioed plumbers Mario and Luigi to walk, punch and swing their way through different worlds, swinging on vines, jumping on mushrooms and bricks and travelling through pipes to rescue a princess. In later years, the brothers were also available in go-carts and other vehicles.  What Fogel's screenplay does is honour that simple approach, constructing a simple narrative to get Mario to bashing bricks and jumping on mushrooms quickly and for much of the film.  As the film opens, Brooklyn Italian-American plumbers Mario (Pratt) and Luigi (Day) are showing off the TV ad they've shot for their new business, and this is the one moment that feels like an authentically cheeky nod back to the game's early days. It also addresses some of the online criticism the filmmakers received casting the very Anglo Pratt and Day for the voice work, neither being particularly Italian, as the plumbers put on the thick Brooklynised Italian accents of their parents for their quirky TV ad. They also don ridiculous coloured overalls, caps and gloves for the ad, giving context for these real-world human characters to look like video game characters.  Heading into the subterranean levels under the Brooklyn streets to get to the bottom of some localised flooding, the brothers are sucked into a portal to an alternate dimension but are quickly separated with Luigi trapped in a cage in the world of evil turtle emperor Bowser (Jack Black) while Mario is in the kingdom of Princess Peach (Taylor-Joy). At my session of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, I sat in front of a school group on excursion, probably grade 4 or 5, and absolutely the demographic for this film. Those kids giggled the whole way through this film and they loved the absolute heck out of it, particularly Black's two musical numbers, so, critical interpretation aside, kids will love this film, and what the heck do I know? But that screenplay is particularly disappointing and will be to older audiences who are looking for a little nuance. Visually, though, the film is glorious and colourful and directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic set up fun and familiar action scenes those kids in my audience responded positively to. "
"Apr 11, 2023",positive," The year’s first buzz-worthy TV show was HBO’s excellent first season of the drama series “The Last of Us,” based on the Sony PlayStation hit. Last week brought us the Apple TV+ film “Tetris,” not an adaptation of the enduring puzzle game — thankfully — but instead a dramatization of the wild race decades ago to secure rights to the Soviet Union-controlled property. Fast-paced and entertaining, if also lacking any real emotional substance, it works best as an homage to the games, starting with 1981’s “Donkey Kong,” moving through all the “Super Mario Bros.” titles that came after it on various Nintendo consoles and racing into the era of all the “Mario Kart” fun. After introducing us to the big-and-bad Bowser (Jack Black, “Kung Fu Panda”) — a turtle and King of the Koopas, who efficiently turns a snow-covered kingdom into the lava-filled Dark Lands — “Mario” shifts to Brooklyn, New York, where brothers Mario (Chris Pratt, “The Lego Movie”) and Luigi (Charlie Day, “Horrible Bosses”) have just debuted the commercial for their new plumbing business. (They really ham up the Italian accents in the ad, a la “It’s-a-me, Mario,” clearly as a way to acknowledge this part of the franchise’s past.) Soon, they’re off to a job, directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic creating a sequence inspired by side-scrolling games such as the early “Mario” entries. It’s well done. After Mario and Luigi are sucked into a pipe and set to the magical realm now endangered by Bowser, the myriad nods to the games continue as things become three-dimensional. The brothers are separated, with the not-as-brave-as-his-brother Luigi finding himself in the Dark Lands and Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom. (Hey, this is no pleasure cruise for him, either; like any sensible person, Mario finds mushrooms disgusting.) With the help of new buddy Toad (Keegan-Michael Key, “The Lion King”), Mario gains an audience with the benevolent Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy, “The Queen’s Gambit”), who fears her peaceful land soon will be invaded by Bowser and his forces. The two team up to rescue Luigi and stop Bowser, Peach putting Mario through a bit of training and teaching him about power-ups that can help him be a magically enhanced version of himself before they venture forward. The adventure that follows also brings into the zany fold the titular figure from “Donkey Kong” (Seth Rogen, “The Lion King”), a big gorilla who doesn’t exactly hit it off with Mario. Horvath and Michael, a tandem best known for the “Teen Titans Go!” animated series, work from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel, whose credits include last year’s solid “Minions: The Rise of Gru.” Like that movie and the entire “Despicable Me” franchise, “Mario” is made by animation studio Illumination, this time in collaboration with Nintendo. As with the “Despicable Me”s, the “Minions”s and Illumination’s “The Secret Life of Pets” flicks, “Mario” is interested in showing you a good time and not in giving you a case of the feels. Unlike with, say, the best efforts from Disney-owned Pixar Animation studios, “Mario” isn’t likely to have you reaching for a tissue. And as the directors suggest, there is a message about the value of perseverance — Mario is NOT a quitter — but it’s little more than a bit of seasoning. While Pratt’s reasonably entertaining Mario is the star of the show — and has some enjoyable interactions with Rogen’s Kong — the filmmakers get a lot of comedic mileage from Black’s Bowser, especially after his true motivations are revealed. Part of that is making use of Black’s musical abilities in one particularly nice scene. And then there’s the delightful Toad — delightful in no small part to Key — and the other cute citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom, one of whom suggests they’re too adorable to die. They’re certainly this movie’s answer to the little, yellow Minions, if not quite THAT interesting. By no means a classic, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” should help rid the movie-going world of any lasting bad taste from 1993’s live-action “Super Mario Bros.,” a commercial and critical failure. And, sure, it can feel like one big meta-heavy commercial — Mario even plans an NES game early on in the affair — but that was to be expected. Ultimately, “The Super Mario Brothers Movie” boasts enough smile-inducing moments, expected and otherwise, that both young viewers and those old enough to have a history with the games can expect a pretty good time."
"Apr 11, 2023",positive," The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a little too afraid to stray from the brothers' origins for its own good but delivers an entertaining adventure all the same. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the first time Nintendo's frontman has jumped onto the big screen since 1993's disastrous live-action outing. In this new version, directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic have delivered a fun, fast-paced but overly familiar adaptation that could have been a little bit more inventive along the way. Mario games aren't exactly renowned for their plots, so if you've any experience with the games' primary objective—beat Bowser, save Princess Peach—you'll pretty much know what you're in for in The Super Mario Bros. Movie; the only major change this time around is that our damsel in distress is not Peach, but Luigi.  Our duo of plucky plumbers arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom after being sucked down a green warp pipe after attempting to save real-world Brooklyn from a burst water pipe, but get separated during the journey into this strange new world. Big bad Bowser is off plotting how best to win Princess Peach's heart and captures Luigi for info on Mario's whereabouts so he can put a stop to his new rival. From then on, it's all familiar, family-friendly fare; Mario teams up with the Princess to prove his heroic credentials and save his brother from the King of the Koopas. The plot certainly won't win any awards for complexity, but it sure does zoom along at a breakneck pace. Across the film's 92-minute runtime, we're barely given a moment to breathe between Mario's arrival in the kingdom and his final battle with Bowser. This helps the movie serve up plenty of action, but it would've been nice to spend a little bit more time with some of the supporting characters, especially as most of the voice performances are pretty solid.  Jack Black's turn as Bowser is the most magnetic presence on-screen. His version of the villain is a goofy, lovesick titan who yearns for Peach's hand in marriage to the point he ends up crooning out a power ballad about the Princess in one of the film's funniest moments. Charlie Day also embodies Mario's scaredy-cat brother with aplomb, which is a shame given how he's chained up and absent for a lot of the action. By comparison, Chris Pratt's Mario is serviceable, but he remains the weakest of the lot and doesn't really do much to distinguish between himself and his character, even if his delivery isn't nearly as catastrophic as the internet's reaction would have had you expecting back when the Mario movie cast was first revealed. Illumination's animators certainly made the most of Mario's history bringing The Super Mario Bros. Movie's world to life. The film's colorful and crisp and the Kingdoms we explore are packed full of Easter eggs and nostalgic nods both to Mario lore and Nintendo's wider history; I've no doubt you'll find deeper and deeper cuts lurking in the background of scenes on a second or third viewing.  That visual density is matched by composer Brian Tyler's charming interweaving of Koji Kondo's iconic Mario themes and sounds into the score. That being said, the obvious needle-drop moments to tracks like Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out For a Hero"" and The Beastie Boys' ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" (get it? They're plumbers... from Brooklyn!) had me rolling my eyes.  There are certainly some well-staged sequences peppered throughout; Mario's training montage and an early rush through Brooklyn ingeniously ape the side-scrolling platforming action of the games, and the Mario Kart/Mad Max mash-up that sees Mario, Peach and the Kong army taking on Bowser's forces on the open road is a thrilling end to the second act.  Ultimately, the biggest complaint is simply that, whilst fun, the movie is too safe; flipping the switch on Princess Peach, making Donkey Kong and co. expert Mario Kart engineers, and having Bowser's minions be genuinely bemused by their King's ultimate desire is about as daring as things get, and it would've been nice to see a little more willingness to poke fun or play around with elements in the Mario universe. Ultimately, the film felt more like an exercise in laying some solid foundations for a new movie franchise and ensuring that the Mushroom Kingdom made its way to the silver screen in a recognizable way. In short, everything is competently put together, but it would've been great to have seen some more creativity from the team. Plenty of signs point to a sequel—stick around for a post-credits scene teasing the arrival of one of Mario's best pals—and I'd wager The Super Mario Bros. Movie has introduced us to a world that definitely has the potential to build into a bigger and better second outing, even if the first could do with a power-up or two of its own.  Some of his favorite shows are What We Do In The Shadows, Bridgerton, Gangs of London, The Witcher, Doctor Who, and Ghosts. When he’s not watching TV or at the movies, Martin’s probably still in front of a screen playing the latest video games, reading, or watching the NFL."
"Apr 11, 2023",neutral," An impressive Hollywood A-list voice cast and a script filled with nods to the video game series adds to the appeal, although by about the hour mark, you might well feel this is just one long chase movie. The razor-sharp wit of, say, The Lego Movie is largely absent here, with a story that seems more geared towards pleasing youngsters than their accompanying adults. At least the film, directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, is a vast improvement on 1993’s notoriously bad live-action Super Mario Bros, which starred Bob Hoskins as the titular Mario. Here, Chris Pratt voices Mario, joined by Charlie Day as Luigi. They’re introduced in amusing fashion – a TV commercial, in which these Brooklyn-based brothers adopt fake Italian accents to promote their new plumbing business. It feels like a sly wink to the criticism Pratt received when the trailer landed, with many complaining about the lack of authenticity in his voice work. After Mario and Luigi are separated following a detour into an alternate universe, the sliver of a plot sees them butt heads with the turtle-like villain Bowser (Jack Black), “the most evil, wretched creature alive”. He is plotting to rule the world and – if she’ll have him – marry Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), the leader of the Mushroom Kingdom. Desperate to rescue his brother, Mario has to join forces with Peach to fend off Bowser. The film’s best moments come when it emulates various Mario game iterations. Early on, the siblings are rushing to a plumbing job, leaping over obstacles on a building site much like a classic platform-style video game. Later, Mario Kart features, and there’s even a nod to that other Nintendo classic, Donkey Kong – the character voiced by Seth Rogen – with iron girders and barrels included. There’s clearly a love for the games here, right down to the familiar chimes of old-school sound effects and lessons in how to power up. For all the inspired moments – like Bowser’s piano interlude as he repeatedly croons Peach’s name – there’s a lot that feels lazy too. The soundtrack is peppered with obvious ’80s hits – Take on Me, Holding Out for a Hero and so on. There’s also a distinct lack of real jeopardy. And by the end, the seizure-inducing array of primary-colour visuals just gets tiresome. This is a film for kids – and Mario obsessives – but nobody else."
"Apr 11, 2023",positive," Video game adaptations currently find themselves in a interesting place. Back in the 1990s and 2000s they were often mined for quick, cheap, schlocky action or family films. There was a bit of a lull in terms of game adaptations coming out of Hollywood in the late 2000s and early-to-mid 2010s, but now we are experiencing not just a renaissance, but practically a golden age. For so long there’s been this talk about there being a “curse” around video game adaptations, and that’s largely been built on the back of those poor quality films from the earlier era. To be fair, even back then there was still some good mixed in with the bad. Films like Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, and Tomb Raider were overall mostly met with positive receptions and for the most part actually did accurately adapt if not their respective games correctly overall, they at least captured their vibes. Even the much maligned Street Fighter film from that time seems to have found a more positive spin as time has gone on and people warmed to the odd campy charm of it and rightfully praise an incredible performance from Raul Julia as M. Bison. Despite this even to this day you have people asking if the next video game adaptation will break the so called curse. In the wake of great adaptations like Netflix’s Castlevania series, HBO’s The Last of Us series, Pokemon Detective Pikachu, and the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, I think it is fair to say that there was no curse, beyond the previous eras being cursed with a lot of bad directors and writers getting into the wheelhouse behind those adaptations. So instead, when sitting down to write this review I decided to task myself with answering a new question; does Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie continue the golden streak? I say it ultimately does. The Super Mario Bros. Movie does what many of the other successful adaptations do, it captures the spirit of the property to a ridiculous degree. It also helps that the Mario franchise is not one particularly steeped in deep mythos or multi-faceted narratives and complex characters. As long as you have Mario coming into conflict with Bowser in some way, you are roughly eighty percent of the way there already. The particular story this film goes with is Mario and Luigi are sucked into the world of the Mario franchise via a warp pipe that just happens to be chilling out underground beneath Brooklyn. Thanks to inconvenient warping shenanigans Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom while Luigi finds himself in the Dark Lands ruled over by the tyrannical giant dinosaur-turtle Bowser. Mario teams up with an adventurous Toad named…Toad and Princess Peach, the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, to save Luigi. Bowser for his own part has a side story running concurrently with the main story about wanting to marry Princess Peach, as he often wants to do in the video games. Not exactly Shakespeare, I know, but it doesn’t have to be. For the most part the story is coherent and flows along just fine, if a bit briskly at times. The film hops from scene to scene so fast that often nothing really gets a chance to breathe or marinate. It breezes through its nowadays abnormal one hour and thirty-three minute runtime so fast it almost feels like watching a speed run of a Mario game. The characters are by and large in line with their depictions in the games. Luigi is spot on with his combination of cowardice and bravery when the chips are down, it makes sense for there to be a brave and thrill-seeking Toad as Toad has been a playable character in multiple mainline Mario games as well as his own spin-off title Captain Toad, and Donkey Kong is the chest-puffing bravado machine he is often depicted as. Bowser, Peach, and Mario aren’t as accurate, but for the most part the changes to their characters work. Peach has been more than the stereotypical damsel she has often been ridiculed as being in the games for a long time, since the game Super Mario Bros. 2 came out and made her playable for the first time, in fact. She, however, hasn’t usually been this brash, badass action girl, either. That’s usually been the role Princess Daisy has found herself in the overall Mario franchise. The Super Mario Bros. Movie taking Bowser’s obsession with Peach and turning him into a full blown simp for her is honestly an inspired choice, and leads to many of the film’s funniest moments. By far the biggest change in characterization in the film, and one I’m still not sure I’m actually fully positive about, is that to Mario himself. He’s presented as a bit of a schlub who constantly messes up and appears to be more confident in a way that sometimes borders on cockiness that his abilities can’t back up. This was arguably the one big risk the film took by deciding to give Mario and Luigi fish out of water stories. In the games the two of them are just…there. They are part of that universe, and Mario’s confidence is well-founded, because he’s very reliable and extremely competent in the games. However, in the end I don’t think that negatively drags the film down at all, and they get so many things right that I feel they earned some leniency in some of their missteps. One such example of them getting things “right” is the sequence where Luigi lands in the Dark Lands. They nailed the atmosphere and Luigi’s mannerisms so well that I really want to see them tackle a Luigi’s Mansion film. Moving along to the audiovisual aspects of the film, I’ll tackle the elephant in the room, the voice acting performances from the cast. Much ado was made about the cast, particularly Chris Pratt as Mario. Overall I feel the cast did an incredible job. Pratt’s Mario voice is fine, but also just never really felt “Mario” to me outside of a couple lines at the beginning of the film where he does an exaggerated accent as a bit. Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi stole the show for me, as I expected them to do when the casting was first announced. Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, and Anya Taylor-Joy do great jobs embodying Toad, Donkey Kong, and Princess Peach respectively. For my money, though, the biggest surprise voice performance in the film for me was Julliet Jelenic as Lumalee, an absolutely darkly hilarious fatalistic Luma. Charles Martinet, the long time and beloved voice of Mario and Luigi in the video games, did great with what little he ended up getting. When they announced he would be involved in the film, I really was hoping it was going to be more than the basically glorified cameos we got from him. It kinda felt to me like they gave him the absolute minimum bread crumbs they could get away with, though they did at least have the foresight to put some respect to his name by giving him a prominent placing in the film’s credits. Musically is probably where some of my biggest praises and negative marks for the film lie. On the plus side for the movie, they use a lot of musical tracks from the greater Mario meta-franchise, and this includes the Donkey Kong sub-series. Some of the tracks are used straight up as they are in the games, while others are fantastic remixes or medleys of multiple tracks spliced together. There are also some original music in the film, including an absolute ear worm of a track that I just dare you to get out of your head. However, one big issue with the music in the film that I can’t ignore is its abundant use of licensed songs. Licensed songs being used in animated films is nothing new, and is honestly basically a crutch all of the non-Disney studios use even when a film can musically stand on its own two feet. But in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, not only is it using licensed music, but it is using it in all the wrong ways. For starters not a single licensed track used actually matches the scene they are put in. Not a one. It is almost impressive how badly they were chosen. There are admittedly tenuous connections, but you have to tilt your head ninety degrees and go cross-eyed while all the planets align during the solstice to see them. More egregiously than that, they apparently removed at least one OST medley from the Donkey Kong series that was to be used during the introduction to the Kong Kingdom to slap a licensed song in its place. This makes me wonder how many OST tracks had to be carved out, just to spend more money on acquiring these ill-fitting songs. The visuals in this film are fair and away the strongest thing in it without question. Not only is the film just from an artistic and technical standpoint just gorgeous by every measure possible, there is an absolute overload of references and Easter eggs to not just Mario games, but other Nintendo properties as well. You will legitimately exhaust yourself spotting something you recognize and then doing the famous Leonardo DiCaprio finger point meme. One particularly inspired scene that had my eyes glaze over in pure fanboy bliss was early in the film where Mario and Luigi traverse the streets of Brooklyn stylized like it was a stage from one of the 2D side-scrolling Mario games. While the Mario characters have widely been some of the most expressive characters in Nintendo’s vast stable, Illumination have gone above and beyond the call of duty giving them new expressions never seen before on them. This is the best Nintendo’s flagship characters have ever looked from a visual fidelity standpoint and makes the wait for the successor to Nintendo’s Switch platform all the more painful. I cannot say that The Super Mario Bros. Movie was devoid of flaws, there are certainly multiple ones to point out. But despite any issues I had with the film, they just couldn’t overcome the pure sense of joy I got from this movie. Watching this movie transported me back to the turn of the millennium when I first entered the colorful Mushroom Kingdom myself on my Game Boys. Wahoo."
"Apr 11, 2023",neutral,"It is, when all is said and done, intensely mediocre: prettier than a lot of animated mediocrity, but ""pretty"" only takes us so far."
"Apr 10, 2023",positive," I'm just going to cut to the chase — The Super Mario Bros. Movie is one of the most divisive video game movies in recent memory, with a 56% critic score and a 96% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes (at the time of writing this). So, I went into this with no concrete expectations, just curiosity about what to expect.  As a fan of the Mario games myself, I couldn't hide my excitement. Of course I was apprehensive, but video game movies have been getting better over the years — an impressive feat, considering the genre's flop-ridden cinematic history. But with films like Sonic the Hedgehog, Detective Pikachu, and Werewolves Within sweeping the box office, these movies have been changing the game  (sorry, bad pun intended). This is something I've always said about children's movies: most critics have forgotten who the audience is. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was made for children, not for you. And yes, I've heard the argument a thousand times from a thousand critics with mushrooms stuffed up their bums, that this movie is purely a vessel to push the marketing for Universal's Nintendo World theme park forward. And honestly? I don't care. I'm so excited to visit that theme park and this movie made me even more excited. Good marketing? Sure, whatever. Good movie? Absolutely, and that's all I care about.  I had an absolute blast watching this film. It's fan service at it's best, and it isn't forced down the audience's throat. Not to mention the incredible casting; I really didn't expect to like Chris Pratt's voice, but it was perfect. And Jack Black as Bowser? Literally the best decision Hollywood has ever made. It's all there, it's awesome, and as a Mario fan it's so much fun. I mean honestly, what did you expect? A deeper dive into the stories of Mario and Luigi? Mario has never been deep — it's not supposed to be. It's a game! It's fun! It's silly! We love it! And yet, this movie supplies a solid plot with exciting twists and turns that make the whole experience like a thrill ride down the Rainbow Road.  Most importantly, I went to see this with my boyfriend's 9-year-old brother,  and watching the pure joy on his face made me fall in love with this film. He was laughing, cheering, and gasping every time he recognized a power up or a Shy Guy and everything in between. He loved it so much that he wanted to take a picture next to the poster afterwards while sporting his bright red Mario hat with pride. To me, all a movie needs to do is bring us joy, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie succeeds in every way. "
"Apr 10, 2023",positive," ★★★☆☆Hugh Grant seems so much happier now that he’s playing the villain. As a romantic hero he seemed fantastically ill at ease. Indeed, he turned that unease into the motor of some of the most beautifully calibrated comic performances we have seen in the rom-com — even if his pairings with Andie MacDowell in Four Weddings and Julia Roberts in Notting Hill also won the award for the relationship you least believed would last beyond the closing credits. Does anyone buy that Roberts’s Anna Scott would have put up with all that bumbling? What chance the long haul of a relationship for a chap who can’t get through a sentence?"
"Apr 10, 2023",positive," Here is a video game adaptation that quite literally stays true to the source material. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is the most accurate cinematic depiction you may ever get of the famous Nintendo title. If you were born in a timeline beginning with the 1980s then Mario and Luigi are there in your popular entertainment memories. Even if you never played the game you’ve seen the two plumbers somewhere. This movie has a particular, at times fleeting, charm that derives from how it simply imagines the game’s creations as a palpable, digitally possible world. In a way it’s an example of how animation is truly the only way to make a “Super Mario” movie. Talking mushroom people, warlord turtles and cocky gorillas wearing ties all make sense when illustrated. Forget the “story,” because it’s completely ludicrous. Switch off the need for narrative and this is a trippy experience full of absurd vistas bursting with color. It’s recommended you don’t sit too far away from the screen so as to truly soak it in, like the hippies who used to drop LSD  during showings of “2001: A Space Odyssey.” There is a plot however. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are Italian-American siblings and plumbers trying to get their business going in 1980s Brooklyn. No one takes them seriously, least of all their family with the exception of mom. When a water main break sends the pair rushing to prove themselves, something goes wrong and they are sucked into a portal. After traversing some colorful wormholes, they are separated but end up in another, quite sunny, dimension. Mario finds himself in the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the sweet Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Her realm is currently being threatened by the Koopa Troop army of Bowser (Jack Black), a snarling turtle warlord who wants to marry Peach and rule the world. Bowser has captured Luigi, becoming very irritated at the prospect of his prisoner’s brother snatching away his bride. Despite the older audience members who will be attending “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” brimming with nostalgia, it should be made clear this movie is more of a roller coaster for elementary schoolers. It doesn’t have the sense of overall lessons you get from “Captain Underpants” or “The Angry Birds Movie,” but there are some easily digestible themes. Bowser is a deluded thug who wants to force Peach into marriage. Mario and Luigi need to find the courage to believe in each other no matter what others think. The deepest character is a talking blue star in one of Bower’s dungeons, who cheerfully issues depressing observations about despair, death and how time is an illusion, like hope. Mario tends to inspire such ideas. The last feature film featuring the character was the now forgotten 1993 “Super Mario Bros.,” starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo in a grimy live-action take. It was a goofy dystopian vision with messages about totalitarianism. That’s how it was done in the ‘90s. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, with a team of brilliant animators, are really just using the story as a way to then dive headlong into Nintendo world. We’re taken on the trip of inhabiting the “Super Mario” environment, made so vivid with a rather astounding palette. The Mushroom Kingdom is bathed in blinding sunshine and cascading waterfalls. Bowser sits on a throne surrounded by rock and lava. Mario traverses the Mushroom Kingdom through pipes that crisscross forever, then battles Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) in a stony arena where we can feel gravity slipping away when he needs to punch those famous power boxes from the game (granting him mushrooms that can either bulk his size or make him tiny). There’s a thrilling chase over a rainbow that feels like “Mad Max: Fury Road” meets “Tron.”  What the filmmaking team does is essentially transfer the experience of playing the game into something to be viewed, tied together by a sparse story. Mario jumping from box to box, evading Piranha Plants is turned into a real action scene.  While the cast has some notables, their presence is barely felt considering the movie truly just exists as a visual delight. Jack Black is the one real standout as Bower. He has a moment of genuine comedy when playing a demented, Elton John-style serenade for Peach on his piano. Fred Armisen is Cranky Kong, who sees his son Donkey as a showboat and screw up. There’s nothing else to them. Bower’s own wedding scheme is as bad as any concocted by a lonely person with serious autonomy issues. His minions, like the sorcerer Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson) are just there to make funny, squeaky noises. The real entertainment is in the exciting, grand action scenes where Mario and Luigi attain powers and do a lot of punching, gliding, spinning and setting off colorful explosions. These sequences have such impressive artistry it is fun to just marvel at them. Or consider some calmer moments full of operatic overkill, like Bower attacking a kingdom of penguins, emerging from the flames like something out of “Lord of the Rings.” Brian Tyler scores the movie with some grandiose sounds combined with Koji Kondo’s original Nintendo themes.  For naysayers the question might be how else could you make a “Super Mario Bros.” movie? Video game adaptations have had poor reputations because of filmmakers trying too hard to adjust the game to a movie plot. Recent standouts like “The Last of Us” on HBO are an exception because the original game itself is essentially a film. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is a worthy take on its source material because it’s absolutely true to it. The recent “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies were hits, yet as stories they suffer from dumping the endless creativity of live action and attempting to find logic in its blue, sneaker-wearing hedgehog walking around the real world. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is designed to be looked at, with goofball humor that kids will like. They will at least also get a lesson in how forcing someone into marriage when they don’t like you and your rampaging armies is unacceptable. If you can’t accept this somewhat successful bit of movie candy on its own terms, you may have just grown out of it."
"Apr 10, 2023",positive,A simple fun story. I was a fan!
"Apr 10, 2023",negative,The whole package is a deranged mishmash of overstimulating elements.
"Apr 10, 2023",positive," After 30 years of waiting, fans of The Super Mario Bros can see their plumber protagonists get a shot at cinematic redemption. The all new animated adaptation promises greater respect to the source material that will somehow condense decades of games into one simple narrative, a narrative that includes mushroom people ruled by a human princess, seeking the aid of talking gorillas, in the fight against the wrath of a giant spike-shelled fire-breathing dragon turtle.  Making the world of Mario accessible to the outside world is a tall order. Thankfully, the creators of The Super Mario Bros Movie have found a way forward. Starting of course with Mario himself, who’s given a relatable down-on-his-luck backstory to get audiences on his side. When his plumbing business becomes more of a laughingstock than a success, he and his brother Luigi make a last ditch attempt to save the city of Brooklyn from a disastrous busted water main. In their attempts to shock the world with their pipe skills, they’re sucked into a portal and whisked away to the Mushroom Kingdom. The hows and whys of The Super Mario Bros Movie will likely have you head scratching to oblivion, which is a fact the film is keenly aware of. The movie moves through plot points at a clip barely giving you a chance to pick them apart. In contrast is the film’s treatment of its characters whose motivations couldn’t be more clearly defined. An emphasis on character through action makes Mario’s Wizard of Oz-esque adventure an easy pill to swallow, even if viewers might find its nonsensical plot development a little disorienting.  The voice actors in play give those characters justice, with Jack Black as the film’s shining star giving it his all as the villain Bowser. Charlie Day and Chris Pratt pull off the brotherly bond of Mario and Luigi. Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach is relatably regal, Keegan Michael-Key finds a way to make the annoying sidekick of Toad more endearing than irritating, and Seth Rogen’s Donkey Kong sounds like Seth Rogen. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.  The film is chock-full of Easter eggs for eagle eyed fans, but never at the cost of the movie’s momentum. The plot is simplistic, but rooted in character, that makes you care why it’s all taking place. The animated action is exhilarating, with a clever twist on Mario’s two dimensional origins. Fans of The Mario Bros can take to the streets and cheer, as justice gets done to the characters they covet. "
"Apr 10, 2023",positive,"The Super Mario Brothers Movie is a sweet, funny, action packed and beautifully animated film with a touching underdog story, some fantastic world building that honors the game, and great VO work from this cast, especially Chris Pratt and Jack Black.

"Apr 9, 2023",neutral,"It’s fan service above all else, regressively so. Structuring a threadbare story around iconography linked to source material just isn’t enough."
"Apr 9, 2023",positive," Super Mario Bros. has been one of the most popular video games for nearly 40 years, and watching the joyous, colorful new film concoction, it’s easy to see why. It’s not just that the story of two brothers getting trapped in a portal is fun for kids. It’s the added notion that two brothers can stick together no matter what obstacle is in their path, even if it’s a villain named Bowser. Directed by Aaron Horvarth and Michael Jelnic, Super Mario Bros. gains a lot from its message of brotherly love. Those who play video games know how bad these updates can be (do we even need to mention the live action Super Mario movie from 1993?). Fans are tired of seeing their favorite IP ruined on screen at this point. But this one stays true to the source material visually and narratively, and it’s packed with so many easter eggs that one has to wonder if the Easter release date is some sort of meta joke. Anyone who has played the game will recognize the callbacks, from the title card to the intro of Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), who arrive on screen to Koji Kando’s original score. Against a backdrop of Brooklyn apartments, the pair set out on their very first plumbing gig, which suitably lands them in hot water. When Luigi falls down a pipe and disappears, Mario embarks on a mission to save his brother from the clutches of Bowser (Jack Black), the turtle intent on taking over Mushroom Kingdom. With the help of Princess Peach (Anya-Taylor Joy), he learns to navigate this terrain, which has been made to look like a floating obstacle course. The animated levels are brought to life by Nintendo and Illumination Entertainment (best known for the Despicable Me and Minions movies), along with the characters Mario encounters along the way. There’s a fight scene with Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), a showdown with Kong (Seth Rogen) and a finale with Bowser, all of which come together in a wonderfully appealing mashup. As it turns out, if you write a funny script and hire talented actors to voice it, it doesn’t really matter if the movie is a bunch of people running around in overalls saying things like “game on!” As long as the wow-factor is there, we’re happy to watch Mario deliver lines over a busy screen. Pratt turns in a winning, wonderful and whimsical performance as the titular hero. With his spry voice, he brings a sense of humanity to the proceedings, which would not have been the case had he stuck to the game’s Italian accent. When he discovers his brother’s location, the character sounds like he’s going to cry instead of bake a pizza. Super Mario Bros.’ plot is simple and its emotions are easy to understand–it’s clearly geared toward kids– but it’s also a wily adventure for all. When Mario eventually reconnects with Luigi, it’s a moment that lands with the intended emotional bang, instead of the thud seen in other cartoon movies. It’s a rarity in animation, and Hovarth brings the right amount of depth to make us really believe in the brothers’ relationship. As for the special effects? They’re winners too.

"Apr 9, 2023",negative," Kids will probably love this scattershot dash through Nintendo’s most popular properties. But then kids, rarely the most discerning audience members at the best of times, will routinely mistake familiarity for fun – something that this lazy picture exploits extensively. Musical motifs from beloved games, minor characters, nods to the Mario legacy: all were greeted with shrieks of excitable recognition at the screening I attended. The Super Mario Bros Movie is a frantic Easter egg hunt of a film that does the bare minimum to please its loyal existing fanbase. Those less enthralled by the antics of the moustachioed Italian plumber will wonder which of Donkey Kong’s weaponised barrels this joyless, noisy mess was scraped from."
"Apr 9, 2023",positive,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie was made for the fans. If you love the Mario games, or Nintendo in general, you'll have a lot of fun."
"Apr 8, 2023",neutral,"'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is super-nostalgic but not super-fun.  Granted, I haven't regularly played home video games since NBA Jam, circa 1995."
"Apr 8, 2023",negative," If I were younger or less secure in my position as a film critic, I would probably spend more time trying to emphasize that I went into The Super Mario Bros. Movie with the so-called “open mind.” While the NES and Super NES platforms had their heyday while I was in graduate school, meaning that I don’t have the same fond memories of them that I do for the Atari 2600 or arcade versions of Donkey Kong, they still elicit deep nostalgia in me. I spent hours playing Dr. Mario on the Gameboy and I cherish the recollections of vacations I spent getting through Donkey Kong Country 2 and 3 and Mario Kart at my own brother’s home.  That openness lasted….ten minutes maybe? The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn’t sink to the level of outright badness, but only because it never even tries to rise above the level of a ninety-minute commercial. Criticisms, such as they are, probably begin and end with the story. Mario and Luigi live in either our world or a multiverse, animated version of it. Either way, they are magically transformed into the land of Toad, Princess, and Bowser, which has no backstory beyond that Bowser wants to marry Peach.  Mario and Luigi are affable losers, but losers nevertheless. They’ve just spent a bunch of money on a television commercial that nets them one plumbing job. They are to fix a leaky faucet. It is a pedestrian plumbing job at which they fail miserably, validating the criticism of their scoffers (including their family) that advertising their services was a colossal waste of money. One might expect — I know I certainly did — that the purpose of making them put down and put upon in the real world is so that the magical world would be a welcome transformation, reminding kids of the escape value of video games where anyone who is not valued in the world around them can still be the hero. But when they get to Nintendoverse (or Toadland or Princessville or whatever it might be called), Luigi is immediately captured and Mario is shown to be equally incompetent in this world. Peach has an obstacle course that he has to complete to prove that he is worthy to accompany her, but after the obligatory montage (“even Rocky had a montage”), he still can’t do it.  One might expect — I know I certainly did — that this failure would be the setup for a more satisfying success when the stakes are on the line, but no. Peach continues to channel her inner Lara Croft and Mario continues to channel his inner Scott Pilgrim…. A word too about Luigi’s capture. He’s banished to a hanging cage for most of the movie, making the film’s first and third-act messaging about brotherhood and teamwork being the key to success oddly pointless. I suspect the creative team feared that a traditional plumber rescuing the princess from a monster story might alienate a 21st-century audience, but the movie doesn’t so much deconstruct the sexist parts of the game and fairytale mythology as ignore them. And really, is a Beauty and the Beast reconstruction where a feisty princess agrees to marry so that an all-powerful dictator agrees not to kill her people really any more egalitarian? Confusingly, the only one seeming to even try is Jack Black as Bowser. And while he does draw the occasional chuckle for channeling his School of Rock/High Fidelity charming doofus persona that makes the sexual predation at the heart of the storyline less sinister but no less gross. It’s hard to take him seriously as a threat, so maybe little kids won’t be scared. But absent any real menace, there are no stakes, and the heroes seem that much lamer for not being able to outwit or outfight a doofus.  I wasn’t expecting Pixar, but the heroes end where they started, not having been transformed by their experiences or learning anything from them. If the goal was to remind us how much fun some of these games were back in the day, mission accomplished, I guess. If the goal was to make us want to play them again or play their descendants on new platforms, the film is an epic failure. "
"Apr 8, 2023",positive," The curse of the video game movie seems over. A string of successful hits turned around the genre in the past few years. Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, Uncharted, and Mortal Kombat all landed positive praise. The Last of Us just dominated television. However, none of these hold a candle to the worldwide appeal of Super Mario. Thirty years after the original film, the world’s favorite plumbers return to the big screen. Leaning heavily into nostalgia The Super Mario Bros. Movie delivers fun action sequences. However, an over-reliance on Easter Eggs and pop music dampens the fun.  Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, The Super Mario Bros. Movie follows the titular brothers as they begin an unusual adventure. Trying to kickstart their fledgling business, Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) dive into the sewers. Their local Brooklyn neighborhood is flooding, and when they get down to the pipes, they are sucked into another world. When the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black) captures Luigi, Mario learns how to beat the King Koopa with the help of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Their adventure takes them throughout the Mushroom Kingdom and Kong Kingdom.  The animation from Illumination takes a giant step up from the Minions films. The Mushroom Kingdom bursts to life with effervescent colors. These designs help sell us to the world. At times, The Super Mario Bros. Movie overuses the side scroller blocks. However, the settings usually make sense. Too much time is spent in our “real world,” which ultimately hurts the movie. These designs, while loaded with Easter Eggs, are far less visually intriguing. The visuals do an excellent job of helping to build out the world. Luckily The Super Mario Bros. Movie opts for show rather than tell for most of these moments. As characters gain new power-ups and skills, the directors communicate the changes through action set pieces and montages. Even showing a horde of Yoshis run through the background helps the world build.  However, the constant use of Easter eggs undermines some of these moments. Accents, costumes, and tech all comes straight from the games. The Super Mario Bros. Movie often becomes too self-aware for its own good. Undermining the feelings of its characters becomes somewhat commonplace. Even mushrooms catch stray bullets from the protagonist.  Simultaneously, Illumination returns to an odd problem they’ve developed across their films. Simply labeling a character as cute, and using that as a joke, feels more like a formula than a genuine comedic moment. The Super Mario Bros. Movie takes that issue to the extreme, with at least three characters using “cute” or “adorable” as the punchline. It might not be so glaring if this issue did not cross franchises, including Despicable Me, The Grinch, and Sing.  The vocal performances greatly vary in quality, but overall the ensemble keeps us engaged. Taylor-Joy’s Peach feels off at times but also steals the film for stretches. This comes, in part, because of how the screenwriters clearly use Super Princess Peach as inspiration. Black easily wins the movie with his growling, comedic, and menacing Bowser. He will, and should, be the takeaway for most. Pratt and Day get to drop the caricature accents, but even then, Pratt struggles. Day brings chaos to Luigi, which undeniably works.  Perhaps the most glaring issue that stands out in The Super Mario Bros. Movie comes in the form of source music. Boasting a soundtrack with a half dozen extremely well know pop hits makes little sense. Super Mario long established the best soundtrack in the video game world. The tracks are iconic in their own right. It’s odd to go this route with the music. "
"Apr 8, 2023",negative," It has been 30 years since audiences were treated to a big-screen iteration of the beloved Nintendo video game series Super Mario Bros., with Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo starring as the titular Brooklyn siblings and plumbers-turned-heroes, Mario and Luigi. That live-action adaptation, however, was at the time universally loathed by critics and audiences alike and ultimately failed to recoup its hefty budget, resulting in Nintendo CEOs’ refusal to license out the property in fear of another gargantuan boondoggle. It was only upon meeting with Chris Meledandri, the head of animation studio Illumination — otherwise known as the house that Despicable Me built — that Nintendo had a change of heart, leading to this week’s release of the fully-animated The Super Mario Bros. Movie.  It was always a curious decision why Disney decided to go the live-action route all those years ago, as the property had generally catered to a younger demographic, and the derring-do involved in the franchise’s action seemed nearly impossible to replicate in the real world — especially when you have a 50-year-old actor playing the bouncy lead character, traversing a fantastical world made up of giant talking turtles and mushrooms. 1993’s version was indeed an undeniable shitshow on its face, but it also had something resembling a point of view and clear personality, elements sorely lacking from 2023’s exercise in brand extension, the definition of art by committee; even to dub the final product “soulless” wouldn’t be quite accurate, as that would imply there were ever aspirations for something greater than nostalgia. Make no mistake, while the candy-colored animation and emphasis on kinetic action sequences suggests that the film is intended for children, it’s really a ploy for those 25- to 55-year-olds who have nothing but fond memories of playing the original series and its various spin-offs, wistful in their longing for a simpler time (even as a good percentage of that demo still spend their current free time… playing video games). The snake is indeed eating its own tale, resulting in a movie that is nothing but callbacks and Easter eggs to the video games themselves, allowing its older viewers to furiously masturbate with one hand while high-fiving their bud with the other, a self-congratulatory chorus of “I know what that is!” filling auditoriums across the country.  It’s predictable, then, that The Super Mario Bros. Movie has only the faintest wisp of a plot. Koopa baddie Bowser (Jack Black) plans to attack the appropriately named Mushroom Kingdom in a last-ditch effort to woo his beloved, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Meanwhile, Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) have just started their own plumbing business after enduring constant harassment from former boss, Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco), a move which seems both entirely understandable and healthy, but one which causes Mario’s father to call him both a bum and a loser, because animated films are seemingly only a vessel for Daddy Issues these days. It’s while trying to stop a massive line break in the sewers of Brooklyn that the two brothers are sucked through a magical warp pipe and transported to another dimension, one with a giant anthropomorphized turtle monster who desperately wants to make love to a human. They inadvertently get separated on their journey, with Mario winding up in the aforementioned Mushroom Kingdom while Luigi is forced to endure various tortures at the hands of one King Bowser. Mario ultimately teams up with Princess Peach in an effort to save both the kingdom and his little brother, relying on some help from raging narcissist Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) along the way. And there we are. So much of the action in The Super Mario Bros. Movie is predicated on the gameplay itself, which certainly makes sense in theory, but is rendered here with all of the subtlety of a barrel-throwing gorilla, consistency be damned. The end result feels as though someone threw the entire series in a Cuisinart and pressed “pulverize.” A car race a la Mario Kart? Yep. Mario’s raccoon suit from part three? You bet. Princess Peach’s floating dress from part two? Yes, it’s all here, but incorporated in the most facile ways possible. The animation is as obvious as the film’s desperation for audience approval, a combination of photorealistic backgrounds and characters with bulbous, over-exaggerated features that stick out like sore thumbs. The voice work is likewise generally uninspired, with Pratt spitting out a “Mamma mia!” every couple of minutes and speaking of his brother with a passionate reverence that brings to mind not a beloved sibling, but a particularly successful Grindr hook-up. Black tries his hardest and predictably fares best, even getting to perform an ‘80s-era pop rock power ballad that recalls some of the lesser works of his own Tenacious D, but even that is presented in a way that feels more Spring Breakers and less music video, which sounds awesome in theory but really just reminds audience members that they could be watching that masterpiece instead of this dung heap.  Props, however, are due for composer Brian Tyler, who takes the various themes of the original games and gives them a wholly appropriate and energized 21st-century spin that captivates more than anything else on screen. Indeed, Tyler succeeds where directors Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath completely fail — specifically, in delivering a modern update that feels simultaneously singular and reverent. The only thing this Super Mario Bros. has admiration for are the contents of the audience’s wallets, all in the name of hollow nostalgia-baiting, and while also delivering a message that, to those unfamiliar with the series, basically amounts to: “You will need performance-enhancing drugs to defeat your enemy and get the girl.” On second thought, maybe this really is a movie for our current time. Let’s-a go!"
"Apr 8, 2023",positive,The creative team seems to rely heavily on the nostalgia and the silliness of it all over taking this in a bold and new direction like The LEGO Movie. 
"Apr 8, 2023",positive,"""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is bombastic, silly and full of energy. Driven by spectacular voice work provided by an A-list cast the film gets props for both being able to appeal to fans of the game and just regular viewers. It's a very fun watch."
"Apr 8, 2023",positive," On September 13th, 1985, the world of video games and entertainment changed forever with Nintendo’s release of Super Mario Bros. While the character first appeared in 1981’s Donkey Kong, this was the first game that would feature Mario and his brother Luigi. Not only did the game save the video game industry after the crash of the early 80s, but it was also critically acclaimed. The game sold over 58 million units throughout its run and created two giant pop culture stars in Mario and Luigi. It rose Nintendo to become one of the most prominent companies in the world. Over the past 38 years, numerous games and increased popularity culminated with the first attempt to bring the famous plumbers to film. 1993’s Super Mario Bros. has become a cult classic, but upon initial release was both a critical and commercial failure as it grossed only $38.9 million. That put the plumbers back into the video game world until 2023 when Illumination and Universal released The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie warps you back into childhood with nostalgia and dino eggs. Impeccably animated with a score that’s an utter delight, the film captures the charm and appeal the game has evoked for decades. The Super Mario Bros. Movie follows Brooklyn’s favorite plumbers, Mario and Luigi. Labeled by their old boss as failures and offered little to no support by their family, the brothers spend their life savings on advertising their business with an 80’s style-commercial, which also homages the old Super Mario Bros. cartoon that starred the late, great Captain Lou Albano. With little to no luck on their side, Mario takes things into his own hands when an overflowing water main is uncontainable. What starts as two brothers trying to do what’s best turns into a descent for Mario into the mushroom kingdom, while Luigi falls into the Dark Lands. While his brother is stuck in the Dark Lands, Mario enlists the help of Princess Peach and a lovely Toad before Bowser gets his hands on him. Matthew Fogel’s screenplay track record can be considered widely acclaimed as it has included the Illumination sequel Minions, Big Momma’s House, and The Lego Movie. With The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Fogel maintains a simplicity to his script that followed the same formula as the game which leads to the ultimate success of the film’s intentions. As a result, Fogel, Horvath, and Jelenic’s goal to create an action-adventure rich with easter eggs for gamers worldwide was successful. The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s animation is sensational. In an era where most animated films are immaculately animated, the film offers some of the most stunning and visually engaging animations in quite some time; beautifully capturing the essence of the games. Speaking on the nature of the games, it’s hard to ignore Brian Tyler and Koji Kondo’s nostalgic score, which fully engrosses you in the world of Mario and is one, if not the most iconic, video game scores of all time. On the performance side of things, the elephant in the room that was Chris Pratt as Mario, can be laid to rest as Pratt is quite good as Mario, lending his voice to create a new iteration of the iconic plumber. While Charlie Day’s Luigi is welcomed, he, unfortunately, takes a back seat in the film. Anya Taylor-Joy’s Princess Peach and Jack Black’s Bowser are the standouts. Joy is fierce as the princess of the mushroom kingdom. At the same time, Black is downright hilarious with a musical moment that will warrant a future Bowser’s musical selections drop on Apple Music and Spotify. The Super Mario Bros. Movie does fall into the Illumination tropes with overuse of modern music, that often leads to cringe-worthy moments, however, the totality of The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a high score and one that will lead gamers across the country to scream “wahoo” in unison."
"Apr 8, 2023",negative," The most positive praise that can be bestowed on The Super Mario Bros Movie is that it’s not as bad as 1993’s Super Mario Bros. Unless this film was an unfocussed mess of plotlines and motivations, it’s a better picture almost by default. The Illumination Animation studio doesn’t screw around when it comes to developing animated movies aimed to please general audiences. They also don’t add much flair to make them stand out amid the tougher competition of Pixar and Dreamworks. Whereas other animated studios always felt like they were developing complete stories, Illumination’s features always felt like a patchwork of funny vignettes that rarely culminate all that well. The Super Mario Bros Movie is not that much different. It tries to find many fun things to do with the Mario franchise, coats it with frenetic animated slapstick sequences, plops on a jukebox soundtrack, and unleashes an onslaught of pop-culture references. I can only assume many Nintendo fans will be too busy counting all the citations to various Mario games to notice how little the characters are explored in this overstuffed lost-world fantasy crammed into 90 minutes.Mario’s Many Mini ArcsThe characters have compelling setups but need more room to advance their plight and personality. Mario (Chris Pratt) has two prime dilemmas amid his plumbing business. He feels responsible for protecting his brother Luigi (Charlie Day), who places too much faith in his never-gives-up brother. There’s also a point of family pride in how Mario wants to prove his dreams are worth pursuing to his scrutinizing family.source: Universal PicturesHad the film been primarily about these concerns, it might’ve made for an enticing adventure. The problem is that once the story progresses to the magical land of the Mushroom Kingdom, we’re assaulted with even more characters who all have different motivations and lack arcs for them. Even though he seems more content playing music, the evil Bowser (Jack Black) wants to rule kingdoms and marry Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). As for Peach, she has her own origin story that is brought up once and never spoken of again as she focuses all her attention on making sure her mushroom subjects don’t become pizza toppings.The nemesis Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) has so little to work with that it’s surprising he has issues to overcome with his cranky dad (Fred Armisen). But with so little time spent with this character, Donkey Kong honestly comes off more like Seth Rogen, complete with his trademark laugh. So many characters fight for the screen that it’s no wonder Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) is reduced to just being a brave and devoted mushroom with no real reason given for such undying allegiance.Lavish LevelsAs far as the animation goes, the many fantastical worlds look nice. Every island has personality and style, from Bowser’s Badlands to Kong Island. The Mushroom Kingdom has an elaborate cityscape of pipes, shops, and many anthropomorphic mushrooms milling about every corner.source: Universal PicturesCompared to films like Sonic, which offered empty fantasy worlds loaded with a lot of nothing, it was refreshing to see a video game movie place so much care into the setting.And, yet, so many of these locations are explicitly built to play out like video games. Even the opening scenes in Brooklyn are framed by the side-scrolling platform view to remind the viewer of the games constantly. To the film’s credit, if you keep the audience locked into this platformer set-piece assembly, they might as well look good. As much as Kong Island’s road system appears over-the-top, it makes for a fun ride with the characters zooming about it on go-karts.Mamma Mia, the References!Though the fantasy elements are well presented, so much of the film feels reliant on its references to Nintendo. Within the first three minutes of introducing the Mario Bros, the film packs in the theme of The Super Mario Bros Super Show, the Gamecube start-up music, a reference to Wrecking Crew, and a cameo by Charles Martinet, the original voice of Mario.While there’s nothing wrong with peppering a picture like this with Nintendo’s bountiful treasure trove of IPs, the truckloads of citations become exhaustive, especially when the film keeps shoving them in your face. Don’t worry about looking for Diddy Kong in the crowd of Kongs during the big arena sequence; he’ll be called out by name and occupy the frame. Don’t, however, expect Diddy Kong to do anything genuinely funny. Like so many video game movies before it, this one dollops its visuals with pop-culture identities meant to be more exciting for their presence than their purpose. Watching Diddy Kong being recognized in the movie is about as exciting as seeing the electronic billboard for Coke in Blade Runner.source: Universal PicturesEasy Mode FantasyThroughout the picture, there’s this tone about treating every inch of this Mario adventure with delicacy. Not so much a sensitivity to ensuring a good film will be made but more like wrapping every element in plastic wrap so it won’t break. After all, nobody wants another 1993’s Super Mario Bros movie, right?This careful nature results in a film that plays it far too safe with its fantasy adventure. There’s a cohesive plot, a well-defined world, and stylish action moments. But rarely does the film feel like it finds a groove where it can have all the fun with a Mario movie. More of the mechanics of video games feel like they’re given a playfulness than anything else that could be staged humorously. And while it was silly to watch a Mario death “Game Over” montage, there’s only so much comedy that can be evoked from such a standard slapstick.It’s Still An Illumination MovieAlthough this film stands out as one of the better films to come out of Illumination, it’s still bound by all of the studio’s lukewarm hallmarks. Despite the film featuring many orchestral renditions of all the familiar Mario music, the jukebox is fired up for much of the action-based scenes. Guess which popular music was used for Mario’s training montage, and you’ll probably be right.source: Universal PicturesThe other problem with Illumination’s films is that they always feel like more of a series of set pieces that overshadow most of the script. This film succumbs to the same difficulties, resulting in character arcs that are either treated like bookends or fall off the map amid all the fast-paced action. This makes the film all the more frustrating, considering it works in bits and pieces, but doesn’t come together by the end, at least in terms of developing its ensemble.Conclusion: The Super Mario Bros MovieMario’s animated movie debut is too safe and passive, more content with referencing its source material than playing with it. I kept waiting for the film to take off and find that special power-up to make this video game icon shine bright. Sadly, it mostly just gives the Italian plumber the Illumination makeover treatment, dressing the character up in a flashy animated film fit for families, familiar enough for box office success, and routine in its vignettes of good ideas that never amount to a great movie.If you’re a hardcore Mario and Nintendo fan, I’d probably recommend the film on its surface levels of slathering so much Nintendo product into its animation. But much like Nintendo’s previous commercial movie, The Wizard, there’s only so much Nintendo one can take before the product-placement strings become visibly distracting. Its fans will likely revere it for its passable presentations, bringing the format of platform gaming into movies, and once more breaking the long-debunked myth of the “video game movie curse.” As for everyone else, it’ll likely be another Illumination distraction spruced up in a red hat, blue overalls, and mustache, routinely reminding you that Nintendo exists.The Super Mario Brothers Movie will be released in theaters on April 5, 2023!Watch The Super Mario BrothersPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

To the film’s credit, if you keep the audience locked into this platformer set-piece assembly, they might as well look good. As much as Kong Island’s road system appears over-the-top, it makes for a fun ride with the characters zooming about it on go-karts.Mamma Mia, the References!Though the fantasy elements are well presented, so much of the film feels reliant on its references to Nintendo. Within the first three minutes of introducing the Mario Bros, the film packs in the theme of The Super Mario Bros Super Show, the Gamecube start-up music, a reference to Wrecking Crew, and a cameo by Charles Martinet, the original voice of Mario.While there’s nothing wrong with peppering a picture like this with Nintendo’s bountiful treasure trove of IPs, the truckloads of citations become exhaustive, especially when the film keeps shoving them in your face. Don’t worry about looking for Diddy Kong in the crowd of Kongs during the big arena sequence; he’ll be called out by name and occupy the frame. Don’t, however, expect Diddy Kong to do anything genuinely funny. Like so many video game movies before it, this one dollops its visuals with pop-culture identities meant to be more exciting for their presence than their purpose. Watching Diddy Kong being recognized in the movie is about as exciting as seeing the electronic billboard for Coke in Blade Runner.source: Universal PicturesEasy Mode FantasyThroughout the picture, there’s this tone about treating every inch of this Mario adventure with delicacy. Not so much a sensitivity to ensuring a good film will be made but more like wrapping every element in plastic wrap so it won’t break. After all, nobody wants another 1993’s Super Mario Bros movie, right?This careful nature results in a film that plays it far too safe with its fantasy adventure. There’s a cohesive plot, a well-defined world, and stylish action moments. But rarely does the film feel like it finds a groove where it can have all the fun with a Mario movie. More of the mechanics of video games feel like they’re given a playfulness than anything else that could be staged humorously. And while it was silly to watch a Mario death “Game Over” montage, there’s only so much comedy that can be evoked from such a standard slapstick.It’s Still An Illumination MovieAlthough this film stands out as one of the better films to come out of Illumination, it’s still bound by all of the studio’s lukewarm hallmarks. Despite the film featuring many orchestral renditions of all the familiar Mario music, the jukebox is fired up for much of the action-based scenes. Guess which popular music was used for Mario’s training montage, and you’ll probably be right.source: Universal PicturesThe other problem with Illumination’s films is that they always feel like more of a series of set pieces that overshadow most of the script. This film succumbs to the same difficulties, resulting in character arcs that are either treated like bookends or fall off the map amid all the fast-paced action. This makes the film all the more frustrating, considering it works in bits and pieces, but doesn’t come together by the end, at least in terms of developing its ensemble.Conclusion: The Super Mario Bros MovieMario’s animated movie debut is too safe and passive, more content with referencing its source material than playing with it. I kept waiting for the film to take off and find that special power-up to make this video game icon shine bright.

But much like Nintendo’s previous commercial movie, The Wizard, there’s only so much Nintendo one can take before the product-placement strings become visibly distracting. Its fans will likely revere it for its passable presentations, bringing the format of platform gaming into movies, and once more breaking the long-debunked myth of the “video game movie curse.” As for everyone else, it’ll likely be another Illumination distraction spruced up in a red hat, blue overalls, and mustache, routinely reminding you that Nintendo exists.The Super Mario Brothers Movie will be released in theaters on April 5, 2023!Watch The Super Mario BrothersPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

"Apr 8, 2023",positive,"If 2023's The Super Mario Bros Movie is a response to its predecessor, it's a happily dutiful one, doing its utmost to copy the video game. The strongest feeling it inspires: making viewers want to bust out their old NES or SNES or Game Boy."
"Apr 7, 2023",positive," This Week: Kevin starts things off with a look at the box office, then the hubbub surrounding the rebooting of the Harry Potter franchise. Next, he looks at new trailers for Barbie and Blue Beetle. Later, he reviews The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Air, Paint, Chupa and On a Wing and a Prayer. Finally, he wraps things up with the Home-Cinema Round-Up with a spotlight on Rick & Morty: Season 6."
"Apr 7, 2023",positive," Illumination animation studio, the big brain behind the Despicable Me trilogy and the lesser brain behind the recent Minions: The Rise of Gru and ho-hum sequels to Sing and The Secret Life of Pets, turns in this serviceable adaptation of the beloved Nintendo franchise. It’s the best outcome we could have hoped for: fun for kids; very okay for adults. It is unfortunate that two directors and a screenwriter (Matthew Fogel) felt the need to shoehorn in an extended family and – groan – Oedipal crisis for both Mario and Donkey Kong. Despite this misstep, the film belts along with an assault of candy colours and a commendable command of canonical detail. Remember when, at the very nadir of video-game adaptations, Alicia Vikander’s Tomb Raider hastily did something or other with shapes and colours during the final sequence of the 2018 film? Have no fear. Super Mario Bros, silly while leaning heavily into Mario Kart 8, buzzily incorporates the platform game that inspires it. Chase scenes and chapters lovingly re-create the sensation and pace of gameplay, a throwback to the golden age of New Games Journalism. The plot, in other respects, is unlikely to be confused with Christopher Nolan’s Memento. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are brothers running a new plumbing business in Brooklyn. A mysterious portal leads them to the Mushroom Kingdom, where Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) is about to be  assailed (and wooed) by the tyrannical Bowser (Jack Black). Can Mario find his brother, save the kingdom and power up again and again? Well, sure. Some of the voice cast is, arguably, overfamiliar, but it’s always a pleasure to encounter Black and Keegan-Michael Key. The ever-popular 1980s aesthetic – cue A-ha, Bonnie Tyler and an amusing faux-contemporaneous TV commercial – adds bounce and nostalgia for accompanying parents. Sensitive children beware: the PG rating stems from many barrel-related injuries. Shout out to game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. There’s something magical about being in a cinema full of nine-year-olds who are just as excited as this writer was for the same franchise at the same age. But we’ll go to our graves disputing that blue-mushroom wear-off."
"Apr 7, 2023",neutral,"Nostalgia might be the only thing that warps you through this one dimensional adaptation. Though peppered with candy coated visuals and chock full of easter eggs for hardcore Nintendo fans, the story (or lack thereof) leaves one wanting a power up. "
"Apr 7, 2023",negative," Larry Mantle and LAist film critics Claudia Puig, Peter Rainer and Charles Solomon review this weekend’s new movie releases in theaters, streaming, and on demand platforms. Larry Mantle and LAist film critics Claudia Puig, Peter Rainer and Charles Solomon review this weekend’s new movie releases in theaters, streaming, and on demand platforms. In recent years, Warner Bros. has become known for expansive franchises like Harry Potter and the DC universe. However, the famous film studio first started out in film noir with actors Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis and in classic animation with the iconic characters of the Looney Tunes. In his new book “Warner Bros: 100 Years Of Storytelling,” filmmaker, writer, and photographer Mark Vieira chronicles the legendary studio’s history. Vieira joins Larry to discuss the studio’s origins as an immigrant family business between Polish-Jewish brothers to its controversial rise with movies like “A Clockwork Orange” and “The Exorcist.”"
"Apr 7, 2023",positive," But, to me, nor does a sport where towering athletes have to throw a ball into a hoop that is generally only three and a half feet above them. What makes basketball entertaining is the speed at which it’s played.What makes Air so much fun is the deft humour of its stars Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Viola Davis. Damon is the lead, playing wheeler dealer basketball obsessive Sonny Vaccaro who needs to convince multiple doubters that Nike can sign rookie university player Jordan. Back in 1984, when this film based on a true story is set, Nike was mainly known for making jogging shoes and Jordan preferred the far cooler Adidas brand. Jogging jokes are quite literally a running gag throughout the film.Affleck plays Nike co-founder Phil Knight, who tries his best to convert the out-of-shape Vaccaro to breathing exercises. Making fun of the Eighties is an easy target, although I have seen the old “wow, they have a phone in a car” scene too often. DIRECTOR Guy Ritchie gives viewers a textbook serving of his classic of action caper, with lots of violence, silly accents, slick tailoring and comic twists. Wine-swigging and sweary spy Orson Fortune (Jason Statham) is enlisted on a mission to prevent sleazy arms dealer Greg Simmonds (Hugh Grant, deploying a Michael Caine drawl) selling lethal technology to a faction of villainous wrong’uns. With his fellow operatives, Sarah (White Lotus’s Aubrey Plaza) and JJ (Rapper Bugzy Malone), he enlists Hollywood actor Danny Francesco (Josh Hartnett) and goes undercover, jetting off to exotic locations to save the world. The punch-up-packed plot lacks enough substance to sustain almost two hours’ screen time, no matter how much you love a good fight scene or explosion. The perky cast all appear to be having a genuine whale of a time with Grant and Plaza in particular relishing slam-dunking their droll, facetious one-liners. This 90-minute bombastic caper is chock-a-block with high-octane references and colourful set pieces to bolster what is a rather simple story about never giving up. Chris Pratt and Charlie Day take on voice duty for Mario and his timid brother Luigi and, thankfully, the stereotypical Italian accents are kept to a minimum. The Brooklyn plumbing duo are a laughing stock to their friends but when they get sucked into a pipe and delivered to the magical realm of the Mushroom Kingdom, they get a chance to play heroes. Those honours go out to Keegan Michael Key’s spunky Toad, Seth Rogen’s macho Donkey Kong, and Jack Black’s antagonist Bowser whose comic delivery is note-perfect."
"Apr 7, 2023",positive," The Pitch: Okay, there are these two brothers, see? And they’re plumbers. In fact, the Mario brothers (Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi) have just opened up their own plumbing business, though despite Mario’s natural agility, business could be better. That’s why, when a massive water emergency shakes up their home borough of Brooklyn, they leap at the chance to save their borough — only to stumble upon a mysterious pipe, deep within the sewers, that transports them away to a wild new universe. Good News, Moms and Dads: I’ll just cut to the chase here, for any parents reading this — it might not be the best film of the year, but you’re going to be able to watch The Super Mario Bros. Movie more than once without losing your dang mind. Can’t say for sure how many repeat viewings it’ll hold up under, but the new animated film, clocking in at a tight 93 minutes, is a fast-paced, visually appealing, and overall loving tribute to the Nintendo games enjoyed now by multiple generations. That’s games, plural, for a reason: The pretty thin narrative somehow also manages to feel a little overstuffed, in order to incorporate both another iconic Nintendo character (Donkey Kong, voiced by Seth Rogen) as well as an extended sequence bringing the beloved Mario Kart franchise to the screen. (The sequence is done well, but… real talk, the Wachowskis did it better.) The needle drops are sometimes fun but wielded with brute force — we’re talking Beastie Boys’ “No Sleep Till Brooklyn” blaring as the brothers run through the streets of Brooklyn. Fortunately, there’s no attempt at dated topical humor, no grating musical numbers. (Black’s Bowser gets all the songs, leaning hard on his heavy metal chops, and they’re pretty good.) Plus, any opportunity directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic have to include a Nintendo Easter egg… you’d better believe they use it."
"Apr 7, 2023",negative,It’s emotionally bland and yet garish enough to psychologically sedate the pre-teen Easter audience.
"Apr 7, 2023",positive," Is the Nintendo world the most untapped piece of IP? Mario, Luigi and the rest of the crew have dominated video game culture for over 40 years. Yet, a theatrical feature film has not been attempted since the ill-fated 1993 campfest starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper. Gone are the steampunk influences and live action hamminess. Universal’s new foray into the mushroom kingdom is a bright, glossy and impressive animated tale that bears appropriate semblance to the game, while also having the zany plushness of an Illumination tale... While the Super Mario world is well-rendered through animation, is the movie good enough to warrant going to theaters rather than playing the video game at home? When we meet Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), they are Brooklyn plumbers looking to start their own business, much to the chagrin of their family and former boss, Spike. A plumbing emergency in the streets of Brooklyn prompts the two brothers to hop into action and prove themselves as the area’s premiere plumbers. Zany calamity ensues, with both brothers ending up far below the surface of the city where they discover a green pipe. This pipe sucks both of them up, spitting them out into very different lands. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, a technicolor wonderland that resembles Munchkinland, if all the Munchkins had mushroom-like hats. Toad (Keegan Michael-Key) decides to help the outsider, taking him to see Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Meanwhile, Luigi crash lands in the Dark Lands, getting almost immediately captured by the nefarious Bowser. Mario and Peach team up to defeat Bowser, saving Luigi and the Mushroom Kingdom in one swoop. From the moment Mario touches down in the mushroom kingdom, we’re thrust into a goofy adventure. The film will often revert to a flat, 2D-like display where our characters go up and down various platforms and through colorful pipes, dodging obstacles and hitting power ups along the way at super speed. Character development takes a backseat to razzle dazzle. Mario’s greatest change from beginning to end is learning to stomach mushrooms, a food he despised back home in Brooklyn. What keeps the film from being just a cheap regurgitation of IP points is the enthusiasm and infectious whimsy of the plot. These fun callback moments to the classic games are enhanced by the way they up the ante of the story. Peach trains Mario using what would be a classic level, with disappearing platforms, Piranha Plants, fire bars and more. These are all fun callbacks, but in the context of the film this scene provides an energetic training montage that shows Mario harnessing his inner strength and bonding with Peach, all while guaranteeing to get laughs from kids. When we reach Kong island, Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) and Mario face off in an arena setup that is part Super Smash Bros, with a bit of the 8 bit arcade game sensibilities. It’s so clearly aping a video game level, but still arrives at an objective that moves the story forward. The film may be aiming for fans with these callbacks, but the set pieces and story progression are all squarely aimed at kids, who will likely eat this film up. It’s not as smart or elegant as The Lego Movie, but it’s similarly visually engaging and exciting."
"Apr 7, 2023",positive," I’m pretty sure The Super Mario Bros Movie proves that movie critics are wildly out of touch with audiences when it comes to video game adaptations, and really when it comes to lots of ‘genre’ stuff in general. When I saw that the movie was at a lousy 54% on Rotten Tomatoes I was initially pretty worried. When I went out and read some of the reviews—including reviews lamenting the movie’s story or calling it offensive because Bowser wants to marry Princess Peach against her will—I knew it was more likely because the critics must be crazy. Sure enough, the movie ended up being absolutely delightful. It’s a great, fun, beautifully animated story of Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, Donkey Kong and a colorful, zany cast of Nintendo characters fighting off Bowser and his armies in the Mushroom Kingdom. There’s Mario Kart racing. There’s a Donkey Kong arena battle. It’s wonderful. The music is straight from the games with a nice cinematic once-over. And it’s just the right length: One-and-a-half hours long. The theater I saw it in had lots of very enthusiastic kids, but all the teens and grownups were having fun, too. This is all reflected in the film’s Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score, which currently sits at 96% compared to the grumpy, out-of-touch critics score of 54%. That’s Certified Fresh vs decidedly Rotten. And the critics are wrong on this one, folks. Beyond just the audience score on RT, the CinemaScore for the movie is a solid “A”. Many consider this a much more accurate sampling of moviegoers since that score is taken in post-screening surveys at the theaters themselves rather than just the most enthusiastic fans online. All I can think is that the target audience here is Nintendo fans. Not just kids as some have suggested, but fans of these games going back to when I was a kid. I’m 41 and grew up with Nintendo games and these characters have been as important and dear to me and to many of my peers as any comic book superheroes or Lord Of The Rings characters. There just has never really been a great Mario movie (other than The Wizard) made until now. It’s crazy! Within a week the first really excellent D&D movie and the first really excellent Mario Bros movie came out. What are the chances? In any case, a lot of these movie critics must not play much Mario or know much about Mario because the magic is apparently lost on far too many of them. That’s a shame. This movie is absolutely great, a very faithful, very fun adaptation of one of the most popular and beloved video game franchises of all time. Go see it on the biggest screen you can find!

"Apr 7, 2023",positive," “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is fun, funny, entertaining and tailor made for those who are huge fans of the game. My inner child was grinning from ear to ear, and I commend the filmmakers for successfully presenting the world building, the game details and the iconic tunes by intertwining them with the film’s score. This video game adaptation is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. It features the voices of Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Kay and Seth Rogen. When brothers Mario and Luigi leave their job to open their own plumbing company they face doubt and disappointment from their family. One day, they enter the city’s sewer and come across a magical pipe that takes them to another realm. The brothers are separated and must find a way back to each other. Without exaggerating, I can confess that I was transported back to my childhood. It rekindled specific memories I hadn’t visited in decades. Seven-year-old Rosa would often play Mario Bros on my neighbor’s Nintendo. My family couldn’t afford one so all my experience came from playing with others. Those happy times resurfaced while watching this film, and that nostalgic feeling of joy is something I wholeheartedly appreciate. Every nostalgic cord in my being was momentarily awakened. The animation was beautiful and very authentic to the game. Its colorful aesthetic will appeal to the younger audience, and the runtime is the perfect length to hold their attention. It does feel like a commercial to the variety of characters, games and worlds within this video game franchise. So, parents, you’ve been warned. The voice acting worked very well. Pratt was excellent as Mario but Jack Black takes the MVP trophy. He is perfect as Bowser but it is Black so we already know his singing skills are superb. Although, in second place came Lumalee who had the best one liners and jokes. Taylor-Joy as Peach is also flawless because Anya is Peach in every single sense of the word. Kay as Toad was also great and Day’s Luigi also worked wonderfully. Rogen’s Donkey Kong may be my least favorite out of the bunch, but I didn’t dislike it. The story is simple and formulaic, but I don’t expect a highly complex and layered plot from a video game adaptation. I did buy into the brothers’ dynamic, their bond and their need to succeed. Some funny moments worked for me (maybe it was my inner child having the time of her life), and I relished the abundance of references to the games. If you’re not a big fan of the video game, then I wouldn’t recommend seeing this film. But if you grew up playing or you currently play, then this may be a fun time at the theaters. Overall, “The Super Mario Bros.” Movie is an entertaining adaptation that stays true to its source material. A dream come true to fans who’ve played the game religiously and a visually stunning animated feature for the kiddos.

"Apr 7, 2023",positive," The last time Mario and Luigi were in a big-screen theatrical movie with the 1993 film Super Mario Bros., the film was a gigantic flop, and Nintendo didn’t make motion picture adaptations of its beloved properties for almost 30 years. Nintendo’s longtime ban on film adaptations has finally ended with the new CGI-animated movie, produced by Illumination, The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Depicting the adventures of the iconic video game duo in an animated feature format was the ideal choice for the Brooklyn plumbers. The film faithfully recreates the worlds of Nintendo’s interactive adventures onscreen for a vibrant, fun, and heartwarmingly sweet tale. Animation is the ideal format for adapting the adventures of Mario and Luigi since there is no predilection for grounding the material to make it look more realistic and palatable for a live-action audience. Illumination, and co-directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, embrace the visual look, style, and characters of Nintendo’s games. The animators do not stray far from the established and iconic designs of the worlds and characters of Super Mario Bros., right down to the Mushroom Kingdom, the Cheep Cheeps, Goombas, and Bloopers. They’re all here and appear faithful to their game counterparts. The animators of Illumination went wild to bring the world of the games to life without skimping on all the imaginative, wild concepts. At the heart of , Super Mario Bros. is the bond of its two would-be heroes, Mario (Pratt) and Luigi (Day). The duo just quit their day job as plumbers for the big bully Spike (Maniscalco), and they are now ready to start their own plumbing business, much to the chagrin of their dad (longtime Mario and Luigi video game voice actor Charles Martinet, who thankfully has a role in this picture). With things not going too well after they strike it on their own, Mario seeks to bring the duo some glory by investigating a devastating water leak that threatens to flood all of Brooklyn. Their endeavor causes them to be unwittingly sucked into an underground pipe that transports them to another world, stranding Luigi in the lava-filled Darklands. Meanwhile, Mario is transported to the Mushroom Kingdom, a peaceful land inhabited by sentient mushroom people, such as Toad (Key). The Mushroom Kingdom is soon to be under siege by the despotic King of the Koopas, Bowser (Black), who has stolen a magic Super Star that will grant him the power to rule the world, lest the Mushroom Kingdom’s human ruler, Princess Peach (Taylor-Joy), grants him her hand in marriage. Now, it’s up to Mario and Peach to save her kingdom, Luigi, and stop Bowser once and for all. The Super Mario Bros. tells a very simple story, but it has heart where it counts. The strong bond between Luigi and Mario shines through, even though the duo is separated for most of the film. Mario and Luigi make for charming underdogs who refuse to quit no matter how much they get bullied or beaten down.  The emotionally tortured and belligerent Bowser is a tyrannical monster, but he wants to be loved. The filmmakers lovingly adapt the classic Bowser, and writer Matthew Fogel clearly wrote the character with Jack Black in mind. Black’s casting is perfect, as they incorporate the actor’s gift for music and song as part of Bowser’s personality, which makes for some hilarious musical interludes.  The film’s casting is incredibly solid. Day as Luigi and Black as Bowser are pitch-perfect casting choices. Day’s nasally, scratchy voice is perfect for the cowardly, neurotic Luigi. Black has always been a gifted vocal talent and performer, and Bowser takes full advantage of his range and talents. Chris Pratt was a very controversial choice to play Mario, and that’s understandable. However, it is also understandable that Charles Martinet did not reprise his role as Mario. Considering the film makes Mario and Luigi Brooklyn natives, it would not make much sense for them to speak with heavy Italian accents through most of the film. However, the movie does portray their Italian background which is illustrated when they sometimes speak in Italian-accented phrases.  Pratt’s vocal performance is adequate. He tries to put in the effort, even though he uses a quasi-Brooklyn accent. Pratt does not attempt to use his typical inflection and voice. His vocal performance does not blow you away, and it is a weird attempt by a guy who is not from Brooklyn trying to adopt Brooklynese. It’s not quite as strong a vocal performance as Pratt has done in the past for The LEGO Movie, but it mostly gets the job done. Much is due to the film’s score composed by Brian Tyler. Tyler put considerable effort into creating the score for The Super Mario Bros. Movie and adapting the classic, iconic theme music composed by Koji Kondo for the original games. Many movies based on video games have been missing the boat by not maintaining the iconic music that goes with the games. The music of video games is important. The music empowers players for their gameplay sessions, and the Super Mario Bros. game series music evokes a warm tingly feeling.  Tyler understands the power of Nintendo music themes and consulted with Koji Kondo to create the film’s score, converting the iconic Kondo’s indelible music themes into big orchestral instrumentations. It comes together for a delightful score that enlivens this vibrant, animated world and makes it sound alive. So many composers try to assert their own will onto video game properties without paying proper homage to the classic sounds. That is not the case here. The problem with the score is that the movie often resorts to using popular rock music and needle drops throughout the runtime. Brian Tyler worked incredibly hard and collaborated with Koji Kondo to create a fantastic score, yet the film repeatedly drops in pop music tracks when the music Tyler composed is infinitely better. The movie needs more of its excellent score and fewer pop songs. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a wonderful and joyous experience. Horvath and Jelenic demonstrate their love for the games and characters that comes through visually. The movie is loaded with fan service and nostalgia. However, those moments are executed in a way that propels the story forward with effervescent energy. Some of the action sequences are staged like classic platform levels. There is also the Mario Kart Rainbow Road sequence and an homage to Super Smash Bros. The filmmakers incorporate game concepts within the narrative in an organic way that doesn’t require long-winded, ridiculous exposition and is easy to follow. Within the cinematic world, the integration of video game-type conventions makes sense. Horvath and Jelenic go the extra mile by including some classic Easter eggs in the most surprising places. The discovery and inclusion of these references prove the filmmakers are true fans, and they manage to incorporate those all-important Easter eggs to have a maximum narrative impact. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a joyous event that will bring excitement to all longtime Nintendo fans and players, giving them a new generational story that they can share with their children and families. This movie is playing with power. Copyright © 2024 411mania.com, LLC. All rights reserved.Click here for our privacy policy.
