Apr 14 2024,neutral,i have to say the best part of the whole movie was austin butlers performance as feydhe was amazing and deserves 5 stars for surehe definitely left me wanting to see more of him in this movie and beyond  while i enjoyed the rest of the movie it was just too long and some parts really draggedwould have liked it better if it was 2 hours or less

Apr 14 2024,neutral,this wellmade movie doesnt engage in an oversaturated scifi saga blockbuster era if only it came out fifty years ago
Apr 13 2024,negative,ridiculous long boring and a waste of time unless  you bring a pillow blanket and nap during the movie it seems like it was made using deleted scenes from other movies my legs hurt and im writing this review while watching it help i want my money back
Apr 13 2024,negative,long and boring plus i dont get it

Apr 13 2024,positive,must see loved both movies
Apr 13 2024,positive,doesnt disappoint worth the sit
Apr 13 2024,positive,this movie is like anthropology with adrenaline picture the story of the hobbit mixed with star wars blended with got some in my group got a little confused but i found it totally fascinating  followable watched part 1 only 4 months ago hoping theyre working on a part lll
Apr 13 2024,positive,not herberts dune stick with syfy miniseries for authors vision villeneuve made good scifi but sacrificed herberts complex mystical aspects and elegance instead we get highly edited modern attitudes and sensibilities herberts chani was the strong and loyal fremen who was the center of pauls life villeneuve has her mock southern fremen fundamentalism and abandons paul its good space opera but lacks the substance of herberts dune misses its rewarding complexity read the book for something wonderful while lynchs 1984 dune was a strange mélange at least it retained some of herberts vision villeneuve is just dunelite
Apr 13 2024,positive,one of the best series ive seen in a long time cinematography and music score are fabulous very original story line and u love to hate some of the characters would highly recommend
Apr 13 2024,positive,way over rated like part one long and laborious at times but if you have invested your time in part 1 like me youll be watching this and part 3 anyway 
Apr 13 2024,positive,its such a great and unusual story  its a must see on the big screen
Apr 13 2024,negative,it is visually thrilling but a bit lagging
Apr 13 2024,positive,not as good as the first movie the first was a good balance between geopolitical realism and prophecy supernatural the second is too heavy on the supernatural fantasy aspect that it gets a little weird also in the first it was so exciting to be introduced to this universe and different locations while the second is almost entirely dull dessert scenes 
Apr 13 2024,positive,great photography and story
Apr 13 2024,positive,it wasnt boring at all i like music visual effects actors and in my opinion it is worth to watch this movie in theater
Apr 13 2024,positive,the movie is long but its awesome the visuals and special effects were amazing timothy and zendaya put their heart and soul into this movie its better than the first dune
Apr 13 2024,positive,great movie that plays on all the emotions cant wait to see what happens next
Apr 13 2024,positive,special effects and movie intensity were awesome
Apr 12 2024,positive,one of the best sifimovie ever
Apr 12 2024,positive,one of the most impressive cinematic adaptations of all time
Apr 12 2024,positive,a beautiful film but the plot moved slowly and was very choppy it also did not have a satisfying conclusion
Apr 12 2024,positive,i was exited for film film was good
Apr 12 2024,negative,butchering the story for a contrived lazy and pointless plot twist featuring screen time for zendaya to bring in more audience
Apr 12 2024,neutral,almost every scene is desert some great acting and some flat acting worth watching but at times i was bored generally not impressed
Apr 12 2024,positive,this movie needs to be watched and it needs to be watched only in imax
Apr 12 2024,positive,dennis does a fantastic job at painting paul atreides in the theme that frank herbert had originaly intended in his science fiction franchise    beautiful cinemetography fantastic story telling and great actions sequences  i wish i had rewatched the original again prior to seeing this so i could really immerse myself into arrakis but the film is nonetheless a treat and easy to follow without that    incredible acting from everyone that iswas involved with this film  really hoping dennis creates a trilogy out of this franchise
Apr 12 2024,positive,spellbinding start to finish
Apr 12 2024,negative,truly one of the most boring clichéd and poorly put together movies of all time i would say top ten worst movies but quite honestly 1 worst movies with absurdly high ratings in the history of film the reviews from both critics and the public are astounding demonstrating the remarkable decline in human intelligence even since such recent masterpieces as avatar or any of dozens of scifi genre pieces of film art hours of desert some of the worst actingand castingof all time timothea not even remotely believable as any kind of hero or warrior temperamentally physcially and with the charisma of a newt his acting chops are simply nonexistent maybe the most lack lustre actor of his generation some good cgi here and there but the whole dreary and somber portrayals of worlds and cultures are simply stereotypical been there done that well if you need something to put you to sleep maybe but even then it is mainly annoying and overall simply silly from start to finish and not in an good made for kids way but in an immature inept way these are facts but hey apparently people love it so there goes civilization as we knew it
Apr 12 2024,positive,this is probably the greatest scifi movie i have ever been blessed to see i came into this movie hearing the greatest movie ever comments from everybody and anybody on social media while i was watching the movie i would often think is this what people think is the greatest movie ever but when i finished the movie i thought to myself that these people might actually be right so good i saw it a total of 3 times highly recommend
Apr 12 2024,positive,in a time when audiences are fatigued from flavorless cgiheavy cashgrabbing rehashes dune part two spices up the industry with the quality of its craft everything from the writing performances costumes cinematography score production design and visual effects is a marvel to witness on the big screen those claiming its the star wars and lord of the rings of their time fail to realize its an average story in a simply wellmade film given the proper budget and marketing which was the norm for most films back when studios treated their movies seriously hopefully more upcoming releases will receive the same support so that cinema can begin to heal from the degeneration caused by the mcu
Apr 12 2024,positive,one of the best films of my life
Apr 12 2024,positive,a masterful adaptation that elevates the source material without straying away from the core message this is a brilliant example of how easy it is for a charismatic leader to win us over    brilliant acting brilliant sound brilliant cinematography perfect
Apr 12 2024,positive,it feels like theres at least an hour missing but that only because i was loving this    they manage to hit all the parts they wanted in story cast is perfect visually its a spectacular film
Apr 12 2024,positive,movies with such detailed stories are rare
Apr 12 2024,positive,amazing  this film made me want to go to the theaters for everything  all the actors nailed it  zendaya was her usual self and many others were actual oscar worthy
Apr 12 2024,positive,i dont know what all the hype is about it is a good movie that entertains and lets the time pass fast however the battle scenes are not that impressive and neither are the worm sections i expected more
Apr 12 2024,positive,great story a bit long but the cinematic shots  drives the drama
Apr 12 2024,positive,honestly one of the best films ive seen in a very long time visually stunning great acting and phenomenal costumes
Apr 12 2024,positive,read all the books like so many of you  need the next cinematic offering waiting for duncan and baby sister
Apr 12 2024,positive,i cant think of a better movie ive seen in a very long time i cannot wait for the third
Apr 12 2024,positive,masterpieceno fucking words just a masterpiece
Apr 11 2024,negative,i love scifi unfortunately the dune movies and i watched them all are based on a book that was an indulgence of the authors need to write in long rambling story lines after the first dune movie i thought possibly it was just a poorly made movie and then after watching the most recent two movies its the story that is tedious and no amount of movie making can make the story interesting enough for nearly 5 hours of viewing time that is required for dune one and two
Apr 11 2024,positive,the action scenes were great and it was so imaginative i cant wait for it to be released digitally so i can play it on repeat
Apr 11 2024,neutral,how on earth does this rate so high i love scifi i read the frank herbert books i watched the david lynch version when it came out and played the video games such as dune emperor  dune 2 is tedious and selfindulgent in an effort to create an epic film villeneuve has made something that equates to watching sand blow across a desert the production design is awesome thats probably the best part of the film and what is it with these space people cant they afford to buy a light bulb you know like have a room or two lit is the only way to create atmosphere having the super rich worried about their next electricity bill and not turning anything on
Apr 11 2024,negative,tedious overblown nonsense
Apr 11 2024,positive,its maybe the best movie ive ever seen a few differences from herberts original book however
Apr 11 2024,positive,one of the best actionscifi movies
Apr 11 2024,positive,just wow it lives up to all the hype and then surpasses it i genuinely feel like this is a film that will be seen as revolutionary denis villeneuve has created something that is epic beyond proportions i believe this can justifiably be called a masterpiece and will be mandatory learning in film classes for generations to come
Apr 11 2024,positive,just outstanding  the first installment dune1 was very good dune 2 is everything an audience would want from a scifithriller plenty of action great cgi dynamic cast of talented actors and actresses
Apr 11 2024,positive,i didnt like the original one but this one was a masterpiece 10 worms out of 10 for me the sound the cinematography the action wow just wow i was very surprised
Apr 11 2024,positive,dune was ongoing excitement
Apr 11 2024,positive,amazing movie kept me gripped would definitely recommend
Apr 11 2024,positive,super longonly to drop a 3rd movie to finish thing up why did original manage to get everything into 1 movie and this version is taking 5oh yeahto take out money
Apr 11 2024,positive,really well made and great special fx i dislike chalamat though because hes a talentless pretty boy who spends more time in making faces in the mirror than actual acting
Apr 11 2024,positive,truly one of the best movies i have seen in cinema and just in general truly life changing experience and i know a lot of people feel that way too im a huge fan frank herbert books and dune truly has changed my life that book is the reason i am still now reading books it really opened my mind to a completely different world and rung me in and denis captured that feeling perfectly the acting was literally out of this world i can for see timothee getting that oscar nomination as written  but seriously towards the end of the movie we see where denis blended pieces of dune messiah into part two and it was incredible to see timothee truly transform into the person paul was always inevitably going to become and be going forward the cinematography was jaw droppingly stunning i felt like i was physically there on arrakis with some of the shots gregg was giving us like theres so much more i can say about this film but id literally be here all day an absolute masterpiece in other words
Apr 11 2024,positive,i was not a fan of dune before seeing this film i remember the hype around the first film when it came out but i was not interested in seeing it and was unfamiliar with the franchise i understood through the buzz that the movie was scifi long wellreceived and had zendaya i still have not seen the first movie yet     that was my background knowledge about the movie before my father asked me if i wanted to watch dune part two with the family i was hesitant about going as i told him the movie was long and that i had yet to see the first part he was surprised and slightly offended by that my father is a nerd but does not show it as much as others i did not expect him to be so passionate about it i was also surprised to hear that he had watched the first part multiple times since it came to streaming services     i agreed to see dune part two thinking it would be a good time with family i expected to enjoy the movie generally and only get slightly bored during the films run time my father would be happy and that would have been more than enough for me i watch a recap of the first part in the morning we leave for the theater and sit in our seats in time for the film to start     i was enraptured throughout every part of the film there was no moment when i was bored or too distracted by other things this was surprising considering the theater experience was unpleasant when i went this time each scene was beautiful and it felt as if every frame was uniquely put together i remember very specific thinking that i wanted to scrape through the screencaps and study every one of them for their composition and color the accompanying music track was immersive making the already stunning visuals come to life
Apr 11 2024,positive,the cinematography of this movie is absolutely astonishing the cast and the acting is equally as superb and the change of pace from the first film makes for a great experience for fans of dune overall i would definitely recommend seeing this especially in theaters
Apr 11 2024,negative,disappointing after the terrific first part
Apr 11 2024,negative,very boring movie dont understand why it has a good rating on this website
Apr 11 2024,positive,possibly even better than part one  follows the book very well  lookingpraying for the next dune messiah
Apr 10 2024,positive,builds on part 1 perfectly  absolutely awesome in its scale
Apr 10 2024,positive,proceeds its world building first movie with the perfect follow up the new characters may throw you off because of the big time actors that play them but they really outperform their roles music is used perfectly to heighten key moments and immerse you into each key moment especially in the theatre
Apr 10 2024,positive,a cinematic experience the likes of which none have witnessed before
Apr 10 2024,positive,i watched this movie a handful of times now and i never get sick of it this is everything a movie should be
Apr 10 2024,negative,why do people overrate whenever they some some decent visuals the characters the dialogs the action and storytelling are so incredibly childish that it is unbelievable that writersdirector arent actually 13 years old kids the world is really effed up isnt itsince oppenheimer barbie godzilla past lives  poor things are on oscars lootbox  live service gaming era of movies
Apr 10 2024,positive,popped my pussy 1010
Apr 10 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has established himself as a modern director synonymous with the word epic  with films like arrival blade runner 2049 and of course the first dune from 2021 he knows how to make whatever hes directing feel huge and so it is with dune part 2 one of the few sequels ive actually been looking forward to in the last few years the original film had a tough task of adapting an infamously complex story and mythology into a 2andahalfhour movie but it succeeded admirably with part 2 villeneuve has gone the empire strikes back route by pushing the story into much darker territories and its all the better for it theres a lot of things going on several disparate plotlines that are destined to cross and while we spend more time with some rather than others it never feels like any of them are being forgotten or glossed over with such a massive cast big names like christopher walken  florence pugh get diminished screen time but it never feels like theyre turning in halfassed performances as a result the oneonone fight scenes are still cut a little erratically but generally the action sequences are given scale and weight you feel the pressure on our heroes as they battle a far larger and more powerful enemy and i liked how the climactic battle came down to smart tactics and wise decision making rather than just being another case of 2 big armies charging at each other and the winner being whoever has people left standing despite the undoubtedly grand scale the film doesnt lose track of the human element with pauls romance with chani his contentious bond with his mother and his burgeoning alliance with the fremen all given lots of screentime paul as a character goes through a lot in the course of the film and by the end hes recognisably the same person but moulded considerably by struggle and expectation austin butler makes for a menacing if underutilised villain who i would have liked to see more of hans zimmers score is suitably bombastic but gets toned done or silenced when its appropriate its a film that practically begs to be seen on the big screen and with a 3rd instalment already confirmed its difficult to see how theyre going to top this one but ill be right there when they try
Apr 10 2024,negative,doesnt have an ending the credits roll without anything really being resolved so its hugely disappointing to invest all this time in the characters only to be left on a cliffhanger ending wondering whats going to happen to them if you cant make a movie with a complete plot and release it all at once dont bother
Apr 10 2024,positive,dune part 2 certainly shined in almost every aspect whether this is from the cinematography visual effects direction tone a well driven story or the strong performances from its cast
Apr 10 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie zendaya plays zendaya as usual
Apr 10 2024,positive,this is perfection this is cinema this is art 10010 must see
Apr 10 2024,positive,excellent acting and cgi
Apr 10 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies i have ever seen wow absolutely amazing
Apr 10 2024,positive,unbelievable cinematography great performances by all the cast
Apr 10 2024,negative,walked out well before this rubbish ended underwhelming and confusing
Apr 10 2024,positive,the movie was amazing the actors were so charming that made me cant take my eyes of the film the cgi the sounds this movie are by far one of the best i saw this last years i willingly wait for the third part love it
Apr 10 2024,positive,this was as good if not better in the epic visual department but for being longer than the first film youd expect more plot progression and that didnt happen instead we get mostly lame teenybopper highschool puppylove melodramatics it felt more like a disney film meant for kids not a mature enough scifi drama i also wasnt a fan of chalamet in the first film  he just wasnt convincing in appearance nor performance and its even worse in this film dude seriously needs to get rid of that mop on his head and start hitting the gym his 11 year old frame isnt convincing as a towel boy let alone a leader who easily wins battles to the death over guys at least double his size first film was an 8 this is a generous 7 all going to the visuals and everyone elses performance except chalamets hopefully the writing and chalamets pubescent growth improves in the third and final film
Apr 10 2024,positive,this movie is so amazing denis villeneuve adapts the previously unadaptable novel so perfectly the visual effects and cinematography are top notch hans zimmer creates one of his best scores there were moments when i was grinning up at the imax screen austin butler and timothée chalamet deliver amazing performances but rebecca ferguson absolutely steals the show as lady jessica she sells the role so well overall this movie is a 5 out of 5 stars
Apr 9 2024,positive,i cannot wait until the next one i will have to rewatch all of them together once all have been released as a set   the length pushes the need for intermission barrier seriously  the length is fine but an intermission would have been welcome
Apr 9 2024,negative,    dune part 2 disappointing continuation of the saga    as a fervent fan of the original dune novel i approached dune part 2 with great anticipation only to find myself sorely disappointed frank herberts masterful universe seems to have lost its magic in this lackluster sequel    one of the most glaring issues is the pacing while the first book expertly balanced intricate worldbuilding with gripping plot development dune part 2 drags on with tedious exposition and unnecessary tangents the narrative feels bloated weighed down by superfluous details that detract from the overall enjoyment    furthermore the character development falls flat in dune readers were treated to complex multidimensional characters with motivations that resonated deeply in contrast the characters in dune part 2 feel onedimensional and uninspired lacking the depth and complexity that made the original cast so compelling    additionally the plot itself lacks the intrigue and suspense that made dune such a gripping read the stakes feel lower the conflicts less engaging and the resolutions predictable its as if herbert ran out of creative steam recycling tired tropes and clichés instead of pushing the boundaries of his own imagination    overall dune part 2 fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor while it may hold some appeal for diehard fans eager to revisit the world of arrakis casual readers are likely to find themselves bored and underwhelmed by this lackluster continuation of the saga        remember this review is fictional and based on common criticisms dune and its potential sequels have garnered widespread acclaim and opinions on any subsequent installments may vary widely
Apr 9 2024,positive,i enjoyed it but slightly underwhelming
Apr 9 2024,positive,a huge step up from the already great dune 1 the storyline and acting is amazing along with the visuals there was not a part of the movie that i was bored watching the only negative view i have on this movie is about how easily some of the villains were killed off especially dave bautistas role  glossu rabban but overall its a great movie and probably the best one this year
Apr 9 2024,negative,sleepy  i literally was falling asleep and lost the plot i liked part one enough i had just streamed at home to go see part two in theatre but felt like a waste of time if you want a more interesting messianic story try just reading the bible watching the chosen tv series or matrix or star wars
Apr 9 2024,negative,save your money and your time utter trash the best thing going was the limited romance and that gets ruined by the ending wont be seeing part 3 people who think this is good must be the same people that look at a sloppy splatter painting and say its awesome
Apr 9 2024,positive,goodshit my fav movie so far
Apr 9 2024,positive,stunning cinematic visuals cgi and a fine collection of very good actors in interesting character roles unfortunately it was one hour and twentyfive minutes too long filled with gazes stares vistas sunsets and lots of sand the bits telling the story were good but it plodded between them
Apr 9 2024,negative,after watching i had to watch some videos on youtube to fill in some of the gaps and story  you had to be aware of what seemed like  small aspects in the first dune to fill in some blanks or you needed to read the book  some of the story just jumped here and there and it was really only after i watched these videos that i realised the main character actually isnt a nice person  the bit at the end came a bit out of left field and i probably didnt need to have to read the book or find fill in the blanks videos to understand it  visually it was ok lots of cgi some good visuals but it was just ok for me
Apr 9 2024,positive,wow great acting amazing cinematography so much plot development and action it was one good scene after another ive watched this movie four times already at the theaters the bar has been raised very high for the scifi movie genre
Apr 9 2024,negative,flat acting close to two hours of desert shots not all of them interesting zendaya only had two modes the entire movie the falling in love and being in love part was not at all believable i guess i should blame the director the music and the sound was impressive but almost too much yes we know the story of dune that didnt make this movie any better was it better than the first perhaps
Apr 9 2024,positive,preshow movie previews ran a bit long wish that part of the movie experience could be made shorter  the show kept your attention the whole 25
Apr 8 2024,positive,amazing film everything about it is better than the first film
Apr 8 2024,negative,still an unfilmable series of ever more complex  novels visually appealing though this one is  the latest iteration in a series of unsatisfactory attempts barely scratches the surface of herberts highly nuanced geopolitical ecoverse one day using av techniques as yet uninvented someone might do it but not yet    a process cannot be understood by stopping it understanding must move with the flow of the process must join it and flow with it
Apr 8 2024,positive,better written the embodiment of scifi epic excellent directing from denise its much better than the first one excellent cast and timothy and zendaya give excellent performances this is now my top 10 favorite scifi movies of all time
Apr 8 2024,neutral,unclear what the plot was if you hadnt seen  1 you would be lost
Apr 8 2024,positive,i preferred the first movie and l again felt like the movie wasnt over otherwise still a great movie
Apr 8 2024,negative,i never saw the movie because the movie theater  closed before i got there at  5 pm  there was a shooter threat in the dolphin mall and everything closed  can i please get a reimbursement  thanks
Apr 8 2024,positive,a blockbaster worthy of the name it breathes epicness and this doesnt happen often the photography zimmers music make everything immortal very good actors even if sometimes their characters are not well characterized in any case villeneuve pays homage to herbert the only flaw that needs to be addressed is that it cannot be concluded like this the third is a must
Apr 8 2024,positive,the greatest film ive seen in 2024 up to this point is truly remarkable and stands out above the rest the music cinematography and acting were all of exceptional quality creating an unforgettable viewing experience that will stay with me for a long time
Apr 8 2024,positive,much better than part one still kinda bs and inconsistent but better now
Apr 8 2024,positive,awesome story go see it in the movie theaters
Apr 8 2024,positive,epic spectacular groundbreaking and visually stunning i love the movie denis v really outdid himself this time herbert would be proud i feel bad for the small but vocal minority who cant appreciate this film for what it is a cinematic tourdeforce with immersive world creation powerful acting a riveting score and a nuanced message that mirrors that of the book enjoy it
Apr 8 2024,positive,exciting followup to first dune now anxiously waiting for dune 3
Apr 8 2024,positive,absolutely amazing saw all the version of this but never got involved emotionally this one makes it for me great job great director great cast its on the level of lord of the rings epic congratulation my only disappointment is that they were not made all at the same time
Apr 8 2024,positive,equally as good as the first
Apr 8 2024,positive,hmmm  i really enjoyed the first movie  i was pretty excited about the sequels  but idk how i feel about this one  dont get me wrong it was a great movie  but it felt really long without a whole lot happening  i get itthey are setting things up for a third moviebut idk  the original dune movie felt more interesting than this one
Apr 8 2024,negative,i did not like the movie confused and too long
Apr 8 2024,positive,wow  not my favorite genre but this movie packs a huge punch fastest 2 hours and 45 minutes you have to watch it
Apr 8 2024,positive,awesome sequel great visuals story and acting
Apr 8 2024,positive,the musical score was very good cinematically the graphics were realistic and eye catching
Apr 8 2024,positive,everything from the action to the actors was amazing everything about it was great highly recommend watching it
Apr 8 2024,positive,being a massive fan of the books i honestly couldnt see how villeneuve could do it justice by god did he visually its a cinematic delight how he managed to capture the essence of the books in such spectacular fashion is beyond me yes there were bits missing without adding spoilers i was slightly disappointed that lady margot fenrings part was underplayed but boy it wasnt enough to detract from the sheer spectacle of what he achieved i cannot wait for dune 3
Apr 7 2024,positive,literally one of the best movies that i have ever seen i put 5 stars because i did loved it and it has some things that are immutable from the original book but in the movie they missed one thing they almost didnt showed how much paul suffered with everything that happened and i missed it a lot but it stills one of the greatest pice of art in my opinion
Apr 7 2024,positive,great they nail it with the visuals which i like a lot from the first movie great character development the action isnt over the top and mostly visually interesting the conclusion it plays out its own rules and not what most ppl expect i appreciate this movie because it takes me out of reality into the dune world im familiar with trilogies so trilogies are cool but this one isnt ground breaking its not like star wars please its definitely not star wars
Apr 7 2024,positive,this movie was long awaited great story line and great effects this is a fantastic movie
Apr 7 2024,positive,harder to follow relationships than in 1 looking foreward to  3
Apr 7 2024,positive,where so many sequels fail to keep the story new and spend more time on sfx than plot or character development dune part ii is an easy exception to the rule picking up from the very end of the first installment if anything every already introduced character and the plot are strengthened add to that the newly introduced characters with each of them newer plot points plans within plans are presented seamlessly dune messiah cant come soon enough
Apr 7 2024,positive,the cinematography acting and costumes were excellent
Apr 7 2024,positive,absolutely loved this film the casting was phenomenal  especially timothee chalamet as paul austin butlers faydrautha and florence pughs stunning portrayal of the princess the retelling of the original movie was nothing short of spectacular
Apr 7 2024,positive,delicious piece of cinema
Apr 7 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal 1010
Apr 7 2024,negative,this second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame which is logical considering dune spans several novels with a history of 15000 years of civilization villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch the pacing is irregular at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed especially for people who are not familiair with the original material you dont get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made cramming a story like dune in a two part sets of films is probably not doing the story justice should have been remade into an  tv series to make it really work therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of dune is very unlikely
Apr 7 2024,positive,not knowing much about the story it had a good feel and was enjoyable
Apr 7 2024,positive,better than the first film although i preferred the locations and how the first one was shot   its still nowhere near as good for me as people are making out not a lot going on in the first half of the film very well made though no one can argue with that
Apr 7 2024,positive,damn near perfect should not have made the finale as close otherwise a great adaptation of difficult source material
Apr 7 2024,positive,excellent big performancesbig set pieces and wellbig worms so beautiful to look at it is immersive i had to empty the sand out of my shoes after
Apr 7 2024,positive,much faster pacing than the first movie the plot twist is a bit surprising though many tense moments which fits the storys atmosphere
Apr 7 2024,positive,no flaws  great movie in all aspects music acting score photographya masterpiece
Apr 7 2024,positive,best movie i have ever seen i have been reading and rereading the dune series for decades and this is finally the movie that captures the emotional power i feel when i read the books
Apr 7 2024,positive,when i first saw the first dune i thought to myself wow this is such an amazing movie from the vfx to the diolog to everything and i liked the idea of dune it was like a more grounded version of star wars but then came the second movie to the amazing franchise it left me spechless and exited for the next movie dune messiah timothee chalemate really nailed the part of paul as so for rebeca fudgesson i really enjoyed her in silo for a reason like in this movie her acting looks like the charecter from the books  denis villenueve is a genius i really recomened watching the movie in theaters its just a one time expiriens that you will never get again recomend the movie 10000000000000000 10 must watch
Apr 7 2024,positive,awesome the best cinematic experience ive ever had
Apr 7 2024,negative,dune part 2  teen angst is better than the mcu but not by much    first the good parts  the movie theater was clean and the reclining chairs were comfortable parking was fine too the guy from the 8th air force did a good job playing a psycho all this just shows how low the bar is in the us movie industry these days     now for the rest  the story was shallow and credibility was damaged by shark jumping inplausibility what did the freemen eat how did they build and repair anything how does anyone ever dismount from a sandworm has there ever been a more incompetent military defense or intelligence network than that of the sarduakar     just none of it makes any sense and the suspension of disbelief isnt possible especially when the emotional stakes are so low and the characters are mostly stereotypes     it was acclaimed and has a good rating on this site i suspect part of this is selection bias and the rest is of that is a reflection of the expectations of the day    maybe go if youre a fan me id like my 15 dollars and 2 hours 30 min back
Apr 7 2024,negative,i love scifi but this one was too long and too slow i rewatched part 1 recently in order to enhance my experience of this second part but it didnt help on the contrary part 1 was much better 4 out of 5 stars
Apr 7 2024,positive,visually excellent but i have serious doubts about the adaptation from the original some narrative lines had to be dropped of course but others were included unnecessarily i guess the director had to make many hard choices like the suspicion that jessica was the traitor not yueh about the characters themselves i dont like the way jessica and stilgar were portrayed the psycho mother and the zealot i missed the last scene in the book the exchange between jessica and chani was superb i guess well have to wait for a third movie many things depend on that eventual closing episode
Apr 7 2024,positive,great movie    cant wait for the 3rd
Apr 7 2024,positive,long live the fighters    dune part two is a 2024 american epic science fiction film directed and produced by denis villeneuve      its good   id recommend it if you like this genre     make sure you have the subtitles on or you wont understand most of the movie    follow the mythic journey of paul atreides as he unites with chani and the fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee
Apr 7 2024,positive,one of the greatest scifi movies i have ever seen
Apr 7 2024,positive,pure cinema a terrific experience in the theater
Apr 7 2024,positive,dune part two is considered as one of my alltime favorites of 2024 and best sequels that which redefines the epic storytelling of scifi adventure likely be critically acclaimed for best visual effects and the cast performances especially timothée chalamet as the titular character paul atreides and austin butler as feydrautha
Apr 7 2024,positive,what an amazing movie plot twist was unexpected one of the best movies ever spoilers it made me emotional how chani didnt end up with paul

Apr 7 2024,negative,what an underwelming movie the last battle last 15 seconds and the last fight was straight out of disney the good guys gets almost beaten only to come back at the end what if you really want to see dune what the original everything is better and the customs are great as well as the dialog i will keep this director in mind so i dont make the mistake of ever watching anything else he does the acting bt bardeen over the top muah deeb just ok and chani not beleivable it seem to me like they made this movie for money and not for the art
Apr 7 2024,positive,absolutely a must see id give it 10 stars if i could loved the old original movie and this lived up to all my expectations cant wait for the next movie
Apr 7 2024,positive,great adaptation visually spectacular

Apr 6 2024,positive,even with the changes this was the best dune yet
Apr 6 2024,positive,an instant classic dune part ii solidifies itself among the greats in cinema my only gripe is that it wasnt a great book adaptation certain liberties were taken with the plot other than that its beautifully shot has an excellent music score and the acting is top tier
Apr 6 2024,positive,great adaptation with great music
Apr 6 2024,positive,a 3 hour masterpiece each frame was slowly painted by the hands of someone who actually cares about the craft the acting all around was a dune 2 is a must watch over and over and over again will never get old
Apr 6 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece one of the greatest sci fi movies i even seen the last hour is amazing the entire cast and story are perfect   i give this a 1010
Apr 6 2024,negative,three hours of agonytotal flop with grandiose scenes that dont make an impact and lead nowhere90 by viewers
Apr 6 2024,positive,this only came out in march and will be my top 3 of 2024 absolutely amazing start to finish glued to the screen the graphics and visuals are extraordinary this lives up to the hype and then some austin butler also kills his role
Apr 6 2024,positive,the second dune movie is an absolute spectacle that needs to be seen on a big screen the shots that showcase the scope of the story and the colors of every location look beautiful even in the most dire and hostile of places theres a lot of thought that went into every shot throughout the long runtime which really doesnt feel like it drags at any point the characters and dialogue are great which compliments their placement in the celestial environments as the second part of an ongoing saga dune part 2 will give you reason to revisit the first film in an attempt to stay immersed within the universe it shows you
Apr 6 2024,positive,absolutely stunning science fiction
Apr 6 2024,positive,magnificent in every department

Apr 6 2024,positive,it was a little long and  reverent  plot was great
Apr 6 2024,positive,great followup to part 1
Apr 6 2024,negative,great cinematography however this movie is far from epic the action was sparse but enjoyable after lengthy periods of dialogue   the approval rating had me hyped to see this movie    it was far from fulfilling for me and my spouse agrees  we would not have paid for this movie had we known it was so disappointing   i was hoping for more aspects of the book such as training the fremen in the weirding way   i certainly will not be going to the theater to see the next episode   
Apr 6 2024,positive,dune part 2 delivers an epic cinematic experience that surpasses all expectations from stunning visuals to captivating storytelling every moment is gripping and immersive a masterful continuation of the saga that leaves audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment epic in every sense of the word
Apr 5 2024,positive,loved it  it really takes you on a journey
Apr 5 2024,positive,great adaptation of this iconic book the cinematography the soundtrack and most importantly the acting was phenomenal amazing ensemble and direction
Apr 5 2024,positive,very good movie  imagery was great
Apr 5 2024,negative,overrated so bad i left halfway through
Apr 5 2024,positive,this is pure cinema
Apr 5 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie but i definetly reccomend that you watch the first dune before seeing this one so you remember what  happened before this movie this movie was action packed the acting was peak and overall a great movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,the film you should see and the film with a must see and the cast of the characters that made the film a lot of money and word of mouth of positive reviews
Apr 5 2024,positive,only issue was the diverting from the books however it was amazing nonetheless i really hope they continue telling the story and continue with the series
Apr 5 2024,positive,epic from start to finish my mind is still blown
Apr 5 2024,negative,this movie was made by the devil  it was nothing but killing eating peoples organs and gore
Apr 5 2024,positive,amazing adaptation of source material that proven to be very difficult to adapt villeneuve is a genius the casting is perfect the soundtrack is amazing cant wait for the finale in part 3 whenever that comes 
Apr 5 2024,positive,this is a great version of a scifi universe which is more darker than we are used to watching this really got us invested in the planet of arakkis and how the people live with some great visuals the only gripe would be that some of the villains are introduced to the plot too late in the movie and dont have much to do until their inevitable downfall
Apr 5 2024,positive,absolutely loved it
Apr 5 2024,positive,good pace great characters  casting rich story and artcinematography made me actually care about learning more of the dune universe looking forward to dune 3
Apr 5 2024,positive,gotta see it in imax
Apr 5 2024,positive,beautiful cinematography  fine acting by all true to the novel
Apr 5 2024,positive,equal to dune part one good graphics and it follows the story line of the book very well worth seeing waiting anxiously for part three
Apr 5 2024,positive,a movie that is undeniably superior to its predecessor in every way from visual effects to storytelling dune part two is a best picture contender that deserves to win the whole damn thing    the story was insanely hardhitting with twists and turns at every corner which literally gave me a headache once the movie ended since there was so much to take in truly one of the most unpredictable stories in the history of cinema    the writing was excellent as well  the writers dont get enough props on this movie it is seriously one of the best cinematic pieces of writing of all time  if you guys ever watch this movie youll see what i mean    the cinematography and the choreography combined were both amazing the camerawork was able to catch every possible thing along with some badass angles and the fight choreography was beautiful the fights felt insanely unpredictable as to who would win    the cast performances were absolutely amazing timothee chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson josh brolin and stellan skarsgard were all immediate standouts since the first movie i hated that the first movie didnt get any acting nominations at the oscars so this one had better get all the nominations to make up for it haha    do not get me started on the visual effects dune 2 is insanely beautiful  especially considering the fact that this movie was made on a budget twice as small as avatar 2s budget the world of arrakis is insanely beautiful    hans zimmer absolutely killed it with the musical score as well hans is one of the greatest movie composers of all time and this movie just adds another stone to his crown    denis villeneuves direction in this movie was absolute perfection id go as far as to say that denis is the scifi genres martin scorsese thats just my opinion though to be brutally honest    the pacing in this movie was also wayyyyyy better than the first movie the first movie dragged so long in the first half to pick up insanely quick in the second but this movie cut straight to the chase and i love that    dune part two is a perfect payoff to part one while also standing as a perfect setup to dune messiah which entered development today april 4th 2024 sporting compelling performances stunning visuals impeccable writing and stellar direction cinematography and choreography cementing dunes legacy as one of the greatest scifi media franchises and this movie alone standing at the top of the mountain as the greatest epic scifi movie of the 2020s
Apr 4 2024,positive,this was a thrilling movie and cant wait to watch it again the sound can be a little louder but other than that its great
Apr 4 2024,positive,visual amazing but falls short otherwise    the movie is absolutely stunning to see almost every shot could be framed  put on a wall without anyone thinking twice    sadly that can only do so much the story is thin the acting is meh  even the action scenes are underwhelming which is the biggest sin next to the run time so much potential was there but none of it pays off     basically this is an overly expensive coffee table book
Apr 4 2024,positive,this is the best movie ive ever watched in cinema 3 times imax this is why we go to cinema thank you denis villeneuve for living you are a game changer
Apr 4 2024,positive,again gorgeous cinematographywormriding scenes are breathtaking satisfying plot progression   recommend ignoring the kind of just silly romance scenes they add very little and tarnish otherwise solid performances didnt need to be as long as it is   still very entertaining overall
Apr 4 2024,positive,such an immersive experience regardless if you see it in 70mm or not the hype for zendayas character was overblow unfortunately
Apr 4 2024,positive,marvelous spectacle  the scale of it all was mind blowing   the ability to make the audience feel a scenes to your core is what makes a great film to me  the cast is amazing  the effects were outstanding  it was visually stunning
Apr 4 2024,positive,great film some moments of whats going on that can probably be attributed to trying to fit in all the book material into a film but overall its done superbly looking forward to watching it again 
Apr 4 2024,negative,no excuse for diverging from the novel so much bland visuals
Apr 4 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a longggg time hands down
Apr 4 2024,positive,dune part two is denis villeneuves best work to date and is truly a cinematic experience to be lived on the big screen riveting from start to finish visually striking beautifully directed bring on the holy war
Apr 4 2024,positive,very solid film and as close to perfection as could be
Apr 4 2024,positive,its long yes but if youre into dune its worth it cant wait to see part 3
Apr 4 2024,positive,not a fan of remaking classic movies but this whole project has been tastefully done excellent movie and i hope they make the rest of the books into movies
Apr 4 2024,positive,close to the book good pacing of the movie good special effects great on the big screen
Apr 4 2024,negative,its a boring 3 hour trailer for dune part 3 skip the movie watch a few of its trailers and wait for part 3 or skip dune 2 3 etc etc and watch something better shouldnt be hard to find a better movie
Apr 4 2024,positive,the movie was extraordinary it joined with part 1 perfectly  and made me hope more are in the works
Apr 4 2024,positive,outstanding film i cant say enough good things about it the cinematography acting the progression of the story are all top tier best movie ive seen since top gun maverick i hope the director will finish his trilogy and continue on i would love to see how he portrays the rest of the books
Apr 4 2024,positive,without being cliche but this is really the best movie i have ever seen and i was there for empire strikes back return of the jedi and also for the two towers and return of the king in my opinion this blows them all out of the water not just because of the amazing visuals but those are truly amazing because denis insisted on doing everything as practical as possible even the sandworm seems like you could really go ride one but it is the way it handles the chosen one trope i have seen it 7 times in the theater all in imax or dolby and i really recommend not  missing this one in the theater just like those other epic films it will be around and discussed forever i am glad if the third movie is made it will not have return of the in the title
Apr 3 2024,positive,wow such a great freaking movie this is 1 film you should check out at an amc dolby theater because its built for it the visuals and sounds are jaw dropping and the action is top tier while watching pauls journey i couldnt help but compare him to anakin skywalkers dive to the dark side i cant believe spring is the new summer movie season smh awesome flick
Apr 3 2024,positive,storyline was not cohesive
Apr 3 2024,positive,great deep well played fascinating
Apr 3 2024,positive,this is one of the top 10 movies ever made  epic story telling wonderful character development b the breathtaking cinomatography and out of this world special effects
Apr 3 2024,negative,watch lawrence of arabia instead 
Apr 3 2024,positive,one of the 3 best films ive ever seen even the epicness was epic the landscape score cinematography  wardrobe direction cast not a single bad thing blown away and its gonna be a long wait for part 3
Apr 3 2024,positive,cool story and many different special effects i liked that there wasnt quite a happy ending
Apr 3 2024,positive,beautiful graphics and scenes good plot twist and great character development
Apr 3 2024,positive,honestly 1010 watched it twice still had the same feelings of awe the second time amazing in every aspect absolutely recommend watching it
Apr 3 2024,positive,zendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upzendaya bricked me upv
Apr 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 was my most anticipated movie of the year and did not disappoint its the best movie i have seen this year by far i dare say it was almost perfect okay maybe not perfect but it was crazy good to say the least my favorite aspect of the movie was the worldbuilding and deep lore segments the first movie left me with so many questions but this sequel genuinely feels like they answered many of them dont get me wrong i still have plenty more yet i feel satisfied as a viewer for the new information we got but mainly im excited to learn more    to get moviespecific dune part two feels more like a comingout party for paul as the main protagonist or antagonist depending on who you ask pauls rise was epic it felt like he couldnt miss in this movie and stilgar was there to remind the whole movie seeing paul rise to the occasion again and again did have me hyped i cant lie    the movie has a heros journeytype vibe with a little chosen one energy sprinkled on top yet you can tell that the plot is a lot deeper than pauls storyline alone matter of fact you can tell its a lot deeper than these first two movies i loved how fluent the cast rotation was for this movie for the most part they did a great job establishing new characters as we lose old ones it makes the movie feel more alive    one thing that i didnt like about this movie was the big battles or war portions of the movie it felt way too onesided and seems to be a continued trend from the first film the issue is that it makes all the preparations and conversations pointless granted i dont get tired of seeing the freman pop up out of the ground ready to rumble i wish there was some real pushback from the opposing sides i dont care how much prep time they have    lets switch up the pace a little bit i want to talk a little about the love interests something we were robbed of in the first movie they killed it this go around the newfound triangle between paul chani and princess irulan is going to be one for the ages the reason is that we spent most of the movie seeing paul and chani boo love while princess irulan was playing politics things are bound to get tricky with pauls newfound position plus his political union with the princess paul is playing a dangerous game if you ask me    zendayas portrayal of chani was great she not only grounded the movie but also stuck to her convictions regardless of what paul had going on this will set up some interesting conflicts in the future paul is going to have to make some tough decisions that are not so blackandwhite i just hope chani will be around to help make them     the future looks bright for dune learning about the empire and their roles in the prophecy was poetic plus with talks of a holy war things are going to get interesting fast i am excited to see what paul can come up with to keep the power he never really wanted but this movie in general was really good they made it feel like one big puzzle where you dont know what the image is going to be until the end it feels like theres still so much to discover which is why i gave it a 910 gfiles score    seeing paul becoming one with the desert is one thing but seeing him gain the trust of the people is a whole other thing timothée chalamets speech was incredible this movie takes the necessary steps to fully flush out its characters good or bad you expect to see paul embrace the title of muaddib his pursuit of revenge vengeance or freedom from the powers at be it makes sense you dont expect to be thrown into this chasm of politics secret agendas and visions of people not even born yet this movie was amazing and i cant wait for the next one to come out
Apr 3 2024,positive,absolute movie peak i loved every second of this movie the only problem is that if you havent read the books the end is very hard to understand plus youll have to wait many years for the continuing
Apr 3 2024,positive,superb acting with unapparelled cinematography highly recommend
Apr 3 2024,positive,i saw the movie a few days ago in theaters and it is a very good movie a lot of action ad new stuff
Apr 3 2024,positive,dune part two is a perfection i made a mistake when i was watching it for the first time i was trying to be critical dont do that so for the second watch i went to an imax theater so that i could just enjoy it and i did this movie is absolutely incredible the cinematography is one of the best of all movies iv seen you feel like youre there on arrakis the characters feel real their emotions feel real the music is just incredibly cinematic the visual effects are stunning the sandwormriding was the best part of the movie it always looked more gorgeous each time we saw it i cannot say the pacing is perfect but its certainly very good during the first time watch i felt a little bored in the beginning    the characters are all very interesting my favourite being stilgar of course who probably deliveres all the jokes of the film javier bardem is just amazing but the best acting pefromance was given by austin butler he was so intense timotheé chalamet was also really good these two are probably going to be nominated for a lot of awards but everyone was great i especially love stellan skarsgards vladimir harkonnen    all in all this movie is absolutely incredible its no question that its a 1010 years later when people look back on 2024 this film will probably come to their mind
Apr 3 2024,positive,the  movie was epic every scene felt like it had been built upon  take the time to read the books and i think you will have a deeper understanding of the story and it be even larger than what you see on screen
Apr 3 2024,positive,masterpiece of cinematography again by denis the score is  as usual with hans zimmer  incredible and gives the film such a unique special feel cant wait for dune messiah
Apr 3 2024,negative,its a super well made movie with a lot of money  one star is because it is not original at all     first of all its yet another adaptation of a story thats already been told  then its a mix of multiple films matrix he is the one avatar the last test to become a fremen paul jumps on a worm while jake on a bird the gladiator i dont even have to explain this   etc     i am a lover of original ideas and i hope that tons of money can be spend on new stories   a lot of people are creatingwriting new stories   give them a shot
Apr 3 2024,negative,its a dry and horrible attempt at an oscar haul attempting to match the succes lotr got but failing horribly a storyline that was attempted to be saved by throwing big name actors at us overall this is one of the most overrated movies of 2024
Apr 3 2024,positive,perfect i loved every single thing in this movie
Apr 3 2024,positive,i would personally like to say that in 2024 this is movie of the year i dont know what other movie can top this movie aside from planet of the eighth but other than that this was a joy to watch but to let people know that this is definitely a sequel there are some parts that you might be confused on so if you have not watched part one please do before going into this now this picks up right where it left off like five minutes ago where in the first dune paul is traveling with the freeman alongside her mother and they are trying to apprehend the harkenns throughout this movie you can see a transformation in paul in the downfall of paul at the same time he is trying to lead the freman to paradise but he keeps seeing visions if he tries or even attempts to lead them to paradise the performances in this movie is really good and the first one  i thought timothy chalamet was kind of a little weak but in this he has a lot to work with and its done very well i have not read the book so i am confused on florence pugh character but other than that i was in with the story just like the first one every performance is really good especially javier bardem and austin butler who really steals the show this is a visual masterpiece every single shot is so well done keep having these change of color pallets and it dont feel like a green screen or nothing and feels like youre into this world zendaya was pretty cool and really fits the character well sometimes id be questioning her acting but its ok because in this she was really good and this is actually a deeper dive into its theme and its theme of religion is religion a manipulative tool or is religion the right way to go thats how i viewed the movie on its theme javier bardem and represents the manipulative tool and zendaya is the opposite and the final battle between austin butlers character and timothée chalamet character was so intense and to be honest i didnt know which one to root forwork for i was trying to rule for timothée chalamets character but i realize that he is now mixed in and following the visions that he dont want to follow in austin butlers character was so entertaining to watch that i really want to see more of him but overall this was a fantastic movie and tell me that theyre going to kill timothée chalamets character in part three because i want to see some real good consequences since these visions are now explored and well executed and in my humble opinion this is my movie year 9510
Apr 3 2024,positive,absolutely epic a masterpiece of cinema
Apr 3 2024,positive,awesome visual effects and cinemaphotography too bad that 10000 years into the future all they have developed technologically is roman empire weaponry and 1960s gun technology that required a little effort at belief but it kept moving and was well done the story is cute wellpaced too obviously theres a dune part three
Apr 3 2024,negative,for a 3 hour long movie a lot of it felt rushed except for paul the character development for many characters felt like it either came out of no where or there was no development of their character at all the first part of the movie was a lot of feet dragging but by the time they get to the actual conflict of the movie it feels like the movie version of a run on sentence
Apr 3 2024,positive,great follow up to the first flick seen it twice already
Apr 3 2024,positive,closet youll love it
Apr 3 2024,positive,great story and action interesting characters and part two really got into the universe building aspects

Apr 2 2024,positive,really fun movie with lots of action new content from the previous versions which i enjoyed and i am very excited that it left it as a cliffhanger for a future movie or two
Apr 2 2024,positive,still incredible the second time i was on the edge of my seat again at the end still amazed at how well the movie was done great cast score and visuals stunning movie
Apr 2 2024,neutral,too slow paced did not make much sense
Apr 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed it very much more than the first part  good script good acting good directing
Apr 2 2024,positive,not happy with all the filming

Apr 2 2024,neutral,too long   good entertainment   whats that thing in their nose 
Apr 2 2024,positive,wow mind blown this is a perfect scifi film it fulfills the first movie and what it set up faithfully but this story can also stand on his own as we see paul adapt the ways of the fermen and signals signs of a prophet which he is the big action in this film is so satisfying thanks to the rather slow and at times meticulous setup the cinematography and sound in this film is groundbreaking this is truly a film to experience wow dune 3 better be good amazing
Apr 2 2024,negative,this is a story very focused on violence and evil  while admirable on filmmaking and technical levels i would not recommend it for children  the movie plotline would be tough to follow if you are not familiar with the frank herbert books andor had not seen the part one movie
Apr 2 2024,negative,to me part 2 was not even in the same league as part 1 if not for having gone to see it with friends i would have been perfectly fine walking out halfway streaming it and fast forwarding to see the key moments to me it was not nearly as visually interesting it was so devoid of the depth of character and relationship nuance explored in the part 1 the complex and possibly unhealthy relationship between paul and his mother that was so central in part 1 is totally absent in part 2 they hardly share any screen time together pauls ascension isnt believable to me nor is his change later in the movie for me there are other issues as well overall this was hugely disappointing
Apr 2 2024,positive,brilliant in every way
Apr 2 2024,positive,somehow denis villenueve managed to make a film that just might have outdone its predecessor  dune part 2 goes heavy into the action yet doesnt take anything away from to world building  plot progression we learn so much about the characters their world  the galaxy around them my only hope is that they do in fact continue this story in further films if not these 2 films will no doubt still stand among the best scifi epics of alltime i just want to thank everyone involved in the making of these extraordinary works of art
Apr 2 2024,negative,the first one wasnt horrible but this one was awful nothing happened for most of the movie lots of sand and beige boring how in the world does it get an above 90 rating there wasnt much else to see at the time i will not bother with the next movie in the series
Apr 2 2024,positive,loved all the action the acting was great i had read the series when i was a teenager and loved itthe movie brought it to life
Apr 2 2024,positive,i went to see this movie expecting to be bored to sleep however i was so wrong the movie was epic in scale and visually stunning the actors and writers did a great job recreating the world of dune from the novels
Apr 2 2024,positive,its was extremely splendid and i was tipping off the edge of my seat you may be wondering why this extraordinary movie has been robbed of half a star the reasoning behind this is the tragic death of sexy bald man would have loved for him to have more screen time
Apr 2 2024,positive,absolutely amazing truly the empire strikes back of its day
Apr 2 2024,positive,ive just rewatched it many times we use the word masterpiece to describe a film that has been really good at least for us but its safe and a must to say that dune part 2 truly is a masterpiece from the striking and touching soundtrack to the gorgeous scale of the shots and sequences denis villeneuve truly delivered us a cult classic and a film that will be remembered of what cinema must be  enjoyable from start to end time just flies through the desert it is so beautiful when the sun is low
Apr 2 2024,positive,wanted to see all the hype about this movie so i watched dune 1 on hbo max was pretty boring but figured it was setting up the story then watched dune 2 and wow im so speechless and amazed this movie was fucking amazing my god lone live the fighters lisan al gaib
Apr 2 2024,negative,looks visuallty great has a great cast but the film is dull and shallow the story just didnt make me care about anything other than the relationship between chani  paul atreides i was happy when it all ended because the i was just so bored
Apr 2 2024,negative,this films visually stunning if you love star wars youll recognize many shots are straight of that film as for the story meh i walked out after the second hour ill watch the rest when its released to streaming the character development is flat so youre not pulled into any of the storylines this is just a movie to watch for the beautiful shots and intense music but after two hours of the same close up and thun thun music followed by another extreme close up and thun thun music youre ready to go home dune 1 was better like this review where im struggling to find more to talk about than the pretty shots and music the movie is too long two hours too long
Apr 2 2024,positive,just finished watching the flick let me start by saying that the acting as a general rule was strong there was one or two scenes which were almost a bit childish but this may have been on purpose otherwise amazing flick loved the subtle changes made to the source material which made the story better suited for the big screen the special effects were first notch visually stunning movie cant wait for part 3 
Apr 2 2024,positive,dune part two is a masterpiece it fixes almost every possible complaint from the first movie it was well written and paced with amazing acting and chemistry between characters very impressive onscreen visuals and amazing cinematography
Apr 2 2024,positive,absolutely wonderful movie amazing cast and great story
Apr 2 2024,positive,an epic sequel to denis villeneuves 2021 dune although it has quite a different feel from the first it still delivers an amazing story following timothee chalamets paul atreides of course the scifi drama wouldnt exist without mastermind author frank herbert the harkonnens continue to portray some of the most treacherous villains in modern cinema lead by star austin butler also a wonderful score by hans zimmer including worm ride a third film is all but confirmed and although it will be difficult if pulled off correctly will please fans and wrap up the dune trilogy perfectly
Apr 1 2024,positive,may thy knife chip and shatter absolutley epic must watch timothee chalamet delivered the most incredible captivating performance austin butler absolutely destroyed the role of feyd rautha so good
Apr 1 2024,positive,the acting was incredible the storyline picked up directly where it left off i think the emperor and his daughters needed to be introduced physically in the first movie  i wish for more explanations of events  details as to why there were certain alliances guess i need to watch both movies again i must have missed something
Apr 1 2024,positive,dune meets star wars lord of the rings and road warrior  visually stunning at times but more space opera  i see dune 3 is already trending
Apr 1 2024,positive,better than the first one which means a lot
Apr 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have watched 1010 would recommend
Apr 1 2024,negative,long hard to follow and honestly a bit boring for me sure it was cinematically impressive but ultimately not for me if like me youre not into the fantasyheavy scifi genre about royalty and prophecy and all that stuff i recommend not wasting your time
Apr 1 2024,positive,best scifi movie over the last 50 years
Apr 1 2024,positive,my new personality just dropped i just might be paul maudib atreides duke of arrakis great camerawork amazing cgi refreshingly interesting story and timothee chalamet
Apr 1 2024,positive,the first movie ive ever gone back to see again in theatre must see
Apr 1 2024,positive,a truly stunning masterpiece i watched this movie on the big screen just today and left with a new perspective on modern cinematography and scifi the vfx and lighting were phenomenal ranking at some of the best ive ever seen the costume designs were fabulous and thoroughly enhanced the futuristic glamour of the movie the pacing was well kept while the storyline was interesting and easy to follow yet intricate and indepth this in my opinion far exceeded the quality of the original modern adaptation of the 1984 dune timothée chalamet and austin butler are due well deserved praise for their contribution to making this movie a masterpiece along side zendaya and the entire cast thank you denis villeneuve for making this movie truly shine among some of the greatest motion pictures in history
Apr 1 2024,positive,the best sciencefiction movie since original star wars  we are back to old school mature movie like alien its like a game of throne in space    the movie is not perfect but we are very close i feel the imperfect is mostly from the book himself or denis villeneuve feel thats irrelevant to explain those details like im questioning how fremen got their plastic tube and technologies inside a desert why harkonnen use swords instead of machine gun when they land    we can debate about it but at the end what make that movie so good its the directing the acting the design the editing the music etc everything is there
Apr 1 2024,positive,thoroughly enjoyable  amazing cast so well acted and the sets both real and digital magic a great ride  cant wait for dune 3
Apr 1 2024,positive,great sequel epic like lotr harry potter and star wars  a lot of characters and story lines  i went with my girlfriend who is not into scifibut she totally got attached to the characters mainly the love story  i cant wait for dune part 3
Apr 1 2024,positive,i grew up watching the theatrical and alan smithee cut of the 84 on sci fi  was really excited to see 2 and enjoyed 1 after a few viewings to get used to it being a completely different thing from the 84 version  after probably 3 viewings i really liked the first one of these  saw 2 yesterday in a real imax theater and as someone who always plays stuff loud music or home streaming i actually thought this one was too much  as someone else mentioned the protagonists are great actually all the characters are but there are too many and the screen time they receive is uneven  definitely not enough paul  i kept waiting for the movie to hit its stride and it never seemed to happen  i may need to see this one a few more times to appreciate it more but i wouldnt say making it to an imax is a must  i might have enjoyed this more in a smaller theater
Apr 1 2024,neutral,it was an average movie with good action scenes and character growth and here is my full run through  austin butlers character for the limited screen time brought a lot of drama and tension towards the movie though it took time to introduce him  both timothée chalamet and rebecca ferguson were great acting and had the best growth  movie was too long and dragged at certain points  overloaded with characters so that actors including stellan skarsgård dave bautista josh brolin florence pugh léa seydoux were wasted  javier bardem brought great humour towards the movie although at time was not appropriate for certain scenes
Apr 1 2024,negative,didnt like it too convoluted for me and way too long i lost interest and still had 2 hours to go
Apr 1 2024,positive,enjoyed it but the sound was so loud in the imax theater that my iphone warned about damage to hearing and showed a graph with 90100 decibels it was hard to understand the dialogue at times great cast loved the hans zimmer soundtrack the sandworms were excellent
Apr 1 2024,positive,saw it in theaters 2x
Apr 1 2024,positive,its a masterpiece in every sense ive watched it twice already and the soundtrack still gives me goosebumps in my headphones i cant imagine how it can be surpassed in a third movie but im looking forward to it
Apr 1 2024,positive,made for the cinema experience
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie destorys the disney star wars franchise with just this movie alone if you havent seen it in imax get off your butt and do it before it leaves theaters best movie of the year easy
Apr 1 2024,negative,i had previously seen part one and the 1984 version about 18 months ago  i was totally lost  didnt know who was who and what was going on  totally lost  there will be a sequel or more  im sure some people who read books about it must have had some idea what was going on
Apr 1 2024,positive,epic bring on part three
Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie is abosolutely amazing the entire movie is made so well and has a great storyline i cant wait until part three

Apr 1 2024,positive,this movie was dope that is all
Apr 1 2024,positive,overhyped the nearly full theater was quiet during and after opening day it was pretty but has too many repetitive scenesbeats wait in sand fight sit in sandsietch with a little dialog another locale start over
Apr 1 2024,positive,the main actor playing paul is so well at this acting see the acting and plot is so good to the point it felt like a different movie the movie seemed like an action type of film about the muslim culture
Apr 1 2024,positive,this is a must see you hace see the first one though to understand whats going on
Apr 1 2024,negative,very slow and boring in long stretches the main protagonists are interesting dont know if i can stand a part 3
Apr 1 2024,negative,slow boring and didnt hold up to the thrilling trailer it had its brief moments but part1 was far far far better
Apr 1 2024,positive,im 53 years old and i swear this is the best movie ever for sci fi i was in total aw the whole time it really is a masterpiece im just shocked at how good it was thank you 
Apr 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 surpasses all expectations delivering an absolutely incredible scifi cinematic experience from breathtaking cgi to stellar performances the starstudded cast shines elevating the film to new heights seamlessly continuing the narrative from its predecessor part 2 exceeds the already high bar set by the first movie each scene brims with passion and emotion drawing viewers deeper into the characters struggles and triumphs the expanding lore of the dune universe from the intricacies of the sand people to the enigmatic bene gesserit and the menacing harkonnens captivates and leaves audiences yearning for more as the plot unfolds setting the stage for the next installment anticipation for the future of the franchise reaches a fever pitch dune part 2 is nothing short of amazing a mustsee for fans of epic storytelling and immersive cinema
Apr 1 2024,positive,movie was full of action and followed the books very well
Apr 1 2024,positive,really good the film really builds upon the first film to present something that is worth your time
Mar 31 2024,negative,im reviewing this because i watched it   i am not a fan of the dune movies at all i know they are very popular and loved but its just not my thing   i was bored and i had some spare time so i watched this movie and i didnt understand a thing that was going on im not saying this is movies fault when it is probably mine for not being focused enough
Mar 31 2024,positive,a good example of a perfect movie
Mar 31 2024,negative,i didnt see the movie lol
Mar 31 2024,positive,i never finished the book or the first movie 1980s but agreed to see this with my sons for a night out  wow  what a blockbuster of a movie  the characters were the driving force behind the story telling and not just there to be ornaments on a tale of dei and cgi  these characters make sense  after seeing it i went back and watched dune 1 the new version and it was great too  i highly rec this picture
Mar 31 2024,positive,in my opinion this is the best film of the year denise builds on the first film in a way that makes this an epic endeavor
Mar 31 2024,positive,one of those experiences i will cherish for the rest of my life
Mar 31 2024,positive,good movie acting  special effects were quality and of course the writing is good
Mar 31 2024,positive,a really good production scenes with great cinematography rebecca and zendaya stole the show for me everything else a bit hyperbole but films are supposed to be subjective
Mar 31 2024,positive,i expected a good movie but this is a masterpiece it totally shocked me at how good this film is there is no flaws in it anywhere directors vision is superb acting cinematography costume design visuals and music score is some of the best ive ever seen costume design on florence pughs character alone is incredible possibly the best sequel ever made it leaves you begging for more it is going to be very hard for any film this year to even match its greatness this deserves multiple oscars including best picture it had me in tears by the end i e seen this several times already its filmed in imax and i highly recommend seeing this in imax
Mar 31 2024,positive,the battle scenes were incredible but the story had some elements that were unnecessary the movie probably could have been shortened by 30 minutes and still have the essential story
Mar 31 2024,positive,dune 2 absolutely nails it its bigger bolder and somehow even more beautiful than the first the story grabs you from the start and with the cast bringing their agame youre in for a treat and can we talk about the visuals and hans zimmers epic soundtrack just wow its not just a movie its an experience that drags you into its world and doesnt let go whether youre a hardcore dune fan or just looking for an epic scifi adventure this ones a winner totally worth the watch and then some

Mar 31 2024,positive,epic not to miss if you are a dune fan amazing we can still make a decent movie in spite of all the corruption in our country
Mar 31 2024,positive,a massive cinematography experience of this decade immersive and massive at the same timesounds colors the characters and the story  everything takes you to another level
Mar 31 2024,positive,dune part two as was dune part one was superbly entertaining with characters who could empathize as a scifi buff i highly recommend this thrilling sequel with spectacular action scenes and an unblemished storyline
Mar 31 2024,negative,not the type of movie that i was expecting for my first date not the kinda movie i would watch on a first date
Mar 31 2024,positive,great movie best science fiction and adventure movie ever
Mar 31 2024,positive,long movie at 2 hours and 46 minutes but it moved very fast keeps you interested the whole way great visuals story and sound best movie i have seen  in a while go see it it wont disappoint you
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie if you can even call it that this is a masterpiece of art and just purely amazing i can not describe with real words how amazing the movie was have to give props to the elite level cast its great what they can make from some words on a piece of paperthe script great job to the director for being able to all of this in such a short time only a year is not a lot of time to create a spectical of art like this
Mar 31 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time well written well executed cant wait for the finale
Mar 31 2024,positive,great continuation of the first part
Mar 31 2024,positive,this movie looks amazing the visuals are top notch the story is solid the acting is above average its a great movie but the genre is deep so it doesnt have the wow factor one might expect given how great the movie really is
Mar 31 2024,positive,wish they had stayed true to the book
Mar 31 2024,positive,too long and too loud
Mar 31 2024,negative,long boring music was oppressively loud 
Mar 31 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  i saw dune part 1 several years ago when it first came out and recently rewatched it to refresh my memory  im glad i did having the refreshed memory of part 1 made dune part 2 so much more enjoyable  im looking forward to part 3 just dont take three years for the next installment
Mar 31 2024,positive,im quenching for part 3
Mar 31 2024,positive,awesome show everything i expected and more great graphics sound acting helps to have a background and understand what is going on some in our group were a little lost but all enjoyed it
Mar 31 2024,positive,hard to leave reviews sometimes but when you truly enjoy something it fills you with excitement and joy this movie has been by far one of the bestest for 2024 this is after watching dune part one and giving it another try to finish it amazing movie as well and the following of part two just mind blowing its truly a movie well put together an experience to have you at the edge of your seat
Mar 31 2024,positive,this film is simply perfect there are no words that can define how good this film is undefeatedly deserving of the 2025 oscar and all the awards it participates in
Mar 31 2024,positive,love it and must watch at the theater to get the sound effects  love the actors and the amazing effects
Mar 31 2024,positive,movie was good but wrap it up already  if part three leads to a part four ill be waiting for it to stream
Mar 31 2024,positive,the cinematography and cgi were fantastic the sound was very good also the story however is a poor adaptation of the book with changes in characters and timeline which leaves it confused for anyone who has read the book    without giving any spoilers but when you realise the last 20 minutes of the movie is about actually preparing the way for a sequel rather than bringing a proper conclusion to the story it left me very disappointed
Mar 31 2024,positive,an amazing conclusion to part one massive epic the ever expanding cast with a listers is just the cherry on top the cinematography on this movie is out of this world  no pun intended lol
Mar 31 2024,positive,i had high hopes going into dune 2 considering i enjoyed the first movie very much the trailers and the tv spots all seemed very convincing and im glad my expectations were high because this film delivered on every possible level    first off i should definitely mention the characters that made up the film all of the cast did a phenomenal job including timothée chalamet and austin butler who were show stealers and i think were some of the best performances of the year and overall the entire cast really brought the story to life and their expressions and emotions and the way they actually made you feel connected and brought into the story that they were telling    and the story itself across the entire film was phenomenal i hear a lot of people say that the last film didnt have enough action in it or it was just a little too slow and not enough sequences of violence or action or whatever and i feel like that first film does a great job of setting up this film like its a twopart series and the first film just setting it up while the second film will do all the heavy blows and it truly does that across the film i especially feel that seeing more of the fremen throughout the entire film was very cool to see especially seeing how many of them there were their customs and how they slowly started to trust paul as the lisan al gaib i really enjoyed seeing pauls arc as he slowly starts to embrace his role as lisan al gaib and seeing him slowly start to turn towards a darker path in his role as the lisan al gaib the twist with house of attreides coming from the harkenens was really cool and interesting to see especially towards the end when paul takes the life of the baronhis grandfather which was incredible to witness even witnessing what all happens on the harkenen homeworld was incredible especially seeing feydrautha murder the final members to be thought of house attreides was breathtaking and how ruthless and violent he truly is even how he messed around with rabanportrayed by dave bautista and made him seem like a little mouse to him was crazy we truly got to see who his character and what he is as princess irulanportrayed by florence pugh describes him hes psychotic even in the final moments of the film with the phenomenal battle between paul and feydrautha to the other houses coming to fight the fremen was especially how we see chaniportrayed by zendaya lose pauls trust and love even as we see the toll pauls sister takes on his mother lady jessicaportrayed by rebecca ferguson is cool and seeing her embrace her role as a mother and even in the end though the story doesnt feel complete it seems where it comes to that conclusion we will never know what happens next but it is confirmed that dune messiah is in the works it gives you a feeling of interest and suspense as you see paul and the fremen prepared to take on the rest of the houses and potentially the rest of the galaxy    in summary dune 2 is a truly phenomenal film and the best film of this year it will stun and blow everybody away from its phenomenal storytelling to its incredible visuals dune 2 is a must see film of this year and my opinion one of the best films of the decade thats why dune 2s a 1010 film
Mar 30 2024,positive,now that was quality film making 
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was one of the best movies i have ever seen love it i would see it again
Mar 30 2024,positive,better than the first and the first was fantastic truly one of the best sci fi movies i have ever watched timothee chalamet is one of the best up and coming actors in hollywood
Mar 30 2024,positive,excellent i can only hope the remaining of the books will be brought  to films
Mar 30 2024,positive,still need to watch the first film but a great sci fi flick sort of like star wars for an older audience
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie  follows on well to the first one
Mar 30 2024,positive,first off how is this movie pg13 and who thinks this is ok for 13 year to old to watch over all good movie and if you did not see the first one recently id watch it first some of this movie though they just rushed it so some of it felt out of place minus one star for that please dont take your 13 year old to this
Mar 30 2024,positive,i think that this movie can be long at some points but there is a great story with great action and acting i think this movie is a must see my favorite part of the movie was when feydrautha kissed his uncle baron harkonnen i really do love this movie
Mar 30 2024,negative,seriously  theres going to be another dune  3 or 4 or 5  when does it end
Mar 30 2024,positive,really good movie wonderful acting cant wait for 3
Mar 30 2024,positive,great movie visually stunning loved it

Mar 30 2024,positive,unmissable awesome masterpiece
Mar 30 2024,positive, 9610       spoilers   i was gonna wear a anakin i dont like sand shirt but it wasnt gonna deliver until sunday  i dont love the first in my opinion its one of the most ok films ive seen but it sets up for this juggernaut of pay off this honestly makes me hype for what there gonna do next and this feels like the hype that we got from the what are the rings or the original star wars trilogy its a real modern classic cinematography and set pieces blew my mind you just feel the scope the same with blowing up the helicopter things was really well done i cant find much negatives here austin butler was introduced pretty late but still had a big presence and this man can do great impressions the climax was just prefect even the small details of paul telly chani that he would always love her until the day he stopped breathing then asking princess irulan to take his hand was such an unexpected twist but makes sense when you stop to think about it in the bigger picture he is royalty after all and has to do certain things for the bigger picture until he can ultimately find happiness perfect movie grade a
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is seriously epic
Mar 30 2024,positive,well made movie but differs way too far from book 1984 version  scifi too was closer believe it or not
Mar 30 2024,negative,dont waste your money or time  the original 1 and 2 were much better sure todays special effects are nice but half the story and plot was written over  where was the wearing module   and the ending was left off never saw the navigator s the whole movie
Mar 30 2024,negative,very slow movie felt likewhen its gonna end and after waiting for 3hrs almost got to know there would be another onelike cmon
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely stunned by how good this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie me and friend have ever seen in a theater perfection
Mar 30 2024,positive,not quite perfect although not having read the book i cant comment on the accuracy of the adaptation slow to get going but definitely one that would benefit from a rewatch as theres so much going on if i was nitpicking id say the whole nuclear weapons angle could have been cut out and lost nothing that aside its a very good film indeed
Mar 30 2024,negative,disappointing i honestly expected more
Mar 30 2024,positive,its gonna be a little hard to follow if you havent seen the first movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,great move  makes me want to go back and reread the book
Mar 30 2024,negative,i cant even explain how boring this movie is and 25 hours are you kidding me this felt like forever this was so boring i dont even know the plot

Mar 30 2024,positive,a example movie must watch the only problem with it would be that you have to watch the first but still an excellent movie despite it
Mar 30 2024,positive,best movie of 2024great acting set design score cgi this is why we go to the movies

Mar 30 2024,positive,i havent felt the way this movie made me feel since i was a kid watching star wars for the very first time absolute masterpiece
Mar 30 2024,positive,dune 2 was released in 2024 and is the sequel to the last movie of the same name based on the frank herbert series of books it stars timothee chalamet rebecca ferguson stellan skarsgard josh brolin javier bardem zendaya et al the plot is somewhat complicated so lets just say its the classic good vs evil ruling empire vs the rebels with a little romeo and juliet love story mixed in for fun its directed and cowritten by by denis villeneuve the visuals are breathtaking the acting is incredibly good it features fantastic special effects with excellent fight scenes and the script was also great the only negative for me was the ending which was clearly just a set up for part 3 i would have liked for the movie to end about fifteen minutes earlier but thats just me overall villeneuve has shown again why hes one of the best directors in hollywood as this movie was epic best seen on the big screen so if possible hurry out and see it
Mar 30 2024,positive,better than the first dune and sets up dune 3 nicely
Mar 30 2024,positive,it was good  get plenty of rest this is a 3 hour movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,once in a lifetime experience must watch it in a big screen imax with laser recommended
Mar 30 2024,positive,i watched the first and part two both today which was quite overwhelming dune is intense visually the film is genius with perfectly composed shots special effects and the colouring was epic the use of sound was essential and the sound itself with the already epic soundtrack is not like anything ive ever heard imax is loud so skip it if your not good with seatshaking level noise the story gets more intense in part two and requires full attention all the time i have to say having not read the books some parts are confusing and i lost track of what was going on at times the casting was perfect and i cant imagine anyone else playing any of the characters especially paul was perfectly cast every creative choice fits perfectly into the overall feel of the film the world that it exists within and the characters themselves i feel as though i have witnessed something truly spectacular in cinema now i gotta read the books
Mar 30 2024,positive,superb denis vs magnum opus wow
Mar 30 2024,positive,great action and characters but it did seem a little short as in it seemed like they had to compress too much in the time allowed and left some key elements of the book out
Mar 30 2024,positive,i loved the movie i need cant wait for it to come out on streaming services
Mar 30 2024,positive,the second part of what looks likely to be a trilogy delivers precisely what was required an epic in every sense breathtaking cinematography and very well directed austin butler with a standout performance
Mar 30 2024,positive,one of the greatest sci fi movies ive ever seen the scale is epic the acting and direction were flawless the world was stunning and the score blew me away best of all villanueve appears to have been as faithful as possible to the source material which is frustratingly rare these days this movie was incredible
Mar 30 2024,positive,awesome follow up hope theres a third one
Mar 30 2024,positive,this was simply excellent movie fully delivered and was very well done if you are fan of the dune series of books this one and part 1 bring to life those books
Mar 30 2024,positive,freaking masterpiece
Mar 30 2024,positive,absolutely perfect love the cast and the cinematography timmy c deserves some praise for this
Mar 30 2024,positive,better than the first film emotional violent just great
Mar 30 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie great character development true to the book
Mar 30 2024,positive,kind of disappointed 2nd part was boring
Mar 30 2024,positive,i have seen it twice in one week  every aspect from the soundtrack to the cinematography is amazing  i completely forgot i was sitting in a theater and believed each and every actor was a real person i will happily watch it again
Mar 29 2024,positive,i just thought it was a lot of fun
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was good nonpredictable 7 12 8 a little long but of course part three because there was no solution
Mar 29 2024,positive,its amazing and i love it so much
Mar 29 2024,positive,beautiful  just beautiful this movie was and i mean on every level possible go see it in 4dx or imax 
Mar 29 2024,positive,very dark i love the first one and was so excited for part two but it just seem to be super dark to me
Mar 29 2024,positive,absolute stunning film visually you can easily get lost in just watching everything happening around the actors story was a bit choppy for me and i think thats due to editing and i wish their would be more payoff to the visions
Mar 29 2024,neutral,too much fighting and religious overtones
Mar 29 2024,positive,stunning visuals but the divergence from the books story makes for a frustrating experience essential subplots are cut out making this 2 hour 45 minute movie feel rushed hopefully the third installment will find a way to bring back the heart of this story im not sure why hollywood keeps deciding to do adaptations that veer off from what made the books great i cant say more without spoilers
Mar 29 2024,positive,looks and sounds absolutely incredible one of the greatest scifi movies you will ever see
Mar 29 2024,positive,the greatest cinema experience of all time
Mar 29 2024,positive,though impressive in its ability to make dunes look duney the rest of the flick is boring beyond words much like the first one this one has ideas in it that are just mumbled through and you miss most of the dialogue perhaps you had to read the book beforehand to understand or the issue is that there are derivative movies that were inspired by frank herberts novel and mined with better execution    i do not understand the overwhelming love of this movie it feels sopedestrian and miniseries milked dried they really take their time to get to a point  also the drudgery of seeing a pretty dune and thennothing  this movie is all intellect and zero emotion a frustrating movie to sit through
Mar 29 2024,positive,great watch see it in a dolby experience and every thud and every breathe kept me in perfect suspense at times the visions and forecasting can be a bit confusing or distracting but not enough to distract from the truly epic size of the story and further potential set up perfectly for the third instalment
Mar 29 2024,positive,even better than the part one
Mar 29 2024,neutral,the effects and cinematics were fantastic the plot was just boring like the other dune films they could have made it a superb piece to remember but what happened star wars movies are far more interesting let it die out like all the other 250 superhero movies
Mar 29 2024,positive,not my cup of tea but was a interesting movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,masterpiece best movie of scientific fiction ever
Mar 29 2024,positive,very close to the book which is a long indepth story dramatic scenes and very real characters portrayed throughout
Mar 29 2024,positive,compared to the first it has a lot more things that make it different from the book not to say that is bad but there are somethings in the book i would have enjoyed to see in the movie overall a great film though
Mar 29 2024,positive,1 scific movie to see in theaters  imax  do you like sequels if you say maybe well dune 2 is a must see sequel and delivers an amazing story visual effects sound acting you will not be disappointed with this epic return to dune
Mar 29 2024,positive,i found myself much more engaged and connected with dune part 2 than i was with part 1 not only does this sequel top its predecessor it delivers something extraordinary
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing film great soundtrack
Mar 29 2024,positive,this is cinema  watched twice in the theater
Mar 29 2024,positive,phenomenal movie imax was made for movies like this
Mar 29 2024,positive,what a masterpiece the characters designs the world building and the character ares are amazing going from seeing austin butler as elvis presley to seeing him as a bald physico is so good as we know he can play so many different characters and he did this one perfectly timothee chalamet was also an incredible actor in this as per usual
Mar 29 2024,positive,i really like the scene after he drinks water made me audiobook book two and now im a dune fan i guess lol but seriously that scene is so sick the entire movie is good but ive thought about that scene every day for like 3 weeks now
Mar 29 2024,positive,great setting direction and visual effects the casting is so great too recommend to watch it
Mar 29 2024,positive,without question dune part 2 is a that ohso rare untrendy thing a modern masterpiece albeit a flawed masterpiece while the ultraminimalist marie kondo stylings of the desert are visual gift that keeps on giving and the character arcs and foreshadowing on display here are of the highest class theres a but    despite the brilliant set up from the first movie did anyone else get the impression that the fremen were never really in danger between the giant worms seemingly endless swathes of foot soldiers perfectly tune to their environment theres the inescapable feeling that the harkonnens never really stood a chance  despite austin butlers incredible turn as feed reutha    however the pros here far outweigh the cons and dune part 2 is going to be discussed for a very long time im a believer that the original source material is more importantinfluential than it is actually good but denis villeneuves interpretation of frank herberts galaxy is treat for the senses
Mar 29 2024,positive,1010 great movie had a great time watching it
Mar 29 2024,positive,amazing sequel great action visually stunning and great sound great score cant wait for part 3
Mar 29 2024,positive,way better than first dune movie in the 1990s
Mar 29 2024,negative,did not really grab my attention at all characters and plot are just weird and made no sense to me
Mar 29 2024,positive,the movie is so memorable for me favorite movie of the year
Mar 29 2024,positive,dune 2 is an absolute must watch for scifi fans
Mar 29 2024,positive,i have seen dune 2 a total of 3 times once on an xd screen once on a dolby atmos and once on a laser imax imax is for sure the way to see it    i think each time i have seen it its gotten better and i understand a little more of the story a real feast for the eyes thats for sure the music the sound etc this movie is a real masterpiece i dont care how good your living room tv with a 72 inch screen and surround sound is it simply cannot compare to watching on a huge imax screen with a laser projector and no nobody in the theater is talking or on their phones because this movie is just too good to not keep your eyes glued to the screen see this in theaters while you still can you will not regret it
Mar 29 2024,positive,did not disappoint ive been waiting for this for a long time and i can seriously say that this is probably one of the best movies ive seen in the past 5 years
Mar 29 2024,positive,dune part two is a generational science fiction masterpiece     i was not born in time to see the lawrence of arabia apocalypse now or space odyssey in their moment so i feel especially lucky that denis villeneuve has proven the hollywood epic is not simply a lost art form     the best movie ive seen since fellowship of the ring my favorite movie    see it in theaters friends imax if you can 
Mar 29 2024,positive,a tremendous movie with good fights and highly recommended viewing
Mar 29 2024,positive,its long  well worth it
Mar 29 2024,positive,it was a very good movie hope part 3 doesnt  several more yrs to come out
Mar 29 2024,positive,one of the best movies in a long time a cinematic masterpiece i dont ever see movies twice in theatre and i am going to see this again what a story and what a movie
Mar 29 2024,positive,incredible movies in 2024best audio performance
Mar 28 2024,positive,loved every minute of it a perfect mix of majestic soundtracks and impeccable scifi picture blended in with the soft drama and true action on dune keeps you pinned on the theaters seat the small details and loyalty to the source material tops it with the sweet delicious cherry id gladly rewatch twice or thrice just to better absorb it all
Mar 28 2024,negative,maybe i had too high of expectations because everyone said it was so good it was beautiful but overall empty never caught myself caring for or rooting for one of the characters good or bad some great landscape shots and artsy closeups
Mar 28 2024,positive,great story and special effects  stayed mainly true to the original story  left you wanting more but each movie is a full story in itself    chris walken was great as the emperor
Mar 28 2024,positive,denis villeneuve alongside christopher nolan are two filmmakers working today that literally have yet to produce a product that i have not enjoyed loved embraced endorsed or more than likely added to my favorite films of alltime and dune part ii reaffirms this as it is a monumental achievement that transcends expectations and transcends what as audiences and cinephiles believe can even be accomplished with a camera    this was an experience that surpassed even the first film in its scope characterization attention to detail and progression within the narrative that is masterfully and thoughtfully imagined with every frame piece of dialogue and a score by the legendary hans zimmer that truly made me feel like a kid again  watching films like jurassic park and the matrix in a cinema around the time i became a teenager are films that easily elicited pure emotional responses that we dont often get anymore     the incomparable visual effects cinematography editing and brilliant adapted screenplay are just a few more of the accolades this film deserves  the ensemble cast from chalamet to butler to chanti to ferguson to bardem to skarsgård to pugh  denis brings out their absolute best and it is undeniably apparent everyone from cast and crew are eternally invested    i dont anticipate another film in 2024 that is going to surpass what villeneuve has achieved and despite a march release i would hope this is a film that is recognized and appreciated at the end of the year especially when awards season is in full force    all i can say unequivocally is dune part iiwas worth the wait and stilgar believes
Mar 28 2024,positive,part two was great and i followed the storyline just fine i did not like how they made zendayas character to standoffish and questioning to paul she was not like that in the books
Mar 28 2024,positive,great movie long but i didnt get bored great effects action character development felt like i was really in this world part 2 is way better than part 1
Mar 28 2024,positive,cinematics and cinematography were excellent   and sticking to the story line so much better than the 80s original attempt  whens dune 3
Mar 28 2024,positive,i liked it quite a bit  there were some changes to the story that i have a rough time accepting particularly the entire rewrite of chani is not what i would have done  why do i give 5 stars  because the amazing content that denis and the crew and actors provided is just so fantastic and its impossible to do a dune movie so hey very well done guys i appreciate the insanely hard work and talent    my favorite interpretations so far have been feyd big time stilgar peter devries and the entire treatment of the sardaukar  the worm riding fascinating i never thought about doing it that way i get it just hadnt thought about the worm just staying far enough out of the sand to keep the exposed segments out  makes it look 20x more dangerous serious excitement    all around great experience i cant wait for the next installment
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is why you go to the theater  good movie but you need to watch the first one to understand it all
Mar 28 2024,neutral,i was disappointed with the artistic license taken at the end
Mar 28 2024,negative,visually spectacular otherwise empty there are some interesting ideas lurking but these remain unexplored  the story makes no sense and is actually rather silly the lead characters are neither interesting or sympathetic with as much character as cardboard boxes   perhaps 3 stars five stars is absurdly generous
Mar 28 2024,positive,its visually stunning and there some very good performances by the key actors but but the first half drags a little and the film overall lacks light and shade with the action sequences sometimes just too relentless also i dont like the portrayal of chani its rather one dimensional and seems to be a slightly lame nod to the fashionable kickassbadass strong female thing i preferred the first film
Mar 28 2024,positive,dune part 2   it is a great culmination of different genres scifi adventureaction   the score by hans zimmer is just enough to sweep you of your feet  timothee chalamet is just so good especially in the third act   highly recommended
Mar 28 2024,positive,i need to see it again to give it a revisit  however it was much better than the first  better plot development and engagement  despite me not liking timmy he did very well as the lead  visually powerful and a great film all around  saw at sunset megaplex
Mar 28 2024,positive,its crazy that a movie can be this good  dune 2 needs to win an oscar at least or we might as well do away with the award altogether  its like the first time one sees titanic or transformer or harry potter  one of those start of great movie franchises that so stunningly original  neverseenbefore cinema techniques and ideas so exciting from beginning to end  this will go down as one of the greatest for years to come  gosh  i am worry about dune 3  can it even come close 
Mar 28 2024,positive,beautiful and entertaining  looking forward to part 3
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is way above a movie its an experience that should be felt 
Mar 28 2024,positive,when is part 3 coming out lol
Mar 28 2024,positive,i am extremely impressed the story is fascinating and some of the action scenes are amongst the finest i have ever seen its a bit long but never boring my only reproach would be that old and new important characters are not fully developed and are only given very few brief scenes i guess that only means that the surviving ones  will be more present in a third installment dune messiah
Mar 28 2024,positive,awesome movie i cant wait for the third part
Mar 28 2024,positive,amazing visually great acting edge of my seat
Mar 28 2024,positive,amazing cinematic experience it was absolutely
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is better than the first in every single way not saying the first was bad still a good movie but this movie is peak cinema the camera shots the action the acting the character development and story are all done perfectly here this is a must see film and one of the greatest films i have ever seen
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is hands down the best film ive ever seen everything was so massive the acting impeccable the story is so well told every character so perfectly cast the make up and costume design are second to none unbelievable
Mar 28 2024,positive,what a masterpiece visuals the acting the soundtrack great sequel
Mar 28 2024,positive,this is literally the best movie i have ever seen in my life part 1  part 2 has surpassed everything else for me be it sci fi or fantasy in imax its a theater experience ive never had before it was clearly built from the ground up for the imax experience and i noticed a big difference when seeing it in a regular theater ive seen it 5 times and im only stopping because its dropping out of imax i genuinely believe that this is the equivalent of witnessing star wars in 1977 ive never been so engrossed in a movie or seen this quality in cinematography and sound design
Mar 28 2024,negative,just a really weak film all around
Mar 28 2024,positive,ive seen this movie 5 times in theaters so far and it gets better every time i watch it lady jessica is my favorite 
Mar 28 2024,positive,very well made gave more insight than the first one cant wait for dune 3
Mar 28 2024,positive,the entire movie including the sound script was just fantastic  ive seen it twice at the theater because i liked it so much
Mar 28 2024,positive,best movie in decades and i cannot wait for the next
Mar 28 2024,positive,supremely impressive and epic watch this in theaters
Mar 28 2024,negative,brutally boring ill never get those 3 hours back so confused
Mar 28 2024,negative,not my cup of tea no character development convoluted basically just an excuse for special affect battle scenes if youre an 8 year old boy who enjoys pulling the wings off flies this is for you
Mar 27 2024,positive,more epic engaging and romantic than the first film which was just the first half of the same book
Mar 27 2024,negative,beautifully made stunning visuals and soundtrack  acting was great  the ending felt a little rushed  it was the tone of the movie that i didnt find appealing  most of the characters were scheming and unlikeable  it was so hard to care about the protagonists due to being so manipulative and selfserving that i could care less about the ending
Mar 27 2024,positive,liked visual effects  dialog was poor
Mar 27 2024,positive,special effects scenery were great  did not care for the movie or acting
Mar 27 2024,positive,absolutely amazing  this was my second time seeing dune part two but the first time on imax 70mm  wow
Mar 27 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time dont let the run time scare you its very entertaining
Mar 27 2024,positive,if you liked part one you wont be disappointed
Mar 27 2024,positive,did not like the dark turn that the movie took i think it is leaving itself open for a part 3
Mar 27 2024,positive,wonderful movie cinematography was on par with the very best and every moment of the film was gripping
Mar 27 2024,positive,incredible if you dont see this in an imax you will be missing out on a once and a lifetime spectacle     not since the two towers have i felt such elation and magnidicence     watch it now before it leaves theaters make haste
Mar 27 2024,positive,refreshing to finally see a movie in imax worth seeing the visuals were absolutely stunning and overall it was just a super present viewing experience even though this movie was almost 3 hours it only felt like it was an hour and half long
Mar 27 2024,positive,obvious setup for part 3 4    well done but could have been done in shorter time or more story in time used  too much dead time
Mar 27 2024,positive,ok i loved the first part of this so my review is going to be a little biased but this has to be the best sequel ive seen in a long time everything is bigger from the brilliant effects to the script and the acting the cast is stacked with top tier names the sand worms are a joy to behold whenever theyre on screen they look awesome the music is fab its just an outstanding film the only negative i have is that you really do have to have watched the first film for most of this to make sense its not a sequel you can just jump right into without having prior knowledge of the first films events like you can with some follow ups cracking movie
Mar 27 2024,positive,denis villanueva has given us a visually stunning riveting and breathtaking scifi masterpiece that perfectly encapsulates why imax exists
Mar 27 2024,positive,absolutely legendary this definitely sets the bar for all of the other scifi and fiction movies who are looking to be considered as one of all time greats because this one sure is    visuals  1010  cast   1010  acting  1010  cinematography  1010  soundmusic  epic
Mar 27 2024,positive,such a good movie id watch it again
Mar 27 2024,positive,this movie delivered on stunning visuals and seatshaking action but still suffered from poor casting of the main protagonists spotty storytelling and sequences or features that made little sense  part of effective an scifi movie experience is the suspension of disbelief where something may not be possible or likely in the real world it is supported within the imaginary world that is created  in the case of the dune remake its simply distracting  as a fan of the original movie i had high hopes for this remake using modern technology but left with a decent but not great impression
Mar 27 2024,negative,still boring  it uninteresting dont care about characters glad when it was over but it is better then the original with sting
Mar 27 2024,positive,simply stunning epic and beautiful
Mar 27 2024,positive,after this film my faith in the trilogy was restored    when i watched the first part some time ago i wasnt very impressed the film was very slow and the excitement didnt start until the last 15 minutes this film on the other hand was thrilling from start to finish there were many memorable moments and the excitement was tense most of the time the fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitement    also i cant say that the film was too abrupt there was love depression and compassion very cleverly woven in the film offered the whole spectrum of emotions    speaking of the actors timothée chalamet as paul atreides did an excellent job offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power one could get quite a deep understanding of the phrase power corrupts austin butler as feydrautha was also excellent the inner psychological instability reflected in him was extremely convincing    visually the film was extremely well made combined with the music by hanz zimmer the visuals were so evocative that in some moments i found myself shivering definitely a film to experience in the cinema excellent
Mar 27 2024,positive,an epic tour de force which is somehow still as deceptively barren as its namesake superior to its prequel if only because most of the best stuff was reserved for this second outing the story is now familiar to any who have seen avatar the outsider will become the aboriginal and then lead them to glory that avatar was much inspired by the story of dune doesnt really change the fact that the blueskinned ones somehow did it better dune is a much more serious affair of course but its espouses true depth of character for its epic story and visuals we never really get close to anyone  they are all pieces to serve the story the love story is fine if predictable i still dont know how the sandworms move or why they dont submerge and throw off their riders or what they eat  but the rule of cool dominates here we have a much more dangerous villain in the young harkonnen prince and the movie takes the time to convince us he is worthy before he goes up against paul atriedes but villains be damned for the story really hinges around paul fulfilling or not fulfilling his destiny both of which have serious consequences i didnt really understand why in the end he had to do what he did but he seems blessed with drstrangeseque endgame foretelling so apparently this was the only choice hmmm what is great is the last act which i wont spoil here but which takes a twist away from novel and the older movie version a twist for the better i would say and the music zimmer really pulled out all the stops this time with a soaringly tragic love theme which is just sublime for all its shallow thrills i greatly enjoyed dune 2 and if it feels familiar it is really because dune has inspired so many other stories in turn so credit where credit is due what will be fascinating is seeing where they go next for the sequel novels were trippy to the point of incoherence often lets hope the movies as they seem to be truly chart their own course ahead dune doesnt rival star wars or star trek yet but it may
Mar 27 2024,positive,i didnt understand anything about the movie
Mar 27 2024,positive,enjoyed the show especially the scenery the plot was the same as the original except for the ending looks like there will be a third episode  the sound was too loud at times didnt think it needed to be
Mar 27 2024,positive,like the first movie everything works well except the warfare anything above a skirmish struggles to look like all out war  and with a couple of years of what real war looks like taking up regular news daily theres a vast disconnect between that and having 10 minutes to wrap up a battle for a cityplanet in movies the other thing villeneuves dune movies lack is any sense of who lives in arrakeen a city without citizens  thems the quibbles everything else builds on part 1s set up and follows through effectively with more of everything people liked
Mar 27 2024,positive,epic visually yet ponderous in pace too loud in the theatre as always
Mar 27 2024,positive,a gigantic proof of how an almost mystical image and sound can catapult you anywhere even in the depths of the desert every blink of an eye during viewing is a step on living sand
Mar 27 2024,positive,amazing sound in the right theatre none of that 4dx necessary
Mar 27 2024,positive,best movie experience there may be some nits if you want to pick but overall the best movie watching experience
Mar 27 2024,positive,this movie was phenomenal to watch it was beautiful the acting the cinematic experience it just felt like you were actually there it felt so real
Mar 27 2024,positive,best movie i have ever seen everything about it was perfect
Mar 27 2024,positive,i just wanna live flat on the floor and watch dune
Mar 27 2024,positive,strangely cruder than its predecessor but still satisfying and leaves you wanting messiah to happen  i really rate chani as a character wonderful performance by zendiya
Mar 27 2024,positive,even though they have taken some liberties with  the book it was still a very compelling movie
Mar 27 2024,positive,it was an incredible movie much better than the first part god willing that cinema gets closer to this quality again permanently
Mar 27 2024,positive,excellent in imax would not want to see any other way  loved part 2 much better than 1
Mar 27 2024,positive,much better than part 1
Mar 27 2024,positive,nice movie great sound its incredible
Mar 27 2024,positive,denis villeneuves epic storytelling of dune continues and gets even better as the worldbuilding and character development gets cranked up not to mention action humor and emotion excellent directing filmediting and if it doesnt win best cinematography soundediting and best original score at next years oscars it will have been robbed
Mar 27 2024,positive,great visuals too long great sound fx and music as well
Mar 27 2024,positive,so good now i want to read the books
Mar 27 2024,positive,truly an absolute masterpiece and staple for a franchise that will forever be remembered
Mar 27 2024,positive,honestly i have never watched a movie that has had such amazing cinematography along with its modern day remake of the the original dune saga i was skeptic of how they would conclude part 2 and it has me taken away comepletey not many films make me wanna rewatch it for a 3rd or 4th time just falling inlove with its imax film ratio i will be investing more into my home threate system so i can rewatch the home media version on blueray once its released
Mar 27 2024,positive,very good better than the first smooth pace beautiful end action packed not a boring moment cant wait for the next
Mar 26 2024,positive,even better than the first part which was already great but had to be used to explain the basics of the dune story the story really picks up speed in the second part and also contains unexpected twists
Mar 26 2024,positive,very good cgi was very impressive not a lot of humor but very intense fight scenes
Mar 26 2024,positive,what can i say to do this movie justice just wow
Mar 26 2024,positive,great movie i am a fan of the franchise waiting for the 3rd part yes
Mar 26 2024,positive,the movie was a great continuation of the first movie  ive seen a lot of reviews saying you dont need to watch the first movie to watch the second i disagree watching the first movie gives you the gravity of whats happening
Mar 26 2024,positive,honestly i thought that the movie was a little bit boring i liked it the movie  the characters but i hated how it got better at the end of movie
Mar 26 2024,positive,i liked this movie and went and viewed it twice but the ending did not follow the book but then it more suggested a part 3  the book that came out illustrating this part 2 makes not a mention of a part 3 or even a thought pattern related to suchmaybe an entirely different venture with aged new actors but my suspicions are there  will be a part 3 the views of the desert are greatdefinitely a visual movie
Mar 26 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies i have ever seen
Mar 26 2024,negative,boring with terrible cgi of the worms that look like just a sandstorm they could have easily trimmed 30 mins of the running time by shorting the camera pans and people glaring into the camera
Mar 26 2024,positive,beautifully directed and wonderful visuals along with a phenomenal score by hans zimmer that never brought a thought to be distracted  throughout the film
Mar 26 2024,positive,dune 1 was just great but dune 2 is 100x better than 1st cause we know 1st is always not the better one than 2 fully loaded with excellent vfx  i just love it 
Mar 26 2024,positive,all my all my lebron were do i begin lebron is my glory of my life he deserves my life no matter what happens he gave me life in the darkest times of my life he deserve all of my property
Mar 26 2024,positive,i would have watched this movie even if it was 11 hours long and it still would not feel long enough
Mar 26 2024,positive,the first movie was good but this was something else the action and acting was amazing and way better then the first one the first one was really good but this is wow definitely recommend
Mar 26 2024,positive,its a hit deni captures the essence of medieval conflict inserts it beautifullly into the scifi genre and lets it flow like sand in the wind if youre a timothée chalamet skeptic you can hide from him no longer he is the lisanal gaib bow before his grace atreides atreides atreides
Mar 26 2024,negative,this movie was boring and the action was sub par but hey not very oke has good taste
Mar 26 2024,positive,the first movie had me enthralled while the second is good and looks sounds amazing it didnt build the story as much as rolled it out still way better than many of the movies out there and worth your time very curious if the next installment will stun or fade out
Mar 26 2024,positive,its amazing the grand scifi movie everyone is hoping for  the visuals and sound are most notable but the plot and acting are all top notch as well  another alltime classic from denis  the only downside is that the next movie isnt out and ready to be watched
Mar 26 2024,positive,it was really good and better than i thought it would be the highlight was josh brolin
Mar 26 2024,positive,the films aesthetics is superb the photography incredible and the direction impeccable this film is a work of art in itself not to mention the music which is also incredible the only downside in my opinion is that the films pace is sometimes a little too slow
Mar 26 2024,positive,modern masterpiece sets the bar for contemporary cinema
Mar 26 2024,positive,probably one of the best of this era  music visual acting storytelling all perfect
Mar 26 2024,positive,i really liked this movie and it had me on the edge of my seat  i kept thinking oh dont end here dont end here  and it didnt  great movie
Mar 26 2024,positive,great movie effects are crazy
Mar 26 2024,positive,wow i though hollywood stopped making movies like this anymore it is awesome
Mar 26 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a while also one of the best soundtracks amazing everything you can ask for in a good movie     part3
Mar 26 2024,positive,this is by far the best achievement of film making since the lord of the rings   dune part ii is 1010 perfection from the cinematography acting visuals plot music score by hans zimmer and the action in this movie is so intense at so many moments
Mar 26 2024,positive,if dune part one is as an appetizer part two serves as an excellent entree one of the best cinematic experiences ive ever had as the visuals are stunning and the acting is toptier across the board especially timothée chalamet instant classic scifi film
Mar 26 2024,negative,halo sucked succd sukd suckt suct sucd  lets do it again but this time  it will be like the last time  its just a movie chill kinda vibe   journey 2 was wack  nobody could really act   fade rotha zucked  timothee has a mangina   my knife fight scene was awesome and it was thrown out  you definitely get what u give here  if at face value and thats what you get was a movie  possession isnt funny  movie is too long  princess wweknightn gale was awful  i need a drink after this
Mar 26 2024,positive,graphics were great
Mar 26 2024,positive,visually fantastic and the sound was amazing the story starts a little slow at first but it really picks up about a quarter of the way in and then the second half was just a masterpiece highly recommend watching in imax totally worth it
Mar 26 2024,neutral,too weird too long needs more color
Mar 26 2024,positive,sequels are usually disappointing not the case with dune great acting and incredible special effects  great plot
Mar 26 2024,positive,epic from start to finish cant wait to see where this goes next 5 stars
Mar 26 2024,positive,along with part 1 they had 25x the time to tell the story but told less than lynchs did pauls importance is diminished chanis is now against him how and why alias not born so instead of paul becoming a man and a leader over 56 years time period of war with the harkonens it all happens in less than 9 months how do you cast christopher walken as the emperor then have him dress and act like a feeble old man in the end how could they do so many things right and still get so much wrong read the book watch the lynch movie and scifi series re watch these two films and see if you agree
Mar 26 2024,positive,a grand and beautiful journey that reminds you why film is great strong performances and plenty of breathing room help this adaptation subvert your expectations while remaining true to herberts text in all the right ways
Mar 26 2024,positive,dune awesome  it was everything i thought some scenes were a little dark but overall especially the music was great cant wait for part 3
Mar 26 2024,positive,fantastic character development world building and an unbelievably immersive and visceral movie going experience
Mar 26 2024,positive,i liked the first one but i like this second one more the visuals are great i havent read the book the only thing im missing is why they didnt use the same voice weaponry they used on the old one anyways great movie recommended
Mar 25 2024,positive,i think i read the book for the first time 50 years ago and several more times since then its not easy to turn a nearly 900 page book into film and denis villeneuve has done it  its a fine line to make it understandable to newbies without angering fans of the book and make a bangup film at the same time well worth seeing amazing effects and a pure setup for part 3
Mar 25 2024,negative,if i were an unimaginative 14 year old with no idea what guns were or what to do during a full scale war for the highest power i would probably have liked this film throw as many cool or popular faces as you want at it still not a good movie too long too like how many scenes of you walking thru a freakin desert do you need i want a refund
Mar 25 2024,positive,great moviel looking forward to the next one
Mar 25 2024,positive,visuals and set design were incredible  better than the first
Mar 25 2024,positive,it was epic too long but quite well worth it and really well done er uh dune
Mar 25 2024,positive,i am not thrilled with all of the changes that were made from page to screen but overall i really liked the final product i think they got paul and jessica right they are a reason they a respected by the fremen but also feared there is a reason that strangers treat both of themand later aliaas unnatural   as always gurney and stilgar are my favorite characters and they both get some satisfying screen time here   my big problem with this movie is pacing villeneuve is so in love with aesthetics that he practically rushes through certain plot points to get to more scenery chewing so that those scenes dont have enough impact
Mar 25 2024,positive,it shines in cinematography costumes acting and set the film is visually stunning and is a fun time a epic must see
Mar 25 2024,positive,this is a fantastic scifi that i highly recommend to plan coming to the theater 30 minutes after the start time the previews are 30 minutes of aggravating nonsense with maybe one movie ill make an effort to watch in the future     the first dune was a lot of story building that truly blossoms in the sequel i cant wait for this series to continue with the third and fourth installments
Mar 25 2024,positive,really freaking good i want more
Mar 25 2024,positive,i thought it was very well done much like the first one  im not gonna lie i am having a hard time with the hard rewrite of chani in variance of herberts work but at the same time my gosh no one else could have done as good a job as denis and zendaya did a great job in playing the role as it was written for her outstanding    feyd played by austin butler is a stunning interpretation and speaks so deeply of what it is to be harkonnen  but all the cast did an amazing job  xavier was a wake up call to me where have i been that i dont know more about this actor
Mar 25 2024,positive,was looking for some uplifting moments like star wars
Mar 25 2024,negative,too many disparate parts and pieces to be a coherent tight sci fi flick dialogue was unimaginative and mvoie overall was at least 30 minutes too long compared to the very best sci fi films such as blade runner total recall the thing it just doesnt measure up by a long shot
Mar 25 2024,positive,the sequel to this epic science fiction story has finally arrived and the adaptation of the 1965 novel by frank herbert has finally come to an incredibly satisfying conclusion it follows paul atreides as he unites with chani and the fremen people of the desert planet arrakis to wage war against house harkonnen while accepting his nature as a new messiah he must face a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee a visually thrilling masterpiece that will go down in history together with its first part as one of the best science fiction stories of all time denis villeneuve has built an immersive and unbelievable world for this franchise with such detail that it is just marvelous and this time he explores religion fanaticism and fighting for freedom with this story the movie is a spectacular experience in the big screen imax preferably with the stunning and cinematography and impressive visual effects the costume design and the production design outdid themselves with this second installment and the sound and hans zimmers score continue to amaze viewers with its epicness the 2025 oscars will definitely have dune part two among the biggest contenders of the ceremony also the whole cast gives its best especially timothee chalamet zendaya austin butler and rebecca ferguson even javier bardems stilgar that gives the movie some of the best comic relief moments of the movie ultimately so epic and captivating that i want to read the first book right now
Mar 25 2024,positive,loved it watch it on imax
Mar 25 2024,positive,what a treat for diehard fans what a treat for the broader audience to be invited for a truly philosophical journey villeneuve managed to create a more than worthy vision of herberts ideas and please dont stop with messiah denis do dem dune books till nr 4 god emperor only you can succeed
Mar 25 2024,negative,its very mid its definitely not a must watch it felt pretty generic and rushed wasnt what i expected you should only watch it if you are a big fan of dune and you want to follow the story while watching it it felt like it was to long and i was hoping for it to end at some point during the middle it was dragged out and its way too overrated
Mar 25 2024,positive,very consistent to the book
Mar 25 2024,positive,i liked the close up shots and the cinematography
Mar 25 2024,positive,excellent movie making  film direction cinematography casting music hans zimmer  everybody did an amazing job with a fantastic plot also  i am very hesitant about the use of computer graphics in movies these days as it tends to be very corny but this movie did a great job go see it
Mar 25 2024,positive,awesome looking forward to part 3 
Mar 25 2024,negative,violent and boring even zendaya has only one look on her face the entire time
Mar 25 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece of the film for reference ive never read the books i only ever watched the part one and found that film to be a near masterpiece with this one superseding it slightly and moving into a perfection zone anybody giving this less than 5 stars simply does not like cinema
Mar 25 2024,positive,this was a great movie all around it was a long movie but was entertained the entire time great story acting action visual and sound effects one of my favorite movies of all time
Mar 25 2024,positive,i loved every about it except no teaser at the end when there clearly has to be another sequel  ending did seem a little rushed but loved to hear more about the inner workings of the realm
Mar 25 2024,positive,quiet long and somehow boring at a time
Mar 25 2024,positive,cinematographer greig fraser does some truly unimaginable work here in essence dune2 is a realistic work of art and constant orchestra of astonishing visuals that should be seen on the biggest screen you can find the complex character development was profoundly convincing the action sequences were energizing and in particular it felt completely vivid the field battle with feydrautha played by a pale skinnedalbinoized variant of austin butler was almost entirely devoid of color making the most uncanny feeling of fear hans zimmer  chose sounds that upgraded the climate and emotional resonance all through the film in spite of its lengthy runtime the film kept an ideal speed guaranteeing that practically zero scenes were wasted and that each second added to the overall journey
Mar 25 2024,positive,epic must see on big screen villeneuve should direct all the scifi movies from now on
Mar 25 2024,positive,never left a cinema after almost three hours and immediately wanted to book the next session the buzz after watching this was crazy honestly cant compare it to anything torn between appreciating part two in all its glory and desperately waiting in anticipation for part three edit ended up going back and watching it thrice more
Mar 25 2024,positive,an incredible scifi epic the visuals music and acting were all phenomenal a few changes from the book but they enhance the overall storyline and drama
Mar 25 2024,positive,never saw the first one because i heard it was boring decided to go see this because my daughter wanted to go see it i was extremely entertained ill admit the storyline is confusing but in a way that makes me want to go see it again austin butler stellan skarsgard and josh brolin are fantastic     also i guess its time to watch the first one
Mar 25 2024,positive,i saw this film in imax and it was incredible while almost 3 hours long i never once lost interest it was visually beautiful with a great soundtrack this is a must see for any sciencfi enthusiast
Mar 25 2024,positive,even better than one i wouldnt change a thing
Mar 25 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies ever not necessarily one of the greatest movies ever but one i could rewatch endlessly
Mar 25 2024,positive,for people that havent read the book and arent emotionally attached to the novel this will be a fun romp big screen movie with lots of action    for those who care about the book whether you like this movie or not will hinge on how you feel about the adaptations changes to chani they took a lot of editorial liberty with her character in some ways it makes the adaptation feel like the book was adapted to modern sensibilities but also it makes me a little sad to see the book not adapted as faithfully as it could have been    its an excellent movie its just not a perfect adaptation of dune whether that bothers you is up to you
Mar 25 2024,positive,didnt particularly love the first one but thought this one was worth a shot still not sure if its entirely my thing but i cannot deny this is well done to steal a non particularly unique take  lawrence of arabia meets star wars
Mar 25 2024,positive,we thought the movie was great  very glad we rewatched part 1 before going to keep the storyline straight  we hope they make a dune 3 to continue the story
Mar 25 2024,positive,i liked it but soundtrack and visuals  and javier bardimaustin butler do all the heavy lifting     the first 15 hours basically could have been summarized before the actual movie started in a small scrolling paragraph shorter than a star wars intro it was painfully long the most recent avatar was about the same lengthbut it didnt feel like it to me this felt like 3 hours     the 2nd half was good and fun     zendaya is a good actress but looking at her scowling face got old christopher walken seemed to not care he was there and also just seemed out of place in this universe     my biggest gripe is that the original dune movie from the 80s was just one film and covered more groundlore than both of these dune movies did at triple the run time    austin butler was the biggest surprise
Mar 25 2024,positive,it was a stunning epic movie based somewhat on the book  standing on its own i asbolutely loved this movie it looks great the character arcs are nicely done it has a bit of a problem with pacing at times and the feyd rautha bits feel a bit off but all in all its one of the better movies that ive seen recently    but its based on a book so its not unfair to compare it to the source material  and there it falls a bit short it cant be avoided that a book like dune gets simplified when brought to the big screen but from the richness of themes in the dune novel villeneuve seems to have picked only two the danger of charismatic leaders and pauls struggle against becoming a messianic figure and he really wanted to make sure that the audience got it which leaves out a lot of the other themes and scenes from the book    the biggest changes are of course his relationship with chani and how he basically just gives in to the holy war that will be fought in his name the fact that this surrender to his destiny happens rather fast makes it a bit jarring    good movie good acting very impressive visual effects as an adaptation of the book it falls a bit short
Mar 25 2024,positive,spectacular in every sense a magnificent blockbuster of galactic proportions 
Mar 25 2024,positive,even more than part one this dune deserves to be seen at the cinema as the sound and scenic design are both incredible in contribution to the epicness of the storytelling its story telling is layered with thematic allusions and respect for its audience to draw upon these themselves to so finely balance such restraint with the bombast of the big moments of its aesthetic is no easy feat and reflects the craftedness at the core of all aspects of denis villeneuves direction
Mar 25 2024,positive,an absolute tour de force of cinema ive never read the dune books nor seen any previous adaptations and yet i was drawn into the dune universe in such a profound and powerful way that it will stay with me for years this film is what storytelling in cinema looks like
Mar 25 2024,positive,a visual spectacle and the sound was incredible as well
Mar 25 2024,positive,literally a masterpiece loved it i would love to rewatch this beautiful work yet again
Mar 25 2024,positive,stunningly beautiful yet compromises on the themes and deep subtlety of the source material although some of the changes were probably necessary to fit the movie into a reasonable run time it wanders way too much for this to be the case with all of the changes     as a whole definitely worth watching however the more i think about it the less am i really satisfied
Mar 25 2024,negative,looks amazing incredibly boring movie fergusson and butler deliver brilliantly zendaya and chalamet performances are weak musical score was predictable and unimaginative
Mar 25 2024,positive,villeneuves dune part 2 delivers an epic spectacle a visually stunning and absolute pleasure to watch for fans for frank herberts dune  it left me wanting more  the casting storytelling cinematography effects are incredibly strong  chalamet ferguson  bardem were especially good 1010 villeneuve adaption of herberts dune is awesome
Mar 25 2024,positive,at the end of the movie when the great houses refused to accept the ascension of paul atreides to the imperial throne the logical obvious response was not to go to war but rather simply to withhold the shipment of spice  without spice the great houses would come around soon enough without warfare  and by the way why bother with an emperor in the first place  an expensive useless layer of government more trouble than its worth
Mar 25 2024,positive,the movie was amazing
Mar 25 2024,positive,one of the best movies of our generation
Mar 25 2024,positive,great plot if you love a good drama that is action packed with some twists and turns fantastic time
Mar 25 2024,positive,story acting scenery
Mar 25 2024,positive,awsome awsome movie  better then the first movie definitely one of my favorites right now 
Mar 25 2024,positive,awesome however timothe is the worst casting as he is not intimidating at all
Mar 25 2024,positive,after seeing dune part two i can confirm its not only the best film of 2024 so far not only that its denis villenueves best film but that its quite literally one of the best action films and sequels of all time rising up to the status of the dark knight  the beautiful cinematography keeps it 100 just like the first movie despite it being set in mostly desert territory every character is perfectly executed written beautifully and id say zendaya bardem chalamet and butler were the beating heart of this film paired together with one of hans zimmers best scores a gorgeously sinister overlook into the future hint hint dune messiah this is the makings of perfect storytelling paired with some of the best action and fight scenes put to the screen vfx is phenomenal in this as well along with the costume designs for everyone
Mar 25 2024,positive,phenomenal one of the greatest scifi films of all time
Mar 25 2024,positive,its the perfect mix of twilight got star wars  true blood
Mar 25 2024,positive,i think the dune part two was even better than the first one exciting from start to finish i cant wait until the next one drops love the fact that people who havent seen the first dune youll still love it and understand what is going on
Mar 25 2024,positive,epic film  very true to the book
Mar 25 2024,positive,rousing yarn  couldve done with a little less chanipaul romance chitchatand the deviations from the source material  javier bardem was spectacular
Mar 25 2024,positive,id say the story was old and stale but the books are 40 years old so perhaps that explains the same story ive seen before yet another movie that didnt need to be 3 hours  seen it all before fight sequences are so up close like always fast cuts no real feel of the battle special effects are good but i do that for a living and once again seen it all before actors are good but young love senerio is contrive and prophecy is weak
Mar 25 2024,positive,great visuals but disappointed in how chani gets screwed over hopefully theres a part 3 where that wrong is righted
Mar 25 2024,positive,phenomenal cinematography score and script were executed perfectly  cant wait to experience it again
Mar 25 2024,positive,i havent walked out of a movie in a longtime feeling the way i did about duneparttwo allow me to explain    the characters the visuals the storytelling the dialogue the action the music the sound design everything about this movie was cinema perfection     it truly is one of the best sequels of all time and timothee chalamet knows how to lead a movie zendaya stole the show josh brolin javier bardem austin butler and dave bautista were sooo good as well     when i tell you i had tears in my eyes i did not because the movie was sad but because it was beautiful if youre a movie buff like me or you love scifi in general please watch this movie     45
Mar 25 2024,positive,visually stunning  i highly request to see it on the biggest screen you can find
Mar 25 2024,negative,i walked out halfway through it
Mar 25 2024,positive,best godammn movie with stunning visuals music and performances
Mar 25 2024,positive,loved it saw it twice
Mar 25 2024,positive,beautiful shots and gorgeous bgm though plot not so satisfying
Mar 25 2024,positive,fantastic movie loved it so much and cant wait to see it again i really hope they make the sequel i will be soooooo disappointed if they dont
Mar 25 2024,positive,best movie of all time
Mar 25 2024,positive,great follow up to the first movie   fantastic scenery and excellent acting
Mar 24 2024,positive,beautiful movie with a heartbreaking story
Mar 24 2024,positive,good movie but way too drawn out
Mar 24 2024,negative,nothing interesting or inventive going on my wife dragged me to this recycled stories from the bible and european history lots of sand blowing around plot holes galore
Mar 24 2024,positive,there was nothing wrong with this movie and it was amazing to watch in the theatres high expectations for part 3 which hopefully comes out soon
Mar 24 2024,positive,fantastic movie but at times i thought the pacing was a bit strange and the ending was in my mind a bit rushed but a great movie overall and it has some of the most stunning visuals i have ever seen cant wait for dune messiah
Mar 24 2024,positive,so much better than the first i saw this in 4dx and i was litterally riding the sand worms this was a movie experience i cant wait for the next one
Mar 24 2024,positive,breathtaking cinematography and fantastic acting
Mar 24 2024,negative,couldve been so much better they stole alias moment and gave it to paul that was utter garbage
Mar 24 2024,positive,best movie of the decade it is rare a part 2 out does the 1st but in all honesty it does not feel like a sequel bc it just picks up exactly where part 1 finished well worth it saw it twice
Mar 24 2024,positive,it was certainly epic and something to see on the big screen preferably in imax it is a slow burn though like part 1 if you have issues staying focused on something for 2 and half hours this may not be for you i dont know if i liked it as much as part 1 but i want to watch it again when it is on streaming
Mar 24 2024,negative,well i really wanted to like it but the first 34 of the film drug on and on and mercifully lead to the frenetic conclusionwhich resolved little the psychotic died the emperor bowed to paul and did the director really think that the knife was stuck in puals right shoulder when clearly it was sticking out of his left side a moment before sloppy the endingpaul leads the fighters off to fight the other houses in battle in space chiani leaves for the south to lead her people and we walk out without any true conclusion to a story at this point i have no desire to even see a part 3 no stars
Mar 24 2024,positive,epic visuals sound story adaptations
Mar 24 2024,positive,enjoyable but slow paced and jumps around in a jarring way austin butler as feyd was a chefs kiss he is going places
Mar 24 2024,positive,the movie felt like a minute they could have made it 10 hours and i would still never get bored 
Mar 24 2024,positive,so much fun cant wait for dune messiah really hope it gets greenlit
Mar 24 2024,positive,a great conclusion to herberts epic takes enough liberties to be welladapted for the screen but stays faithful enough for the message to remain strong
Mar 24 2024,positive,pretty good but felt long  great movies dont feel long
Mar 24 2024,positive,dune part two not only successfully carries on the many great things about part one but also elevates them considerably the world building alone continues to be so out of this world patrice vermettes production design absolutely deserves a lot of the credit for that the makeup work as well as jacqueline wests costumes are even more imaginative this time around greig frasers cinematography here officially solidifies him as one of the best directors of photography working today as i was watching the many visual effects sequences i kept wondering how the hell did they pull that off having caught this in imax the sound work and hans zimmers score both shined through all the speakers surrounding me    the performances are also more enriching in this installment timothe chalamet and rebecca ferguson both continue such strong work here as paul and his mother lady jessica respectively meanwhile those who had less to do in the first film have a lot more to do here zendaya as chani josh brolin as gurney halleck and javier bardem as stilgar are each in great form not only that but i thought zendaya also shared some great onscreen chemistry with chalamet as for the new cast members austin butler as feydrautha harkonnen in a move 10 times more interesting than his overrated performance in elvis florence pugh as princess irulan and even christopher walken as her father shaddam iv all make for great additions    most of all the story is so emotionally engaging from start to finish not only that but it also kind of feels relevant to whats currently going on in the world the film itself may be a bit of a slow burn but joe walkers editing thankfully keeps the whole thing well paced theres definitely a lot to unpack here but thats what subsequent rewatches should be there for in any case dune part two absolutely deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible its epic in every conceivable way imaginable
Mar 24 2024,positive,dune part two is wonderful its one of those onceadecade experiences 3 hours that feel like minutes a different world you feel immersed you live it a soundtrack that drowns you in adrenaline and emotion breaks filled with art landscapes on par with vincent van gogh  truly lively performances rebecca ferguson and austin butler truly shine
Mar 24 2024,positive,great movie love the actors zendaya and timothee did an outstanding performance and work very well together i cant wait to watch the trilogy
Mar 24 2024,positive,amazing and intense at the same time
Mar 24 2024,positive,amazing movie would give a rating even higher than 5 maybe even best movie of all time hands down 
Mar 24 2024,positive,this movie is a game changer exceeding the likes of starwars easily the audio score acting and beautiful cinematography is like no other ive seen it 3 times and it still blows me away everytime
Mar 24 2024,positive,this movie is extraordinary its the fourth time ive been to my favorite cinema to see the film every time i see dune part two its story and world runs through my body amazing work
Mar 24 2024,negative,david lynchs version was way closer to the book and much better this version was absolute dogsht clearly most people who saw this didnt read the book  95 lmao why did they make chani an annoying little b
Mar 24 2024,positive,the movie was very exciting and well made gave it a 4 because it was a bit long and a little slow in some places but overall an excellent movie cant wait for dune 3
Mar 24 2024,positive,i dont need to get all technical with this review    this film was absolutely amazing

Mar 24 2024,positive,powerful  even better than the 1st movie which doesnt normally happen i watch tons of movies and series this has one of the top 5 most powerful scenes of all time all movies i says this for serious movie watchers like me if you truly engage in the stories and characters like me you will appreciate what the director did with this movie
Mar 24 2024,positive,fantastic blockbuster movie incredible acting incredible scenery incredible use of cgi great movie all around

Mar 24 2024,positive,incredibly immersive movie experience go lose yourself in another place and time for 3 hours
Mar 24 2024,negative,defiantly not as good as the original
Mar 24 2024,negative,we did not like the movie  it was so slow that i fell asleep   my partner encouraged us to leave because he was so bored  i read the book many years ago and it was very good  sorry to say we were very disappointed in dune part two
Mar 24 2024,positive,great adaptation of the book  doesnt follow all the story lines but captures the essence of the story  the characters are mostly spot on  timothee needs to develop more chutzpah towards the end but overall a good performance
Mar 24 2024,positive,really good although watching part one not required itll help part 2 seamlessly picks up where we left off
Mar 24 2024,positive,better than part 1 of dune dune 2 was very entertaining and didnt feel like a long movie  looking forward to the next dune 3
Mar 24 2024,positive,full of great special effects great movie
Mar 24 2024,positive,455 because while i think denis did a beautiful job on the visuals casting sound etc etc i mean come on its a scifi masterpiece but i just cant give it a perfect score cause the alterations while i understand why they were made  these are modern times i get it just leave a slight meh feeling for me personally
Mar 24 2024,positive,best film of all time
Mar 24 2024,positive,who reads these anyway
Mar 24 2024,positive,fantastic cinematography solid science fiction epic
Mar 24 2024,negative,i really disliked this movie dune2  it is only cgi and more cgi and way too much noise  frank herbert the author of the novels had created a real world  not my favorite book in my taste but at least it was real creativity you learned to care for the protagonists  this movie  dune 2 does not explain anything of what is at stake here and why  only zendaya stands out in what is otherwise a boring noisy and way too long movie
Mar 24 2024,positive,one of the best sequels ever made it improves on pretty much everything that was a bit rough with part one mainly the pacing is perfect it balances being slow with big payoffs of incredible action that is filled with massive scale and scope the special effects are excellent and even though the cgi is noticeable its always used in original and epic ways the camerawork is top notch and you always feel fully immersed in the world this looks and feels truly epic austin butler steals the show in the acting dept and thats saying a lot because everyone is giving a grade performances across the board here tim  zendaya are good together but the chemistry couldve been a bit better perhaps really the only slight issue is while editing is really good overall it feels chunky at times this has tons of ideas and goes very slow to fit it all and never feel bloated sometimes it can be a little hard to follow every particular plot point but the direction is so strong your able to get the general idea compared to the 84 one this improves so much its not even comparable the romance is perfectly interwoven explored developed and fleshed out and feels earned rather than hammed in it allows you to digest ideas much better and stellan as the villian is way better here and not cartooony like the other one the acting here balances being serious but never emotionless perfectly as well compared to lynchs everyone should give this a try once dune 1 can be a bit slow to get through but the payoff is worth it to watch this all time classic
Mar 24 2024,positive,stunning in imax wow lisan al gaib
Mar 24 2024,positive,watched twice loved each time excellent
Mar 24 2024,positive,there was a ton of action in part 2 felt like a stronger standalone movie than part 1 good plot
Mar 24 2024,positive,impeccably cast timothy zendaya florence and rebecca shine each bringing their characters to life with authenticity and depth the fight scenes are uniquely satisfying allowing each character to showcase their skills without feeling rushed a refreshing departure from typical movie tropes
Mar 24 2024,positive,nearly a perfect movie fantastic acting visually stunning gripping soundtrack great writing and dialogue the powerful soundtrack really carries this film     something to improve would be the pacing during the first quarter or so of the movie they couldve also focused more on the war scenes which felt rushed
Mar 24 2024,positive,its a great movie and also difficult to watch because its a war movie with violence dunes version of gore a high body count and complicated decision making by characters you may have come to love and respect
Mar 24 2024,positive,pure perfection    cant wait for dune part 3 holy war or whatever the title may be    li san al ghaib  as it is written
Mar 24 2024,positive,great movie full of suspense and certainly looking forward to part 3
Mar 24 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic there were no slow moments of the movie and it definitely worth rewatching the first before the second started reading the books after watching the second one
Mar 24 2024,positive,1010 visual masterpiece and epic storylineincredible soundtrack 
Mar 24 2024,positive,amazing story and visuals
Mar 24 2024,positive,outstanding better than the first
Mar 24 2024,positive,acting incredable shot with a sence of realism an epic movie made to watch in theaters the sound design made you feel everything
Mar 24 2024,positive,i liked the movie but i also think there are quite a few issues i also believe the original story is so complex that the fans are thrilled anyone made it into a decent movie maybe also the fact someone finaly brought back some seriousness into big budget scifi khm marvel casting is poorly done the main characters simply cant pull it off on the other hand the giants of acting that stand besides them havent been given enough to work with first thing that comes to mind is edward furlong in t2 that kid that young and inexperienced pulled off way harder task than timothy theres simply not enough oomph to him zendaya was just a vehicle and a pretty face to drive to the final plot twist rather than a desert warrior on a distant savage planet i give it a decent rating as i hope it will become a beacon of light to lead the hollywood future i believe lots of critics do it for the same reason
Mar 24 2024,positive,front end was a bit slow not sure about christopher walken being cast when he did all those comedies second half was pretty good
Mar 24 2024,positive,the movie was well written and acted but a bit underwhelming since there isnt any significant conclusions to this part of the story of course the 2nd book was the same so there isnt really any other way to make the movie just be warned that this part of the story is essential to how the main character becomes the leader he is prophesied to be but it develops slowly
Mar 24 2024,positive,is it called dune or dude  epic movie amazing acting
Mar 24 2024,negative,while i generally enjoyed the first movie and certainly enjoyed the book the second one was frankly pretty boring not certain id even attempt to watch any future ones after sleeping through this one
Mar 24 2024,positive,great movie awesome soundtrack
Mar 24 2024,positive,a very wellexecuted remake that made an old cornerstone of science fiction appear novel and fresh

Mar 24 2024,positive,great unexpectedl surprises now for part 3
Mar 24 2024,positive,great cinematography and action super high quality acting and pushed the story forward at a perfect pace just an amazing part 2
Mar 24 2024,positive,amazing way better that the first one hans zimmer score is amazing sound design is godly made sounds in cinema were amazing i got goosebumps every time song came on weapon sounds are great rocket launchers were my favorite
Mar 24 2024,positive,love the books and movies and part 2 is indeed an epic but why such a focus on chani its the story of paul not his concubine that last scene focussing on her looking angry as the movie closes left me empty and bewildered compare it to the triumphant final scene in david lynchs dune  now thats a climax
Mar 24 2024,positive,excellent movie really good special effects  cant wait for a part 3 hopefully
Mar 24 2024,positive,beautiful cinematography great acting i love dune and this did not disappoint
Mar 24 2024,positive,excellent film builds and improves on dune i continuing depth of characters great new characters intelligent dialogue excellent performances great sound track lots of quiet sections which really zoned you in on emotion in the scene and some really big worms  whats not to like 
Mar 24 2024,positive,it drags a little in the middle but pretty good overall it ends the same way the prequel did but in a more meaningful and more satisfying way
Mar 24 2024,positive,one of the best experiences in an imax theater  a monumental achievement in film making best sequel ever made
Mar 24 2024,positive,it should have been longer  honestly i am going to have to see it another couple times
Mar 23 2024,positive,awesome easily one of the best sequel movies that i ever seen every minute catchs your attention
Mar 23 2024,neutral,great special effects and twists and turns in plot  but drags on and on  and now a part 3  almost fell asleep  lots of sand storms and too long
Mar 23 2024,positive,was expecting something like dune 1 but this movie blew my expectations out the water
Mar 23 2024,positive,this is how you make a movie     no swearing no unnecessary gore no sex no nudity
Mar 23 2024,positive,the ending it was a cliffhanger and we anticipate it taking around 3 years before the next part comes out
Mar 23 2024,negative,i think the ending is horrible paul suvks and shouldve ended with jonie very bad i dont like this ending pls make aa dune 3 i will vote higher
Mar 23 2024,positive,ninety percent of the scenes were too dark  otherwise it was ok
Mar 23 2024,positive,it took a while to build but once it started rolling it was on cant wait for 3
Mar 23 2024,positive,absolutely amazing  loved the wacky 80s movie  but a bit ahead of its time  loved the remake of part 1  was concerned the wife would t have the same feelings  she walked out after watching part 2 askingwhen can we watch this again  amazing
Mar 23 2024,positive,story line was great characters well developed cinematography excellent
Mar 23 2024,positive,great special effects but easy to get lost in the story acting very average
Mar 23 2024,positive,great plot love the action and the little romantic scenes the plot twist was the best omg overall amazing movie must see
Mar 23 2024,positive,so great to see in the theater  there had better be a dune 3
Mar 23 2024,positive,how do you describe a movie of absolute class this movie keeps you engaged captivated surrounded by understanding of what movies are meant to be like this movie will make you feel different when you leave the cinema as i think ive witness one of the greatest cinematic experiences of all time definitely watch a movie theatre
Mar 23 2024,negative,same things over and over people walking tense victorious music fighting and back again it is heavily inspired by muslim middle east culture and i dont know why the movie does not explain why it is the same thing as part i waste of time would not watch any of that series again
Mar 23 2024,negative,imax video crashed half way thru  was told to go to my app and get refund pls advise
Mar 23 2024,neutral,boring  monotone acting cliched 
Mar 23 2024,positive,amazing movie second time watching it but i loved the 70mm imax screen dallas cinemark offers
Mar 23 2024,negative,inconsistent boring constant fighting
Mar 23 2024,neutral,it seemed to be mostly a repeat of the first dune movie   the special effects and such were good but all in all it felt like the same movie i saw when version 1 came out  there were also a total of 4 people in the theater when i went on 322  people vote with their feet  and s
Mar 23 2024,positive,its grandiose sure but it all feels a bit forced que worms que random battles and prophecies and grand speeches it doesnt really ad up to much
Mar 23 2024,positive,my best imax experience ever the directing is also masterful
Mar 23 2024,positive,a great movie to see at the theater this gigantic visual spectacle features some characters you know from the first film and some interesting new ones including christopher walken it is visually stunning dark complex and draws from great cinema and deep historical references of the past of human history we saw it in imax which is well worth it this film is definitely want to see in the theater and you should not wait to watch on a television you will only get about half the effect on a tv screen that said the film was a bit long and despite a few slow moments it kept us fully engaged and felt and thrallingly real despite its otherworldly characters and planets truly an inspiring piece of cinema the captures both the human spirit the conflict of humanity the flaws of emotion and the goodness of the human spirit great cinema 
Mar 23 2024,neutral,while the cinematography was grand the movie felt long and drawn out the score did absolutely nothing to help also the story did not follow the book enough especially in terms of character interactions and the timeline i have no plans to see this again
Mar 23 2024,positive,dune part two delivers stunning visuals and action continuing paul atreides journey on arrakis its a lengthy film with a rather complex plot so be prepared to invest some time if you enjoyed the first movies scifi world this sequel offers a return to that epic adventure
Mar 23 2024,negative,too long for the content make sure you are not tired when you go see it
Mar 23 2024,positive,spectacular tbh the first movie did not impress me much but this dune 2 is truly magnificent all the setting from the first movie led to a satisfiying and cathartic resolution the combination of incredible scenotography music and story makes this movie a must watch all hail space jesus
Mar 23 2024,positive,this movie made me do a complete 180 on how i felt about dune one of those films that you must see in imax if possible everyone brings it an otherworldly experience
Mar 23 2024,positive,its rare when a sequel exceeds the prequel in such a magnificent way i loved dune part one but i loved dune part two even more this is a must see movie even if you havent seen dune part one you will still love dune part two there is nonstop action there is romance intrigue and plenty if surprises twist and turns bring on dune part three
Mar 23 2024,negative,this movie was the most boring movie i ever seen in my life i belive bucky larson born to be a star has more action than this   if you wanna watch it make sure you bring a blanket and a pillow as you will be sleeping for 3 hours the movie didnt make sense it would go from one end to the other started telling one story and the next 20 minutes interrupt the story with another story then going back to the story it was initially describing  the end was super mega lame
Mar 23 2024,positive,this is the very definition of cinema muah chefs kiss 
Mar 23 2024,positive,after watching dune i said i wouldnt watch any other movie again until part three comes out its been two weeks still havent watched anything this movie changed me
Mar 23 2024,positive,not only a great spectacle the characters and story really come together in the second part of dune great filmmaking
Mar 23 2024,positive,true to the book this visually stunning epic captures frank herberts universe perfectly cant wait for the future films especially with villanueve at the helm
Mar 23 2024,positive,this whole movie is a feast for the eyes a scifi masterpiece
Mar 23 2024,negative,though the scenery is amazing the movie is made of up of endless sequences of stupid dialogues and excessive dopeinduced violence set in the desert lasting for almost 3 hours the topic of spice has not been developed the battles are unrealistic how come the harkonnens enjoying total air superiority destroyed a well trained army of the house of atreides in part one only to be decimated by a bunch of swordarmored wormriding fremens in part two a better title would be dune 2 the gangs of marrakkesh finally the babyfaced paul atreides was not convincing at all
Mar 23 2024,positive,superbly filed great story great movie
Mar 23 2024,positive,amazing waiting for next movie
Mar 23 2024,positive,nearly perfection denis villeneuve delivers an epic and stunning cinematography lesson the cast is wonderful i just love javier bardem and rebecca ferguson tbh the 2 main characters  timothee  zendaya seem a little fragiledelicate for this story other than that everything is top notch
Mar 23 2024,positive,the grandiose settings and superb audiovisual experience are undeniable in this film however the sluggish pacing abrupt character transitions and poor performances from the actors make it difficult to give it a high rating while it surpasses its predecessor in some aspects it still falls short of greatness
Mar 23 2024,negative,poor adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece dennis should have more respect for the author
Mar 23 2024,positive,honestly confused by the negative reviews you would have to watch this with ear plugs in and your eyes glued shut in order to not enjoy this masterpiece to the guy who said david lynchs dune was better you are out of your mind 65 could not recommend it more watch both backtoback for 5 hours of cinematic ecstasy
Mar 23 2024,positive,i had high expectations going into dune part two but whatever they were this film completely blew them out of the water this film looks just as good if not better than the 2021 original and this films writing and direction is just so much better than the previous film that isnt a knock on the previous film though as i thought they did a great job in the same departments there but in this film it was just so good that id be lying if i said they were equal i even had to go back and change my score for the previous dune film after watching this one as this was so much better in almost every conceivable way this film truly used its 166 minute runtime to the fullest as there wasnt a single scene in this film that i didnt find necessary or compelling which left this film feeling a lot shorter than it really is hans zimmers score also elevates this film to new heights as it fits so well with the film but i think its a captivating score to listen to even outside of watching the movie with all of its amazing landscapes and beautiful effects this film begs to be watched in a theatre this film also does greatly at expanding the world and characters of dune by adding depth and introducing new elements which makes it all the more interesting to watch paul has such a great arc and a ton of character growth throughout this film overall dune part two is a fantastic followup to the 2021 film and is easily the best new film ive seen this year so far and realistically it may not be topped though we we are still early into the year so anything could happen go see this on the big screen you will not regret it
Mar 23 2024,negative,cant believe there are so many good reviews the movie is a mess the story is piece by piece if you only like the good scifi scene this is for you otherwise such a waste of time to watch this boring and long movie
Mar 23 2024,positive,the scoring of the film was flawless enjoyed the attention according to the book
Mar 23 2024,positive,best fucking movie ever
Mar 23 2024,positive,so good theres not a single wasted moment in this movie every scene has a purpose perfect pacing it flies by
Mar 23 2024,positive,dune 2 is a masterpiece that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible in your area  a truly generational movie that will live on in infamy
Mar 23 2024,negative,they absolutely butchered the plot i dont plan to see any third movie
Mar 23 2024,positive,denis has raised the scifi movie making bar beyond the reach of many
Mar 23 2024,positive,excellent movie it makes you want to even see more 
Mar 23 2024,negative,plot goes completely against the source material why can hollywood never just stick to the book if you want to write your own story make your own movie dont ruin someone elses work
Mar 23 2024,positive,it is beautifully shot far too loud for no real reason except to entice emotion the writing could not  no character development for the heroes and especially not the antagonists no touching on herberts philosophy in any meaningful way lots of slow motion esoteric future foreshadowing scenes that explain very little but make run time as long as it is seemed rushed when explanation was needed and dragged when the point was more than clear not sure why everyone is saying it is so good another shining example that idiocracy is a documentary
Mar 23 2024,positive,absolutely amazing  i liked the first dune a great deal but the second installment is a masterpiece  the special effects and soundtrack were breathtaking and the villeneuve has really brought frank herberts vision to life  the cinematography is second to none and i cant wait for the third one to come out  there are so many great scenes to discuss but it cant be done without spoilers so do yourself a favor and go see this one in theaters for yourself
Mar 23 2024,negative,not anywhere near as good as the first movie  way too long with long stretches of the movie where nothing is really happening  movie builds up to the end battle which is way too short leaving you with the thats it feeling
Mar 23 2024,positive,oh my god literally a cinematic masterpiece
Mar 23 2024,positive,excellent i couldve kept watching for 2 more hours and it wouldve still had me captivated the storyline the cinematography the acting the dramatic  soundtrack all of it pulled me in and kept me in
Mar 23 2024,positive,this may very well go down as one of the great cinematic epics of our current generation
Mar 23 2024,negative,well done but pretty boring maybe you had to have read the book
Mar 23 2024,positive,it had an amazing feel a little light on character development but it had an awe inspiring feel to it
Mar 23 2024,positive,awesome cinematography and story line
Mar 23 2024,positive,probably the best movie i have ever seen  exceeds the original star wars and lord of the ring  a true masterpiece
Mar 23 2024,positive,sci fi fans rejoice  movies got it all 110 satisfied
Mar 23 2024,positive,i loved the movie the only part i dident like that at the end the guy chooses that queen girl over zendaya in the movie 
Mar 23 2024,positive,the best scifi movie ever its awesome how denis v managed to show the story of paul atreides as one of love sacrifice and tragedy i watched on imax and the experience is out this world i cried with the ending its amazing how the director shows us how paul went from an unsure teenager to a fearless leader
Mar 23 2024,positive,best movie of the year
Mar 22 2024,positive,my mind my eyes and my whole body have all lost every bit of sense they had in order to make me comprehend what i experienced just magnificent
Mar 22 2024,positive,i have not read the books nor did i see the original movies of dune  i did see dune 1 and i am going to disagree with most people here  i thought the acting was good but the story had more evil in it than i thought it would  the mother creeped me out and i didnt like the dark turn in this sequel  nothing against the acting i just didnt like the dark edge to it and also it skipped around too much as in not explaining all the time in the desert i will probably not go see dune 3
Mar 22 2024,positive,really good second part to a sagazendaya is a force all her own
Mar 22 2024,positive,absolutely outstanding  cinematography score acting all tremendous must see
Mar 22 2024,positive,superior  cant wait for dune 3
Mar 22 2024,positive,55 100 absolutely no notes saw it in dolby cinema with the vibrating seats best movie experience of my life most fun ive had since avengers infinity war or dark knight with heath ledger youre doing yourself a disservice if you dont go watch and if you have critiques you should find another hobby
Mar 22 2024,positive,cast special effects and story were great
Mar 22 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece so good everyone should see it just amazing work incredible cinematography and music impeccable directing such a good job from the cast perfect film
Mar 22 2024,positive,truly one of my favorite movies of the past few years this movie hit me on a level i didnt think was possible anymore
Mar 22 2024,positive,quite possibly the greatest scifi movie ever made nearly every frame is a work of art  great move i highly recommend
Mar 22 2024,positive,one of the best movie experiences of all time
Mar 22 2024,negative,they ditched subtle characters of part 1 in favor of onenote caricatures rebecca is no longer the conflicted motherbenegeserritwife with complex relationships with paul and others instead reduced to a series of plotmoving villainous actions stilgar no longer a complex competent leader think of the way he handled meeting paul and jessica but a literal joke chani is just a bad character compared to how she was in part 1 and certainly the book the character has nothing to do besides scowl and walk away from things has vague psychologically implausible goals and has absolutely no chemistry with paul and that all comes from the direction and screenplay i dont think zendaya is to blame and beyond character writing its just not as thrilling or involving as the psychologically motivated direction of part 1 that movie was like a trance a strange masterpiece and the action had real danger and implications for the characters and you felt that part 2 is just a lot of lifeless action bluster halfhearted humor and simplistic dialogue scenes
Mar 22 2024,positive,this movie brought magic to going to the theatre again an absolute joy to watch id pay money to watch it 5 times on the big screen 
Mar 22 2024,positive,beautiful enigmatic fastuous a cinematic experience made for the big screen
Mar 22 2024,positive,such a great adaptation of my favourite book definitely didnt disappoint visually spectacular the screen direction is impeccable the storyline was true to the book  was a great adaptation being able to appeal to the fans  not leave those new to the dune universe behind   its rare that im not looking at my watch in a 3 hour movie but this had me fully entertained  engaged from start to finish
Mar 22 2024,positive,i literally made an account so i could rate this movie i think about this movie daily  its my roman empire
Mar 22 2024,positive,dune part 2 delivers an impressive cinematic experience skillfully blending stunning effects with a captivating storyline its a movie that undoubtedly warrants multiple viewings what sets it apart is its faithful adaptation of the source material in stark contrast to earlier versions however while part 1 remained loyal to the book part 2 takes some liberties with the original storyline introducing significant changes to both plot and character arcs some elements like the iconic weirding ways and pauls sister are notably absent or altered which may disappoint avid fans     for those unfamiliar with the source material understanding pauls decisions may prove challenging as the movie doesnt delve deeply into his visions it would have been beneficial to explore this aspect further to provide better context reading the book beforehand enhances the viewing experience offering deeper insights into the characters and their motivations    excitement brews as the movie hints at future installments although it remains to be seen how they will fare while following the second book might not resonate as strongly with audiences the prospect of a continuation is intriguing it will be fascinating to observe the direction the series takes
Mar 22 2024,positive,i think its a slight dip from the first movie mostly due to its script but still very good beautifully shot with some excellent acting particularly led by javier and rebecca  another movie made for adult fans of science fiction which is a victory for movie lovers and fans of the genre and is becoming deniss legacy     it does feel like the problems of adapting this difficult source material are starting to compound and the same feeling from the first movie of the story feeling incomplete stings more with this one after five hours of storytelling its strange to still feel like the story is still only starting
Mar 22 2024,neutral,it could have been way better the last half of the movie is very rushed the final fight happened offscreen
Mar 22 2024,positive,the film is good but i expected more from this film the scenery sometimes makes jumps that are not explained clearly   if we consider for example the lord of the rings part 3 between one scene and the other clearly show where it is happening while it is not easy to understand the new scene immediately in this film so this is why i put 3 stars
Mar 22 2024,negative,a watered down version of david lynchs masterpiece
Mar 22 2024,positive,visually stunning the sound was great  it was long but never boring  mostly true to the books  i was entertained
Mar 22 2024,positive,total blast i found it very entertaining  i enjoyed watching the 1st movie then coming to the theater and seeing part 2  the purists of the novel will find the flaws they want but overall it was a fun experience
Mar 22 2024,positive,how ever you felt about the 1st dune movie is probably going to be how you feel about dune2 i loved dune and thought dune 2 was almost but not quite as excellent as the firat one
Mar 22 2024,positive,this was a movie weve been needing for a while     dune part two knew the success of the first film and continued the story with the same cinematic and worldbuilding prowess as its predecessor the visuals again were fantastic and i felt encapsulated throughout the movie the use of sound and lack there of created gripping sequences which left me in awe and wanting more throughout     we knew what was coming in regard to the story with dune part one regularly dropping visions of the future throughout the movie however a few twists and surprises still found their way into the film which was much needed pauls transformation into the lisan al gaib was incredible to watch and his arc from the start of the first movie was extensive a special mention goes to austin butler as feydrautha his performance was exceptional and he embodied the madness and desire of the harkonnen brilliantly i also enjoyed the mixture of serious and light conversation throughout the serious conversation drove the story forward with meaningful dialogue and the light conversation made the characters relatable     however i will say that the film was maybe slightly too long a few sequences could have been cut down and some skipped altogether focussing on the core story i also felt the emperor could have been utilised more in the film but maybe thatll be for the next film these downsides should not put you off though    all in all this film was embodied the definition of a blockbuster and i advise you see it wherever you can
Mar 22 2024,positive,a trully epic scifi experience that has supreme visiuals great action scenes and a brilliant soundtrack  one of the best sequels ever made a must watch for dune and scifi fans
Mar 22 2024,positive,currently the best film of 2024
Mar 22 2024,positive,i saw this in 70mm imax its a proper old school spectacle movie    the art design cinematography and soundsoundtrack just might be the best ever  overall its a masterpiece     i could have done with another ten mins or so spent a bit more time on some charactersplotlines had a little more time to watch some things unfold etc not exactly a terrible problem to have people needing more     i very much hope this gets a third part
Mar 22 2024,negative,tenet was easier to follow
Mar 22 2024,positive,i am perplex with how incredible this is
Mar 22 2024,negative,it fucking sucks  3 hours of boringnessd half of the people just slept in cinema  nothing really emotional everything pretty forced it just sucks  high budget trash film  do yourself a favour and avoid it
Mar 22 2024,positive,a masterpiece visually stunning great cast this adaptation stays true to the original frank herbert novel and given he wrote six books in this series hopefully there are many more dune films to come
Mar 22 2024,positive,absolutely stunning movie both visually and in terms of its plot really setting the standard for the movies to come    i definitely recommend watching this whenever you can
Mar 22 2024,negative,bizarre long and drawn out movie about sums it up in a sentence music and background movie so loud hard to hear certain parts of actors speaking abrupt and disappointing ending sets stage for an automatic part 3 to the movie first movie was much better script this one just screams sequel
Mar 22 2024,positive,truly wonderful film such amazing ensemble work so many good actors the battle scenes were marvellous the music was outstanding it just slipped by and i was so into the film i was shocked when it ended villeneuve and nolan lead the way as stunning directors
Mar 22 2024,positive,great movie i loved it enjoyed it with my son
Mar 22 2024,positive,this is a epic masterpiece of a movie its 2am how am i supposed to go to sleep after seeing this scale of this movie  the score acting the look and feel it puts you right into that movie austin butler played such a awesome character the sandworms  this might be the best movie i seen in ten years and maybe my favorite movie of all time i dont see any movie this year knocking it out of my 1 spot all year 1010 epic fantastic movie i seen it 4 times
Mar 22 2024,positive,i am someone that was not a huge fan of the first dune but loved the world that it set up this movie is great because it has payoff to a lot of the things the first movie set up the length didnt bother me the action was great
Mar 22 2024,positive,this movie was made for theaters would definitely recommend it to any sci fi movie fan
Mar 22 2024,positive,excellent film especially the visuals and sound
Mar 22 2024,positive,i found part 2 way more interesting than part 1 i had zero familiarity with dune so with the first one i felt lost with this sequel i got a quick prep on the world and main figures of the plot i thought it was engaging and it left me wanting to see what happens next
Mar 22 2024,positive,anyone who hasnt seen dune part 2 needs to go asap though it may be a little long at just under 3 hours it flows really well and doesnt feel like it it starts where the first movie left off so if you havent seen the first one i highly recommend you do that first its available on max
Mar 22 2024,positive,love the movie great acting and story plot you dont even have to watch the 1 dune to understand
Mar 22 2024,positive,pace was better than part 1   feydrautha character was under developed  the cgi of the troop assemblies and stadium scenes was cartoonish  i thought the industry had progressed beyond that  also having feydrautha battle in the stadium with poor cgi detracted from the development of his character  so much more could have been done to show the relationship between paul and feydrautha  although the villian in this movie had a sense of honor and respect for paul  expected more development  i am going to reread the book but i thought he had children with chani  so ill hold my thoughts about her going off by herself  in the dune book wives and concubines were an accepted practice  i did like the down playing of pauls sisters role  finally the importance of spice to the guild was not adequately explained nor was pauls relationship to him and his abilities   spice came off as just a drug  i enjoyed the dune books  i enjoyed the 1984 dune movie  i enjoyed this movie but felt especially with its length that it could have been so much better  if anyone failed it was the director cgi company and the producer that accepted it  it was not the actors who failed
Mar 22 2024,positive,incredibly well done thoroughly enjoyed
Mar 22 2024,positive,good acting good story generally a well done movie
Mar 22 2024,positive,great sequel  leaves you wanting another please
Mar 22 2024,positive,absolutely amazing already seen it twice going back again next week
Mar 22 2024,positive,this movie is a beautiful spectacle to behold i feel so fortunate to live barely 20 miles from one of the few imax 70mm theaters in existence so seeing it in that format is a must for this film i had seen it twice previously on a standard screen and dune part 2 stands on its own on the strength of its story acting and soundmusicbut i truly got the most out of the experience in the format villeneuve intended it for everything has been extended perfectly and ratcheted up from the first dune and visually the seamless and believable nature of the visual effects yet again raises the bar for groundbreaking science fiction
Mar 22 2024,positive,great production of a fun allegorical sci fi classic which does not disappoint the almost three hours flies by and i cant wait for part 3
Mar 22 2024,positive,great vfx and world building a vast cinematic landscape of mystery and war that really feels like an actual living breathing universe really appreciated zendayas grounded performance as chani and the one who doesnt seem completely mystified by paul atreides and timothee chalamets performance in this one was quite engaging his paul ranges from cool and calm to violent and aggressive   the film is quite long but i could have stayed in the theatre for longer
Mar 22 2024,positive,this movie was so good i didnt even realize it was almost 3 hours the plot was crazy good it captivated my attention the entire time timothée chalamet was incredible i was shocked to see him as muaddib based on his previous roles safe to say hes got good range
Mar 21 2024,positive,this is one of the best scifi movies of all time ive never watched a movie like this at the cinema its another level of cinematic experience and not just because of the beautiful scenes and astounding soundsits because of the story the acting the incredible direction which gives the movie a near perfect rhythm so you never gets bored dune part two is one of the movies that you just need to see at the cinema because you will regret it if you dont
Mar 21 2024,positive,it was amazing  closer to the books than i expected and i read the series 40years ago as a teenagerwill be seeing again before it leaves the theatrevery immersive movie
Mar 21 2024,positive,the movie was fantastic the visuals were amazing and loved the cast part 2 definitely picks up the pace from part 1 make sure you do your homework and know all the characters and houses names because it can be confusing to follow if you dont know who is who
Mar 21 2024,positive,the music production world building and atmosphere is great it can be very loud i am glad i was in the back row of the theatre its a loud movie    i think it has a lot of what the mcu is missing actual music and atmosphere and humanity mcu feels so disney its not grounded in anyway    i think acting is good for two very young leads but the leads they could have had been 510 years older timonthee has the best scenes but they couldve been more if he had better range he had the best lines the best part everything to stand out     zendaya is good i feel like she does better than timonthee as well but i feel the same way she says tomontees character is sincere at one point but in no point in the movie or the dialogue or the acting do i really see it in that character he has a lot of ego and all this bravado i saw the character as a hyper masculine leader who is only doing something to get what he wants      i really felt like the veterans brought out a lot of the power of the film javier bardem saved me from getting bored of the dialogue he was best actor he had charisma nuance wisdom    its not really a faithful adaptation and i enjoyed the block buster they needed a tighter script and better writing to really make a adaptation true to the novels but it was not a deal braker for me
Mar 21 2024,positive,wow holy mother of all worms in the imax 70mm was out of control blast not only worth a second  third trip but do it in imax long live the fighters
Mar 21 2024,positive,this movie is just perfect i think last time i had an experience like this in the cinema was on lotr return of the king back when i was a kid
Mar 21 2024,negative,long and boring tried to cram too much in
Mar 21 2024,positive,well done  so many layers to this movie  did not disappoint and delivers enough to keep you intrigued about the next adventure
Mar 21 2024,positive,part two  cinematically beautiful and very well done
Mar 21 2024,positive,great movie superb actingengaging and increadible visuals to experience them on a  big screen was a joy will definetly rewatch it recommend it
Mar 21 2024,positive,awesome movie good storytelling and lots of action definitely recommend
Mar 21 2024,positive,dune 2 is operatic on the biggest scale you can imagine i didnt feel the duration at all beyond wanting a bathroom break everything in it is made with such immense and detailed care zimmers soundtrack alone is worth a 2nd viewing saw it on imax if youre into great scifi do yourself that favour to get the full blast of it dune 2 postulates some intellectualsocietal challenges but not as much as blade runner 1 2 got to for me anyway but just sitting there and watching the remarkable pictures acting and sound is worth it for me i think after digesting more it will rank in my top 5 scifi movies and that starts of with kubricks 2001 odyssey
Mar 21 2024,negative,disappointing weakshame i saw it
Mar 21 2024,positive,ive already seen it twice in the theatre if that tells you anything such a great movie
Mar 21 2024,positive,this is the best movie ive seen all my life everything is perfect i had goosebumbs every part of the movie and everytime i watched it you have to see it and you have to see it at imax timothee did such a great job with this role he proved what a good actor he is and that he can play any role he is given and deserves all praise he is jut that good also zandaya although her character is a bit altered from the book she was such a great supporting character and i loved her all throught the movie denis the director has all of my respect and after the first dune i was in love with his work dune part 2 flipped my world upside down after my first time watching the movie i was blank faced i think dune part 2 has set the bar so high that i will never find a movie as good as this in addition hans zimmer has once again proved that he is one of the greatest composers of all time thank for this masterpiece also congrats to all the actors because they did such a good job
Mar 21 2024,positive,made me so bricked it was longer than the sandworms
Mar 21 2024,positive,i saw this movie opening weekend and i have never been more touched walking out of a movie dune part 2 is everything cinema should be i love the story of religious oppression and misguided hope and faith im sure the few people reading this have all heard these things before but dune part 2 is amazing just amazing
Mar 21 2024,positive,honestly the best movie for 2024 really enjoyed i had a great time i didnt even realize it was that long because thats how much action there was i cant wait to see part three
Mar 21 2024,positive,it was great like the first one good movie good score
Mar 21 2024,positive,it is a clear example of why cinema should be seen on the big screen this film is a genuine spectacle for cinemas even though the film has a very varied rhythm it is still entertaining its good but not excellent
Mar 21 2024,positive,if you like scifi this is an absolute must see multiple times even never has a movie captivated my heart and mind so thoroughly you will be immersed in the sets and feel like youre part of the desert world of arrakis the acting is top notch and the action scenes are so well done its hard to believe you havent traveled in time and space most of my other favorite movies have parts that are skippable or kind of cringeythis has none of those every scene and dialogue exchange is enthralling and well executed   when a movie makes 3 hours feel like 30 minutes you know you have a masterpiece on your hands my favorite movie of all time im so excited for dune messiah
Mar 21 2024,positive,an awesome movie packed with action and emotion amazing acting from timothée chalamet and a superb display from austin butler
Mar 21 2024,positive,masterfully crafted an aweinspiring experience on all fronts that begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible this isnt your traditional big blockbuster film franchise and that is not a bad thing while the first entry in the series was very good this sequel brings the franchise to new and not often found heights
Mar 21 2024,positive,one of the best sequels i have ever seen everything in this dune part two is just almost perfectacting directing writing cgiall mixed seamlessly in this amazing masterpiece
Mar 21 2024,positive,reading the book is still on  my todo list but this was a great sequel to first part kept you on the edge of your seat and was easy to follow along with what was happening throughout the movie
Mar 21 2024,positive,dune 2 is a good example of a movie that would not work as a playand thats a problem take away the admittedly stunning visuals and the droning score that tells you hey feel something now and there are very few moments where plot or dialogue creates true suspense as a result i was never on the edge of my seat the plot is driven forward by explicit statements in prophecy or conversation like you havent had a nightmare like that in a while rather than making you as a viewer find it out for yourself as a viewer im thinking stop telling me how to feel and make me feel it this movie doesnt ask anything from you as a viewer hence its hard to resonate with three stars because javier bardem is great the fight scenes were solid and the worldbuilding is fun to look at like going to a contemporary art gallery
Mar 21 2024,positive,a very good adaptation of the original novel its much more compact fast paced and exciting compare to the first dune movie the only criticism is that the movie left out some important scenes and character development from thr original book especially for gurney and hawat resulting in a lot of the side characters being a bit one dimensional otherwise i have no complaints its a great movie both visually and storywise and also kudos to hans zimmer for such wonderful scores
Mar 21 2024,positive,it was not like the book but that is ok it was done very well and something id like to see more of
Mar 21 2024,positive,simply sensational it was truly a perfect movie with so many powerful scenes if you havent watched the first one do so and catch this in theatres i saw it in avx and had goosebumps 80 of the time
Mar 21 2024,positive,top notch filmmaking from dennis villeneuve action story special effects sound score you name it and its top quality all around well done
Mar 21 2024,positive,dune 2 is a good movie with an interesting storyline and the most beautiful landscapes in the end paul becomes what he has been afraid to become all his life
Mar 21 2024,positive,long and uneven tim and zen have zero chemistry walken and butler are poor casting choices  story jumps around
Mar 21 2024,positive,it is fabulous great special effects and the acting is superb enjoy on the big screen
Mar 21 2024,positive,best big budget scifi movie in a very long time im calling it now next year it wins an oscar for best visual effects hands down it would be very difficult for another movie to surpass the video effects in this sequel if you havent seen it in imax then i suggest you do because the visuals and audio is out of this world the bass from the theater speakers were so loud and impressive our seats literally shook every time the characters used the thumpers to call the worms no need for dbox or 4dx i watched in laser imax but now im thinking of going to a 70mm imax theater
Mar 21 2024,negative,the beautiful filming doesnt save the completely abysmal writingdisappointing the studio managed to destroy the entirety of what was an incredible start to reimagining one of the most beloved scifi novels ever written dune part i had some acceptable deviations from the original text that still communicated the spirit of the novel the virtues of part i were nowhere to be found here it felt like the writers were told the story verbally by an executive and told to make it an action film the studio managed to mischaracterized chani and paulchani is acted as a warrior and thereby robbing us of certain intricacies of fremen culture that observing her in the book provides the studio absolutely ignored pauls character in the book altogether and chose one aspect of him to harp on because they felt they would get more positive press they stretched a canvas of 1 dimensional boring character writing over a skeleton of a poorly executed action film story outline     the studio rewriting of a story that was beautiful intricate and beloved already was not only unnecessary but unskilled the pacing detail and beauty of the books was not anywhere in this film even without the knowledge of the book i would have seen this and left the theater wanting my money back i am embarrassed for the writers
Mar 21 2024,positive,magical and beautiful in all ways
Mar 21 2024,positive,great story seen the original many times during the year great new cast
Mar 21 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive watched in my life so many moments that took us to the tip of the sit such a great plot so much developed in so little screen time even if it is almost 3 hours long
Mar 21 2024,positive,the special effects were simply stunning and combined with the story creates an epic cinema could not recommend it enough and if you have the opportunity see it in imax for all of its legendary splendor
Mar 21 2024,positive,good up until the end
Mar 21 2024,positive,seems like just about every shot in the movie could be framed looked amazing in imax
Mar 21 2024,positive,glorious so many movies today are slathered in special effects but theres no substance under that wrapping dune 2 uses gorgeous cinematography and special effects to mold its epic tale and drag its audience into another world     dune is a classic for a reason and this telling does justice to its source setting the bar for what movies can now achieve and putting marvel and dc s recent schlock to abject shame
Mar 21 2024,positive,visually stunning split into two films with the second having a nearly three hour run time and yet it still felt rushed they changed too much of the story this version is hardy recognizable unless viewed as a stand alone film it is not the dune you are expecting to see
Mar 21 2024,positive,its truly epic in every sense of the word see it on the big screen
Mar 21 2024,positive,movie was absolutely amazing epic epic epic
Mar 21 2024,positive,i loved this film so much it was everything and more of what i was expecting timothées character acting did a full 360 the acting was spot on in every single scene
Mar 20 2024,positive,the single greatest cinematic experience of my life watch it at the bfi imax in london
Mar 20 2024,neutral,the character were developed much better in dune part one the ending was flat certainly disappointing i will not be recommending this movie
Mar 20 2024,positive,i got slow towards the end of the second act the whole religious thing starting to get a little tedious but the ending roaring back into blockbuster territory
Mar 20 2024,positive,buckle up  roller coaster of emotions  loved it
Mar 20 2024,positive,to answer certain questions we must wait until part 3
Mar 20 2024,positive,one of the few sequels where i wasnt even a little afraid of disappointment it continues in the same megalomania as the 1st part with the fact that the plot moves massively forward and opens up new possibilities for the next sequel for me its just a bit of a shame about the unused potential of stellan skarsgård who was nicely prepared in the 1st part where he acted as a quite threatening villain but austin butler on the other hand pleasantly surprised by how he actually acted as such a reflection of chalamet on the other side
Mar 20 2024,positive,movie was amazing there needs to be a part 3
Mar 20 2024,negative,i read the book i saw the original movieawesome then i see dune part 1 thought it decent then dune 2 the entire movie was dark the story was jumbled dune 2 pure garbage
Mar 20 2024,positive,great  characters soundtrack and visuals that transmitted emotion throughout the film bot that it was needed since the action was outstabding
Mar 20 2024,positive,a whirlwind adventure from start to finish absolutely gripping leaving you wanting more a must to see at the cinema to feel the full atmosphere of dune
Mar 20 2024,positive,perfect movie from start to finish
Mar 20 2024,positive,the best cinematographic work that my eyes have ever seen
Mar 20 2024,positive,the entire movie is fantastic see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 20 2024,positive,picks up well from the previous picture there were a few scenes i felt they could have expanded on but overall great pacing throughout the whole film once it had ended it was hard to believe i had sat through two hours which had felt much less and was comfortable for more cant wait to see the next film
Mar 20 2024,positive,liked it so much i saw it twice
Mar 20 2024,positive,absolutely magnificent even though i do not know the dune lore as well as others this film is truly a spectacle to behold in every creative aspect
Mar 20 2024,positive,greatest movie of all time dont walk to movies run run as fast as your legs possibly can and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience of your life
Mar 20 2024,positive,action packed and beautiful visually really expanded on the base that part one layed down austin butler was great but not enough of him in it overall a great experience and very fun
Mar 20 2024,positive,a true cinema experience possibly some minor imperfections but it would be nitpicking to give it anything but a 1010     denis villeneuve is probably my favourite film maker hes like chris nolan but without the pompous overintellectualized aftertaste
Mar 20 2024,positive,could have been shorter in length
Mar 20 2024,positive,action packed beautiful cinematography very involved story  a little confusing at times see in dolby for sure
Mar 20 2024,positive,an incredible film up there in the top ten of all sci fi films ever made
Mar 20 2024,positive,amazing movie the dialogue is outstanding the action scenes are epic and the acting from everyone is an a
Mar 20 2024,positive,this film is visually a masterpiece acting overall is top tier especially from the villains though i did not get the chemistry between paul chalamet and chani zendaya which was a let down it is definitely a film i need to see again to full comprehend the storyline also interesting and creative choices that deviate from the book that definitely make the film better love a great epic tragedy 
Mar 20 2024,neutral,the whole movie is about him proving hes the chosen one a lot of sensationalism and cool visuals but the story itself is lame
Mar 20 2024,positive,dune 2 is a cinematic masterpiece the movie differentiates itself from modern blockbusters with its slightly slower pace narrative speed which is cleverly used to build up characters and their motivations it managed to not bore the audience for a single second the finale of the movie is a visual treat full of actions and visual effects and the ending not only concluded dune one and two well but also opened up possibilities for a third film absolutely amazing
Mar 20 2024,negative,beautiful in images i found zero efort in acting javier bardem is the only actor in the entire movie zero chemistry between zendaya and chalamet
Mar 20 2024,negative,absolute garbage   no story barely any dialogue   left the movie early   dont waste your time   all movies in hollywood are garbage
Mar 20 2024,positive,best piece of sci fi  fantasy since lotr  got better than anything disney has produced lately worth the money to see it in imax
Mar 20 2024,positive,just saw it for the 3rd time today to get the most out of the dolby experience cinema history has been made with this movie if you havent seen it do yourself a favor and get on it
Mar 20 2024,positive,very well done good storyline liked the cinematography saw in imax and felt truly immersed
Mar 20 2024,positive,a feast for the eyes and a captivating story
Mar 20 2024,positive,movie lighting was very dark dialogs were not clear at times
Mar 20 2024,positive,excellent visual effects and screenplay
Mar 20 2024,positive,we liked the storyline and characters it was a bit too long and sound was overwhelming in the theater
Mar 20 2024,positive,great continuation of the story
Mar 20 2024,positive,this movie is absolute cinema you are doing yourself a disservice not seeing it every moment will keep you hooked and make you feel like you are in the work arrakis
Mar 20 2024,positive,a wonderful production of this story excellent visuals and sound in the imax cannot wait for messiah
Mar 20 2024,negative,only good if you havent read the book takes away any innuendo from hebert and instead delivers the message on a silver platter again fine if you dont care about reading the book but a true disservice to herbert and his world
Mar 20 2024,positive,amazing cast amazing cinematography amazing everything no dull moments for me
Mar 20 2024,positive,what star wars should be
Mar 20 2024,negative,in my humble opinion this movie was one of the worst viewing experiances of my life the first half had little plot progression and almost entirely was world building about how sandy the planet was and more so a recap of the previous movie the third fourth was paced well and had a good balance of plot progression and character devolpmentworldbuilding at this point the movie was more so boring at this point but not horrible however in the last fourth or so the writers crammed the entire take over of the empire into a relatively short period for all that was going on we went from paul being a messiah who could cause some trouble to the emperor in what felt like a matter of minutes we saw very little of the seige on the capital city and only saw paul and his armies enter the throne room and we are left to presume that he took over hte rest of the city in general the sotry and pacing felt wither painfully slow or rushed to an absurd degree there are some thing i loved about the movie however the cinematogrophy was gorgeous the visuals were incredible and the score was amazing in terms of the scifi genre this movie does make certain leaps for the genre but the dramatic flair and spectacle of it can not make up for the horrible pacing which made an otherwise great story feel horrible
Mar 20 2024,positive,what a beautiful masterpiece this film was i enjoyed every minute every character and every planet my only critique is that i feel like story jumped ahead slightly at some moments only slightly i found myself thinking how did we get here a couple of times
Mar 20 2024,positive,what a masterpiece the best movie in the last decade  well done i loved dune part 1 but part 2 is 100 times better is just a amazing movie it deserves all awards and so the cast
Mar 20 2024,positive,enjoyed this movie a lot
Mar 20 2024,positive,simply the best film of 2024 everything that was worked on and shaped by the first film in this everything was used spectacularly and with maximum quality the director showed all his ability to make incredible scenes that detail the transition from young paul atreides to muaddib the chosen one of the fremen impeccable direction script and soundtrack in addition to obviously maintaining and even surpassing the performance especially timothée chalamet
Mar 20 2024,positive,liked    too much sand    would recommend but watch in two sittings because it is very long
Mar 20 2024,positive,lifetimes of war for houses and thronesprophecyto save or enslavethe desert ride beware the misguideadaptdunes permanent wave
Mar 20 2024,positive,everything you want in a big screen epoch great acting great effects visual and sound its long 244 so plan for that
Mar 20 2024,positive,breathtaking and greatest movie ever made
Mar 20 2024,positive,i liked it all highly recommend
Mar 19 2024,positive,this film accomplishes so many have failed before it remained beyond truthful to the original book series but it was adopted to give equal opportunities to all main characters to me it is the best movie of all time both because of its history and its filmmaking
Mar 19 2024,positive,not only one of the best films ive seen in recent years but on of the best sequels cannot wait to see part 3 the cast and crew did an amazing job a remake that everyone should watch 1010
Mar 19 2024,negative,the imax theater played the awful sound so loud that the whole movie was ruined that weird multifrequency horn sound is possibly meant to convey that heavy machinery and craft are moving in these futuristic structures with a strong overtone of dread well i felt dread for most of the movie and cringed every time it started again after the infrequent and short pauses the day before i streamed the first dune in this series to prepare and it was so much more intriguing of a story and i cared about what happened to the characters there was more uplifting behavior mixed in with the villains depravity while in this one the villains were really bad and there was very little to balance that even the good guys actions were conflicted and unsatisfying its been so long since i read the book so i dont know how accurate it is but any story needs some positive things to happen besides one side killing more than the other side    whoever decided to fill the movie with that awful loud sound should have to listen to it randomly for a few hours every week over the next year maybe they would get the message that it was way too much can you tell im pissed about it
Mar 19 2024,positive,im part of the minority who loved this more than the first and i really loved the first looking forward to part 3 in the far future
Mar 19 2024,positive,optics were amazing they finally fixed the issue with the sound for the music which made it more enjoyable really hope they make dune messiah
Mar 19 2024,positive,this movie is peak cinema you will leave the theater with your mind blown and having watched the best movie of our generation watching this movie is like crack id imagine
Mar 19 2024,positive,great visuals pretty chopped up and hard to follow if you didnt read the novel i liked  the original movie from 1984 much better than these two latest epic mystically confusing forays into filmmaking
Mar 19 2024,positive,fantastic i decided to read the novel after i learned that director denis villeneuve was taking the helm on the dune remake having never watched the big screen 1984 release hes my favorite director and he stayed true to the book mr villeneuve spares no effort in bringing to life author frank herberts imagination and vision along with his own original touches stunning
Mar 19 2024,positive,lots of actionwell acted heroes and villains at its best 
Mar 19 2024,positive,absolutely epic best theatrical experience in a long time must be seen on the big screen
Mar 19 2024,positive,great special effects good actors and acting  the movie kept moving well  no boring parts
Mar 19 2024,positive,the only way to see this movie is in imax format  the sound and cinematography are incredible ive seen it twice and am going back one more time before it leaves the big screen i really hope the theaters bring this back in a few years to show it in imax once again ill watch it at home eventually but i know it wont be close to being the same experience
Mar 19 2024,positive,spectacular and heavily improves upon the first film on every front
Mar 19 2024,positive,fantastic story telling special effects and acting  true to most of the source material  another movie needed to deal with the second book
Mar 19 2024,positive,wonderful  im just a speechless i got so goosebumps and tears from it there were too much tension and excitement one of the best movies ive ever seen bravo
Mar 19 2024,neutral,over saturated with plot points and major pacing issues

Mar 19 2024,positive,was just as action pack as part 1
Mar 19 2024,negative,its a beautiful movie the special effects are amazing but it is painfully slow
Mar 19 2024,positive,very good sequel to the first dune movie  acting was very good and the movie provided more detail than the prior dune movie acting was very good with a lot of interesting turns and twists  highly recommend
Mar 19 2024,positive,not a dune fan never read the book rated dune 3 saw this last night in imax worth it id go see it again in the theatre if you see one movie in a theatre this year it should be this one great job by all
Mar 19 2024,positive,amazing ride and especially riveting first 23 of the movie some flawed direction in the last part but the overall experience did not disappoint highly recommended for all audiences whether they read the books or not
Mar 19 2024,positive,this is one of the best movies of all time its cinematography was breathtaking the sets and cgi were so lifelike that there werent any points where you could obviously tell what was practical and what was cgi the score was dramatic and helped capture the emotion of the movie and its characters the captivating plot is brought to life by the incredible acting of timothee chalament zendaya and the rest of the starstudded cast even those who arent fans of the science fiction drama will find something to enjoy about this movie this is the type of movie that will be cemented in pop culture for a long time
Mar 19 2024,positive,this is why i love cinema  the movie has everything to give it a 5 star i already went twice to the cinema and i will probably go a third time its just mesmerising 
Mar 19 2024,positive,have not seen such an epic and cinematic movie in a long time  even though i didnt see the first movie i was sucked into the world and the characters from the first minute  this is perfection
Mar 19 2024,positive,together with part 1 villeneuves dune is a scifi masterpiece one for the ages and personally became my favorite film of all time just topping the original blade runner
Mar 19 2024,positive,beautiful movie to watch and should earn awards for their cinematography and special effects but overall it was just an okay movie nothing bad but nothing really great
Mar 19 2024,positive,loved the movie enjoyed the content the story line the action and definitely the twist was really cool on the big screen definitely going to pay to see it again
Mar 19 2024,positive,great story telling amazing cast cannot wait for dune 3
Mar 19 2024,positive,i dont know how it could have been any better
Mar 19 2024,positive,the empire strikes back of the decade scifi has made a comeback in an epic way
Mar 19 2024,positive,epic very true to herberts criticism of the chosen one narrative
Mar 19 2024,positive,its thrilling but  theplotfeelsrushed
Mar 19 2024,positive,i was expecting less from this movie but it blew me away great characters cinematography and a carefully structured plot just a masterpiece
Mar 19 2024,positive,denis villeneuve makes another masterpiece
Mar 19 2024,positive,fantastic beautiful sonically astounding this movie is what the cinema experience is about loved it
Mar 19 2024,positive,favorite movie i have ever seen i have been to the theatre four times already hehe
Mar 19 2024,positive,the most wonderful thing about it is that it is a great attempt to bring to life the very phenomenon that we are always struggling to describe which cannot be put into words through visuals and sound    this work is all about letting the audience experience phenomena such as religious devotion precepts and karma
Mar 19 2024,positive,epic movie i start two days ago reading the fist book hoping to fish all books before release the part three
Mar 19 2024,positive,great visuals but it felt rushed compared to part 1 i wish we learnt more about paul becoming part of fremen community and why emperor and other houses flew to arrakis even the batte scenes where sardukars and harkonnens got wiped out by fremen fighters felt underwhelming as they were such a strong force in the previous movie
Mar 19 2024,positive,this movie is so good i love it
Mar 19 2024,positive,dune 1 was a fantastic setup and this movie hit it out of the park honestly this was one of the most immersive and enjoyable movies ive seen in a very long time cannot recommend it enough
Mar 19 2024,positive,its like a futuristic version of troy  absolutely stunning
Mar 19 2024,positive,story pacing is much approved over part 1 and part 2 does its job of wanting me to see a part 3
Mar 19 2024,positive,this might be one of the best movies ive ever seen
Mar 19 2024,positive,good movie long but the climax is worth it
Mar 19 2024,positive,almost too big to comprehend
Mar 19 2024,negative,if you love movie magic then this is for you the kind of magic that makes no sense a plot that skips all over the place characters that magically live under the sand and popup well  like magic the story itself was lame and made no sense even the worms shown were ridiculous worms move in a serpentine manner these worms moved in a straight line i guess on wheels funny they used balloons to lift the harvesters incredible technology but there were no cars to be seen but somehow they build massive palaces at least the lynch version had characters that were intriguing and explained their treachery now they are single thread mtv characters but since there arent any other movies this big so i guess this looks special it was agonizing but javier bardem was special to watch
Mar 19 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen  1110 if they do not make a third of this i will be very sad
Mar 19 2024,positive,wow after a disappointing first film this ones a cracker visually amazing well acted and loyal to the original plot just enough youre not let down while adding a unique touch must faster paced than the first film  we watch our hero starting to believe in himself become a man cant wait to see if there is s follow up film
Mar 19 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie but it wasnt this mind blowing event that some movie goers said it was i went in thinking there was going to be a part 3 but two hours into it i realized this was it unless it gets a continuation after what happens on dune
Mar 19 2024,negative,part 1 was far the better than part 2 dune is a classic the books are fantastic  but part 2 dune is just noise pollution lacking in any rhythm or sustenance 
Mar 19 2024,positive,it was an epic story  lots of action and incredible visuals  great acting  better than the first  just very long  lol
Mar 19 2024,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece from the genius screenwriting to the amazing soundtrack everything blew me away the actors did an amazing job at making the world feel alive and real it really made me feel like i was inside the dune universe i am truly gratefull to live in a time and age where i can see this masterpiece of cinema on the big screens definitly a must see
Mar 19 2024,positive,excellent the score is jawdroppingly amazing they made some changes to the book that made it flow much better though view in imax cause wow
Mar 19 2024,positive,movie was a little long but there was enough action to keep my interest of course the story is not over and there will be at least one more sequel to follow
Mar 19 2024,positive,fantastic every dune fan should go to this excellent continuation of the story
Mar 18 2024,positive,visuallstunninggoodactingshouldwinoscar
Mar 18 2024,positive,i hope to see other film like this soon wait 34 year every time is too much time for me beleve me see that film on imax cinema if you can more than one time if you can
Mar 18 2024,negative,part one was good but part 2 was utterly boring the old first version from the 80s is far superior to this one
Mar 18 2024,positive,a beautiful and epic scifi movie better than part one hans zimmers music storyline is interesting and there are multiple good characters    its a long movie but it feels like shorter than two hours long
Mar 18 2024,positive,villanueve has filmed the unfilmable and done it well he didnt try to replicate the book too closely with its omniscient viewpoint letting you peer into everyones heads as in the lynch version he made changes that worked well making it clearer that pauls journey is not really as heroic as it might seem on the surface something herbert wished had been clearer in the book i am excited to see him continue the story i hope he gets the chance
Mar 18 2024,positive,the most impressive movie i have ever seen
Mar 18 2024,positive,i liked the action and the plot put a period to dune 1
Mar 18 2024,positive,great needs more lisan ai ghaib
Mar 18 2024,positive,amazing best movie ive ever watched in a theater needs to be seen on imax the action is incredible pacing in this movie is much better than the first film  i got chills at the end of the film hopefully we will get to see dune messiah on the big screen ill be first in line
Mar 18 2024,positive,cinematography as well with sound is so godam good easily best movie ive seen
Mar 18 2024,negative,full of logical flaws lazy setpieces and brutally slow pace unconvincing costumes and some misplaced rocket worm cameos but hey the actors were pretty and gazed in to the distance longingly
Mar 18 2024,positive,so good i almost quit writing science fiction because theres no way i can top this 
Mar 18 2024,positive,excellent entry into the dune catalog  but it looks like we will need part three
Mar 18 2024,positive,a truly epic film the best film that has come out in many years the cgi was not overdone the scenes are fantastic and the story was well done
Mar 18 2024,positive,i thought it was enjoyable  im excited for the next movie  i liked the first one a little more but i definitely wasnt disappointed  almost three hours a little too long for me  timothee chalamet is fantastic as paul
Mar 18 2024,negative,it was acted well and visually amazing but i found it slow and boring with the time passing weird and not caring about the characters    i fell asleep during dune part 1 and was told this had a lot more action and it did but it was chaotic action it was like he learned everything in a blink with a noshow approach    i would never watch this again i love the actors and they did fine and it was a visual masterpiece but had i not been the driver for others i would have left    if you liked part 1 you will like part 2 if not save 3 hours of your life and 20 silverlining it was my birthday so i got free popcorn and a drink at amc
Mar 18 2024,positive,its literally the best movie i have ever seen the first 20 starts slow then boom explodes in action watch in imax the sound for this is an unparalleled masterpiece
Mar 18 2024,negative,if you know this movie isnt your type of genre do not go you will not change your mind i fell asleep twice during the movie although the movie was loud not my cuppa tea for sure
Mar 18 2024,positive,hadnt been to a theater in years prefer to stream but this was such an important movie it was worth paying the money to see it on the big screen casting was excellent especially paul atreides stilgar and chani costuming and set design was also very strongit was a feast for the eyes there are some disconcerting parallels to current events such as the use of religionfaith to galvanize a population of followers to commit violence   this is not a movie to see once and catch all the nuances cant wait to see it again but will wait until it is available to stream
Mar 18 2024,positive,well done with attention to detail around the original story
Mar 18 2024,positive,a superb followup to the incredible part one this chapter shows the rise of paul atreides to become muaddib the savior of the fremen a wonderful execution of the original source material
Mar 18 2024,negative,visually impressive but boring
Mar 18 2024,positive,its okay movie but the story line is horrible we really need a good screen writers
Mar 18 2024,positive,cinematography music by hans zimmer story themes it was all beautiful
Mar 18 2024,positive,fantastic implementation of the story really enjoyed this wanted more after it was over the probably could be done better as series to really explore the world and characters with all the backstories but aside from that pure entertainment with fantastic visuals the acting was fun and engaging  up for rebecca ferguson and timothée chalamet whom i was skeptical of before watching this series all the others were fantastic as well just as expected
Mar 18 2024,positive,tldr this movie is good but should have been longer and the changes that they made took away the depth that was provided in the novel    close but not perfect this movies strength is how it was made the cinematography vfx and score the most important elements of a movie are incredible however the movie quite honestly wasnt long enough the transistion between part one and two is sudden and major things change in terms of character relationships randomly like they forgot where they left off this movie would be very confusing for me if i hadnt read the book the events that take place over several years in the book happen in a rushed couple of months and creates a lack of depth that is present in herberts novel further more the movie leaves out the introduction of meaniful side characters and most importantly thurfir hawat im not mad that villenueve changed major plot points such as the ending but he seemed more concerned about the narative rather than the time frame and quality of the plot this movie is still well worth watching but knowing what could have been is a little disapointing
Mar 18 2024,positive,perfect everything from the directing acting cinematography the sets it was all perfect
Mar 18 2024,positive,best movie of 2023  2024 insane
Mar 18 2024,positive,i want timothee chalamet to touch me
Mar 18 2024,negative,my take if you want to spend nearly three hours watching dark depressing landscapes with dark simpleminded depressing mood music behind it and not even the tiniest bit of levity or humorthis is the movie for you     oh yes and dont forget planet arrakis has gigantic worms that make spicea drug that allows you to see into the future essential for interstellar travel but youre supposed to already know this    and sure every desert creature on earth is small because the hot sand doesnt provide much to eat but heck this is fiction so all bets are off still the gigantic worms were a blow to my willing suspension of disbelief sand is apparently a gigantic worm superhighwaythey zip to and fro sometimes with riders and cargo    so  the movie itself hit me with an audible thud and simply did not impress at all as entertainment i actually love some of the cast in guardians of the galaxy dave bautista masterfully and hilariously plays drax the destroyer but hes wasted as glossu raban a bad guy in dune 2 in guardians hes delightfully clueless in dune 2 hes just clueless    if you want palace intrigue like dune 2 attempts to explore go to youtube and watch the story of yanxi palace chinese with subtitles its ten times more clever than dune the book or the movie and has a spunky heroine to boot    in summary two thumbs down oh and im disappointed in myself too dune 1 was if anything worse
Mar 18 2024,positive,i am in absolute awe of what has been created here i would have thought that as complex as the story was it would have taken 1015 hours to tellwas i wrong what villeneuve has achieved with both films in less than 6 hours is epic if you loved the first partbe prepared to be wowed even further everything about part two is tight and spot on acting writing choreography and the special effects are incrediblethere is no valid reason this cannot sweep the oscars next year because it is a perfect film
Mar 18 2024,positive,almost 2½ years later denis villeneuve takes us back to arrakis for part two which picks up immediately after the end of part one plunging us straight back into the story as if the two films are meant to be watched backtoback everything that made part one such an exhilarating watch are present and accounted for greig frasers majestic cinematography of the desert landscape made even more breathtaking on imax together with hans zimmers arabesque score are designed for a maximum immersive cinematic experience while villeneuve and jon spaihts screenplay wrangles frank herberts dense sometimes soapoperalike plotting into something more manageable and audiencefriendly charting the rise of timothee chalamets paul atreides the last avenging member of the house of atreides hell transform himself over the course of the film into the messianic mahdi a figure who blends elements of islamic culture with the christian story of jesus and is prophesied to liberate the fremen from their oppressors meanwhile his blossoming romance with zendayas skeptical freman warrior chani plays out with hints of a shakespearean tragedy and rebecca fergusons jessica now taking on a more shadowy and sinister lady macbethlike role underlines the dangerously exploitive power religious fundamentalism can have in any society in any world returning audience will find this sequel reassuringly familiar if theres no longer the surprise element at least their heightened expectations should be met and theyll hardly be disappointed by the dazzling spectacle of fremen warriors riding sandworms and the inspired monochromatic geidi prime gladiatorial scene with an unrecognizable austin butler as feydrautha unequivocally establishing villeneuve as a master of the scififantasy genre the truest indicator that he has successfully crafted a riveting coherent and tightly paced film is that its lengthy 2h46m runtime flew by joyously and effortlessly roll on part three
Mar 18 2024,positive,masterpieceive watched 2x in cinemas but still want to watch again love everything about the movietimothee is a great actor l also austin butler zendayajavier b and all the othersall of u make the film so incredible also the musiccostumepictures this film will gain many oscars next year
Mar 18 2024,positive,amazing film probably the greatest sci fi epic in the last 20 years cant recommend enough we need more studios and directors interested in making actually decent movies these days
Mar 18 2024,positive,in my opinion a perfect movie from visuals to story this movie capitalizes perfectly on the setup of the first movie
Mar 18 2024,positive,entertaining all throughout the movie
Mar 18 2024,positive,beautifully filmed denis villeneuves dune part 2 is a masterclass in how to make three hours of desert footage look beautiful the directing and acting were all topnotch zendaya and timothee chalamet served up a tumultuous love story but rebecca ferguson gave a breathtaking performance as lady jessica kudos to villeneuve for bringing this performance to the screen dune is a hard film to make many have tried the story is tough and the environment is tougher but these two films together are a fine adaptation of a book that most never thought could be successfully filmed the books just get harder to film from here on out im not sure how villeneuve will do it but i eagerly await his take on the next novel in the cycle
Mar 18 2024,positive,what a show this is such a captivating and well crafted movie
Mar 18 2024,negative,visually stunning but major departures from the book eg every bene geserit in the universe feeling him take the water of life scene  not here ruined it for me ive read the book many times in the last 50 or so years and the characters to my mind are nowhere nearly as two dimentsonal as those presented in a lot of ways the old 1984 film was much closer both in acting terms and following in following the book plot
Mar 18 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece its all i can think of
Mar 18 2024,positive,immersive captivating epic excellent story sound action and cinematography cant wait for part 3z
Mar 18 2024,positive,this is by far the best version of dune to date  however i still liked the first movie with some of the ideas of weapons and the integration of the religious aspects of the  bene gesserit the thing i disliked the most was the integration of the muslim madie  also the muslim prayer rituals  this is supposed to be a culture of its own  incorporating aspects of the muslim religion from our world took away a great opportunity to have its own unique religious demographics the sandworms seem to be able to travel faster than plausible the physics of the real world does not work the sand would have been like a sandblaster eating through metal and glass like butter i dont see how anyone could survive riding on the back of one of these sandworms gurney comes back from the dead what the heck the movie is well worth going to see it could have been three hours long and still not capture the full flavor of the novel but a large popcorn and drink with refills got me through the twohour and fortyfiveminute movie oh i almost forgot about the two bathroom breaks too i will probably see this movie again it was that good
Mar 18 2024,positive,unless i missed something the best science fiction film of the past decade
Mar 18 2024,positive,i love this movie outstandingly done i saw it on an imax screen i cant wait for part 3 to come out
Mar 18 2024,positive,suspenseful action scenes and sequences of a utilitarian rise for power to for fill a widely misunderstood prophecy a next chapter to a realized universe taken place on a planet anointed irraqis this movie expanded on my senses of what dune was really all about
Mar 18 2024,positive,my initial thoughts are this the movie picks up where it left off and of course you get more info the actors performance was amazing he did an amazing job with the source material can he be the one to lead them to paradise who knows
Mar 18 2024,positive,very good  like really good
Mar 18 2024,positive,duna 2 is an epic in terms of photography but the spectacular scenes confronts with the development of the characters it is like see the pool but you are not able to see the bottom
Mar 18 2024,positive,1110 best movie of the year oscar winner movie and best actor goes to timote
Mar 18 2024,positive,great night of entertainment i thoroughly enjoyed myself and enjoyed thisbmovie very much even considering that timothy chalomette looks exactly like cousin larry appleton from perfect strangers 80s tv show
Mar 18 2024,positive,unbelievable cinematography and action just blew me away
Mar 18 2024,positive,i loved it great acting cinematography superb
Mar 18 2024,positive,music powerful adventurestory
Mar 18 2024,positive,did not disappoint incredible movie all around 
Mar 18 2024,positive,i was in awe the entire film beautiful shot and edited storyline was one you must pay attention to but not so insane youd get lost incredible performances and muscletightening action
Mar 18 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece a little confusing but seriously you need to watch it it was beautiful cinematics music but a little loud please watch this
Mar 18 2024,positive,great cinematography and musicsoso story line    worth seeing
Mar 18 2024,positive,cinematography special effects characters story atmosphere sound effects acting and score all were stellar this is the kind of movie we will reference back to as a standard for future scifi pictures to follow i went to the show with high expectations and this film surpassed those expectations this is 1010 for me
Mar 18 2024,positive,visually striking a must see in theaters villeneuves care and appreciation for the for the source material is once again present while some elements were drawn back for the screen the choices made sense frank herbert would be proud of this interpretation and its one i look forward to revisiting
Mar 18 2024,positive,probably the best an adaptation of this source material could be but thats not to say its actually good dune looks amazing with great camerawork and excellent effects and it manages to build out the world by treating the alien cultures of its setting with respect but ultimately the intricacies that make herberts story a classic prove difficult to portray on screen making the end result a dull watch underlined by a gratingly bad soundtrack
Mar 18 2024,positive,cannot wait until next movie   hurry please    brilliant movie
Mar 18 2024,positive,i liked everything about the movie it was spectacular and the acting was excellent
Mar 18 2024,negative,first part was better these reviews are backwards so different than the books and original it should have been called something other than dune 2
Mar 18 2024,positive,in my opinion overdone and very narrow story line ok with me
Mar 18 2024,positive,denis villeneuves latest masterpieces one of the best sequels of alltime one of the best scifi films of alltime truly breathtaking in every sense of the word chalamet  butler are sensational delivering the best performances of their careers also rebecca ferguson is jaw droppingly good
Mar 18 2024,positive,more like dune your mom amirite    jokes aside i feel this movie does better when you watch it back to back with part one  looking forwards to dune messiah though i get the feeling its going to be very different from the books
Mar 18 2024,positive,while a little long at almost 3 hours dune part 2 continues the story and feels like it ups the pacing of the first movie
Mar 18 2024,positive,spectacular this was such a welcome change given all the rubbish coming out of disney
Mar 18 2024,positive,i cannot help but feel that despite some wellmade characters developments the director sacrificed too much runtime to massive spectacles  adding unnecessary extra time to an already long and not always rewarding ciname session unless being blasted with deffening soundwaves and nearly trembling from your seat is considered a hreat cinematografic achievement     it is also rather disappointing that there is no closure of the storyline at the end but rather the promise of even more spectacle i am guessing that all critics and many viewers who commented here are 2 generations behind me in age and cinema experience when i grew up in the 60s and 70s not the massiveness or quality of cgi and surround sound was determining for the experience but rather the quality of acting and story development the 1984 dune movie version which i recommend you all to see told the whole story in one session true in villeneuves version there is more character development there are more storylines with even a few surprises and of course the miseenscene is magnificent with fremen warriors popping up from under the sand magnificent worm rides etc yet i cannot help but admire the 1984 version  in character developments and storyline more limited because only one film in effects obviously far behind the new version except for the space navigators watch at least that part  and yet depicting the whole essence of the book and at least you can follow what is going on onscreen which is more than can be said for the massive battle scenes of the 2024 part 2 a positive exception being ao the superb fight scene between paul and feyd rauta kudos to the excellent martial arts artists who made that     as regards the acting both paul leads have their limitations kyle mc lachlan in 1984 came across a bit wooden yet believeable timothee chalamet in 2021 and 2024 is probably technically a great actor yet somehow i do not feel the emotions    all in all i had expected more from this part 2 not in runtime or in spectacle but probably in story progress 
Mar 17 2024,positive,i enjoyed the film overall i really liked the level of direction cinematography and music im very impressed with the casting and how the actors played their characters unusual roles and such an excellent result
Mar 17 2024,positive,excellent movie cant wait for part 3
Mar 17 2024,positive,the movie was great it didnt feel as long as it was by far the theater was impossibly loud had to plug my ears during parts of the film
Mar 17 2024,positive,perfect successor to dune pt 1 and equally perfect predecessor to messiah   timothees presence echoes through his portrayal of paul especially as his evolution from paul to muadib to duke of arrakis he truly found his way   visually striking and a must see in imax
Mar 17 2024,positive,lots of action amazing story great acting full of surprises and incredible fight scenes
Mar 17 2024,positive,couldnt find a good time to stop and use the restroom
Mar 17 2024,positive,truly a fantastic film the best ive seen in a long time its up there with greatest of all time for me
Mar 17 2024,positive,this scifi gem delivers on every level from breathtaking visuals to intense storytelling its a mustsee for any movie lover the casts performances are topnotch drawing you into a mesmerizing world of intrigue and adventure watching it in theaters is a must for the full cinematic experience dont miss outgrab your tickets now and prepare to be immersed in the epic journey of dune
Mar 17 2024,positive,denis villaneuve has not just made a movie about dune but has captured a world
Mar 17 2024,positive,great movie i had rewatched part 1 and the 1984 version helped me to understand story line and characters as never read the 1965 novel
Mar 17 2024,positive,this film deserves all the hype that it is receiving denis villeneuve is a genius and the acting in this film is absolutely phenomenal true must watch
Mar 17 2024,positive,phenomenal scifi movie unbelievable to see quality cgi cinematography was the best ive seen in years a truly wonderful film that should be scene on a big screen
Mar 17 2024,positive,saw the first dune in imax  and was reasonably impressed  was fortunate to see the second dune in imax againwhen watching this movie its only the 4th time ever that ive had a transcending cinematic  experience   the first was gravity the second interstellar the third blade runner 2049 which to this day is the only movie it felt like i never blinked the whole run time reference is just to give some idea how astonishing awesome dune 2 is every aspect of this film is almost flawlessfrom the direction to cinematography to the sound production the authentic locations to acting and dialogue which has real weight and philosophical depthmy nephew who i watch it with wanted to go straight back into the cinema to watch it again me i just hope im  still alive to see dune messiah 
Mar 17 2024,positive,i dont often go to the theatre this was worth the trip i had no pause button and it didnt matter because it was epic
Mar 17 2024,positive,i wish i couldve seen the first movie to better understand this one but i see where its going for the next saga to come amazing special effects
Mar 17 2024,positive,a great follow on to the first part visually stimulating and amazing music  i would say that there is not much spark between the main characters but that storyline is just one of many  i thought timothee chalomet did an outstanding job
Mar 17 2024,positive,a really great cinematic master with great characters great scenes riding the worm great actors austin butler great fights and awesome story and soundtrack argh aahhh
Mar 17 2024,positive,masterpiece of scifi cinema   seen three times in two weeks never enough
Mar 17 2024,positive,its a great movie highly recommended to watch it
Mar 17 2024,negative,man was that one weird and meaningless movie rushed with too many things intertwining but without any proper link between the jumping of the months or days it is really weird but in a bad way typical empty disney movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,absolutely  incredible movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,dune part two is the best film ive seen since dune part one highly recommend going to see this masterpiece in the theater

Mar 17 2024,positive,incredible interesting choice of emperor though but absolutely incredible nonetheless
Mar 17 2024,positive,wow the scenes the acting the action the music simply amazing finally a great movie worth watching on the big screen will watch again
Mar 17 2024,positive,awesomeepic special effects and battle scenes but slower and less gripping than i would have expected after reading the book it would have made the movie way more gripping and believable if the harkonnens had been presented at least a tiny bit more like genuine human beings instead of monsters
Mar 17 2024,positive,great film with epic special effects and landscapes  the story and prophesy continues with a climax that keeps you on the edge of your seat
Mar 17 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece there is nothing negative to say at all
Mar 17 2024,positive,spectacular and epic great acting stayed true in grand arc of the book 45 out of 5  still absorbing what i saw  how can i get timothees hair
Mar 17 2024,positive,truly an amazing movie on all fronts the cinematography audio set design acting and the story are all top notch when i saw this movie in imax i felt totally immersed and it was awesome    captures the bleak fascist and brutalist vibe of the harkonnens amazingly feydrautha played by austin butler is killer in this movie    we also get to see how powerful the benne jesserit ploy truly is and how paul reacts to his part within the prophecy
Mar 17 2024,positive,as a book lover dune part two is nearly a perfect adaptation with some liberties taken that make it a much more enjoyable movie experience all of that aside the cinematography is a breath of fresh air in recent memory will watch for years to come
Mar 17 2024,positive,quality very well done

Mar 17 2024,positive,dune 2 is an amazing movie  epic  this movie will stand the test of time  so refreshing to see good scifi
Mar 17 2024,positive,loved part 2  the ending was decided and rich with dynamic events however i would have liked to see the holy war and finalize the ending with them at peace on top let the water flow 
Mar 17 2024,positive,great adaptation even i as a purist still enjoyed it good movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,the storyline the special effects the actors were all amazing

Mar 17 2024,positive,i loved every moment of this movie denis villeneuve has made another masterpiece it is better then dune part one austin butler was my favourite character zendaya as chani is the hero of this movie
Mar 17 2024,positive,dune part 2 continues villeneuves masterclass is visual storytelling the story is driven forward at a pace yet time is made for the intimate and quiet     the added cast bring mostly phenomenal performances and it is a shame that we dont see more of austin butler and florence pugh indeed this is likely the primary criticism but with such a strong wide and talented cast villeneuve mostly balances the story telling beautifully
Mar 17 2024,positive,you will probably either really like it or hate it i enjoyed it awesome theatrics
Mar 17 2024,positive,absolutely insane movie loved every minute of it
Mar 17 2024,positive,terrific movie and cinema experience exceptway too many advertisements 30 minutes ugh makes the experience not as great
Mar 17 2024,positive,first of all i love the visuals und the music and would go a second time to theater to watch it what pisses me off on this 3rd version of dune is the change in chaniszendaya personality she is angry girls for almost the entire movie with one angry expression for jesus christ  who wrote her character and why nobody told her to use more then 1 face expression also paul can see the future there is no way he could be stabled by feydrautha   however looking forward to the 3rd part
Mar 17 2024,positive,the visual effects and acting are spot on  the story is great and is as if you were watching me story unfold in your eyes as you read the book
Mar 17 2024,positive,one of the greatest films i have watched in years i was left impacted there are very few gems in films that come out every decade or so and this killed it
Mar 17 2024,negative,the music i liked but thats about it
Mar 17 2024,positive,lisan algaib anyways the story was super coolio the music was rad asf so rad i was getting hype in my reclined seat in amc theaters  not to mention whoever birthed austin butler thank you  i damn near fell over whenever he was on the screen great acting by him too  this movie shall win an oscar as written
Mar 17 2024,positive,a bit long score was too loud at times however amazing story acting is impeccable as well elevating yourself makes the experience that much better
Mar 17 2024,positive,as a dune fan this movie really does a good job of adapting the script while at the same time providing a stunning and imaginative visual spectacle recommend to dune and nondune fans alike
Mar 17 2024,positive,a lot of set up but one helluva final act   zendaya was impressive
Mar 17 2024,positive,this is one of the best scifi action films you will ever see
Mar 17 2024,positive,delivered everything id hoped for  great watch chalamet and austin butler were both outstanding  remaining true to the text and providing a visual gourmet banquet to feast on this film paves the way for an ongoing series based on the other books
Mar 17 2024,positive,an achievement in film and one of the alltime greatest scifi movies dune is my favorite scifi story and denis villenuve outstanding direction bring this adaptation to beautiful formation
Mar 17 2024,positive,incredible just wow
Mar 17 2024,positive,dune part 2 was much better than the first one
Mar 17 2024,positive,it was alright i liked the david lynch version better this version was slow and really didnt get into it as well as lynch even though lynch strayed from the novel more  i think it spent too much time and effort in being inclusive the acting in lynchs version was far superior with the amount of wellseasoned actors it had  the acting in this version made the characters feel hollow and you really couldnt get invested in them
Mar 17 2024,positive,fantastic  brilliant performances cinematography and musical score  brilliant translation of frank herberts vision onto the screen from a novel that was long deemed too difficult to shoot
Mar 17 2024,negative,app didnt work had to buy new tickets
Mar 17 2024,positive,amazing sci fi movie that has fantastic visuals and amazing characters 
Mar 17 2024,positive,very good but 3 hours ouch
Mar 17 2024,negative,the cinematography is greateverything else is just a waste of time i was on my phone most of the time and barely paid attention because it lacked substance
Mar 17 2024,positive,so entertaining  loved it
Mar 17 2024,positive,cinematically stunning
Mar 17 2024,positive,visually stunning  with good sound effects  the storyline is complex  and often hard to follow
Mar 17 2024,negative,should be rated r this film is very dark with evil manipulative creepy and violent characters there is constant and extensive violence parents need to know that there are dark religious themes of evil characters definitely not for teens or young children
Mar 17 2024,neutral,good acting somewhat poor and confusing storyline
Mar 17 2024,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece of an adaptation
Mar 17 2024,positive,as it is written lisan al gaib
Mar 17 2024,positive,its the first time in my life i go to see a movie in theater twice i dont know why but this movie haunt me
Mar 17 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen see it in imax
Mar 17 2024,positive,great cinematography and score excellent effects great acting
Mar 17 2024,positive,the cinematography is wonderful and the plot moved along so the 3 hours of the movie seems not long at all
Mar 17 2024,positive,great movie if u understand  must see i hope part 3 comes soon than later
Mar 17 2024,positive,the movie is good but quite long
Mar 17 2024,positive,i did like this version though the story line differs from david lynchs version and the books i think i will have to reread the later it definitely made me think this series will continue
Mar 17 2024,positive,it is a perfect adaptation
Mar 17 2024,positive,a visual masterpiece and the character development and transformation is immaculate one for the ages
Mar 17 2024,positive,pretty much all of the positive things youve heard about this movie are likely true its epic intriguing seatclenching and it does an amazing job of bringing a scifi classic to life on film  it elevates the action drama pacing and universebuilding from the first film if you enjoyed the first one youll definitely love dune 2 if i had any critiques they would be that the sound mixing can sometimes make it difficult to hear the characters speaking in english and that you do feel the almost 3hour runtime after a while however i feel the grand storytelling more than earned this runtime and the movie is still a solid one overall greatly recommend
Mar 17 2024,positive,if dune part 2 is any indication of how movies will be in 2024 then im going back to the theatres  without a doubt this movie blew my mind with how great it is  power through dune part 1 because itll be worth it with this second part  it was amazing
Mar 17 2024,positive,epic doesnt drag at all except for a few moments between chalamet and zendaya speaking of which damn he really did her dirty that was ice cold this is a visual feast with the best special effects and set pieces ive ever seen must be like when people got to see star wars for the first time in the 70s a historical event and an instant classic in the genre of sci fi
Mar 17 2024,positive,really good movie a great part 2
Mar 17 2024,positive,amazing and exciting dune 2 builds on the first one masterfully and adds characterization not seen in the first novel it is a beautifully shot movie every shot can be a poster excited to see where the 3rd one leads to
Mar 17 2024,negative,all special effects no storyline whatsoever
Mar 17 2024,positive,cinematography to the nth power
Mar 17 2024,negative,very poorly edited seemed to jump around for no reason even though it was a digital projection it was as if the projectionist got the reels out of order
Mar 17 2024,negative,so much of the original story and character development was cut in favor of shock and awe that the experience was disjointed and hollow  it is dissapointing after the promise part 1 had shown
Mar 17 2024,negative,it tried hard to be epic like lord of the rings but fell flat by the end there was no clear good guy to root for and of course it didnt conclude  so just another money grab  wait for next one to stream on tv
Mar 17 2024,positive,dune 2 was so good i cant stop thinking about it the actors the cinematography the music  absolutely amazing watching it in theaters definitely did it justice i felt like i was transported to another world timothee absolutely devoured his role as paul atreides austin left me speechless with his performance as feyd rautha
Mar 17 2024,positive,a little slow to start but really a great movie best version of all the dune movies
Mar 17 2024,positive,amazing from start to finish
Mar 17 2024,positive,it follows the original story if you know it from movie or book very well done in my opinion good acting a bit slow maybe now and then very detailed in different ways from the original movie recommend it
Mar 17 2024,positive,amazing soundtrack amazing scenery amazing dialogue definitely worth the wait
Mar 17 2024,positive,what can i say without spoiling it other than its fantastic a must see
Mar 17 2024,positive,i cant wait for the next one i was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie a must see
Mar 17 2024,positive,slow start to a super fast last quarter even out the pace
Mar 17 2024,positive,amazing movie a truly masterpiece
Mar 17 2024,negative,movie was too long i fell asleep for 20 minutes please dont ever make a movie that long   thank you and have a nice day
Mar 17 2024,positive,the best movies since the end of the lord of the rings trilogy just stunning
Mar 17 2024,positive,fenomenal i havent enjoyed watching a movie this much in a long long time
Mar 17 2024,positive,better than the first movie  a real scifi treat
Mar 17 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has an incredible talent for translating epic scifi books to the big screen i cannot overstate how much i loved this movie it may quite literally be my favorite movie ever made see it in imax you wont regret it
Mar 17 2024,positive,a must see on the biggest screen you can denis villeneuve is my messiah
Mar 17 2024,negative,honestly with how much hype there was around this movie i thought it couldve been a lot better now dont get me wrong the cinematography was fantastic but thats about it
Mar 17 2024,positive,perfect better than part 1
Mar 17 2024,positive,great starry line lots of action
Mar 16 2024,positive,amazing one of the best movies i have seen
Mar 16 2024,positive,it is perfect see it in theaters while you can 
Mar 16 2024,neutral,the movie was too long by about 30 minutes and it was difficult to tell the sides in the battle scenes
Mar 16 2024,positive,spoilers ahead not complete spoilers but there are major plot points discussed    for the most part of the first half while the movie has its action moments it is pretty much not what youd expect    there is little progress as the guerilla fighting of the fremen fedaykin against the harkonen intensifies paul is smart enough to keep his head down and just be a fighting fremen as he understands that his future depends on him being accepted as fremen the harkonen troops are certainly weakened by the retreat of the emperors sardaukars the sardaukars are not shown leaving but they are no longer in any of the fighting scenes    however the atreides family traits are bubbling under the surface of young paul nevermind the explosions and the fighting these psychological traits are the subtle things which drive the entire movie while some appear on screen for maybe a couple of seconds they drive the entire plot the defiance that the great reverend mother talks about is seen here and there in young paul but when you stop to think about it defiance was surely present in his father paul shows it for seconds before the box test or in the start of the second movie when he says he wants to revenge his father and after paul becomes kwisatz hederach which trait exactly becomes dominant its defiance exactly what the great reverend mother feared he becomes uncontrollable there is always the question if the world would be better with the kwisatz hederach controlled by the bene gesserit in many ways it wouldnt but the world in control of a man which has this particular character flaw defiance you can pretty much see what happens universal war all because paul basically cannot accept not being emperor it is not clear if there would be a future for him in a world in which he does not go to war with the great houses but how can a defiant man accept that him dying and all of his house would mean a better world for the entire universe he is blinded by revenge and cannot see anything beyond his own salvation and this is exactly why the bene gesserit tried to eliminate his entire house an action which was deemed to be unheard of in the past centuries for the emperor it was simply because leto atreides was very appreciated by the other houses it is interesting to see the emperor had no idea why the bene gesserit green lit the atreides extermination but while the prophecy seeds were planted by the bene gesserit to help them they end up being used against them and the contingency plan of the bene gesserit feyd rautha against paul fails too the final fight between feyd and paul is again a beautiful lesson on control and who has it while feyd was the stronger and more skilled fighter his flaws are also huge one of them cruelty he injures paul but instead of finishing the job quickly he goes very close to paul to enjoy his victory the sadist in feyd wanted to see paul in pain up close to see him die thats what paul knew what he saw his only shot at victory the narrow path to accept a fight in which youll very likely lose just to get a shot to be very close to your opponent and use his flaws against him the bene gesserit found out feyds flaws also and planned to use them against him just like they tried with paul before the great reverend mother was silenced by paul she tried to command him as a motherly figure as paul was considered sensitive to strict maternal figures ordering him what to do but to their surprise control was completely lost as paul saw through their schemes  so all in all the movie is well done and while it does have a huge show with worms and explosions the point of fundamentalism as a danger to civilization is quite well captured   i rarely give a 1010 but the movie deserves it even if it does not fully obey the books
Mar 16 2024,positive,great story even though i heard it made deviations from the book great acting and visuals a phenomenal directed film
Mar 16 2024,positive,a masterpiece that gave wb a few more years 
Mar 16 2024,positive,a fantastic sequel  im more invested now in the world of dune than i was before hooked on arrakis
Mar 16 2024,negative,very bad movie really bad dialog bad direction bad writing bad production overall  i walked out of the movie  boring and bad
Mar 16 2024,positive,epic in every sense of the word  we are witnessing the next great trilogy of films to the likes of lord of the rings
Mar 16 2024,positive,well executed adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece see what happens when you stick to great source material
Mar 16 2024,positive,dune one was a good start but dune 2 knocked it out of the ballpark peak cinema right here that everyone should def watch once in there life javier 1010 as it was written
Mar 16 2024,positive,loved it cant wait for part 3
Mar 16 2024,positive,its for sure better than the first one but still pretty slow and dull in a lot of points throughout
Mar 16 2024,positive,simply a masterpiece of cinematography a fullfledged cinematic experience the consummation of craftship into a beautiful work of art marvelous breathtaking unique wonderful not enough words can describe the multiple accomplishments of dune part two
Mar 16 2024,positive,not many sequels are better then the original this one is for sure
Mar 16 2024,positive,one of the best sequels of all time if not one of the best movies period
Mar 16 2024,positive,while the movie is not perfect it stands as my most memorable cinema experience to date each member of the team excelled in their roles combined with breathtaking visuals and the genius of hans zimmer this film is an absolute mustwatch
Mar 16 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie very much very true to the book in my opinion but the ending obviously points to a 3rd movie but it will be very disappointing if that doesnt happen
Mar 16 2024,positive,the cinematography was astounding the actors were fine but the planet dune stole the show
Mar 16 2024,positive,the movie was good and interesting its worth seeing 
Mar 16 2024,positive,interesting story with great cinema adaptation and gorgeous scenes the acting is also worldclass
Mar 16 2024,positive,a feast for the eyes denis villeneuves dune part two expands the next chapter of the epic saga with breathtaking visuals and powerhouse performances from the cast
Mar 16 2024,positive,this movie defines epic the whole cast brings their a game and the visuals are exactly what movie watching is all about denis is on another level 
Mar 16 2024,positive,one of the greatest movie with lords of the rings
Mar 16 2024,positive,this is hands down one of the greatest movies ever made its almost absurd that other movies released over the past couple of years could possibly have a higher rating than this movie best action movie ive ever seen
Mar 16 2024,positive,amazing sound easier to understand than the first one and never boring cold scenes as well
Mar 16 2024,positive,even better than the 1st
Mar 16 2024,positive,very good cinematoghraphy and story
Mar 16 2024,negative,this movie is boring and the visuals are not great why is everyone fawning over this repetitive sprawl of messiah cliches theres nothing new or original here why in the year 10000 do they still fight battles by running at each other with swords like its the year 1000 bc the worms do nothing except dive in sand
Mar 16 2024,positive,brilliant  way better than part 1 this is a must see movie
Mar 16 2024,positive,entertaining but had some issues overall seemed quite hurried introduced new villains unnecessarily and discarded villains from first movie after setting them up as intriguing and powerful eye candy tho filmed great and pretty accurate to the book
Mar 16 2024,positive,we loved first movie and dune 2 didnt disappoint
Mar 16 2024,positive,amazing visuals just like the first one but weird pacing and time jumps and disjointed flow between scenes pretty boring until the 2hour mark
Mar 16 2024,positive,im not a dune fan just checked out the movies first and now second part based on the positive reviews just didnt do it for me not as much as the first part but it is still dragged out the story and setting is uninteresting and not much action the cast was great for what the roles they were playing i give them that
Mar 16 2024,positive,as someone who read the book and already enjoyed the first part very much this is just utter perfection sure  it doesnt follow the book exactly but the movie just leaves out details of the book and isnt trying to integrate any own ideas it surpasses the first part sets beautiful szenes amazing fights and incredible music  and just gets the mood i got from the book aswell its a breathtaking movie one of the best i have ever seen
Mar 16 2024,positive,great movie with special effects and sound
Mar 16 2024,positive,it hit every note great watch
Mar 16 2024,positive,hands down the best movie i have seen in theaters since return of the king this movie has been sitting on my mind for the last 48 hours and has ruined other movies for me go see this in theaters preferably dolby or imax incredible
Mar 16 2024,positive,cant wait to watch dune part iii 
Mar 16 2024,positive,i recently watched dune part two and i must say it was an incredible experience the action acting and story were all topnotch and the cinematography and special effects were stunning the pacing was perfect keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film i particularly enjoyed the character development and how the relationships between them evolved over time overall i highly recommend dune part two to anyone who is looking for an unforgettable cinematic experience
Mar 16 2024,positive,marvel producers could learn a thing or two from villneuves masterpiece
Mar 16 2024,positive,fan the flames of religious holy war 
Mar 16 2024,positive,even better than the first one great action stunning visuals and fantastic costuming
Mar 16 2024,positive,best one yet doesnt follow the book exactly but well worth watching
Mar 16 2024,positive,everything was perfect
Mar 16 2024,positive,this movie leaves you feeling empty i really would have liked some type of conclusion for a two part movie  i need a real ending probably wont go to see another sequel
Mar 16 2024,positive,a true modern masterpiece this movie is perfect in every way the casting and acting the pace and editing the sound mixing and score photography set pieces and costumesits just perfect everything about it is perfect it is epic as lawerence of arabia it is as well crafted as citizen kane or the godfather it is also as entertaining as jaws it is a perfection in cinema and a continuation in craft    its hard to say if dune 1 or 2 is better i think theyre both terrific but dune 2 is certainly a larger in scope more magnificent in action and carrying with a bit more dialogue yet it maintains pace that makes it feel all too short i get why the immediate reaction to dune 2 surrounded the  rumors regarding dune 3 messiahwe need more dune  the only drawbacks as far as i can tell is that it spoils every other movie for me i find myself frustratingly scrolling through streaming apps looking for something good to watch lately and im afraid dune has spoiled everything for methe bar for good movie has just been raised by dune 2   as a final note i just want to thank denis villeneuve for making this movie and wb and legendary pictures for funding it as a long film fantatic my heart feels more full knowing dune exists in this modern world of entertainment
Mar 16 2024,positive,great movie action from start to end

Mar 16 2024,positive,one the best movies of the year duna 2 and joker probably fight in the next oscar for the rewards
Mar 16 2024,positive,how can one near perfect dune movie be overshadowed see dune part ii each part of the movie elevates from dune i a step further
Mar 16 2024,positive,great continuation of part one  this had some powerful moments from the cast  cant wait for part 3 or dune messiah
Mar 16 2024,positive,a characters ascension to power is rarely handled with the level of finesse as it is here

Mar 16 2024,positive,its worth watching in the cinema  impressive
Mar 16 2024,positive,absolutely perfect no notes
Mar 16 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece  dennis villeneuve is a true visionary for being able to project the book into this stunningly visual masterpiece that his peers have failed to do so from stunt choreography to costumes villeneuve has done an excellent job at creating an entirely new world with its very own people and culture exactly as frank herbert intended it to be this movie is a tribute to the novel for those whove read it nobody else has come this close to projecting it so perfectly and i dont think anyone else will in the near future
Mar 16 2024,positive,good movie critic and some fan reviews made it sound like it was the greatest movie of all time but definitely overhyped i think the problem is were so inundated with horrible movies these days when a good decent movie comes along people think its a masterpiece it was definitely good but im most certainly not putting it in the masterpiece category
Mar 16 2024,positive,i loved this movie i dont usually like to watch a movie again in the theaters but i want to relive this experience again
Mar 16 2024,positive,better than part 1 
Mar 16 2024,positive,excellent film masterful technical feat and worthy adaptation of the book story  may have improved even    superb musical score acting was brilliant beautiful shots    highly recommend watching dune part one and dune part two back to back

Mar 16 2024,positive,best movie of 2024

Mar 16 2024,positive,the perfect addition to the masterpiece that was the first movie
Mar 16 2024,positive,this is probably one of the best movies of the year also has really good acting special effects are outstanding and music tells the story opens the way for more dune films as well
Mar 16 2024,positive,ive seen this movie several times must see if you like scifi
Mar 16 2024,positive,its one of the deepest epics in all of humanities enlightened story telling
Mar 16 2024,positive,so satisfying everything was perfect the soundtrack the scenery the intensity of the characters and the plot   i was totally entranced this is what dune looked like in my head when i read the book decades ago and i am grateful to have gotten the chance to see it come to life
Mar 16 2024,negative,i would say if you are a dune fan that the movie might be worth the watch but for me it was really slow a little confusing not a lot of action and could have been way shorter for what it was lots of unnecessary stuff and missing stuff that could have made it more interesting
Mar 16 2024,positive,is a really good movie and is the sequel that dune part one deserves this movie in my opinion is better than the first one it show us more about this world and the history behind it the fight scenes are wild and epic the photography is one of the best ones i have ever seen the bad thing about it is that it is boring at some parts
Mar 16 2024,positive,dune 2 is a phenomenal movie it is a conquest of cinema in its art direction special effects music and more this adaptation of the second half of frank herberts first book despite some changes is masterful dune is the mother of them all its story was so far ahead of its time and it inspired star wars the terminator and many many other works of modern film and television it was also socially ahead of its time and still relevant today as it warns of the cult of personality and the myth of deification of mortals the acting is stellar i heard timothy chalet was the weakest part and that is simply not true he is much better than in the first and does a great job subtly transforming from boy prince to messianic soldier the entire cast is brilliant the film does a wonderful job picking up where the first one left off amazing cinema  as someone who loved the book and was so disappointed in the past by the versions released this was so satisfying
Mar 16 2024,positive,best 2024 movie by far
Mar 16 2024,positive,an epic movie that exceeds expectations
Mar 16 2024,positive,one of the best si fi movies ever
Mar 16 2024,positive,amazing action and visuals disney only dreams of being able to replicate it i love that the narrative didnt linger too long when unnecessary for such a long series of source material i felt it really moved at the pace it needed to without feeling bogged down this isnt 10 episodes of game of thrones its 5 movies at a lotr level but the scifi everyone is craving 
Mar 16 2024,positive,the greatest scifi movie of all time makes lotr return of the king look mid af on god fr fr
Mar 16 2024,positive,this truly an experience that i have never seen from a sequel blockbuster in awhile top tier filmmaking but also amazing performances from the cast this is a very special sequel that must be experienced in the biggest screen
Mar 16 2024,positive,excellent second half of dune close to the book in many ways but not weighed down with too much exposition
Mar 16 2024,positive,it was a fantastic movie i will really recommend it so if they make another movie i would be delighted if i am able to i would  watch it multiple times if i have the chance
Mar 16 2024,positive,great part 2  hope we dont have to wait as long for part 3 
Mar 16 2024,negative,i have seen and liked villeneuves part one and really like david lynchs version i am a child of the 80s so perhaps im just not the audience the producers were thinking of when casting    in short i was sadly underwhelmed slow ponderous antiseptic too long and oh boring     while i like chalamet he is not right for the part lacking the gravitas looks or voice to make you believe hes a leader let alone the messiah he hasnt learned how to act yet yet  zendaya tries but really doesnt have much to do    while lynchs version has its corny moments and isnt perfect it had a definite edge imparting a real sense of evil and most of all  javier bardem aside  a sense of humour so much more visually interesting despite forty year old special effects
Mar 16 2024,positive,the movie is what a big budget movie should be music is fantastic sound should win an award and the visuals are stunning acting was top notch i havent purchased a movie in a while i will buy this one
Mar 16 2024,positive,a movie that just gets better with every rewatch
Mar 16 2024,positive,they did a great job just a few little discrepancies from the book but mostly loved it
Mar 16 2024,positive,better than the first and the first was good
Mar 16 2024,positive,even better than part 1 very exciting i thought 3 hours might be long but the last hour flew by
Mar 16 2024,positive,the visuals were good the plot didnt warrant the movies length
Mar 16 2024,positive,wow part two is so good this movie kept me gripped with the story and motivated to watch more it is such a good a movie and 100  recommend it
Mar 16 2024,positive,left the theater with my jaw on the floor a performances all around especially butler and some of the best cinematography ive seen this blockbuster film stirred my soul more that any indie movie or arthouse film ive seen in years this is spectacle done right this is herberts work done justice i can now say that villeneuves dune is the scifi franchise of the century oh and one of hans zimmers best scores
Mar 16 2024,positive,probably one of the better movies i have seen in a while i am literally going to go see it again
Mar 16 2024,positive,cinematography fantastic costumes excellent most roles played great a few hiccups
Mar 16 2024,positive,cinematography is amazing   the story is very intriguing and unpredictable
Mar 16 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies now
Mar 16 2024,positive,little long but very gooddune3
Mar 16 2024,positive,i cant believe i live in a time where i can watch dune in live action and its somehow better than i imagined
Mar 16 2024,negative,adequate but with some unfortunate changes
Mar 16 2024,negative,nothing like the book or the original dune movie  part 2 did nothing to make us want to go see a part 3 if there is going to be one very disappointing
Mar 16 2024,positive,great cinematic work  very entertaining and suspenseful
Mar 16 2024,positive,absolutely bonkers 100100
Mar 16 2024,positive,brilliant  special effects were outstanding  the storyline kicked ass and the actors did great almost a 3 hour movie and as intense as it was you would never know it
Mar 16 2024,positive,possibly the best movie i have watched in the last 20 years
Mar 15 2024,positive,nice visually but this second edition just noticeably skips through scenes that clearly dont match the story dune 2 feels very forced and muddled in the storyline and loses most of its pulling power i became disengaged by hour 2 its nice to watch but i wasnt impressed overall at how it was done its going to be difficult for the third movie to find a continuum when dune 1 was spectacular and dune 2 mediocre at best huge lost opportunity
Mar 15 2024,positive,amazing movie from the acting to the soundtrack to the cinematography it was truly a work of art the best movie ive seen since part 1
Mar 15 2024,positive,amazing imax experience greta effects performances just awesome this is why we go to the movies
Mar 15 2024,positive,i saw dune part 2 at an imax theater opening day it was visually impressive but i didnt like the pacingediting long glances and intense eye contact took up a lot of the almost 3hour movie the paulsandworm scene was great but the battle scenes overall were not that impressive i also couldnt bring myself to care about any of the characters there was a disconnect for me    i think i was more impressed by the trailer than the actual movie i was looking forward to austin butlers feydrautha but it was underwhelming when i saw the movie his character depiction felt forced and almost cartoonish at least he looked scary another dune cast member javier bardems anton chigurh in no country for old men was more chilling unnerving      tim and zendaya were okay but i didnt see this amazing chemistry that some people keep going on and on about its not their fault i think it has more to do with what they were given and denis direction christopher walken was a miscast     the sound makeup costumes cinematography and overall technical aspects of the movie were the highlights for me
Mar 15 2024,positive,if you go see it in 4dx it will blow your socks off its really fun
Mar 15 2024,positive,definitely up there with the greatest movies to see in theaters
Mar 15 2024,positive,fantastic from start to finish this movie deserves the lord of the rings and original star wars comparisons i wish it was longer that final battle scene could have lasted an extra 45 minutes and i wouldnt have complained at all
Mar 15 2024,positive,denis villeneuve crafted an excellent sequel to an incredible part one the visuals are undeniable and the cinematography are a shooin for oscar nominations however the first half of this film does suffer some pacing issues and the number of new characters is hard to manage overall chalamet certainly commands his role but he benefits from powerful performances in bardem and butler compared to other godtier sequels this is not better than two towers or empire strikes back but it is on par with the dark knight or finding dory
Mar 15 2024,positive,good acting visually stunning must be seen on a big screen best thing ive seen in a while
Mar 15 2024,positive,amazing in every aspect
Mar 15 2024,positive,this is what cinema is supposed to be like i loved part 1 but part 2 has immediately entered my alltime top 10 watched it twice and definitely need to see it a third time in theaters
Mar 15 2024,positive,mesmerizing holds your attention for the entire span of almost three hours
Mar 15 2024,positive,absolutely stunning special affects amazing action scenes all around the perfect movie the music adds such depth and intensity this is like the best sci fi movie of the 21st century
Mar 15 2024,positive,truly amazing cinematic experience one of my new alltime scifi movies cant wait to see it again
Mar 15 2024,positive,pretty faithful to the book  loved it
Mar 15 2024,positive,i actually really enjoyed the film i read the books and i dont think denis should have cut out the scenes he mentioned he had to it could have been a four hour movie because i wanted more after it was done
Mar 15 2024,positive,generally well directed but could easily have been trimmed down by 40 mins the central character unfortunately doesnt project the messiah warrior vibe too much of a school boy
Mar 15 2024,positive,beautiful work of art
Mar 15 2024,positive,it was great i loved it kept me entertained for the entire 25 hrs
Mar 15 2024,positive,an epic piece of film making with a tremendous cast dazzling special effects and an amazing screenplay replete with thought proviking scifi elements that remain true to the spirit of the original books
Mar 15 2024,positive,it got my lazy cheap ass to a movie theater and i left happy cant remember the last time that happened great movie
Mar 15 2024,positive,plot driven and visually stunning dune pt 2 proves a gritty and satisfying second installment to what will surely be a trilogy to remember a violent work of art denis villenueve provides perhaps too many scenes where you squirm in your seat in the end marvelously choreographed fights another topclass score from hans zimmer and thrilling performances from timothee chalamet and austin butler make for an outstanding film
Mar 15 2024,positive,so wonderful i went twice to watch the movie and i love it
Mar 15 2024,positive,spectacular and mesmerizing
Mar 15 2024,positive,one of the most beautiful and epic movies ive ever seen every scene felt like its own piece of art if greig fraser doesnt win for cinematography it will be an absolute crime it literally took my breath away multiple times you must see it in imax if at all possible envelop yourself in it    hans zimmers soundtrack is a triumph both ancient and futuristic tribal and modern softly soulful and bodyshakingly epic    and of course the story it belongs up there with the greatest scifi stories of all time every actor put their entire being into their performances rebecca ferguson zendaya timothée chalamet stellan skarsgård austin butler javier bardemwow just wow    completely exceeded my expectations this movie will go down as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time
Mar 15 2024,positive,sound and special effects were very good  battle scenes were great  slow spots developing plot  ending leaves open for another chapter which i hope they do not consider
Mar 15 2024,positive,i was literally on the edge of my seat the entire movie literally a perfect film from the action to the dialogue go see this as soon as possible
Mar 15 2024,positive,amazing film  just go for it
Mar 15 2024,positive,awesome sense of vastness of the dessert snd the size of the armies
Mar 15 2024,positive,thank you denis for saving cinema best thing ive seen since lord of the rings
Mar 15 2024,positive,i havent felt this type of movie experience since the return of the king avatar 2009 the dark knight and the passion of the christ dune part two ranks very high as one of my top movies of the last decade its without hesitation the lord of the rings for scifi lovers and im counting myself as one bravo denis
Mar 15 2024,positive,a little more character and plot development in this film more romance and some excitement there is still a lot that has to be explained to anyone that hasnt read the books
Mar 15 2024,positive,the film i have been waiting for absolutely bloody brilliant 
Mar 15 2024,positive,great movie i dont want to spoil it
Mar 15 2024,positive,a little slow in the beginning but picked up as it went along end left us wondering if there is another movie coming some issues were not resolved
Mar 15 2024,positive,great follow up of the story  richer details
Mar 15 2024,positive,brilliant objectively the best movie of the year subjectively the best blockbuster movie in the last half decade yes this movie does so much right the ability to change things from the book while adapting it and still having readers be on board is a huge testament to the quality of this film
Mar 15 2024,positive,first half were good they clearly defined the purpose of the story second half made me quite disappointed they didnt made villian character powerful second half went like  thats it   war portions with christopher walken clan went like nothing happened no curiousity no intensity in war portions overall good to watch hans zimmers music played a huge role that it carried the movie to the next level visuals and set making were top notch screenplay was good
Mar 15 2024,positive,easily the best sci fi i have ever watched love the sound and cinematography and it really feels as if you are in the story cannot wait to watch it a few more times in theaters
Mar 15 2024,positive,powerful message great scenography and an even better soundtrack
Mar 15 2024,positive,im not sure i can explain how much i loved this i watched the first movie and read most of the dune books and this movie is a great adaptation of them its refreshing to see that actual good movies still exist in these times
Mar 15 2024,positive,part one was great but part two was simply perfect everything from the vfx and costume design to the acting and choreography was just satisfying to say the least the cinematography really had me immersed in the setting of ararrakis and the greater dune universe not only was it a great viewing experience in imax but the narrative and characters stayed respectful to the original novel a must see film for any fans of scifi and anyone in general
Mar 15 2024,negative,this movie was dark ugly and about wicked people doing violent graffic things my whole family hated it this should have been rated r i felt tricked thinking that this was a family movie it is not i saw quite a few moms get up and walk out i wish i had too so what if the acting is good and the visuals were good the message left me demoralized there are so many fabulous scifi movies that could be made do we really need a movie about child molesters and human organ eaters it starts bleak and ends bleak 0 stars if i could humans should make something worthy to see this was not worthy material to adapt i wish that id walked out too and shame on the people who rate movies who called this pg13
Mar 15 2024,positive,greatest scifi movie of our time  a bit lengthy
Mar 15 2024,positive,blew my expectations away awesome chapter i recommend this with two thumbs way up
Mar 15 2024,positive,the film promised too much for a war that only lasted about 2 minutes on screen the sound is incredible the soundtrack is to be congratulated but the film has an excess of disposable scenes and is quite repetitive its better than the first one without a doubt but its far from great
Mar 15 2024,positive,a truly breathtaking cinematic experience as a huge fan of the dune books and universe this is a spectacular adaptation that builds on part one beautifully in every way immersive powerful emotional and intriguing this is everything a scifi film should be and in my opinion this should be the standard for how modern scifi films are made from now on
Mar 15 2024,positive,dune 2 brings back epic hollywood moviemaking     the vastness of the journey and the artistic and luscious visuals of dune 2s photography is reminiscent of old hollywood movie days     movies like this come around once every few decades a must see in every level    the music is moving enhancing scenes that burn into the senses     the story is fluid and told well  the actors really play each role to its fullest i was super impressed    this is the same director from blade runner 2049 and thats a good thing his direction and vision of the future is creative and pure eye candy for the audience
Mar 15 2024,positive,fantastic cinematography  soundtrack with strong acting across the board definitely the sort of epic experience that demands the biggest cinema you can find
Mar 15 2024,positive,best movie of all time strong statement but i stand by it having no concept of the first movie or story really i found myself fully encapsulated this film is a complete sensory experience that will touch your soul
Mar 15 2024,positive,if you have read the books then you will likely love this movie because there are a lot of connections that you can make and it brings the books nicely to life if you havent read the books then there is little in the way of narrative to provide the necessary detail to some of the things that happen in the movie so for someone whos not read the books it feels like were just jumping from one big theme to the next with some great visuals and spectacle inbetween but we dont understand the how or why which makes for some very surprising parts that feel weirdly disjointed also the sound editing continues to be a problem as it was in the first movie
Mar 15 2024,negative,movie theatre evacuated
Mar 15 2024,positive,dune part 2 was outstanding with incredible cinematography and cgi effects acting was excellent and the movie did not to seem as long as it was secondary to its fast paced action highly recommended
Mar 15 2024,positive,amazing  if you liked the first one youll like this one
Mar 15 2024,positive,beautifully done if you havent read the book read it it adds more substance to the experience
Mar 15 2024,positive,the very best scifi movie ive seen my entire life marbelous incredible and superb
Mar 15 2024,positive,great all around acting scrpt visual just wao
Mar 15 2024,positive,amazing film great visuals stellar cast book lovers will enjoy
Mar 15 2024,positive,dune 2 much better than part 1 more action and more of a story line   i see 3  coming cant wait  
Mar 15 2024,positive,if you read the books you will love this
Mar 15 2024,negative,i hope they dont come out part three
Mar 15 2024,positive,this is a great example of when the sequel is better than the first installment  the movie had it at drama action and great special effects  look forward to this story continuing
Mar 15 2024,positive,now this movie will make history i rank this in my number three spot in 2024 for now the movie was great as hell there was more action than the first one i saw an imax screening of this its a great movie its great
Mar 15 2024,positive,i cant say 5 stars because im a big fan of the books especially the ones this movie is based on     the changes are not something that make the source material better     however the visuals are great and its not a politically charged film worth the watch    i will say that the audio book the new one is amazing and better than this for are so you should get it to see what i mean about the changes    paul is a lot more put together in the book so is the other main character     also theres a lot of yelling and way too much religious music and made up languages    tldr get the audio book  not bad considering the trash that has been out for that last year good enough but not great    wont rewatch but would re listen to 21 hours of audio
Mar 15 2024,positive,visually stunning awesome backgrounds and locations epic fighting scenes i thought it dragged on a little bit
Mar 15 2024,positive,dune part two may just be one of the best scifi movies of all time the worldbuilding is deep and intricate the plot is complex and engaging the characters are both compelling and interesting the acting is top notch and the visual effects are spectacular while part one was mostly setup albeit very good setup this movie contains the majority of the plot of dune while its only march as of this writing i think theres a very high chance that dune part two will be the best movie of 2024
Mar 15 2024,positive,the best movie of 2024 so far the cinematography was beautiful story amazing and all out great performances now i dont think its the greatest movie ever but its carnally great in its own right
Mar 14 2024,positive,as a man who isnt religious this felt spiritual i dream about the lisan al gaib
Mar 14 2024,positive,masterpiece the plot thickened with unexpected twists and the cinematography and sound and acting made it perfect austin butler was amazing in this did not expect that kind of performance
Mar 14 2024,positive,as a theatre manager i often tire of watching films this is not such a case i have watched this in imax twice and am genuinely feeling i need to see it a third its hard to finish my shifts without thinking about sneaking in this movie for a little while
Mar 14 2024,positive,classic if youve read the book i definitely recommend that you see this movie
Mar 14 2024,positive,ive been a fanboy of the book since i was a kid ive read it several times since i was 10  this film serves dune fans about like peter jacksons lotr films ignore his hobbit served fans of that series as a fan i can live with what was changed or left out its impossible to translate a book perfectly into a movie the source material was treated with respect
Mar 14 2024,positive,five stars great movie loved it
Mar 14 2024,positive,amazing continuation to an incredible story 
Mar 14 2024,positive,phenomenal movie and excellent sequel to the first
Mar 14 2024,positive,i liked it very much  i have been waiting for it and was not disappointed
Mar 14 2024,positive,2024 film of the year award its not very often that a sequel is better than the first film this film is definitely the exception has a great plot and some exceptional follow through with ideas the great acting from the majority of the main cast  just enough action and story line all tied in together for an entertaining 2hr and 47 min top it all off with a massive climax at the end of the film that will having you beg for a third installment  this is a definitely must see and i give it 2 thumbs and a big toe up
Mar 14 2024,positive,dune part two emerges as a monumental cinematic achievement epitomizing the word epic in every frame timothée chalamets portrayal of paul atreides reaches new heights of excellence showcasing a depth and complexity that captivates from start to finish however its austin butler who steals scenes effortlessly shedding his elvis persona to fully embody the menacing yet charismatic feydrautha harkonnen despite its substantial runtime of almost 3 hours the films masterful storytelling keeps audiences engrossed ensuring that every minute is worth the journey drawing inspiration from classics like lawrence of arabia dune part two is a testament to visionary filmmaking at its finest    director denis villeneuves meticulous attention to detail shines through crafting a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience that transcends the scifi genre with a gripping narrative that balances personal dilemmas with cosmic stakes the film explores themes of love destiny and sacrifice against the backdrop of a richly realized universe as paul atreides navigates the treacherous sands of arrakis grappling with the weight of his choices audiences are swept up in a cinematic spectacle that lingers long after the credits roll dune part two cements itself as a modern masterpiece setting a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking while honoring the timeless allure of frank herberts literary saga
Mar 14 2024,positive,visually stunning and the definition of epic in story landscape and character development
Mar 14 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely perfect loved the cast and the cinematography is next level some stunning scenes in this film
Mar 14 2024,positive,contains spoilers dune part one was amazing i watched it at least 10 times so my expectation for part two was sky high and now having watched it 4 times on imax i was just blown away every single time i watched it and i am still thinking about it appreciating it people are hailing this movie as the series of our generation and i can see why part two is so ambitious juggling multiple threads introducing new characters and setting up set pieces  it all comes together in glorious balance while the action is breathtaking the visuals dazzling the score out of this world  it is ultimately the love between paul and chani and the idea of a messiah and its religious undertones that make this movie one of the best if not the best ive watched should any faction embrace the idea of a messiah should one step into that role if you have a choice no matter how good your intentions are would it have the power to corrupt and how does this affect people closest to you are all questions that director denis villeneuve challenges us to ponder we experience all these not just from the protagonist perspective but chani we see her playing that angel on pauls shoulder and through her eyes we see pauls transformation perhaps not for the better denis said in one of his interviews that frank herbert never intended paul to be hailed as a hero and this transformation is paying homage to that is he slowly turning into the very people he hates he has the bloodline and with every glare and icy stare from chani and hans zimmers fantastic score that alternates between hopeful and dark we start to question that all these decisions which are different than the books elevate the story to another level movies are a visual storytelling  medium and how denis played off the feelings of different characters to make the audience feel torn about whats right or wrong  is just brilliant filmmaking and of course the action is just lotrlevel epic the harvester attack the ornithopter attack the sandworm riding the battle of the arrakeen are all shot and choreographed beautifully the cinematography well it was award winning and denis had a lot of iconic shots in the movie these are just snapshots that stays in your mind and just looks friggin cool like paul running on that mound towards the sandworm paul and chanis first kiss paul shouting long live the fighters with his cape flowing behind him stilgar crouched waiting for the battle to begin the 3 sandworms in the screen ready to attack the sardaukar  just too many to list here hans zimmer also goes apeshit on this one with industrial clangs guitars throaty sounds and that all too famous waaaaahahaaaahahhhhh i mean he got his team to create instruments because they wouldnt have pianos in planets in the future  dune is that special project that everybody pours their heart into and we the audience see it on the screen and feel it in our hearts one movie critic once said the greatness of a movie is measured with how long you were thinking about the movie once you left the cinema  i love that quote and i can say i am still thinking about the masterpiece i watched and still reading the stories of the mahdi and the lore of dune this is a movie of epic proportions watch it on imax the way denis intended it to be experienced it will change your life
Mar 14 2024,positive,as i see it this part 2 is a huge upgrade compared to the first one which acts as an introduction to the universe and characters this film is really enjoyable with an amazing soundtrack and beautiful scenes the pacing is good overall throughout the movie however in the last part of the movie it all felt a bit rushed so everything fits moreover nothing bad to say about the acting i am looking forward the part 3
Mar 14 2024,positive,one of the best sequels ever made it makes part one a better movie the main complaint with the first movie was that it was slow moving part two was so action packed  that now part one was no longer a slow movie it was a great character building movie part two was so good that it makes part one better we dont get to see that often the age we live in now more often good movies are ruined by their sequels see terminator dark fate making t2 completely irrelevant or we have good shows ruined by their final season see game of thrones dune part 2 is something great and something very rare in modern day hollywood
Mar 14 2024,positive,faking amazing the best movie in years the cgi incredible the construction the script everything just couldnt be better
Mar 14 2024,negative,the pace was slow the content and context presented felt empty it would appear as if they took one movie and are trying to spread the content over three installments after seeing the first dune many years ago although ive never read the book i am disappointed and wish i hadnt taken the time to see this part 2
Mar 14 2024,positive,honest review is the film is visually stunning if youre a visual person youll love it but its exceeding long winded with too many slow dull sequences the story telling is weak you never have any doubt or tension of any kind completely predictable from start to finish i couldnt sit through it twice which is my benchmark for a great film
Mar 14 2024,positive,despite its long runtime the film never really feels like it has dead space in it the visuals are extraordinary going way beyond any marvel movie in quality and the sense of what youre watching doesnt exist in some universe the first film was a turnoff for some and this would be to those as well for the same reasons but for me i love the pacing and grand imagery of denis villeneuves style shots give you a sense of the world and contrast between being  intimate and keeping you aware of the size of the world he has created so far the best movie of the last year in its genre as a sequel it delivers in keeping up with the first installment lacking the falloff franchises like the matrix suffered from its unclear whether or not there will be a third from the way it ends but either way i am satisfied with how the story progressed and wrapped up
Mar 14 2024,positive,this movie was excellent pacing was great the development of pauls character is painful and scary to watch and the deep religious aspects of the film really make it feel heavy i cant wait to see it again
Mar 14 2024,positive,this is the dune movie i have been waiting for
Mar 14 2024,positive,dune part two is the face of pure masterful cinema like part one part two feels as though they had to actually go to arrakis dune to film my complaints about the film are so minor and get completely shadowed by the sheer scale of the movie this to me is a 1010 without a question you must see it in imax to truly experience its dessert power
Mar 14 2024,positive,one word masterpiece
Mar 14 2024,positive,as i watched this film i was completely immersed in the world arrakis with a captivating soundtrack and the expert use of lighting and color i could not leave the universe i was placed in even in thought for the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes i feel that the story was perfectly showcased in the way the characters were designed the way they interacted with one another the way each setting was designed and the pacing of the story throughout the whole film watching this felt like i was reading the book the relationship between frank herberts 1964 novel and this movie adaptation is stronger than any other book to movie relationship i have ever seen nearly everything is the same and is presented accurately with only one major difference taking place at the very end of the movie finally the cinematography especially of every battle and fight scene had my friends and i in awe dune part two is a must see for 2024 and will be for all the years to come
Mar 14 2024,positive,if youre a fan watch it on the big screen
Mar 14 2024,negative,special effects were great the story like very fragmented and got boring
Mar 14 2024,positive,best adaptation of dune book to a movie  unfortunately the sound mixing failed such that much of the dialog could not be heard  the dialog is critical to understanding the story
Mar 14 2024,positive,a masterclass in science fiction movie making
Mar 14 2024,positive,this is an absolute masterpiece
Mar 14 2024,positive,denis villeneuve flexes the cinematic and special effect muscles while showing us what are we capable of in the scifi genre in 2024 some dialogue falls flat though
Mar 14 2024,positive,dune part two was a very intense and fulfilling chapter it did a great job of keeping me invested with the characters and it kept me invested with the story overall for how long this movie is my eyes were on the screen the whole time fully invested i enjoyed this amazing intense scifi film
Mar 14 2024,positive,my god what an absolute masterpiece
Mar 14 2024,positive,great movie cant want till the ending sequel spoil alert
Mar 14 2024,positive,the movie script was too far from the original story in the book i was disappointed part 1 was better

Mar 14 2024,positive,lived up to the hype
Mar 14 2024,positive,an unforgettable cinematic experience the love for the dune universe the amazing cast costumes scenography pace and score i am so grateful dv took it upon himself to bring this to life

Mar 14 2024,positive,epic scifi sequel  had everything storyaction all star cast  right up there with great scifi sequels empire  judgment day and aliens if you love them go see its a must 
Mar 14 2024,positive,this movie is really a mustsee from story line to elaboration and special effects also i think in this movie again the characters are very well cast the movie is indeed long but because the film is so compelling this does not bother you at all the film is over faster than you think if you ask me yes definitely watch this movie and for me this is the best movie of the year
Mar 14 2024,positive,everything you want from an action movie and more doesnt done anything down amazing shots and acting
Mar 14 2024,negative,overhyped trash cant believe people actually think this was a good movie

Mar 14 2024,positive,one of the best scifi movies ive ever seen 910
Mar 14 2024,positive,its everything you could dream of and yet itll still exceed your expectations
Mar 14 2024,positive,excellent the acting the decors the story so compelling beautiful movie
Mar 14 2024,positive,i liked the special effects and the overall movie  i didnt like that they steered away from the book at the end in the book and the original movie as well as the 2000 miniseries pauls sister is already born and she kills the barron and the other royal houses do concede that paul is now the emperor  the ending left you hanging like unfinished or wanting more  they should just end with dune and dont make the other stories  the rest of the entire story is very disappointing
Mar 14 2024,positive,i liked this movie i was thrown off by the ending but still think it is worth watching
Mar 14 2024,positive,best moviegoing experience in years great movie great sounddolby atmos great acting wonderful visuals
Mar 14 2024,positive,beautiful and action packed part 2 is much better paced then the first one and some great new actors in the film austin butler and zendaya the story may be a little hard to follow but you can infer it just look it up very beautiful scenes and will go down as a classic for sure
Mar 14 2024,positive,fear is the mindkiller
Mar 14 2024,positive,whats not to like  adequate adjectives do not exist  from gone with the wind to present with the single exception of avatar genre i have never experienced such an epic movie  it filled the senses with sound visual grandeur of locations excellent casting dramatic acting impeccable direction cinematography and editing  ive seen every english version of dune  i was expecting more of the same with different visuals  nothing prepared me for what i experienced  talented rewrite with superb direction and editing  old became new and unexpected  i look forward to the next installment  part iii
Mar 14 2024,negative,part one was fantastic and held true to the source material part two started in that vein but wildly departed post paul water of life the movie should have ended there with a promise of a part three  instead paul became a jackass loses the love and respect of chani arya remains in utero the great houses dont capitulate and the fremen holy war begins  all in the final reel  part one was so faithful that part two feels like a slap in the face  i left the theater cursing the filmmakers  may their clapboard chip and shatter
Mar 14 2024,positive,a flawless masterpiece
Mar 14 2024,positive,one of the best movies of the year the graphics storyline along with every aspect of this movie was beautiful if you didnt enjoy part 1 youll love part 2 every character played there role so well and i cant wait for the next part  also great rewatch value
Mar 13 2024,positive,cinema is back baby
Mar 13 2024,positive,part one was exceptional and delivered a vision close to the what the book laid out part two almost 3 hours long  so to start disappointing to watch  it felt lost the baron limped through the story line and was barely watchable the film relied way too much on cgi the battle scenes did not hold true at least for me the emperor was irrelevant and didnt seem like a force to be reckoned with maybe i was holding on to the original film score and didnt give this much of a chance  ill try this again when the cinema is not so packed and people constantly getting up in front of the screen due to the length of the film
Mar 13 2024,positive,great movie overall could have used a bit better editing as some parts are a little disjointed and choppy especially if youre not familiar with the books length is also a bit long could have used a bit of physical aging of the characters to support the concept of growing from boy to man over time as the story would have actually taken quite an extended amount of time to have taken place with that in mind pauls sister should have been born before the end of the movie as this storyline must have taken more than a few months to have really transpired but again overall a good movie
Mar 13 2024,positive,to long but good movie
Mar 13 2024,positive,the lord of the rings of this generation in that it is a lengthy epic that is lovingly crafted from a literary classic it is both faithfully adapted but intelligently altered for both era and format and will undoubtedly continue opening doors for outsiders to the genre     i believe that this series if the pattern continues will similarly be replayed reanalyzed and reenjoyed for years to come
Mar 13 2024,positive,best movie i have watched in a very long time the best ever for the cinematography
Mar 13 2024,positive,literally perfect if you didnt watch this im imagine or dolby atmosphere you wont know the experience of the rumbling feeling of what its like to be infront if a worm
Mar 13 2024,neutral,i feel like the little boy who shouts the king has no clothes  i am a huge scifi fan love movies by denis villeneuve and was excitedly looking forward to seeing dune ii after seeing the glowing reviews and ratings on rt  unfortunatelyi was greatly disappointed and couldnt wait for the film to end  it was indeed a spectacle  there was no end to the dazzling sets costumes special effects and grandious dramatic music but overall i found it to be pretentious and melodramatic  it seemed as if villeneuve skimped on the compelling storytelling and assumed if he just threw a bunch of impressivelooking stuff up on the sceen that wed all be awed into thinking dune ii was an epic masterpiece i dont think it was i never cared about any of the characters except for chani i never believed these were realistic people facing realistic problems in fact the characters often did things that seemed quite nonsensical i understand that the film is an adaptation from a novel so villeneuve was restricted by the source text but he didnt seem to put any effort into drawing the viewer into the world of dune and making it seem like a real livedin universe it seemed like just a bunch of eye and ear candy splashed across the screen to subjugate the audience and make us all nod our heads and proselytize about its grand prescence
Mar 13 2024,positive,since it was called pt2 i expected an evolution of the story rather than a remake with minor plot twists otoh the special effects were breathtaking
Mar 13 2024,positive,epic movie making in every sense of the word definitely worth a second look
Mar 13 2024,positive,loved it even the differences from book and previous movie cut out unnecessary bits really theater had sound too loud a bit uncomfortable at times if you are sensitive to noise
Mar 13 2024,positive,the last hope of cinema
Mar 13 2024,positive,a movie where the paul atredies goes on a journey growing from a boy to leader to fulfill his destiny lots of characters and plots being built for the next installment but oh boy this movie is it it has it all you would and wouldnt expect its very immersive as it has a crazy good cinematography where you dive into this world and forget about our reality it has an amazing soundtrack keeping you on the edge of your seat and its executed really good to match with scenesalso the crazy plot taking us to different places and set piecesthe movie gives us intense scenes  leaving you mind blownall in all incredible movie  that sets a new benchmark for sci fi movies and gives the viewer an elite movie experience highly recommended
Mar 13 2024,positive,vivid  faithful adaptation of best scifi novel long live muadib
Mar 13 2024,positive,the story was great and the cinematography was outstanding
Mar 13 2024,positive,excellent movie the plot captured the feel of the book very well the visual effects were superb and the characters were welldefined much better than the already good dune part one
Mar 13 2024,positive,epic fight scenes with a storyline that continues to draw you in  while im not a dune fanatic both movies have proven to be thoroughly enjoyable heres to the excitement  of a part three
Mar 13 2024,positive,really enjoyable with great action  story telling
Mar 13 2024,positive,hollywood got something right for a change  enjoyed it
Mar 13 2024,positive,i think it might be a bit unfair to compare this adaptation to the book  though its hard to separate them completely while the book is better to be sure this film takes certain creative liberties that i found enjoyable once i let the movie stand on its own apart from my preconceived notions from the book     its a bummer how jessica was portrayed as a surface level villain her character i found to be much more nuanced in the book perhaps more admirable in comparison one of the bigger bummers imo chani was muchhh improved though they gave her way more agency with a less devestating arc     maybe my hottest take i did not like the score in fact that may have been the biggest disappointments for me dunes score has almost no leitmotifs recurring musical phrases that represent characters and themes there were certain scenes that were so grandiose and impactful visually but lacked a through line with the music there were many pretty musical moments to be sure but with only a couple recognizable melodies that occurred more than once i found it difficult to get fully sucked into the film with hans zimmer writing the score i was surprised to be let down     a return to the sterile sci fi of 2001 a space odyssey was super cool and enjoyable to me some really beautiful shots  but why the heck were there no stars  like is the desert known for brilliant night skies and they mention constellations in the movie so why the heck do we not get a beautiful night sky shots of the stars huge let down     because of all the changes from the book im super curious as to how theyre going to tackle the third movie and finish pauls story from the books perhaps this final movie will create a solid through line between all the movies that improves the overall storytelling and world building     also another hot take the baron in this movie was kind of a meh villain could have been way better let down imo as well  but austin butler really killed it for sure and timothee was a perfect paul zendaya was a brilliant chani as well v solid casting for these three character their performances really shone through and sold the story
Mar 13 2024,positive,remarkable storytelling and an exhilarating visual spectacle that delivered a very fulfilling conclusion to part one
Mar 13 2024,positive,from the books to this 2nd live adaptation dennis the crew and the cast have raised the bar in terms of visuals scale and musical score i would highly recommend viewing the movie in imax if possible great movie 
Mar 13 2024,positive,a grand spectacle dune 2 solidifies itself as a modern masterpiece    dune part two isnt just a movie its a cinematic experience that demands to be seen on the big screen director denis villeneuve crafts a visually stunning and emotionally resonant followup to the 2021 film solidifying its place as a modern masterpiece    a feast for the senses the film boasts breathtaking visuals from the vast desolate landscapes of arrakis to the intricate details of the fremen culture every frame is a testament to the exceptional production design and special effects the score by hans zimmer further elevates the experience perfectly complementing the onscreen action and heightening the emotional core of the story    powerhouse performances the cast delivers exceptional performances timothée chalamet embodies the troubled hero paul atreides with a captivating intensity zendaya shines as chani bringing depth and nuance to her role the supporting cast including rebecca ferguson josh brolin and javier bardem is equally impressive adding further weight to the narrative    a story that captivates dune 2 delves deeper into the complex themes of frank herberts source material it explores the consequences of unchecked ambition the seductive nature of power and the struggle for survival in a harsh environment while the films lengthy runtime might test some viewers patience  the narrative rewards those who stay invested    a mustsee on the big screen dune part two is a film that begs to be revisited the combination of stunning visuals powerful performances and a thoughtprovoking storyline makes it a truly exceptional cinematic achievement     in short  visually breathtaking   powerful score by hans zimmer  exceptional performances by the entire cast  complex and thoughtprovoking story   a cinematic experience best enjoyed on the big screen     recommendation dune part two is a strong contender for a mustwatch film especially for fans of science fiction epics and those seeking a visually stunning and narratively rich experience
Mar 13 2024,positive,great acting and story the cinematography was excellent along with special effects
Mar 13 2024,positive,easily the best movie i have seen in the last 10 years i absolutely loved it still have goosebumps 15 min after it ended this needs to be seen on an imax theater or the biggest screen you can find
Mar 13 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece for any scifi lovers out there
Mar 13 2024,positive,the northsouth fremen religious differences were an unnecessary and contrived difference between the book and the screenplay  chanis character was done an injustice as a result in addition to no longer being dr liet kynes daughter    paul and chanis son leto not born and dying in the sitch attack alia pauls sister not being born to end the life of her grandfather baron harkonnen leaves too many holes to fill by fabrication to conclude the book in a part 3  the story is fiction and does not require peoples abilities alias in particular to be grounded in reality    the film locations chosen for dune were fabulous  the cgi and other effects are the high points of this interpretation of frank herberts dune
Mar 13 2024,positive,because i know the story already i found the movie to be thoroughly intriguing and entertaining  the acting is terrific  it is truly a scifi marvel of a movie  people who dont know the story will be disappointed with the ending because its not really an ending at all its dangling arcs that didnt finish  terrific if there is a 3rd movie  not so terrific if there isnt
Mar 13 2024,positive,excellent movie with lots of action that includes love and adventure
Mar 13 2024,positive,such a good movie and one of my favorites this year i cannot wait for the next one im so excited and definitely going to watch it again
Mar 13 2024,positive,i didnt love dune but part two is head and shoulders above the cinematography the action the music are all great for me it really picked up in the second half once feyd  austin butler  showed up he is so gleefully evil and commands the screen you just cant take your eyes off him
Mar 13 2024,positive,see it in imax for the superior aspect ratio
Mar 13 2024,negative,cheesy lame and overuse of bass how do they have so many people and so much money on one project and no ones ever says this so lame lets not do it this way 
Mar 13 2024,positive,visually perfect and absolutely exciting and amazing storytelling
Mar 13 2024,positive,this was exciting and enjoyable once the pace picked up and i cant wait for part three
Mar 13 2024,positive,its better than the majority of the movies that are made better than the 84 dune for sure i wouldnt say its the best movie ever though i have dune on an incredibly high pedestal because of the book there are minor issues i have with the movie otherwise though its a definite must watch in the theater especially in imax
Mar 13 2024,positive,how many battle scenes do we need to understand the prowess of these filmmakers are timmy and zendaya really believable as the one and the love of his life especially after he casts her off so cavalierly for the chainmailed daughter of emperor chris walken perhaps the writers producers and directors should go back to film school to relearn how to tell an effective narrative in an hour and a half its been done before and im sure these stars can put their egos aside long enough to craft a film that is both engaging swiftly told and not so long on the effects i mean how many sand worms can we ride and harkonnens can we kill before it just gets too boring   ps the seats shaking and noises around the viewers head was a fun gimmick just that a gimmick
Mar 13 2024,positive,was great through and through looking forward to part 3
Mar 13 2024,positive,visually amazing had me jumping out of my seat  must watch again
Mar 13 2024,positive,excellent effects and a storyline that does not lose pace movie follows the book quite well best movie i have seen in several years and much better than dune 1
Mar 13 2024,positive,this is real cinema
Mar 13 2024,positive,visual effects and costuming remain the strongest features of the film the plot seemed a bit disjointed and rushed at times which is understandable considering the length of the source material     jessica  and most regrettably paul are no longer sympathetic characters to the point they start to feel like the villains by the end i wasnt rooting for anyone to win
Mar 13 2024,negative,loved part 1 with the story being built lots of fighting in part 2 not much story building it is very noisy bring your ear plugs
Mar 13 2024,positive,might be the greatest movie i have ever seen when i was in the there i was fully absolutely invested into this world and story the actors did an amazing job this movie is so so so so soooo good it is a 100 must watch
Mar 13 2024,positive,quite literally the best scifi movie in the last 40 years this tops almost every movie ive ever seen
Mar 13 2024,positive,brilliant movie denis villeneuve did a perfect job making this movie must watch
Mar 13 2024,positive,storyline visually captivating but was looking fwd to understand how the freemen and everyone else maintain their day to day ie source for food clothes market view also what is the worms predator sure there will be one else the ecosystem logic doesnt work
Mar 13 2024,positive,this movie is a great continuation of the prequel and its a film that everyone should watch almost everything about the movie is at its best the movie is long which i think is good cause its a massive story the story is exciting and great from the start till the finish the movie also has good graphics in it and it feels like pure natural art the music is absolutely amazing i believe this is one of the best works of hans zimmer and his team all the actors have done a great job when it comes to acting cause everything felt so real as if the events were happening for real the movie lacks emotionality which i think is not an issue but im hoping that dune part 3 will be emotional at the end i really loved dune 2 and im very excited for dune 3 whenever it comes out i believe that dune 3 will more epic exciting and amazing than what weve seen in dune 2 its my request for everyone to go and watch dune 2 cause its epic awesome great amazing and still so much more to praise
Mar 13 2024,positive,movie was ok but not worth watching again it added too much meaningless detail to the story and departed too much from expectations of the story from the first movie dune no weirding module it was also unbelievable at times which detracts too much sword fighting in an era of space travel and guns
Mar 13 2024,positive,very solid part 2  the acting carries the story  the story is stil a little broken up even with the movie divided into parts even though t runs 3 hours it is worth your time
Mar 13 2024,positive,such a treat to watch filming was beautiful acting was brilliant and score really made it i appreciated that the sound was leveled out more than last time cant wait for part three
Mar 13 2024,positive,best movie of the decade 
Mar 13 2024,positive,i never believed id see the day when one of the most dense weird and incredible sci fi universes would be adapted so well but here we are     i know villeneuve has said he wants to stop after dune messiah and i dont blame him but i will gladly see any dune movie this man touches
Mar 13 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic movie  the visual effects were great the acting was marvelous and if you happen to be a duneite you will see that dune messiah will be forthcoming  a bit awry from the books but absolutely marvelous
Mar 13 2024,neutral,visually appealing i would recommend imax vs a standard screen i have not read any of the books but i felt the final battle was anticlimactic
Mar 13 2024,positive,excellent movie   the story keeps you on your seat and its is pretty simple to keep up with
Mar 13 2024,positive,could not take walken serious  kept thinking of pulp fiction
Mar 13 2024,positive,an absolute experience to be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible excellent continuation to part one of dune the characters developed accordingly the dialog was intriguing and the world building on point dont miss out on this film  you will walk away wanting more in the top ten best scifi movies of all time including part one
Mar 13 2024,neutral,i had high hopes after the first part was quite faithful and infused with new directors take but this part 2 misses the mark story wise visually as strikin  g as the first but the decision to not have the time jump was a mistake a lot of missed opportunities for world building in the end it kind of made me want to revisit lynchs version and the novel less so what would follow this part 2 which felt very incomplete compared to the novel
Mar 13 2024,negative,music amazing effects gorgeous story nonsensical there are so many plot holes it feels like the sandworms ate most of it dont get how the reviews for a movie that requires you to read a book first to understand certain points is so praised
Mar 13 2024,positive,awesome movie that completes te story told in dune 1
Mar 13 2024,positive,spectacular and touching at the same time fantastic movie
Mar 13 2024,positive,a typical villeneuve movie and thats a big compliment villeneuve has retained everything that made the first part so special  the action scenes are rare but when they happen they are epic technically implemented at the highest level and thrilling  what once again sets villeneuves film apart from other blockbusters is the visual story telling i dont need everything explained villeneuve certainly trusts his viewers to draw the necessary conclusions from what they see  the acting is outstanding lets exclude christopher walken who in my opinion could have improved his voice acting my highlight was the performance of austin butler  the only downside is that the criticism of religion shown in the books has been somewhat lost  but its still an amazing movie i want part three
Mar 13 2024,positive,the actors did their roles well the scenes were stunning but the plot left me wanting dont know it was the movie or the source material
Mar 13 2024,positive,just mind blown by the visuals it was stunning in the imax screen austin butler and florence pughs roles too were neatly integrated as they werent there in the part one
Mar 13 2024,positive,magnificent visuals soundtrack is awesome fantastic on all levels definitely one of the greats
Mar 13 2024,positive,its big its loud its got giant worms used for mass passenger and freight transport the film does not show their boarding process its got too many wellknown actors which is distracting  you keep seeing them as themselves rather than the characters theyre playing the villains are cartoonishly evil its way too long    but its dune if you liked the first one youll probably like this more
Mar 13 2024,positive,absolutely incredible movie  a mustsee in the cinema on the big screen the entire cast is amazing and the images are stunning after watching it in the cinema it is now in my top10 movies of all time incredible movie
Mar 13 2024,positive,the visuals and music of this movie are definitely the best in recent years
Mar 13 2024,positive,shame on any critics who give this movie less than 100 and marvel and dinsey movies high scores you sold your souls and just learned to kiss a88
Mar 13 2024,positive,if you got 2hrs and 47mins heres a solid scifi watch with subtitles my guy
Mar 13 2024,positive,once in a lifetime movie series
Mar 13 2024,positive,amazing cant wait for part 3
Mar 13 2024,positive,didnt expect for the movie to be this good i felt goosebumps when paul was talking a speech very good 
Mar 13 2024,positive,such a good story amazing cinematography and music really enjoyed it
Mar 13 2024,positive,lots of action loved the movie
Mar 13 2024,neutral,far too much fluff terrible editing could have cut out 45 minutes
Mar 13 2024,positive,probably the best scifi film in years you would think that being a long film there would be parts where you disconnect a little from the film but this is not the case it keeps you immersed in every single scene and it just gets more and more intense the deeper you go into the film  truly a masterpiece trilogy in the making  we will have to wait for the final part but itll be so worth it  thank you denis villeneuve for this amazing adaptation
Mar 13 2024,positive,it was very  very good  loved that the harkins have been smashed and paul gets his country back  i guess dune part 3 is in the works with the beginning of the holy war  luv it would recommend
Mar 13 2024,positive,i really liked it but i want paul and jonny to get together
Mar 13 2024,positive,masterpiece believe them when they say go see this movie and see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 13 2024,positive,hes so humble as written
Mar 13 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever watched great sound and visual effects never a dull moment throughout highly recommended
Mar 13 2024,positive,a perfect sequel that does everything a sequel should do and more
Mar 13 2024,positive,truly epic    best movie i have seen in years
Mar 13 2024,positive,ive seen the 1984 dune movie and the scifi channel adaptations this version is the best the definitive adaptation of the book and a fun adventure film just dont drink too many fluids  you wont want to go to the restroom and miss a minute
Mar 13 2024,positive,it was so much better than the first one very intense  it did not disappoint cant wait to see it again
Mar 13 2024,positive,dialogue dragged on far too longneeded a variable music score there was too much repetition 3 more hours and still really no conclusion as my daughter stated kill people faster lol
Mar 13 2024,positive,the worst part is now i have to wait for a part 3 this movie is so good
Mar 13 2024,positive,marvelous evocation of a desert planet
Mar 13 2024,negative,the movie was disjointed and boring
Mar 13 2024,positive,epic storytelling great actors and actresses and excellent character development lots of action so many different atmospheres created as well
Mar 13 2024,positive,some of the best scifi you will ever see in your lifetime hands down my favorite movie right now
Mar 13 2024,negative,dont understand the need to time skip multiple times in one movie pretty easy to take a wild guess of whats going to happen after every scene really loved the rushed ending to that made it worth 3 hours of my life
Mar 13 2024,positive,i can only say this movie reached so high level of magnificence i had years not watching something of this caliber respect
Mar 13 2024,positive,great scifi movie and better than the first  chalamet shines in this allstar cast and austin butler increases the intensity  the movie is dark and brooding but very good
Mar 13 2024,positive,fairly faithful to the book certain stylistic changes and compression of the timeline make for a more engaging film without sacrificing too much of the story too brief a scene with alia and perhaps a bit too much foreshadowing in the framing of others
Mar 13 2024,positive,everything greatly remastered hope there is a part 3
Mar 13 2024,positive,cinematography was great dont go if you havent read the book youll be totally lost music and background sound is the loudest  movie ive ever seen  bring earplugs
Mar 13 2024,positive,much more action than part 1
Mar 13 2024,negative,sound is amazing there isnt much too look at if you like grey  grainy footage this may be for you does it follow the book no it doesnt even try it only gets worse in this part ii spoiler alert the ending is paul goes to war with the entire universe im not going to watch a part iii if its ever made
Mar 13 2024,positive,i havent felt this way since i watched the two towers for the first time if he gets the green light for a third movie this could be the greatest trilogy of my generation    i found it also elevated the first movie now when i rewatch it i have a greater appreciation for the slower pacing and worldbuilding because you feel rewarded with the masterpiece of the second movie
Mar 13 2024,positive,a worthy follow up thrilling beautiful cinematography and breathtaking sound design the cast is top notch both villeneuves dunes are matserpieces
Mar 13 2024,positive,wow this might be the best film of the 2020s and i already know this is going to be my favorite film of 2024 im calling it right now
Mar 13 2024,positive,an epic film in every sense of the word and quite possibly the best of its genre
Mar 13 2024,positive,was a really good experience i cant wait for the 3rd part
Mar 13 2024,positive,the best sciencefiction movie of all time everything is sumptuous all the actors are great the plot fits with the spirit of frank herberts dune wow
Mar 13 2024,positive,this is the best movie of the year
Mar 13 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in the theaters since lord of the rings trilogy probably more beautiful and much better soundtrack see it in imax for sure ive seen both and bigger is better
Mar 12 2024,negative,somewhat disappointed the first film was an epic 1010 bringing many of the subtleties of the book to life whilst visually stunning part 2 just gets it wrong the chani character is the main problem spends half the time acting like a bloke and all the rest of the time scowling just bad acting which is a shame as it doesnt fit the story or in any way add to it meanwhile javier bardem plays a nodding dog and the score is pretty poor islamic wailing for 3 hours basically its a bit odd as the score and all acting performances were exemplary in the first movie so the muaddib tries to lead and rally his troops whilst his girlfriend clearly thinks hes a right bellend rather than it being a bit tragic when he agrees to marry the emperors daughter instead you get the impression he is well rid of her and has actually got a decent lass some truly memorable moments when chani isnt in shot but they are a bit brief and the aesthetics are all wrong so whilst the 80s version had incredibly hammy acting in the first half and became rather epic in the second the modern adaptation had an almost perfect first half and then quite a poor second still worth a watch if youre a fan of the books
Mar 12 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen philosophical emotionally enthralling and visually stunning dune two stands among movies like the two towers and empire strikes back as one of the greatest sequels of all time a mustsee in imax
Mar 12 2024,positive,movie was long but still felt rushed
Mar 12 2024,neutral,this movie was so boring bloated and slow i had to leave the theatre for 10 minutes and even that was more entertaining needed to be forty minutes shorter
Mar 12 2024,positive,great movie  better than part 1
Mar 12 2024,positive,better than the first
Mar 12 2024,positive,if you havent seen this you must watch this this is almost as heavenly of a movie as the spiderverse movies this is such a masterpiece i believe if we ever have to represent humanity to aliens by showing them a movie this is a close second next to sherman and mr peabody i absolutely loved when anakin skywalker came on screen with paul atriedes and said together we are dune part 2 before hugging emotionally and the 8 hour scene with the sandworms and the hulk was absolutely amazing my only complaint is that sherman and mr peabody only appear for 10 scenes instead of the whole movie did i mention how much i love sherman and mr peabody i really loved the scene where atriedes said you turned her against me to perry the platypus from phineas and ferb and when  anakin skywalker said silence to mama coco in all seriousness this is a great movie
Mar 12 2024,positive,as a movie is good i have a problem with zendayas one emotionface thing as an adaptation is in my opinion bad i love how looks whole but parts with zendaya were for me irritating and i saw how meh actress she is
Mar 12 2024,positive,exceptional cinematography well written screenplay well go see it a second time in theaters
Mar 12 2024,positive,great continuation of the original story great special effects and performances
Mar 12 2024,positive,coming from a guy whos never read the books this is an visual and beautiful masterpiece
Mar 12 2024,positive,loved everything about this movie  the acting the score the cinematographyit all hit just right for me  been years since ive had such an experience at the theater
Mar 12 2024,positive,great story line cenimintograpy was wonderful marvelous special effects
Mar 12 2024,positive,an amazing science fiction movie very entertaining great acting and musical score i very much enjoyed it the film is a powerful metaphor it shows the danger of worshipping a messiah type figure and the hypocrisy of religion while also building up a satisfying yet terrifying example of what someone like that would be like it was epic and damn near biblical i loved it and i can not wait for dune messiah
Mar 12 2024,positive,incredible storytelling and visuals there was much more character building in part 2 every single actor delivered an incredible performance and loved how much you learned about paul and chani definitely a must see movie
Mar 12 2024,negative,to long and bad i would rather eat old mr beast chocolate cause there was not enough fighting to much kissing  my grandma does not approve either wich makes it worse not better than star wars and it sucks so bad
Mar 12 2024,positive,this is the best movie i have seen in my entire life i would say its even better than empire strikes back its so powerful and intense also very very loud felt like the soundwaves in imax were as strong as the winds on arrakis this is a must see
Mar 12 2024,positive,visually stunning and stays true to the novel in most ways
Mar 12 2024,positive,brilliant see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 12 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen absolutely incredible 
Mar 12 2024,negative,it was dreadful the plot line was nonexistent all the characters were angry and everyone just wanted to kill it was hard to find any characters that you liked  it was just depressing and the worm was dumb
Mar 12 2024,positive,fantastic a perfection
Mar 12 2024,positive,lots of action good movie
Mar 12 2024,positive,seeing part 1 really really helps  but cinematics makes firsttime viewing wonderful
Mar 12 2024,positive,longtemps que je navais pas vu un aussi bon film    i havent seen such a good film in a long time
Mar 12 2024,positive,an amazing film not a dull moment in a film which is over 2 12 hours never has a sparse desert scenery been so captivating honestly do not think i will see a better film this year
Mar 12 2024,positive,from the cinematography to the writing to the soundtrack and dialogue the movie is perfect
Mar 12 2024,positive,as a book adaptation its probably around 75 accurate but as a standalone film its a masterpiece some characters and events diverge from the source material but the overall message remains intact beautiful movie
Mar 12 2024,negative,it sucked too disjointed and too long the acting was a discredit to the cast also a drug out movie that would have only been half as long  didnt even come close to the hype on cinematogphy
Mar 12 2024,positive,i already liked the first part but this one exceeds its predecessor and i am happy about it cant wait to see dune messiah
Mar 12 2024,positive,the perfect scifi  fantasy movie doesnt exis go see this thing on the biggest screen possible with bonkers loud speakers thank me later 
Mar 12 2024,positive,absolute must see only on the imax screen
Mar 12 2024,positive,i provided everything i could ask of the story more action than dune1 but the sound and special effects are awesome  i took the wife to the cinema to see it and she hated it
Mar 12 2024,positive,before watching dune ii i wanted to see lawrence of arabia 1962 the sand the heavy burden of predestination which the main character rejects politics and blood  there are a lot of similarities between these two epic canvas of cinematography    but back to the main thing dune ii is a terrifying tape its been three days since the first show a day later i watched it one more time and it still wont let it go thanks to the talent of director denis villeneuve the theme of the formation of the dark side of the personality of paul atreides is fascinating and terrifying the scale of events and the sacrifices that religious fanaticism and worship of a charismatic leader bring with them break out in a cold sweat after watching    this is a smart movie wrapped in a spectacular blockbuster honestly on the second viewing i felt more perhaps because the first viewing had set expectations for the film i just couldnt keep up with the pace of the film there was many times more action and fewer words and breaks by the end of the movie even the great desert makers sandworms were so tired that i wondered how i would leave the cinema today by taxi and not by shaikhulud    but we must give credit from the perspective of the films language this is a magnificent creation the sound and image here triumph the action scenes are shut up and take my money    give me even more panoramic shots by greg fraser shots from above and sweet muaddib im referring to jerboa now not timothee chalomet and ill remain on arakis forever     although it would be possible to remain longer at giedi prime blackandwhite firework effects are one of the most impactful impressions the whole blackand white history of the harkonnens planet from a psychological perspective abruptly conveys their houses worldview visually perfected style restraint smoothness and beauty    in part 2 of dune the director brings forward female characters and the mechanism of the formation of a religious cult the eyes of rebecca ferguson pauls mother and now the reverend mother are the most alive the character of zendai played by chani is pauls personal doubts and fears about his role as a religious leader the prophet of the fremen this whole role is built on one frown overall the love story is just plain cardboard there was more electricity between timothee chalamet and armie hammer in call me by your name than between two young hollywood stars    it feels like denis has put all his love into one character giving the soul of the film to him although there might not be much every appearance is worth it and im talking about embodiments of fear and hatred on aracis the assassinmercenary feydrouth played by austin butler its powerful and sexy and everything is monochrome the danger oozes from the screen through the tip of his knife     compared to such a charismatic villain even timothee chalamet seems lost fortunately he has a powerful scene near the end of the film where he delivers an amazing speech in fremeni in the spirit of the king the speech is not just a boy but a man he is exactly in his place carrying the cross of starboy as his hero he still needs to act 3 to fully sing his song without messiah there is no end to paul atreides story all the plot points are there     you will come there is only desert for you lawrence of arabia
Mar 12 2024,positive,this is my favorite movie of all time the music the story the acting the cinematography the music everything is just perfect
Mar 12 2024,positive,this is a mustsee prepare to be captivated true storytelling at its best i loved the darker tones this film had compared to dune part one the atmosphere is so immersive and the cinematography was amazing i was drawn in from the very beginning the stellar cast delivered nothing short of brilliance bringing their characters to life with fantastic performances from start to finish its an epic adventure that will keep your eyes glued to the screen be sure to watch it on the biggest screen you can for the best experience highly recommend this is one movie you wont want to miss in theaters
Mar 12 2024,positive,excellent visual and storyline one of the best scifi movies of all time i loved it
Mar 12 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely spectacular i watched it 2 days ago and i cannot stop talking about it everybody did a amazing job and i most definitely and going to see it again just amazing
Mar 12 2024,positive,one of the greatest scifi movies the soundtrack gave me goosebumps awesome
Mar 12 2024,positive,part 2 is the one of the best movies ive ever watched the visuals matched with great acting plus an astonishing soundtrack just hit it for me got goosebumps multiple times i love that they took the time to make a meaningful movie and didnt rush it     if you can watch it in imax or the biggest scene and with great speakers to get the best experience or at least thats what worked for me 55 stars wow incredible
Mar 12 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic definitely a must see for sci fi fans the visuals were stunning the characters were strong and the theme was sound gravity and high stakes were conveyed in scenes without a whole lot of gore which i found impressive the plot and political tensions were also not too difficult to follow once invested  my only critique was that the movie felt a squeak long nonetheless would highly recommend and watch again
Mar 12 2024,positive,amazing movie much better than the first which was already really good and the ending almost left me crying
Mar 12 2024,positive,original style for once
Mar 12 2024,positive,see this movie in a theater the effects and cinematography are absolutely amazing one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
Mar 12 2024,negative,visually it was quite appealing i guess the story works but still felt disjointed to me i believe the first movie did a much better job at matching up to the book if youve read the book there was so much that was changed as someone who has read the books i know that you cant match a book to a movie theres got to be give and take i believe part one was done much better than part two and i actually liked the original dune better overall while i full understand and accept needing to add remove or change things to fit a book to a movie format but dont completely change the core of who a character is also there was a ton of stuff added to the movie that is not in the books that doesnt even help the story or explain anything they are just added because they can i guess there are also many scenes that differed from the book and changed how you perceived them over all i give the movie a d the actors did a good job the visuals were great but the story and plot were kinda blah since it was based on a book it felt more like someone took the base ideas and plot points then rewrote the whole thing
Mar 12 2024,positive,visually beautiful and great story throughout
Mar 12 2024,positive,such an amazing action packed movie
Mar 12 2024,positive,i have a amc subscription so i see a lot of movies this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time and that is saying something i cant get enough of it i wish it were 5 hours long it is such a masterpiece you can tell so much love and care has been put into it and all of the actors gave phenomenal performances i foresee an oscars sweep in dune part 2s future
Mar 12 2024,positive,quite simply the most emersive experience ive ever had the pleasure of experiencing inside a movie theater considering this installment is only 11 minutes longer than part one it feels like so much more story arch and character building took place in part two compared to part one which i thoroughly enjoyed as well the imagery costume design score and villenueves ability to create emotional dialogue between characters without actual words is second to none in the history of the art form     i cannot wait to see it again in the theater and im looking even more forward to physically owning the film so i can watch it over an over again throughout the years do yourself a favor and see this movie in the theater the score only makes the theater experience worth every penny
Mar 12 2024,positive,epic action and adventure dune part 2 the best movie that i ever watch this year
Mar 12 2024,positive,warning the following review will have spoilers from dune part one you have been warned canadian director denis villeneuve is currently doing the impossible faithfully adapting author frank herberts scifi epic dune while dune part one focused on establishing its characters its massive world and the power structures within that world dune part two lets go of the reins and watches what naturally happens after the downfall of house atraides at the hands of the ruthless house harkonnen paul atraides timothée chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson are in hiding among the fremen people on the desert planet of arrakis paul is trying to balance a lot in his head revenge for his father helping the fremen with their ongoing war with the harkonnen and denying the faithful bene gesserit who believe in a prophecy involving him chalamet does a great job in portraying the growth of his character sometimes forcing the audience to question themselves his love interest is chani zendaya a fremen warrior who is drawn to who he is instead of his power while part one was about fear part two is about power and the dangers of it the story gets deep and complex the technical aspects of this movie are stellar the visuals production design and cinematography are some of the best ive seen the scenes with the harkonnens were filmed using infrared cameras making them look black and white while keeping the cold metallic savage look of the people as you might be able to tell i thought dune part two is a scifi masterpiece the best part about it are the small details of the world denis has created from the fremen language the mechanized vehicles and the contrasting cultures even the largescale shots make this feel like a oneofakind theatergoing experience this is why i love going to the theater so much while watching this i kept thinking that this mustve been what it felt like watching empire strikes back or the lord of the rings the two towers on the big screen previously fleshed out characters going to war against each other with the potential of an even more epic final movie in the trilogy yes this movie is that good go see dune part one if you havent already then dune part two on the biggest screen possible
Mar 12 2024,positive,dune part 2 was hands down the best scifi movie i have ever seen visually avatar 2 has really stunning scenes on a beautiful planet as opposed to the desert planet arrakis but avatar ripped off pocahontas and you can see where george lucas ripped off the dune story being that dune the novel came first with that being said i feel like dune 2 is better than any of the 9 star wars movies tattooine is a desert planet luke is the chosen one meant to bridge light and dark the force is like the voice of the bene gesserit the strongest warriors fight with swords not guns the universe is controlled by a corrupt emperor like cmon george lucas straight up stole from frank herbert go see this movie its incredible from start to finish and i cant stop thinking about it
Mar 12 2024,positive,i expected a little more action
Mar 12 2024,positive,visually stunning with relatively subtle cgi that adds to the story without being distracting the story is well told for those who have read the book it stays as true to the characters and story as possible within the time limitations there is some artistic license taken especially with cheney and stilgar to convey the story and drama without the immense detail of the book the characters are fleshed out well through actions and dialogue without unnecessary explanation from other characters narration or other trite storytelling techniques that take away from the story the whole movie is wellfilmed and the story is welltold the entire theater is left with a sense of wonder at the end and it stays with you the entire ride home it is well worth watching several times
Mar 12 2024,negative,this installment is far worse than the first it diverges from the book significantly on many important points its tedious slow and boring perhaps one of the worst criticisms is its horrible effects the crowd scenes have the worst cgi i have ever seen the people in the crowds look fake as heck if they make further installments i wont be wasting my money
Mar 12 2024,positive,exhilarating and suspenseful wonderfully made
Mar 12 2024,positive,wow this movie is amazing im a new fan to the dune franchise and after part 1 and 2 i love it this movie was beautiful exciting and action packed   definitely cant wait for more movies would recommend to see
Mar 12 2024,negative,having read the books and having seen the earlier movie and part 1 i thought that it was way too drawn out and esoteric too many kinds of weird visuals that reminded me of drug induced movies of the 70s psychedelic
Mar 12 2024,positive,from what i remember from the previous part of dune it left me wanting more well heres the more its mostly action and mystic lore from beginning to end watch it on the biggest screen you can find
Mar 12 2024,negative,back to the world of arrakis with an allstar cast and long live the fighters and all that    but for me watching dune part two was like being trapped in a neverending sandstorm its nearly 3 hours but felt like 5    dont it turn my brown eyes blue    dune 2 s biggest sin is muting the charisma of timothee chalamet and zendaya it would be more interesting to watch these two young stars eat lunch together than sit through this bloated hot mess    the plot is as clear as mud to those who havent read the popular books much of the films dialogue is in the desert language of arrakis so subtitles are necessary not that anyone says anything particularly riveting in any language    and who thought theyd ever see a fight to the death between willy wonka and elvis    to be fair dune 2 s visual effects are impressive a colliseum showdown recalled benhur  gladiator and the climactic showdown between chalamet  baddee feydrautha an unrecognizable austin butler was fairly welldone but youre 25hours in at that point    the legions of dune fans no doubt will eat it up but for those who arent desert dwellers dune 2 is a tough watch    may thy sword chip and shatter indeed
Mar 12 2024,positive,much more real life than fantasy life situations decisions
Mar 12 2024,positive,building on the promise of its predecessor dune part two delivers an ambitious grand epic scifi thriller with less setup intended the longawaited sequel expands further into the worldbuilding established previously delving deeper into the fremen culture the power dynamics but most importantly allowing the characters to flourish visually speaking its phenomenal the vast deserts come alive with breathtaking cinematography and visual effects that seamlessly blend with the practical sets really makes you wonder how the film is produced at more
Mar 12 2024,positive,loved it    but i think it is a much much better movie if youve read the book
Mar 12 2024,positive,movie was great great plot and had the right amount of action
Mar 12 2024,positive,favorite movie this year world is huge and action is hugeer
Mar 12 2024,positive,great movie i know it deviates from the books for example some characters hair but its an adaptation thats a good thing unlike star wars or marvel which distort the universe
Mar 12 2024,positive,havent experienced this type of epic cinema in theater since jacksons lotr peak scifi cinema
Mar 12 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in years it blows star wars out as the best space story
Mar 12 2024,negative,i am just now leaving the movie dune 2 sitting in the parking lot in my car thinking how i could describe the movie to you the best way for me to describe it is if i was captured by the marines sent to guantánamo bay and had chinese water torture for the last 2 12 hours or however long the movie was if i ever decide to go see another dune movie by this guy which there will be please stop me by any means necessary
Mar 12 2024,positive,ive read all of frank and brian herberts books and i am an avid fan of scifi cinema for over 60 years  this picture is a go see as it is on parr with avatar in its direction acting and cinematography   the picture is close enough to the original work to make fans like myself go omg but the picture strays from the original in ways that make the story even better  the stillsuits better the thopters better the worms better   my only gripe is it was rushed and way way too short   dune is a game of thrones space epic from one visionary clan father and son and is worthy of all the hype bestowed upon it sans season 8   we couldnt get enough of r r martins got it will be the same with dune if they just take off the gloves and tell every nitty gritty detail herbert put to paper
Mar 12 2024,positive,outstanding conclusion to the original book
Mar 12 2024,positive,cinematically incredible captivating left me a little meh at end though would i watch it again probably not but it was an amazing piece of cinema

Mar 12 2024,positive,one of the most immersive cinematic experiences ive ever had 
Mar 12 2024,positive,great movie nice and long with epic battle scenes and one on one fights all casting was done very well
Mar 12 2024,positive,finally a new movie that had me wanting to be back in a movie theater having really enjoyed the first film i had high hopes for this one this was hands down the best scifi ive seen in years visually stunning plenty of action and scifi adventure all while presenting a number of big themes that keep things thought provoking the cast here is at their best all the way around but zendaya really stands out for me throughout while we see paul wrestling with his choices how she is reacting and dealing with them really drives things home in a time where there hasnt been a lot for me to personally celebrate at the local theater this was a very welcome change this is one i can honestly say should be seen on the big screen in all the spectacle this one can offer
Mar 12 2024,positive,literally so cool get dune part three a bigger budget and ill get millions of tickets everyday watching dune thats what i want
Mar 12 2024,positive,amazing captivating hypnotic    denis villeneuve is a one of a kind once in a generation director the time energy effort dedication and more to this film was evident throughout will be watching in imax again hopefully this week or next film of the year for me

Mar 12 2024,positive,brilliant the acting was remarkable
Mar 12 2024,positive,excellent cinematography and sound great special effects excellent acting the storyline is obviously fantastic because it is taken directly from a masterpiece
Mar 12 2024,positive,the worse part about this film is that i have to wait 2 or more years for part 3
Mar 12 2024,positive,i cant stop thinking about it contemplating seeing it for a third time its that good thank you denis for crafting another scifi masterpiece
Mar 12 2024,positive,its good but not as memorable as dune 1984
Mar 12 2024,positive,one of the most extraordinary sci fi movies i have ever seen a big step from the last movie and extremely immersive i hope dune part 3 is a possibility
Mar 12 2024,positive,it was awesome to watch beautiful my only hold out is some of the story line changes but as a lover of the books i loved it worth every minute
Mar 12 2024,positive,it is hard to believe that this movie did such a great take off from the 1st part  the cinematography was unreal  this was a great movie to view long but worth it
Mar 12 2024,positive,good adaptation good acting to a good story
Mar 12 2024,positive,amazing i need to see it again
Mar 12 2024,positive,one of the best produced directed films i have ever seen   phenomenal

Mar 12 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece enthralled the entire time
Mar 12 2024,positive,just a masterpiece when all you receive in theaters is scifi junk this movie takes the gold
Mar 12 2024,positive,because its realy good it had action gore emotion and a lo of things you need on a movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,part 2 was even better than part 1 a must see in the theater
Mar 11 2024,neutral,i read the trilogy i loved part 1 but 2  gets bogged down in special effects it was hard hearing the dialog many times hardly any one in the theater so it wasnt too noisy  just too much music and explosions to hear the spoken word sometimes i do look forward to 3 to see how it finishes over all it was entertaining i enjoyed the inspiration of the screen writer and the views of the director
Mar 11 2024,positive,listen i dont love sci fi but my husband does and while this movie is entirely too long i loved the story line glad i went 
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie is awesome
Mar 11 2024,negative,it was just boring i genuinely did not understand the plot of the movie it felt as if i was thrown into a movie with no structure
Mar 11 2024,positive,fantastic scifi film that did not disappoint riveting even with the long run time it felt evenly paced to me the visuals and acting pushed the movie forward and the climax left some storylines open ended hopefully to be followed up with in dune messiah personally one of the best sequels ive ever seen
Mar 11 2024,positive,love it  better than the first want to see it again soon
Mar 11 2024,positive,not as stunning as part 1 for me but definitely a worthy sequel
Mar 11 2024,positive,the attention to detail in following the books was excellent the worms the sand and the native fighters were stunning in imax  a deep and complicated love story weaves throughout the movie go see it
Mar 11 2024,positive,the kind of movie cinema ist there for what a mesmerizing throwback to true blockbuster popcorn experiences with its majestic visuals and soundtrack dune part two elevates the story to a new level going even beyond what its predecessor 2021 promised a great cast and villeneuves adaptation and deviations from the books and the 1984 manage to keep giving i honestly havet been so enthralled by a new movie for a long time the complex story is somehow encapsulated around paul atreides own arch and makes for a much more digestible pacing that just keeps upping the stakes and going from one setpiece to the next philosophical level highly recommended actually make that a must see
Mar 11 2024,positive,a modernday cinematic masterpiece the pace of the movie the cinematography and the acting are all great it is an amazing sequel to a great albeit not flawless part one denis villeneuve has really outdone himself this time
Mar 11 2024,positive,one of the most amazing films ive ever seen in theaters the acting from everyone is incredibly on point the pacing is amazing tighter than the dune part 1 and you will absolutely lose yourself in this masterpiece
Mar 11 2024,positive,excellent action and storyline especially good if you have watched dune 1 or know the series
Mar 11 2024,positive,one of the best scifi movies ive seen in over 10 years puts all disney trash to shame
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie is beyond just a popcorn bucket movie its a movie that has everything from the familys conflict to a destiny being fulfilled to the actionpacked sequences with a bit of romance the run time never came into question
Mar 11 2024,positive,dune part two was certainly something much like the first this movie is an experience the visual effects in this film are so far beyond most hollywood productions james camerons avatar is often hailed as vfx at its finest dune outdoes it by leaps and bounds despite the fantastical and otherworldly spectacle on screen somehow it all looks practical the action sequences are very well done there are a few oneonone duels in this movie and they are so expertly choreographed its amazing every actor on screen brings their agame i cant even describe how real every character feels timothée chalamet delivers a truly oscarworthy performance the world is greatly expanded upon throughout this entire movie now that our main characters are with the fremen the overarching story really takes off the first half feels like a direct continuation of the first movie but there is a noticeable shift in direction by the halfway point despite being an enthralling experience the whole time it starts to become very dense and weighty in the second half with a heavy focus on religion destiny and prophecy because of the transformations that the characters undergo choices begin to feel out of character their motivations get muddied and you begin to feel like youre watching a different film this works to the films benefit and its detriment by the end you get what the story is going for but in the moment it makes little to no sense the movies ending is honestly very dissatisfying but rightfully so considering the circumstances surrounding its conclusion it gets you to question whether or not the protagonists have become the antagonists which is one of my alltime favorite storytelling tropes despite the movies astounding production design and execution the plot brought my overall rating down a notch id give this a 4 out of 5 its no godzilla minus one but its still worth a watch in my opinion
Mar 11 2024,positive,im not familiar with the book but this movie is so beautiful to look at and its engaging in every frame
Mar 11 2024,negative,it was too long and you lost track of who was who as the movie progreed
Mar 11 2024,positive,very intense just like the first one too much killing for me but my husband loved the movie  great special effects  lots of action all the actors are great
Mar 11 2024,positive,dune 2 is incredible indeed a film that can only be experienced in all is glory in imax   the music is enchantingheartbreaking and full of beauty the acting was solid and action was amazing
Mar 11 2024,positive,that is almost perfection at least in science fiction field great story wonderful pictures blasting music fantastic acting thrilling adaptation this universe has been put to a screen a never seen before way congrats to villeneuve and everyone involved you can be proud of your amazing work
Mar 11 2024,positive,incredible masterpiece of cinematography the sets the costumes the cgi and sound everything just stunning
Mar 11 2024,positive,much better paced than its predecessor excellent timeline definitely is going to be a saga to remember
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie was long but did not disappoint even after 3 hours i wanted to see whats next in paul and chanis story
Mar 11 2024,positive,what more could i say about this film than what has already been said villeneuve has created an absolute cinematic masterpiece
Mar 11 2024,positive,denis villeneuve definitely gets the stunning visuals right and dune 2 was definitely a specticle otherwise there were a lot of good parts in the  story but it was very choppy
Mar 11 2024,positive,amazing amazing amazing the way denis was able to capture the true heart of dune while also bringing an incredibly unique take on this world as well was an absolute thrill to see i left the theatre utterly speechless perfectly perfectly casted
Mar 11 2024,positive,absolutely the perfect movie that i was searching for years thanks denis villenueve for this movie i love you
Mar 11 2024,positive,amazing experience i almost thought i was the messiah once i got out of the theater
Mar 11 2024,positive,it lived up and more i could watched the movie again straight away
Mar 11 2024,positive,please see it at the cinema if you can you need noise and vibration the casting is superbthe acting second to none the special effects are amazing and the cinematography is incredible  i think its probably one of the best films ive ever seen takes me back to feeling like a kid watching el cid breathtakingly epic
Mar 11 2024,positive,takes a bit to get going but its absolutely enthralling once it gets there jessicas story became one of my favorites despite her being a bit lackluster in the previous film stilgar also ended up being a standout bringing some much needed humor to the heavy tones oh and austin butler what a wild dude loved him timothée is certainly fine  but in this movie he is actually just you know fine he does an acceptable job but hes not really bringing much uniqueness to the role despite being the lead    its really the directing and the visuals that make this movie worth seeing my favorite scene was by far the first sandworm ride theres just such a sense of immense scale and speed that flies off the screen despite really only taking place in one environment the fucking sand the film brings enough variety in its stylings that it doesnt really get old    by the end of the film the story becomes very engaging i loved the way that paul and chanis relationship was explored and complicated throughout the film with some unexpected turns of events towards the end this movie has done a solid job of setting up the next film and im excited to see where these stories go
Mar 11 2024,positive,visually stunning each performance was captivating and powerful desperate to see it again already
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie takes off from the first one like a rocket and leaves you ready for part iii
Mar 11 2024,positive,gamechanging if the first movie was setting the bar for blockbusters and cinematic experiences this part ii could well be on its way to changing movies and movie culture forever i have never seen a movie in imax before and this movie was admittedly perfect for cinema but more than that the scope of storytelling was incredible brilliant acting denis villeneuve at peak filmmaking best great direction costume and visuals were on point a score to send shivers down your spine the word i would best use to describe this is immersive truly and completely immersive cannot remember the last time i felt so deep inside an epic like this takes you on a journey from start to finish immersive deserves every good word said about it a followup that does justice to the first movie and in many ways adds to the brilliance that we are privy to cinematic genius
Mar 11 2024,positive,awesome imax experience its my second viewing of the movie  i cant wait for the third installment of the series 
Mar 11 2024,positive,brilliant movie kept me gripped the whole 3 hours  first hour felt like 2 and the last 2 hours felt like 1
Mar 11 2024,negative,dune part 2 is overrated it seems like they spent all thier money on the cast and not on the movie itself christopher walken might not even survive for a third movie and it felt like elder abuse even watching him in this role they eliminated the weirding way from the movie which is going to complicate any further movies the voice is only part of the wierding way the other half is a foot technique and a hand technique the hand technique isnt introduced for a few books later jessica seems like she is better then paul at seeing the future which is crazy why need him at all the ending scene which is supposed to be an emperor thrown room looks like they ran out of money and shot it in a supply closet paul who is supposed to see the future getting stabbed twice is insane at the end of the book and the other movies paul takes off his shirt to show that he has been in countless battles but has never been scared wait till its on hbo
Mar 11 2024,positive,loved this movie start to finish such a fan  the sounds the visuals and the acting were all phenomenal story was perfectly executed
Mar 11 2024,positive,groundbreaking this movie will change cinematic history ive never wanted to see a movie twice in one week but here we are the acting is amazing the directing costumes visuals the scoreits like truly watching a story and getting immersed in it kudos to everyone 
Mar 11 2024,neutral,the visuals were fantastic locations action scenes scenes with the worms   some of it felt cheap with the worm scenes from a distance as they surf across the sand but overall it just left me with more questions than answers   i have seen all three versions of this film adaptation of dune  the original movie from 1984 was too short and really did not have time to tell the story  the 2000 version sifi channel version was a lot better than the 1984 movie  this latest version felt a lot like lawrence of arabia a grand movie but slow moving with some action a lot of scene changes characters being introduced and you do not get a true feeling for who they are    i have never read the books maybe that would give me a better appreciation for the two movies  but this is deeper than most star wars movies which tend  to be a fun ride lord of the rings was epic dune is about sand and spice it is not everything nice  but the visuals were fantastic
Mar 11 2024,positive,one of the best movies ever made
Mar 11 2024,positive,never loved a movie enough to give it a rating due part ll was a masterpiece
Mar 11 2024,positive,this is what movies are supposed to be
Mar 11 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie thoroughly wished it was a little longer which might sound crazy now worth the watch in dolby atmos movie theater
Mar 11 2024,positive,visually stunning but may be hard to follow if youre not familiar with the story outline
Mar 11 2024,positive,dune 2 was everything i expected and more for a sequel to an equally brilliant film our local amc theater was also top notch highly recommended
Mar 11 2024,positive,one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history hands down
Mar 11 2024,positive,this is a big theater movie but story and story telling will work on your home entertainment systems as well admittedly i am not one of the readers is the books but this tells so much more than the 80s dune one of the best shot films in a long time
Mar 11 2024,positive,its a very good film well paced good character development not overly complex and a production value that blows other scifi films out the water this is high quality work i particularly like that the big war scene is kept simple exciting but not overlong the drawback for me was the length for a simple tale all based in the desert it feels arduous to stay awake throughout i took a few closed eye moments to get through i cant question the quality of the film though very good watched at the o2 arena cineworld
Mar 11 2024,positive,great cinematography great action
Mar 11 2024,positive,great cgi special effects but the script is somewhat of a disappointment book adaptations always are a distortion of the original story what is in the script is brilliantly executed the ending suggests a chapter 3 children of dune all about alia and leto jessicas unborn twins
Mar 11 2024,positive,i havent stopped thinking about it for 3 days it may be visually the best looking film i have ever seen absolutely gorgeous set pieces and production design great balance between practical sets and vfx not that you can even tell the difference with how well done this film is it was a great continuation of the story that went in some unexpected and exciting directions i havent read the books so not sure how faithful of an adaptation it is but if anything was changed or left out that was in the books villeneuve made the right call in doing so because it was a full and complete vision for a cinematic audience the long run time to me did not feel excessive or drawn out paid equal attention to action plot and story making it well balanced all of the acting was great it was played by the actors and set up by the direction so that even in such a dense story suspension of disbelief was not really challenging because of how immersive this universe is and how well flushed out the story and characters were wish i could have seen in imax but definitely a film to see in the theater really hope the third one assuming it will be green lit sticks the landing just incredible
Mar 11 2024,positive,denis villeneuves unique aesthetic and cinematographic language beautifully portray the beauty of the sands of arrakis hans zimmers soundtrack takes the combination of visuals and auditory experience to an unparalleled height dune may not be suitable for everyone in this fastpaced society but it precisely reminds us of the true meaning of enjoying blockbuster films in theatres
Mar 11 2024,positive,masterpiece its everything star wars wishes it could be take note disney
Mar 11 2024,positive,if you like the first movie then youll love the second one much more action pack than the first great directing storyline musicit was worth the movie ticket price
Mar 11 2024,positive,incredible visuals help drive this epic scifi experience denis villeneuve expertly crafts an amazing story about love vs destiny hope vs faith and honor vs duty the score cinematography and sound are all top tier easily one of the best films of the last 20 years
Mar 11 2024,positive,cannot believe how good this was pleasing the cult core fans of dune bookslore and then also surpassing expectations of an average commercial viewer seems nearly impossible and yet denis villeneuve does it remarkable saw it twice in the first two weeks just to unpack the amount of plot and action they gave us will need to see it two more times just to fully appreciate the insane visual and musical artistry of every scene
Mar 11 2024,positive,the movie was well done overall  it did depart from the novel towards the end
Mar 11 2024,negative,terrible movie very boring and two main actors young guy and girl  were awful  glad my gf bought the tickets and i did not waste money on this
Mar 11 2024,positive,awesome spectacle in imax especially i pity anyone who doesnt see the brilliance in the movie making here truly fantastic adaptation of an incredible book
Mar 11 2024,positive,amazing even better than the 1st watch in imax laser if you can
Mar 11 2024,positive,aside from some minor changes diverting from the books the dune movies are loyal to the source material and beautifully shot
Mar 11 2024,positive,christopher walken again yeah sure why not great actor  but am i the only wanting him to say it come on christopher say it  you know i flew across the galaxy to get here honestly the place could use more sandworm as a matter of fact i got a fever and the only prescription is more sandworm he never did  speaking of sandworms i was hoping for more character development for the sandworms maybe a table scene like in reservoir dogs where they discuss tipping  i still dont know their likes dislikes what motivates them next movie creating guysgive us more sandworm  one more gripe wheres the heart plugs not the first dam heart plug  honestly though it was ok i wouldnt drool over it like some of the reviews it was good but not that great wait for it to come out on vhs yeah i know
Mar 11 2024,positive,if this move is not 1010 then no other is it is closest to perfection as you can get
Mar 11 2024,positive,i have been waiting for part 2 after seeing dune part 1  in one word magisterial  the filming done  as i observed in a kind of tan like the sand filming music and really exceptional acting completed a truly outstanding movie timothy shalamee is simply perfect as is javier bardem
Mar 11 2024,positive,watched dune part 2 at a imax cinema i honestly think this movie is a cinematic masterpiece but thats just my opinion of course
Mar 11 2024,positive,started strong went long kind of peetered out imho  different movie from the first one much more action solid well played love story with strong chemistry overall entertaining
Mar 11 2024,positive,awesome  perfect music  great acting
Mar 11 2024,positive,gorgeous cinematography powerful score and starstudded cast make for an excellent science fiction movie dune part two provides an excellent adaptation of the classic book and transports viewers to arrakis the dialogue is mostly serious and plotdriven but there are some humorous moments the action scenes are wellchoreographed and every scene is shot in such a way that the viewer can actually see and understand what is happening the stylistic choices are bold and the costumes are gaudy my only critique is that the pacing is occasionally a bit slow in the movies efforts to transport you to the desert overall i would recommend dune part two for fans of science fiction movies
Mar 11 2024,positive,hate endings that obviously set you up for another installment
Mar 11 2024,positive,beautifully filmed the movie dragged on at a very slow pace with many pensive moments furrowed brows and long pauses  moments that should have been exciting werent  still it was entertaining so three stars
Mar 11 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen at the cinema recommended for anyone who has been disappointed by the cinema sector in recent years
Mar 11 2024,positive,although i didnt understand who what where when and how i had no idea who was fighting against who what the battle was about or who was fighting for what it was just a mishmash but the cinematography and the effects were superb thats the only reason why kept me in the movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,epic fantasy sci fi at its best casting was flawless
Mar 11 2024,positive,cinematography musical score and story are fantastic
Mar 11 2024,positive,the movie was a touch too long
Mar 11 2024,positive,its the best film of the year acting photography direction  dune part two is pure gold 
Mar 11 2024,negative,i really tried to enjoy it i will give it another chance when it comes out on film  at this point it was just a dissapointment im glad those of you enjoyed it did apart from the beautiful visuals and spine tingling music it was just not the dune i know it was a shade of what dune is
Mar 11 2024,positive,a masterpiece maybe the best scifi movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot
Mar 11 2024,positive,graphics were absolutely amazing  the acting was top shelf too
Mar 11 2024,positive,the empire strikes back of my generation
Mar 11 2024,positive,beautiful to look at and entertaining in every moment
Mar 11 2024,positive,the cinematography and sound score alone make it worth the almost 3 hour mark runtime the story telling is impeccable and the performances are remarkable dont miss out on a classic
Mar 11 2024,positive,zendaya is amazing as is all the other actor  fantastic cast fanatic movie loved every minute story come alive and sucks you it thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 11 2024,positive,very similar to the first movie in both its strengths and weaknesses fantastic visuals music and sound but a story that feels like its building and building and building and then just kind of leaves you hanging for the next part to be fair i do think there is a bit more resolution in this one and chalamets character arc becomes more interesting but i think i wont be able to properly rate these movies until i know the full story i am definitely excited for part 3 though
Mar 11 2024,positive,the scenes are more dramatically and beautifully choreographed than in the previous edition taking place in various settings that include shootouts above dunes and gladiatorial fights at house harkonnens massive colosseum  besides such extremely longshot battle scenes the directors portrayal of paul learning to summon sandworms that snake through a sandstorm toward their prey is a spectacle  and a major reason the movie must be watched in imax  the scale of the film creates an overwhelming sense as does the message throughout the film a heros victory might just make the universe even uglier it says  chalamet displays a detailed wide range in his portrayal of a young mans cautious rise to power  including the intensity of his worries and childlike loneliness in front of his true love chani zendaya  in a universe dominated by inhumanity the director contains pauls changing emotions in a tight shot a clear contrast to the pale bald harkonnen and the ruthless gaze of the violent prince feydrautha austin butler the visual palette becomes bleached in monochrome in the switch to feydrauthas story away from paul and chani making an illuminating comparison
Mar 11 2024,positive,it was a masterpiece
Mar 11 2024,positive,great scenery great acting some deviation from the original storyline was disappointing  great worm riding though my favorite scenes
Mar 11 2024,positive,how scifi movies are supposed to be made how stories are supposed to be told
Mar 11 2024,positive,ridiculously amazing
Mar 11 2024,positive,great storyline superb vfx and phenomenal visuals make for a fantastic moviegoing experience
Mar 11 2024,positive,this is the best movie i have ever seen in my life im 47 so i seen a lot of movies
Mar 11 2024,positive,epic gorgeously shot film beautiful cinematography and splendid wide camera shots throughout it really felt like i was there experiencing it and not just passively watching even the sound and score gave me that sense of being there it was allencompassing    in an age where we have been inundated with cgi fest monstrosities this was definitely a breath of some much rather needed fresh air
Mar 11 2024,neutral,cinematically beautiful but it seems there is so much left out even the 1984 movie at least gives you the scope of things i feel this missed the mark and will be remade in 10 years  zendaya ruins her parts whole thing seems off somehow
Mar 11 2024,positive,best movie ive seen since i can remember maybe since lotr
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie is so epic you gotta watch it on imax the screen play is a work of art love every minute of it
Mar 11 2024,positive,it was cool to watch in theatres but was too long and slow but it was interesting and i thought it was alright
Mar 11 2024,positive,exactly what i was hoping for in a sequel
Mar 11 2024,positive,the best way i could describe this sequel is it being a cinematic masterpiece its such a cliche thing to say but the truth of the matter is everyone in the cast has exceptional chemistry the color palettes and sceneries were gorgeous the sounds and music matched expertly to the tones there were so many emotional moments it is such an improvement from the 1st installment and id say its the best sequel in film history next to empire strikes back see the film in theaters please i want a 3rd installment
Mar 11 2024,positive,outstanding finish to the first part of the dune story  the acting effects and cinematography are all over the top even better than the first half  you must see this movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,last movie that made me feel this way was return of the king simply amazing
Mar 11 2024,positive,didnt even feel like a 3 hour movie cant wait for  3
Mar 11 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i just might go watch it again
Mar 11 2024,positive,definitely the most goose bumps ive gotten from a movie in a long while
Mar 11 2024,positive,i think it must be one of the most spectacular movies ever made i am very familiar with the story and certainly enjoyed the movie however i do think it might be a little hard to follow if you werent familiar with the story  i saw it twice in two days once imax which was a great experience although really loud then the next day i saw it on screenx which was disappointing by comparison curious about the 4dx experience
Mar 11 2024,positive,great cinematic experience  visuals are stunning  and theres a lot more plot in this installment  good performances by entire cast  my only critique is there was some odd jumping in the films timeline  overall i really enjoyed this  45 stars
Mar 11 2024,positive,great movie for an afternoons entertainment loved the special effects
Mar 11 2024,positive,well worth the wait 
Mar 11 2024,positive,excellent follow up to the first one much more enjoyable and engaging special effects are great def recommend
Mar 11 2024,positive,amazing cant wait for the 3rd
Mar 11 2024,positive,everything about this movie the story the actors the scenes everything was appealing to the eye heart and mind so good
Mar 11 2024,positive,the last time i remember this feeling was probably seeing the star wars prequels in theaters and it dawned on me because space operas and fantasy series of this scale are such a onceinageneration occurrence as an adaptation this truly is a monumental feat to pull off that is done deftly paring down what needs to be sliced modernizing aspects that make it more palatable and maintaining the gravitas of what makes scifi so mesmerizing with stellar performances cinematography and music the only thing that would make this a fivestar film is that once all three are out we will likely all realize how much better they flow together by being able to watch them at once
Mar 11 2024,negative,you must be high to watch this movie and even then its a stretch 3 hours for maximum 5 minutes of action top 10 worst movies of 2024 and the year just started you get the idea dont waste your time i fell asleep on 3 separate occasions if theres a dune 3 we have failed as a country 
Mar 11 2024,positive,amazing movie best movie this year by far and im obsessed and want part 3 right now ive seen this movie 2 times and recommend imax for best experience and highly recommend for any movie lover and sci fi lover
Mar 11 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic visuals and sound must see it in the imax theater
Mar 11 2024,positive,cinema perfection id see it again
Mar 11 2024,positive,saw it but all i could think of was if you in fact started to ride one of those sandworms  how would you get off  like  the worm would stop and then youd get a ladder or youd just jump
Mar 11 2024,positive,the female love interest didnt have any significance nor a connection with the lead actor the picture is beautiful but it ran slow with some action there was a few moments that werent explained well or at all overall its a decent movie to watch
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie was amazing great sequel very rare 
Mar 11 2024,positive,absolutely incredible movie i have a horrible attention span but found myself captivated by the film all the way through the imagery was beautiful i got so into it i went home and bought the book series right after seeing the movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,dont get me wrong i enjoyed the movie just didnt love it like i wanted too so im guessing theres going to be a part three too many unanswered questions
Mar 11 2024,positive,the single greatest scifi movie ever
Mar 11 2024,positive,absolutely electrifying the visuals were out of this world costume design was on point and music and sound effects were amazing i cant wait to see it for a second time and a third
Mar 11 2024,positive,epic filmmaking  deni can do no wrong   him nolan and cameron are folks whose movies i will never miss
Mar 11 2024,positive,loved it  great cinematography  it would be a crime to watch this film on the small screen   the sound in he theater was awesome for this magnificent film
Mar 11 2024,positive,bro this movie is actually so good the cinematography the acting so good i felt like i was there too i wanna sand walk now thia movie is actually so good i recommend it 100
Mar 11 2024,positive,great movie special effects are on point great acting as well a must see
Mar 11 2024,positive,i have read the book sometime ago so i watched dune before i went to dune 2  dune 2 was excellent  i thoroughly enjoyed it well done im k m
Mar 11 2024,positive,very exciting never a dill moment i recommend seeing it
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie will stand against time it is revolutionary never been done before the director sets a bar that even artificial intelligence will have to compete with and will probably lose this movie is extraordinary  a masterpiece  epic is an understatement its world changing its deeply moving and spiritual you have to check it out
Mar 11 2024,positive,dune 2 is a fully immersive and sprawling scifi epic with awesome moments of scifi action and theological intrigue spread throughout an organically paced buildup to the romantic coupling of its two leads who succeed at bringing the audience along for the ride albeit the meticulously crafted storytelling does lead to what feels like a rushed climax a common criticism of the original film as well despite the inevitable issue with the ending this film has it all and i sense many repeat viewings in my future  new favourite scifi movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,if the first one was good this one is amazing i actually got chills watching the movie at how awesome alot of the scenes are
Mar 11 2024,positive,the movie was so good i didnt want to go to the bathroom the cast was exceptional austin butler was perfect the cinematography was breathtaking
Mar 11 2024,positive,plot 8510 visuals 1010 acting 910
Mar 11 2024,positive,absolutely mind blowing
Mar 11 2024,positive,good movie but was bit longer than it needed to be
Mar 11 2024,positive,never been so enthralled by a film have already seen it twice in the theater it is just that good
Mar 11 2024,positive,owen kims performance in dune 2 was absolute perfection like pure cinema an absolute classic owen has done it once again
Mar 11 2024,positive,dune 2 captivates with its stunning visuals adrenalinepumping action sequences and an unforgettable score complemented by outstanding performances from timothée chalamet and austin butler making it a modern scifi classic
Mar 11 2024,positive,i am a fan of the books and the movie i will not pretend to be a critic so here is my review this  movie was mind blowing awesome
Mar 11 2024,positive,way too long not enough story to justify a 245 run time
Mar 11 2024,positive,excellent storytelling  a great sequel to the first movie filled with action drama and a nice setup for a third installment
Mar 11 2024,positive,epic sweeping cinematography and story finally the book series has a worthy onscreen telling
Mar 11 2024,positive,denis villeneuve manages to assemble a compelling tale at a scale that is unfathomable utilizing its scale to deliver bombastic spectacle the likes have not been seen but still able to execute story beats with laser precision somehow able to juggle various characters locations and plot elements with no stutters or faults the performances are sensational with austin butler and javier bardem as the real standouts both chewing up the scenery leaving an impression in every scene they are in the action is high flying kinetic energy and the world feels as if it right there just a split second from falling into the dunes of arrakis and at the center is a cautionary tale about prophecies foresight and a chosen one but when hanz simmer score blares as we see paul rise its hard not cheer quite frankly a masterpiece
Mar 11 2024,positive,great action packed movie wish ending wrapped up better
Mar 11 2024,positive,cinematic were awesome great movie
Mar 11 2024,positive,amazing movie ive seen it twice now and ill see it as many times as i can while its still in theaters ive read all the dune books by frank herbert and i think the way the writers have adapted the story to film is brilliant the acting the cinematography the amazing visuals the whole thing is just so exciting to watch and experience cant wait for the next one
Mar 11 2024,positive,most probably the best movie ever made
Mar 11 2024,positive,this is dune this is an every most faithful recreation of dune its an epic in epic proportions it is beautiful and action filled it has a cohesive plot this is what i hoped it could be and so much more if this is what people think of first when i mention frank herberts dune then i would be happy
Mar 10 2024,positive,improved over the first one exciting story the duration flies by
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was an epic scifi feature with topnotch effects but the directors changes to the story were disappointing  he effectively removed the supernatural aspect of paul he portrayed him as just a man with a minor gift of precognition and his followers as ignorant idiots believing in a messiah not the demigod his character should have become  they completely removed the space guilds and the navigators and left a hollow shell  they could have made his drinking of the water of life epic but instead just had him take a nap  so disappointing
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was as good as the first part
Mar 10 2024,positive,storyline was interesting and kept moving no lags i enjoyed the recognizable actors and the end leaves you wanting more
Mar 10 2024,positive,a beautifully crafted adaptation of herberts series only to be seen in imax for the full experience
Mar 10 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece doesnt follow the book completely but shows a lot more action plot twist that changed the story beautifully amazingly placed dune in conversation has a high chance of being the best film of 2024
Mar 10 2024,positive,loved the overall feel of the movie  it is long but i never got bored  lots of action and world building  some deviation from the book but still faithful to the original story  hope they make dune messiah  the music did get too loud during the killing of the baron my only dislike you could not hear what muhadib was saying
Mar 10 2024,positive,when you give a really good director really good source material you are bound to get something great so that was not a surprise however what was a surprise was the fact that this has me liking this interpretation of dune more than the book i think this version is much more clear about its warning of blindly following messiac figures  910 cant wait to see how they wrap it up
Mar 10 2024,positive,this is how great movies are supposed to make you feel pleasantly overcome with nostalgia visually satisfying obsessed with the story
Mar 10 2024,positive,all i really have to say is believe the hype this movie is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish visually stunning and great acting all around from the fantastic cast already stands as my favorite movie of the year so far
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie is so good its unbelievable i heard it was great but i had no idea it was gonna be that great you got to see this in the theaters to really appreciate it   highly recommend this movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing many many goosebumps were summoned whilst watching this masterpiece
Mar 10 2024,positive,even when it veered from the book it was wellthought  and worked in the timeframe great cinematography sound and development of characters
Mar 10 2024,positive,best sci fi film of the year
Mar 10 2024,positive,as it was written
Mar 10 2024,positive,masterpiece from start to finish unraveling a epic drama filled with archetypal imagery and meaning one of the greatest movies of all time
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was easier to understand the storyline and if you read book one you knew what was left out and where storyline was jumped  the battles were loud
Mar 10 2024,positive,too much focus on action and too little on the mystical aspects but the photography and the cg was amazing
Mar 10 2024,positive,amazing better than the 1st even though that was a great movie also
Mar 10 2024,positive,scifi at its best glad i went to the theatre and saw it on the big screen
Mar 10 2024,positive,ending seemed rushed but overall great movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,a classic in the making
Mar 10 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece exceptional visuals character portrayals and an incredible plot
Mar 10 2024,positive,such a jammed packed film bravo to the cast  crew past and present for making an incredible picture
Mar 10 2024,positive,i mean what a movie a must watch in imax
Mar 10 2024,negative,borefest  looked lovely sounded amazing  shame it couldnt keep me awake  the best part was making an excuse to go to the bathroom halfway through  just cant believe i spent 40 for 2 to sit through this tripe
Mar 10 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has managed to finally create a true dune blockbuster which is touching the hearts and minds of the american mainstream in a way ive never seen in my lifetime while i have some quibbles about characterization and form every complaint is met and surpassed by stellar acting sound design and overall visual appeal weve got people on board time to reel them in for dune messiah where it really goes weird
Mar 10 2024,positive,ok wow  heart pounding intense dramatic its a must see movie for 2024 
Mar 10 2024,positive,cant handle the cliff hangers
Mar 10 2024,positive,dune 2 was a completely engaging movie the scenery was outstanding the costumes were just right and the music helped tell and drive the story the pacing and editing were excellent a slow burn driving the story perfectly a lot was communicated by the body acting of the actors not needing dialogue to understand the point  outstanding i may see it again in the theater
Mar 10 2024,positive,very close to the book
Mar 10 2024,positive,absolutely stunning a must see at the cinema
Mar 10 2024,positive,first class acting cinematography special effects and the writing complimented or stayed true from start to finish kept our attention through the entire extended length too if youre a science fiction fan or a dune fani highly recommend seeing part 2
Mar 10 2024,positive,easily one of the best movies ive ever seen  even better then the first
Mar 10 2024,positive,fantastic i liked  the first part and part two was 100 better saw it on a full sized imax screen and that is the way to see this movie the visuals were stunning the story was a great interpretation of the source did not feel like it was a 2hr 40m run time
Mar 10 2024,positive,really sets the story in a more dramatic way with more of the elements being introduced and shown very good adaption
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie was amazing 
Mar 10 2024,positive,visually and audibly impressive i enjoyed the first act did not like the second and the third was ok i am not a scifi fan in particular maybe that is why as i know everyone seems to love this one i just found it boring some good performances though worth checking out to form your own opinion
Mar 10 2024,neutral,unnecessarily long and boring actually took a nap for 5 mins went to the bathroom and got some snacks boring and overhyped
Mar 10 2024,positive,the best scifi franchise of all time
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was a wonderful movie and i just want to see them do more with the series
Mar 10 2024,positive,an absolute cinematic masterpiece great for scifi fans and anyone who appreciates artfully crafted yet actionpacked films
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was a solid adventure and science fiction movie that closely followed frank herberts science fiction novel of the 1970s      if you like science fiction galactic wars this is a very good movie if you hadnt read the novels the story is sometimes hard to follow there is a lot of violence
Mar 10 2024,positive,must see we are literally witnessing a movie trilogy as epic as the lotr playing out before our very own eyes cant wait for dune messiah
Mar 10 2024,positive,visually breathtaking where dune part 1 is more of a set up story dune part 2 makes no mistakes when executing on the stage its put on plenty of action character depth and incredible delivery of a story many are familiar with from the sagas writer frank herbert from what i understand dune part 2 largely completes the first dune book and sets up the story told in dune messiah and will complete paul atreides story arc what an arc it is from a film adaptation dune part 2 will go down as one of the goat adaptations with its incredible scale and equal focus on depth and polish a mustsee in theaters if you get the chance just dont watch this on a small screen and without good audio  everything is an experience in dune part 2
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie you want to watch at the theatre amazing  cinematography
Mar 10 2024,positive,the visuals are fantastic the script and the accents not so much highlight the sandworm gallop
Mar 10 2024,positive,epic simple as that
Mar 10 2024,positive,great cinematography fairly true to the book   i brought younger kids 810 as we had watched part 1 at home  it was definitely a bit more violent and graphic than we would have liked even for a pg13 movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,o m g i think its the best movie ive ever seen
Mar 10 2024,positive,epic i know theres sniveling about departures from the books but oh well it happens with all great works dont go if you cant get over it a masterpiece and this is from someone who has read all five books three times throughout my life 3
Mar 10 2024,positive,definitely delivered to the hype
Mar 10 2024,negative,yawn this is the last superhero or scifi movie made by a big company that ill ever allow myself to be dragged to modern  mainstream cinema just isnt very good anymore this movie was very boring with a few cool scenes but overall was just really contrived theres nothing great about it its just that modern films are so bad that this seems good but it really isnt
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was really good with lots of action and intensity
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie followed the story line of the book quite well  special effects were very good the transition of one of the main characters paul from young idealist to skilled and ambitious leader was well done also well done acting to zendaya
Mar 10 2024,positive,visually a slay story wise a slay everything is a slay
Mar 10 2024,positive,three hours in and i was afraid it would end a masterpiece
Mar 10 2024,positive,fantastic on every level
Mar 10 2024,positive,a lot of special effects fighting and beautiful vistas not so much storyline  i got bored
Mar 10 2024,positive,this was great chalamet killed it zendaya was meh but nothing terrible they did the books justice
Mar 10 2024,positive,exciting movie fantastic acting

Mar 10 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie as it unfolded a captivating narrative where the fremen deeply committed to paul extend their allegiance to the point of initiating a holy war across the vast expanse of the galaxy after he ascends the throne in the aftermath pauls followers zealously carry out this cosmic crusade in his name resulting in the tragic loss of lives for those who resist accepting him as a divine being this gripping culmination unfolds at the very end of dune adding a layer of complexity and intensity to the storyline

Mar 10 2024,positive,such a great movie  my only complaint is not knowing how long until part 3 comes out
Mar 10 2024,positive,if youre a fan this movie did not disappointincredible cinematic displays and the soundtrack really had you feeling the intensity of each scene
Mar 10 2024,positive,zendayas character was annoying as hell her character had mood swings throughout the whole movie tone of the movie was sporadic  concept of the movie is great but the writing and dialogue was underdeveloped
Mar 10 2024,positive,great acting effects and story beautifully made  if you loved the book you will love part 2
Mar 10 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece  the story the acting the sound and visuals are on another level  finally a film that deserves the title epic
Mar 10 2024,positive,dune 2 was intense at times and took surprising turns
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie is one of the most incredible movies i have ever seen in my life the story pauls character arc the cinematography the acting the soundtrack it was just perfect from the beginning to end
Mar 10 2024,positive,i have to see it again i have thoughts but well played mr villanueve
Mar 10 2024,positive,it is a fittingly spectacular climax to the story i like how grand the movie is while simultaneously making the viewer question whether its triumphant or ominous dune part 2 has great choreography and combined with villeneuves eye and zimmers score becomes an exceptional cinematic experience like its source material the story is more intellectual than emotional which might not be everyones preference but i like that it feels different from other grand fantasyscifi stories
Mar 10 2024,positive,ever finished a movie and sat in silence for the remainder of the credits same story here one of the best movies ive ever watched i literally do not have a single complaint about this movie it took me 3 hours to start working the night after watching as i had to read more about it    dune messiah cant come soon enough
Mar 10 2024,positive,dune part 2 is one of the most incredible experiences ive had when it comes to cinema i read the book when i was a younger man and to see frank herberts vision come to life is beyond explanation dune is a massive story and im proud of the work denis villeneuve put into this cinematic masterpiece thank you
Mar 10 2024,positive,excellent movie better than the first one  must be seen in the theater because of the cinematic experience 4k  dolby atmos  its a long movie but but its worth it
Mar 10 2024,negative,dune part 2 was the most expensive nap ive taken in a couple of months even with all of the loud sound effects the movie just did not capture my imagination
Mar 10 2024,positive,action packed  better than part one
Mar 10 2024,positive,im glad dune finally has a truly epic and outstanding movie adaptation this film and the one before it carried such an incredible burden of expectations and as a pair they mostly deliver there is just such a dense plot to dune and they struggle to pull it all together that said the films are still great the acting in dune part 2 is great and the visuals are astonishing the pure imagination at play is an incredible sight to behold dune part 2 is intelligently modernized too in terms of some of the more problematic themes of the novel and some of the characters especially chani are given much more depth and much more meaningful roles some characters are lost altogether to make room for everything but i believe the choices made were all good and in service of telling a better story the movie is a bit awkward in the way it tries to join so many complex pieces together but that doesnt mean you shouldnt see it you absolutely should
Mar 10 2024,positive,dbox seats totally worth it actual cinemaon par with lotr star wars etc cast score crew op in a real desert directing camera work all top scores  i cant wait for part 3 hopefully they dont make us wait too long    my only gripe was the scene where the spice tankers were taken out they have to get up close to take it out but minutes later they use a laser beam to blow it up easy and later in the movie during the montage they do that also so what was the point of that whole sequence maybe i missed something
Mar 10 2024,positive,absolutely breathtaking beautiful masterpiece especially on an imax screen wow hands down one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life 
Mar 10 2024,positive,such great scifi all of time
Mar 10 2024,positive,although this movie seemed to be the same as the first one at first the high tempo of the movie in the second half put the movie one click ahead of the first one for me the visuals are still tremendous as in the first movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was the best science fiction ive ever seen   once in a lifetime experience
Mar 10 2024,negative,this movie was super long the movie was also very boring
Mar 10 2024,positive,not as good as part one the sound and visuals are excellent but the story feels rushed and disconnected in places christopher walken is badly cast and almost laughable as the emporer
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was perfect every just perfect down the last minute detail
Mar 10 2024,positive,its a cinematic masterpiece   no words to say all time favourite

Mar 10 2024,positive,honestly i never give a review but i think this movie deserves it it was truly brilliant the actionthe acting the climax was all par excellence i recommend everyone to  watch it in the cinemas it deserves it
Mar 10 2024,positive,well made film i was hoping for an unopened ending but i understand that there is potential for more films based on the novels available if they maintain a high level of quality as this version of dune 1 and 2 have thats not a big deal keep this level of writing directing and acting goes through or you will lose me
Mar 10 2024,positive,great film cant wait for the next film

Mar 10 2024,positive,overall a worthy sequel and a great sci fi movie the only problem i have is that i didnt understood how some characters developed also some of the characters didnt get enough screan time
Mar 10 2024,positive,great effects in all aspects lacks of timming for feelings like love sadness or acceptance story is so lineal like marvel movies  lack of complexity its a good movie but nothing compared to star wars or lotr
Mar 10 2024,positive,this will go down as one of the great sequels of all time you know the movie is good when youre still thinking about it hours later props to the cast and crew for this absolute classic

Mar 10 2024,positive,absolute must see acting was great the movie flowed well i was never bored and when the ending came i wanted more the action sequences hit hard there were moments that as a viewer i connected to the characters on a personal levelthe romantic scenes were emotional but the ending was heartbreaking and tragic
Mar 10 2024,positive,terrifying and stunning music
Mar 10 2024,positive,even better than part one thank you
Mar 10 2024,positive,wow the best scifi movie ive ever seen hands down what a visual masterpiece and the score easily one of hans zimmers best works absolutely breathtaking for the entirety of the duration of the movie absolutely loved it this is the benchmark now
Mar 10 2024,positive,a visual masterpiece on a whole nother level wow
Mar 10 2024,neutral,aka beige 2 revenge of the beige  better than part one yes but mostly just because someone seems to have sat behind the director and slapped him every time he tried to use slow motion the plot is predictable and a very poorly disguised allegory that doesnt make sense these days the fremen are clearly the worlds worst freedom fighters given that they seem to have better weapons than the spacefaring armies who just fight with swords for some reason and poor florence pugh just gets put in a series of worse and worse head pieces seemingly designed to make her look more and more like she has a condom on her head
Mar 10 2024,positive,amazing cinematography spectacular digital effects and fabulous acting
Mar 10 2024,positive,the movie we needed  a real movie gorgeous visuals brilliant acting excellent pacing everything borderline perfection    thank you i needed this

Mar 10 2024,positive,one of the best movie theater experiences ive had in my life unbelievable cast filming and visuals you need to see this
Mar 10 2024,positive,ill be watching it a third time
Mar 10 2024,positive,a spectacular adaptation that is a milestone in the scifi genre dune part 2 takes an almost impossible to adapt source material and shapes it into cinema magic
Mar 10 2024,positive,great adaptation  soundtrack is amazing
Mar 10 2024,positive,i thought it was very well made overall from the acting timothée chalamet in particular was really great and the details of each scene it was incredibly enjoyable it did not feel like three hours
Mar 10 2024,positive,fantastic when does part 3 come out special effects fantastic  fight scenes very convincing great acting cinematography was beautiful

Mar 10 2024,positive,several changes to source but maintains the tone and themes of herberts book some of the best shot design ive seen in years almost every wide shot is awe inspiring
Mar 10 2024,positive,impressive visuals but insufficient scheming and plotting felt merely action
Mar 10 2024,positive,best scifi fantasy since lotr 1010
Mar 10 2024,positive,this movie was full of dialogue and incredible visuals one of the best performances from all actors incredible powerful sounds and scenes the editing on this film was breathtaking i left needing to ruminate all the things i saw in this movie really incredible
Mar 10 2024,negative,if you are a fan of the book 1st you may not like this movie  the movie changes  the influence of pauls sister and the relationship with chani and their child that they lose due to the enemy attack the movie ends where the book ended but the relationship between paul and chani is not canon to the book where are they going with the story if there is a sequel
Mar 10 2024,positive,absolutely excellent from the scenery the outfits but the actors shine timothee chalamet does so well in this character every actor is award winning in this movie cant wait for dune 3

Mar 10 2024,positive,one of the best movie science fiction to be honest much better than star wars i hope to see it part 3 
Mar 10 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has brought the incredible novel to the screen the only way it couldve been while there are some big differences it nearperfectly adapts the book based on herberts original theme of a cautionary tale for messianic figures add in the incredible score filmographycinematography and powerful acting by an amazing cast this movie is one of the closest possible to perfect
Mar 10 2024,positive,awesome movie and great acting cant wait to see the next one
Mar 10 2024,positive,you must watch in the theater to get a sense of how vast arrakis is the desert is so beautiful and the acting was great lots of worldbuilding to get a feel for a futuristic alien world and alien culture i cant wait to see part three
Mar 10 2024,positive,story line acting and purposeful graphics
Mar 10 2024,positive,extremely well done in a grand manner  great acting pacing and action sequences  makes me want to read the book
Mar 10 2024,positive,i thought it was good different then the original
Mar 10 2024,neutral,yes visually a nice film  overall i was kind of bored  it is not a film i will think much more about  i guess i am not geeky enough to understand it
Mar 10 2024,positive,the story continues to engage and even surprise you from the original at the same time conveying this detailed and complex tale can become tedious task as a fan of the 80s original im all in and ready for part 3
Mar 10 2024,negative,im a zendaya fan which is why i went to see dune 2 todayi wish i hadnt went    the hollywood moguls no doubt paid the critics a 1000 bucks eachto say wonderful things about this snooze fest    if u want sand bad cgi and heavy breathing and facial contortions oh and more sand in the place of a good story and captivating acting then go see this thing  i have again wasted my time and money on yet another stinker this year     jason stathamliam neeson and dwayne the rock johnson thank you for entertaining me in the past and please come out with something soon to save me from these bad movies being forced on the public since early 2023      by the way denis villeneuve the director should be arrested and thrown in jailhe apparently had sand in his eyes while attempting to direct
Mar 10 2024,positive,while not perfect i was entertained and felt the story was a closer adaptation than the previous attempt in the 80s
Mar 10 2024,positive,a sequel is meant to up the ante and dune part two accomplishes this by expanding on themes of colonization faith and more with largerscale action and a broader scope
Mar 10 2024,positive,written extraordinarily must watch
Mar 10 2024,positive,movie was slow and too long
Mar 10 2024,positive,very well developed and intense
Mar 10 2024,negative,paul is bland almost robotic tone basically only changes when hes yelling timothy is the worst actor to play paul    chani deviated to much from books previous movies and lacks trustfaith in paul chanis first child didnt happened either    pauls sister wasnt born by the end
Mar 10 2024,positive,great use of color and cinematography for story telling and world building
Mar 10 2024,positive,must see on a large screen actors draw you in the scenes are surreal

Mar 10 2024,positive,not a perfect film but considering the sorry state of current hollywood dune is far better than we had any right to expect
Mar 10 2024,negative,boring boring boring made me fall asleep
Mar 10 2024,negative,movie was awesome however it was probably 7882 in the theater ill admit it was immersive bc of the heat but at 20 a ticket i expect to be comfortable also not sure why lynnhaven 18 has poverty seating in all of their imax theaters
Mar 10 2024,positive,masterpiece cast cgi world building directing score ive seen it twice
Mar 10 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in years   hits it out of the park on all aspects of what makes a great movie  a beautiful and subtle refined script that with few words and wonderful acting and directing successfully portrays the layered interacting complexities of culture character power religion leadership and mass movements with the added aspects of new planet ecologies and the marvelous blend of futuristic technologies in battle scenes that includes old fashioned knife fights and monstrous sand worms   then there is the pitch perfect musicsound track amazing scenic vistas and meticulous film craft  go see this movie even if you are not a science fiction fanyou will not be disappointed
Mar 10 2024,positive,must see in imax the sound the visual effects are stunning awesome movie the filmmakers did a great job telling the story i felt like i was in the movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,great movie very action packed and picked up from the last movie right away

Mar 10 2024,positive,awesome unique loved every second of it was sad it had to end
Mar 10 2024,positive,a breathtaking spectacle with a strongly beating heart heartily recommend it for the performances and for the message
Mar 10 2024,positive,finally a movie to go watch at the big screen and didnt disappoint  action packkkkkkkkkk ready for part 3
Mar 10 2024,positive,for the most it was pretty good until the ending part i im seeing why they have so many sequels it put you in the same frame of mine as the star wars movies just to create other story lines a movie night soap opera for the big screens yet it was worth seeing
Mar 10 2024,positive,must watchgreat time
Mar 10 2024,positive,amazing movie  the theater was way to loud tho but awesome graphic
Mar 10 2024,positive,absolutely amazing film
Mar 10 2024,positive,amazing movie best theatrical experience ive had in my life
Mar 10 2024,negative,what i liked  it finally came to an end  what i disliked that i paid money to sit through it the script was stupid the acting was bad the special effects were not special and it was 3 hours
Mar 10 2024,positive,a masterpiece for the ages
Mar 10 2024,positive,best film i have ever seen at the theatre absolutely remarkable
Mar 10 2024,positive,definitely better than 1 cant wait for 3 great movie set the standers for 2024
Mar 10 2024,positive,i have so much to say about dune part two but i am gobsmacked after watching it and struggle to write something at the moment that will do it justice let me just say this dune part two is the best scifi movie ever made     by saying that im ignoring an apples vs oranges argument that some scifi movies are probably too different to compare so ill try to lay out my case by comparing dune part two to the four scifi movies that i think are the cream of the crop for scifi movies set in space     2001 a space odyssey  this is 1 on many lists it was groundbreaking and epic due to technical achievements cinematography and a fascinating story by arthur c clarke but dune outperforms 2001 in all those categories and its never boring     alien  this is probably an orange to dunes apple but it has a fond place in my heart given it was my first rrated movie but the things that made me love alien including the sets ship architecture and costumesspacesuits i loved to death in part two     star wars  putting this ahead of george lucas classic took some mental gymnastics i was 10 when it was released and my friends and i saw it probably 20 times it was groundbreaking exhilarating and epic while dune is targeted more at adults and isnt as fun as star wars but i think villeneuve just created a new generation of rabid scifi fans that will reinvigorate the genre going for many years to come     empire strikes back  this is a tough one as this is my favorite star wars and my previous alltimer its got the best script and action of the triple trilogy but i will have to give the edge to dune     i told my boys to remember watching this today years from now theyll remember this day fondly like i did when i saw star wars when it first opened and alien and so on    it is impossible to live in the past difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future frank herbert
Mar 10 2024,positive,ive read the book many times they did a really good job of getting the vast scope of the novel to fit into the two films
Mar 10 2024,positive,beautiful visuals and a thunderous score and overall a fantastic cinematic spectacle though sometimes i felt like the need for spectacle took away a human element of the film this style really captures both the beauty and the horror of the world that has been very built here but it also made me feel a little distant from the characters pauls arc didnt really hit me emotionally as i felt it should but it was written very well and was compelling nonetheless
Mar 10 2024,positive,loved it  great epic movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,even better than part 1 dune 2 gets your attention from the beginning til the end
Mar 10 2024,positive,really liked this movie it was fun to watch but it was a little to long
Mar 10 2024,positive,great movie and great actors action packed but left us a little confused in the end as it did not end as the original movie did so not sure if there will be a sequel but still a great movie and would see again
Mar 10 2024,positive,awesome entertainment ion a grand scale
Mar 10 2024,positive,epic cinema  austin butler is incredible in this
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was very well written and the length of it allowed for character development as a star wars fan im very jealous of the care they took with the story and development of characters
Mar 10 2024,positive,this is what cinema should be
Mar 10 2024,positive,masterpiece even better than part 1 absolutely mindblowing to me as a huge book fan

Mar 10 2024,positive,visually amazing fantastic story never felt like it was long or dragging pacing felt right  i have never read the book and dont have too much background on the story but i felt amazing walking out of the theater it was an intense feeling cant wait for the third one
Mar 10 2024,positive,this is a masterpiece easily joins the ranks of the best film series ever made this series goes above and beyond and rivals the best middle movies in trilogy history its a must see
Mar 10 2024,positive,delivered in a big way thanks for exceeding my expectations
Mar 10 2024,negative,i fell asleep and then left before the movie ended
Mar 10 2024,negative,a watered down overly long movie that strays way too far from the book  visually stunning hence the second star but otherwise does complete disservice to the book with gratuitous and cringe creative liberties taken  villneavue either didnt read the book or completely disregarded it
Mar 10 2024,positive,absolutely amazing cinema
Mar 10 2024,negative,it is hard to describe how totally poor this movie was i went with my family so was unable to leave i was deprived of my liberty quite frankly i would have left if i were by myself this movie was anything but dune having to sit for nearly three hours without a bucket was quite a challenge i should be given my money back in fact it was me who should have been paid to sit through that tripe there was zero integrity to the book which is a classic and it seemed to be a schoolboys attempt at science fiction  the movies modernisation use of cliche cgi hueseffects and poor acting itself was nearly unbearable the secret to any good film is to take you to another world like science fiction always should while feeling like you are there right there in the story this film was simply a cringe with little nuance or creativity  they failed on every level to create a decent rendering of the book let alone a good movie i cannot believe the reviews are even positive for this movie i would describe the plot as a defilement of the original concept and the authors masterpiece forgetting the movie producers integrity to the brilliant seminal novel the world of dune that they created was like a suburban love story set in a desert outside arizona rather than the fictional arrakis the fremen the desert dwellers were portrayed as quasinomads who in actuality were more like middleclass american dressed in rags the supposed battlehardened fremen provided funny oneliners and debated amongst themselves about religious matters giggled and had the all the latest social characteristics of middleamerica when i heard raucous laughing in the cinema after the fremen entertained the crowd i nearly laughed myself given the ridiculous plotline being unfurled unfortunately i cannot rate this film a minus but this has put me off ever going to the movies again it will take me a while to recover from this one i feel hollywood is a desert wasteland and the new dune is a biography of their world los angeles is the new arrakeen see the movie to find out more
Mar 10 2024,positive,probably the best cinematic expérience since lord of the ring story pictures actors musics etc everything is awsome hope these movie will make change all marvel plans

Mar 9 2024,positive,visual masterpiece well acted and intelligent
Mar 9 2024,positive,in contrast to some reviewers i personally found this movie to be dull and predictable the antagonists demise seemed too effortless lacking sufficient action sequences while the cinematography was impressive the cgi fell short though it was an improvement over the first dune film
Mar 9 2024,positive,its been more than 20 years i havent enjoyed a film that much
Mar 9 2024,positive,the world building alone earns this film a five star from me the visuals are absolutely incredible and it truly does the book justice despite some major changes the depth of the characters and the dark message that echoes the book makes you realize that it is no typical action film yet the action is incredible did i mention the amazing acting and incredible score almost three hours yet the time flew only warning is that if you have sensitive ears bring earplugs  it is loud you really feel the base which a lot of people love tl dr see this film do it

Mar 9 2024,positive,austin butler proves he is not a one trick elvis pony he was outstanding in this film  zendaya just has something about her she kept on screen  the sound effects vibrated our seats to the point that i felt a full body massage after almost 3 hours of movie watching  the special effects were off the charts
Mar 9 2024,positive,an extraordinary rendition of the first dune book and an absolutely flawless film sublime

Mar 9 2024,positive,so yes i am familiar with the book and storyline  this second was like someone had read the first third of the book and then skiooed 100 pages read a paragraph and wrote a storylie then repeated another 100 pages etc etc  dune 2 imax was very clunky  oh and bf loud  thankfully i brought good ear protection
Mar 9 2024,positive,so good it was amazing 
Mar 9 2024,positive,brilliant film while some editing was a bit confusing at times and the amount of characters made it hard to follow along sometimes it was an epic film once again timothee chalamets really grew into his character and had brilliant chemistry with zendaya paul really grew as a character showing many sides to him allowing the story to develop the film did feel more fun and epic at times with the large scale shots which was a highlight from the first film
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie was spectacular the visuals the cast the music the director it was a masterpiece my boyfriend and i saw it twice seeing it the second time was better than the first i was in awe the entire time watching and was so moved by it all so silent at the end because of how amazed i was i am excited for part 3 if that ever comes about i cant explain anymore you will have to see it for yourself its not just a movie you see its a movie you can feel
Mar 9 2024,positive,just awesome                        
Mar 9 2024,negative,too slow good photography and excellent special effects zandaya over valorated chambers and buttler excelen performance awfully edition part of the training of the medias is cutted and definitely slow even in that action parts bardem good acting
Mar 9 2024,positive,i just recently watched it here is what i felt i felt like im watching a novel unfolds its story thats the only way that comes to mind im hooked and im eagerly waiting for the nxt chapter i havent read the novel but because of this movies i am planning to but maybe after i watched the complete movies for dune as expected of timothy  i really love his acting hes really a very good story tellergosh   
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing could be best movie of the year you know when theres a scene thats so good it makes you smile thats what happened the whole movie timothee chalamet was born for this role he plays it so well and even though it based of a book the script is written perfectly and there was no lowsy acting in this everyone who played a part sold it so well
Mar 9 2024,positive,epic movie bringing the books to life  wish it was shorter
Mar 9 2024,positive,amazing watched two times already
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie was a masterpiece of cinema go see it in the theatersdont cheapen it by streaming it at home this is the oscar will 2024 ladies and gentlemen
Mar 9 2024,positive,fantastic villeneuve is a master filmmaker
Mar 9 2024,positive,masterpiece cant say anything else 5 stars looking forward to part 3
Mar 9 2024,positive,story moved along quickly and did not linger too long on any particular subtheme  great balance of action and plot
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie is simply beautiful tho i wouldnt recoment to casual movie watchers whos favourite movies are from marvel
Mar 9 2024,positive,i liked im waiting for the third part
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was entertaining  and it is long  2hr 45 minutes if you liked the first one youll like this one it sets up for a part 3
Mar 9 2024,negative,i dont understand whats happening to humanity how can such mediocre films full of glaring flaws have a rating higher than 35 or 610 almost everything in villeneuves dune sequel is bad 1 terrible acting by young actors who act like newcomers from a school theater troupe 2 completely flat characters who are not fully developed 3 empty pretentious dialogues  they are so lifeless that they only provoke double facepalms 4 the almost universal illogicality and incoherence of events as well as the decisions and actions of the characters  even if they were transferred from books it would be possible to at least adequately display their scale 5 extremely insignificant battles  in both parts of the film the battles are shown so poorly that i would like to call them a teaser for the battle trailer and not the battle itself etc the film can only be praised for its visual design and some technical solutions as well as the acting of the old school actors otherwise this film is an almost complete failure i love science fiction and for me this is one of the worst films of the genre and the main disappointment of at least a decade
Mar 9 2024,negative,throw in the koran and mohammed and you have a full blown jihadi flic  isis would love it  by the way the mahdi is the guided one expected in islam to reform the one true religion timothy chalumet a believable mahdi warrior  not a chance  and who cast walken as the emperor his attempt to cover up his accent made me laugh   ok beyond that constant knife and swordplay when you can eradicate your enemies from space youre kidding  its like bringing a toothpick to a tank fight  beyond that the story line was marvel comic predictable with bad guys getting their comeuppance by the knife of course  should go over big in saudi arabia  one star for the visuals and the worm riding   oh man i need some spice
Mar 9 2024,positive,visually spectacular  the best film ive ever seen in the science fiction category
Mar 9 2024,positive,nolan likened dune part two to empire strikes back i dont quite agree empire strikes back was another beast altogether  but the dune sequel isnt far apart    set immediately after the events of part one paul has now joined the fremen and he follows them to their home with freman divided over whether the messiah exists and if it is paul who will ultimately save them a plot is brewing among the harkonnens on assassinating the mauddib paul     with zendaya getting more screentime chani  pauls relationship is one of the highlights of the sequel timothèe chalamet  zendaya are phenomenal austin butlers feydrautha is at his menacing best and javier bardems stilgar turns into someone who believes every action of pauls is a sign that he is the chosen one memes galore already rebecca ferguson dave bautista josh brolin stellan skarsgard reprise their roles with florence pugh christopher walken lea seydoux joining the cast     the sandworm sequences were my favourite i love the beats that accompany the device that the freman use to call the worms dune part two covers everything in the second half of book one albeit a few changes and the two parts together make for a wonderful viewing experience especially for those who have read the book watching the world of dune come alive has been truly mesmerising no one could have done it better than this frankherbert would have been proud     dune has to be experienced on the big screen bigger the better you will love it more trust me
Mar 9 2024,positive,there were 3 or 4 consecutive plot twist that all felt rushed at the very end feels like theyre cramming 5 different stories into one curious to see if 3rd movie elevates opinion
Mar 9 2024,positive,visually the best thing ive ever seen audibly the best thing ive ever heard this movie is the best movie ive ever seen in my entire life it was perfect ive read the 6 herbert books and some of the brian herbert books my dad read the books as the came out and we were just in awe of this masterpiece everything about this movie encapsulated the dune world its a perfect piece of scifi
Mar 9 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece visually and artistically stunning soundtrack gives chills and is unbelievable will watch again  1010 will recommend
Mar 9 2024,positive,it is a spectacular movie amazing at every moment although as a book adaptation it has its flaws as a movie itself it it near immaculate the acting is really good the plot is really wellbuilt and the music is an absolute masterpiece
Mar 9 2024,positive,its spectacular amazing and beautiful
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie single handedly restored my faith in cinema by far one of the best movies both in acting and cinematography i cant wait to watch part 3
Mar 9 2024,positive,cant stand zendaya but other than that simply brilliant
Mar 9 2024,negative,the showing of the movie was cancelled  i rescheduled for fowlling tuesday
Mar 9 2024,positive,i liked it but thought part 1 was better theres some problems with this part the middle hour is fairly slow as we go through pauls awakening as the messiah harkonnen troops can fly sometimes but not when it would be really useful same with the weapons they have devastating lasers in scenes then machine guns but then no guns at all in major battles just swords seriously the atreides now have an atomic arsenal hidden in a really obvious place coz no one will look in an obvious place whoever wrote that scene should hang their head theres no real chemistry between timothee and zendaya it didnt feel real probably lacking a major love scene might have been cut  austin butler as feyd was great and overall it was an enjoyable movie
Mar 9 2024,positive,every shot is a work of art superlative acting from the entire cast breathtaking action set pieces dune part 2 is a triumph of cinema
Mar 9 2024,positive,5 times better than the 1st  must see 
Mar 9 2024,positive,the best visual movie ive ever seen way to bring so much clarity to a movie from a really detailed book
Mar 9 2024,positive,it is rare for a film to meet the monumental expectations that the world has cast upon dune pt 2 this film shatters all of them in his return to arrakis director denis villeneuve flexes every directorial muscle weve come to expect from him and then some dune part 2 is an instant classic the best science fiction film produced this century and proof that in the cinema imagery and sound remain king fans of the book and newcomers to the world of dune will be in awe of the secrets that lay waiting for them in the desert of arrakis while masterpiece is overused these days dune pt 2 will go down as cinematic legend and a must see in a 143 imax if you can find one
Mar 9 2024,neutral,movie was drawn out at times action scenes were great
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was okay i dont know what the hype is really maybe it will be more fun watching it on digital i couldnt hear much in the cinema when i watched dune 1 the same happened the plot twists were nice i guess but i have seen good movies that i loved get bad reviews tbh dune 2 isnt that great this whole franchise isnt     but a good movie to pass the time
Mar 9 2024,positive,bring on dune part 3
Mar 9 2024,negative,unpopular opinion but dune 2 was terrible i read the books saw the first film andi saw this in imax i give it one star for zendaya who was great and some of the visual effects but whole time it just made me feel uncomfortable sad and angry at why i had paid so much to see this incoherent fever dream there was no humor at all if i want a pessimistic and and angry film then i will watch world news the vibe is a melodramatic pessimistic and confusing plot that is barely explained unless youve read the books i did the musical score is barely even music a combination of a call to prayer and over dramatic synthesized drums timothy chálame is not believable as a messianic warrior or any kind of fighter and his character pauls motives and powers are barely explained or explored and the ending was changed leaving out key events from the first book to set up the next film i presume 
Mar 9 2024,positive,incredible stunning masterpiece
Mar 9 2024,positive,beautiful movie loved the cinematography the acting was amazing with a brilliant cast definitely recommend
Mar 9 2024,positive,watched on imax  zendayas ego on full display with unnecessary closeup shots and seems like her character was too prominent as a secondary role  bald elvis was on full display and seemed familiar and flat  quality of cgi was top notch and the star of the film  the princess florence need more back story she stole the attention whenever she was on a full on sex scene between bald elvis and the spy was a missed opportunity  fighting scenes were great  timosiah was good and seemed in tune with the character  this film left me wanting to surf a sand worm
Mar 9 2024,positive,must see pt1 first see it on the biggest best screen possible imax or imax 70mm a masterpiece
Mar 9 2024,positive,best movie of the year so far you have to watch it
Mar 9 2024,negative,everything good about the book and old movie is trashed in this version its overly bloody and i would have preferred better rock operaesque music i cant begin to describe how this craps on my childhood
Mar 9 2024,positive,i never read the books and thus found the first part to be quite confusing dune 2 however was way better and less confusing the visuals were excellent just like in the first one the acting and dialogue was convincing too
Mar 9 2024,negative,absolutely no idea what the fuzz is all about  first off mediocre acting even from the veteran actors crowned with endless exposition dumps and unbelievable character development  second off very stale visuals as many scenes appear empty and undynamic that may seem ok for the desert scenes but also all interior sets including the blocking of the scene itself kind of fall flat look cheap and are visually boring  the pacing is way off deminishing any chance of building any suspension arc its just like someone put together random scenes from different movies   there are a lot of unnecessary scenes as well whereas some other important ones got cut short  no wonder my pal next to me felt asleep
Mar 9 2024,positive,great sequel with some fantastic world building and effects  felt a little bogged down in story but still an enjoyable return to arakis
Mar 9 2024,positive,stunning cinematic experience
Mar 9 2024,negative,overhyped typical villeneuve scifi trash
Mar 9 2024,positive,this is the greatest movie ive ever seen ive never been a nerd about movies but i cant wait to buy this movie so i can rewatch it over and over
Mar 9 2024,positive,really good adaptation from the books to the big screen amazing photography and visual effects
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie makes me upset 1010 on what concerns visuals but unfortunately they screwed it with the script and time management   imho despite its flaws it is a film that should be seen
Mar 9 2024,positive,4dx is intense but the movie is incredible
Mar 9 2024,positive,i have never felt compelled to write a review before i consider myself someone who appreciates cinema on a morethancasual level i get the chills from some music and less often from cinema i got a few chills from godzilla minus one and consider it a movie that i liked very much i am not a dune or scifi fanboy throughout the viewing of dune part two i was either holding my breath shaking or having cold chills it is mentally physically and emotionally exhausting i had completely disassociated with any reality aside from the screen while the movie was running the theater was silent and motionless until the credits had ended i was left speechless for an hour after it had ended it is hands down the best movie i have ever seen
Mar 9 2024,positive,this is mustsee i watched it on imax every second of this movie deserves your 100 attention if you feel part 1 is boring part 2 will give you more than double the enjoyment i may go to watch it the second time  big thanks to the director talented actorsactresses and all crews for making such great movie this is absolutely a masterpiece of this decade
Mar 9 2024,positive,way better than the first this movie truly has an amazing story and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time is it better than all star wars movies no but its better than some of them i still think star wars is better in many ways but this truly is a good movie and one to see on the big screen only once in a generation do you get great movies like this
Mar 9 2024,positive,much better than the first one
Mar 9 2024,positive,very good movie really enjoyed it cant really think of any complaints
Mar 9 2024,positive,too loud hard to follow any storyline just a knockoff of greater films of the star wars movies great acting but boring and drawn out
Mar 9 2024,positive,we need more movies like this immersive as hell full of captivating images and sound telling a thrilling and thoughtprovoking story within a fascinating world see this movie and read the books too i wish i had prescience so i could see dune messiah now
Mar 9 2024,positive,ive read this series through my college years in the 80s loved them this movie series is awesome love all the characters cant wait for part 3
Mar 9 2024,positive,this was one of the best cinema experiences i have ever had it took everything that i loved from the first movie and made it even better i havent stopped thinking about the movie since i watched it i am now patient waiting for news about the 3rd movie as where this movie finished it is obvious there is more to the story
Mar 9 2024,positive,nice plot development beautiful cinematography and action sequences with special effects
Mar 9 2024,positive,simply stated phenomenal
Mar 9 2024,positive,enjoyable dragged a little bit and made characters seem very manipulative  too long
Mar 9 2024,positive,it really didnt need to be as long as it was the story felt full and solid but it could have been told in 2 hours   zendaya and timothee are an amazing combination on screen the cast is stellar
Mar 9 2024,positive,feels like the relationship between his love interest was a little rushed but overall very powerful acting loved the silence scene
Mar 9 2024,positive,i have never rated a movie before but i needed to create an account for this one what an experience the cinematography the score the performances this movie reminded me why i love cinema

Mar 9 2024,positive,one word masterpiece imax was worth every penny
Mar 9 2024,positive,great movie a tad slow in some parts but thats to be expected in dune worth the money for the show take a pee break before you start
Mar 9 2024,positive,absolutely amazing one of the best movies of all time
Mar 9 2024,negative,for such a long movie it moved much too fast   there is no disputing the glory of the cinematography but as far as story line the dune part 2 story line could and should have been part 2 and part 3 leaving room for a longer series it was disappointingly rushed especially after how beautifully detailed dune part 1 was dune part was worlds better than part 2
Mar 9 2024,negative,boring insipid interminable this movie makes us all worse i ask anyone who has seen it is there a single character in this film or indeed its predecessor that you actually care about i will never have the hours i wasted on dune 1  2 back and were all going to die someday please skip if you have ever had a thought or even read a book in your life jesus
Mar 9 2024,positive,its a rare thing when a massive budget a inspired director and talented cast and crew come together to produce a masterpiece this movie will easily stand the test of time and carve its own place among the greatest sci fi movies of all time
Mar 9 2024,positive,movie of the year the trilogy will be one of the greatest ever 
Mar 9 2024,positive,fantastic storyline and cinematic photography
Mar 9 2024,positive,great movie beautiful score by hans zimmer makes you feel like youre in the movie great acting and cinematography
Mar 9 2024,positive,the whole giedi prime sequence was immaculate those fireworks and the scenes showing their military might was an excellent experience to see on imax the scene where paul does his first worm ride was also sublime the views from where paul was standing were breathtaking i found myself at the edge of my seat the entire ride absolutely thrilling i also loved the emperors ship flying through arakeeen its tough i felt the same way about part one as i do part two like some parts felt rushed while some felt drawn out pacing effectively in a dense story such as dune is near impossible though id give anything for a couple of 35 hour movies stellar movie chalamet was phenomenal especially in the second half like a mad man loved it cant wait to see it again but like villeneuve says i was definitely wanting for more  christopher walken voice long live  the foo fightas
Mar 9 2024,positive,best science fiction movie of all time

Mar 9 2024,positive,visual effects were amazing im older and saw the older versions of dune so the story wasnt as impressive
Mar 9 2024,positive,still early but this maybe the best movie of 2024 so far
Mar 9 2024,positive,what a movie     the whole movie is so good the setting is amazing the story is so good and the plot and the premise is amazing my favorite characters are paul and chani this whole movie is seeking revenge from the darkness and the evil that was causing the world to collapse and following that they decide just like on star wars to choose what side theyre on the light side or the dark side and man the cliffhanger of the movie was the most shocking thing ever the whole movie is a very well done movie
Mar 9 2024,negative,these reviews must be fake this movie is boring and poorly scripted the story is ridiculous it bounces all over the place with no background information huge waste of almost 3 hours
Mar 9 2024,positive,epic hand clapping at the end i want more 
Mar 9 2024,positive,great production acting is awesome i liked the book but i love the movie see it in imax for best experience
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was refreshing to see a movie without so many cgi effects a little difficulty following the story since it doesnt have that george lucas type of  of direction im used to watching still very good
Mar 9 2024,positive,masterpiece the pacing was good
Mar 9 2024,positive,absolutely incredible film that is a must see
Mar 9 2024,positive,i saw this for the second time today this time in imax wow what a movie even better the second time around i read the first book a long time ago so i can appreciate how difficult it was to put this into a movie but it all works so well that sandworm ride alone is worth the price of admission great performances all around i cant even pick a favorite i hope its not long until we have part 3 i hope this inspires more great movies and less of the superhero garbage weve been saddled with for so long now
Mar 9 2024,neutral,its a good movie but overrated period
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was a lot going on i didnt see part 1
Mar 9 2024,positive,phenomenal period this movie is so good that im going back to the theaters to watch it a second time and thats rare for me i didnt think he would be as good as part one but it is better which is mind blowing the cast script cinematography etc is outstanding go and watch the film people its a must
Mar 9 2024,positive,the plot was a little confusing i liked most of the special effects
Mar 9 2024,positive,amazing movie best adaptation of the book so far
Mar 9 2024,positive,outstanding i was not expecting to like it as much as the first one but i do i was so bummed when it ended i dont think you have to watch the first one to enjoy this although you will want to after watching dune 2
Mar 9 2024,positive,a must see on the biggest screen possible
Mar 9 2024,positive,villeneuve is the scifi king and dune part two is his latest and probably his biggest achievement this man has become one of my favorite filmmakers in such a short period
Mar 9 2024,positive,this is the best film ive seen in 20 years the last time i enjoyed a movie this much was lotr return of the king or kill bill vol 1
Mar 9 2024,positive,what an incredible movie experience from the story to the acting the visuals etc one of the best i have seen bravo
Mar 9 2024,positive,an experiencei think part one is a better movie as far a story and plot but this one is just an emotional experience
Mar 9 2024,positive,its a little slow in the beginning but midway through carried it and it was a amazing experience
Mar 9 2024,positive,great movie best director in hollywood now keep them coming in the series

Mar 9 2024,positive,a must see in imax
Mar 9 2024,positive,iit was fun  a little too much on the figting  i feel it was dragged out more than it needed to be
Mar 9 2024,positive,dune part two is an epic piece of filmmaking  along with the exciting action and stunning special effects the film tells a nuanced complex and compelling story  while villeneuve version of dune differs in some disappointing ways from frank herberts classic novel dune part 2 is still a true blockbuster not to be missed
Mar 9 2024,positive,must sew    1010 absolutely enjoyed from beginning to end it went way above my expectations     justgosee
Mar 9 2024,positive,i have been a fan of the books for a long time  this movie and the previous one are way better than any other version ive seen  i dont even mind the changes in the story and love the way that it ended with chaani riding off into the sands  in the book she is pretty compliant with pauls decisions but this chick has backbone it was the right call
Mar 9 2024,positive,optics again were great but trying to too much of a love story in the storyline
Mar 8 2024,positive,i loved it i didnt want it to be over  villains were well portrayed i like the characters that were brought back go see it
Mar 8 2024,positive,like the first more but this was great
Mar 8 2024,positive,i really loved the movie tho i was slightly disappointed at the final scene no spoilers but something that occurred in the 84 movie that did not occur in this one  otherwise i thought the cast and story lines were really well done  i enjoyed the peeks at the deeper backstories  i think its pretty obvious everyone is workinghoping on a 3rd movie  i cant wait to see it too
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time
Mar 8 2024,positive,the special effects are of great quality and they come in just the right amountintensity but i was captivated by the story the acting and the overall attention to detail every character fits the story the actors fit the characters the exception could be the emperror the character is too weak for me the actor doesnt fit i felt the emotion of muadib being gradually embraced by the fremen then feared and then worshipped its all clear and purposeful i cant wait for part 3
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie is such a refreshing change to the past few years of marvel like slop safe feeling boring and by the numbers content     they have their place in cinema but this movie and the first dune movie feel fresh they feel like a vision of someone who understands and respects the source material    its only march and i must say this movie is spectacular the movie felt like it was 30 mins long i could have watched another 2 hours     the cinematography and story is just wow    absolutely loved this movie a must watch
Mar 8 2024,positive,its an absolute mustsee in theaters    the story the acting the sound the visuals    chefs kiss
Mar 8 2024,neutral,visual and sound extravaganza but overcooked great acting and cool designs spoilt by pseudo glorious xxl battle scenes and repetitive close combat with knives looked forward to watching it but felt let down after reading so many 4 45 and 5 stars reviews merits a 25 maybe 3 but i think audiences need to be warned against the hype

Mar 8 2024,positive,best movie i watched in years really the only one i consider going to the cinema worth for to see it on the big screen with better speakers first one was a blast as well
Mar 8 2024,positive,it was an entertaining film but lacked many of the things that were present in the dune part one  the characters were such that they were not as relatable  the sound track was much too loud  the climatic scene did not present a sense that something important had been accomplished
Mar 8 2024,positive,must see in imax 70mm wow
Mar 8 2024,positive,action packed adventure which was a little hard to follow at times  running time a little long as is the norm these days
Mar 8 2024,positive,an achievement in filmmaking villeneuve has crafted a thrilling sequel adapting herbets complex character arcs this film does not go short in any way with amazing performances all around beautiful set design amazing writing and some of the best and most convincing cg i have ever seen cannot wait for dune messiah
Mar 8 2024,positive,it has become one of my all time favorites 
Mar 8 2024,positive,denis villeneuves dune  part two delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience the visuals are breathtaking capturing the essence of arrakis with stunning detail timothée chalamet leads an outstanding cast bringing depth to the iconic characters villeneuves direction balances action and emotion flawlessly resulting in a film that demands to be seen on the big screen
Mar 8 2024,positive,great movie wild visuals pretty close to the book enjoyed it a lot
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie is a scifi masterpiece can the story be slow at some points yes but the movie itself is a jaw dropping spectacle i have now seen this movie twice in imax and the experience is one of the best the acting is beyond great and you feel like you are a part of the world the whole 3 hours pretty much it is not for everyone and if you do not like scifi you might not like it but from a pure movie going experience i would say it is still worth giving it a chance 55
Mar 8 2024,positive,awesome followup to the first one visually outstanding  must see in imax
Mar 8 2024,negative,the first hint i got that this film might not be all its cracked up to be was the universal almost cookiecutter gushing of all the screening reviews plenty enough to send the bs meter toward red toward the words bought and paid for the film itself did little to assuage that first impression     ive read all of herberts books next to the depth and breadth of the story telling in the books this movie is like reading a stickfigure comic book of no more than 20 or 30 pages its impossible to understand in any meaningful way the story beingsort oftold on the screen without having read the books and having read the books its impossible to see the film as truly meaningful its most outstanding feature is how so many cliches have been sown together into a rather bland and colorless quilt    i think villeneuve should have known you cant fake storytelling with intense nearly silent closeup seems like a rookie mistake to me the film just reeks of hurried schedules and shortcuts for all its attention to detail its appallingly shallow and superficial but again i read the books    but itll make a ton of money just like walmart at christmas    theres nothing about this film that makes me want to see the next but it has moved me to read the books again theres that ive already begun and world of arrakis already seems more clear
Mar 8 2024,positive,ive read and loved the books for a long time scifi is my favorite genre and this is my new favorite film the changes were brilliant for the medium of the screen and for today it has the best casting of any movie i can think of great acting the direction and music and powerful and beautiful amazing experience
Mar 8 2024,positive,great movie elements of mad max and gladiator added in a little lengthy 
Mar 8 2024,positive,amazing production and a must see in imax
Mar 8 2024,positive,if i could get everyone i know to watch one movie in the theatre this would be it 1110
Mar 8 2024,positive,justwow see this movie immediately epic
Mar 8 2024,positive,havent had a moment in cinema when i audibly gasped as the plot thickened exceptional storytelling and a dazzling spectacle
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the very best films in recent memory it is a beautiful film that will satisfy those who have read the iconic novel by frank herbert or merely watched the last film and waited for the sequel very happy the story cast visuals hans zimmers score and direction all come together to make something that is so very close to being completely perfect     rating 7475 987
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie was incredible part 2 full of action and had great cinematography the acting was also phenomenal timothée chalamet was a perfect casting and portrayed a much more confident and matured paul hans zimmer did his thing the cgi and visual effects were also astonishing overall the movie blew away my expectations after watching the first one and am hoping to see the 3rdif there is one
Mar 8 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a groundbreaking film that combines a captivating storyline with mesmerizing visuals creating a unique and immersive cinematic experience the movies narrative challenges viewers to reconsider societal structures and power dynamics while its stunning visuals transport audiences to a fantastical world that feels both real and otherworldly through its thoughtprovoking themes and breathtaking imagery dune part 2 delivers a powerful message in a visually stunning and compelling way making it a mustsee for those seeking a truly unforgettable movie experience
Mar 8 2024,positive,maybe its a tad too long or slow maybe slight issues with bad acting but any negative was vastly over shadowed by how gorgeous it looks and sounds and how many really cool moments there are i loved it for sure
Mar 8 2024,positive,this is art simply art for my dune second part leaves you with your mouth open simply a masterpiece
Mar 8 2024,positive,fantasticstarted right off where part 1 finished  did not disappoint   can not wait for part 3
Mar 8 2024,positive,villeneuve does it again bringing a visual feast and exciting fight scenes to the finale of his two part adaption however unlike the first the second half seems to feel rushed and loses dramatic pacing almost seeming abrupt with the outcomes and leaving much in the dark maybe it is to set up for another sequel but ultimately it hurts what would have otherwise been a thrilling and awesome conclusion music sound and the cast all shine even in the most desolate settings
Mar 8 2024,positive,the best movie to come out in the last 15 years a must see for everyone i went in skeptical and when i left the theater i was speechles
Mar 8 2024,positive,no film like it in the last 10 years cinematography special effects soundscape and narrative will blow you away even if you have not read the books a must see award winning film
Mar 8 2024,positive,personally thought it was more exciting than the book  its a solidly made movie and i have very few critiques about it there was still a little bit of humor but its very deep themes and a weighty subject matter its beautifully shot and directed and didnt feel like a 3 hour long movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,my spoilerfree review of duneparttwo    better than the first and structured in a way that feels like if the 2012 johncarter movie was good and if returnofthejedi had a very dark  alternate ending for luke    austin butler and dave bautista stole the show    amazing in 70mm imax    910
Mar 8 2024,positive,part 2 picks up exactly where the last one left off the visuals the costumes that action the story they plot the intensity of the film are all upgraded in part 2 part 1 was a true setup movie this one delivered on everything that part one left although i do like part 1 this was the dude movie that i was looking for in part 1 the world building the sit pieces were all phenomenal you can just see the money on the screen the special effects were incredible they sound effects were a second to none and imax im going to go see it again just to plan to not miss one second because i did have to get up for about 4 minutes to go use the restroom i recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of movies this is what the big screen was made for if you dont see this movie on the big screen it just will not be the same so go and see it in the theaters on the big screen possible i saw it on imax
Mar 8 2024,positive,710 was alright but slow at times and had a semi confusing story
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie is big screen epic a solid 5 starts easy i saw it in dolby atmos and the sounds and visuals are incredible its even better than the first movie imo if you are a movie fan then this is a movie that you have to see in theaters go dolby or imax if possible it will make certain scenes even more aweinspiring this movie deserves it and you will not be disappointed
Mar 8 2024,positive,an epic moviegoing experience villeneuve is a master of visuals and has created a world so large and breathtaking that you have to see it on the big screen
Mar 8 2024,positive,the movie was great and the 4k experience was fun too im glad id already seen the film once in imax as the ride of 4k can be a bit distracting
Mar 8 2024,negative,hollow vaped and in no way faithful to the text
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie is so amazing  im has honestly become my new favorite movie of all time
Mar 8 2024,positive,special effects are very well done its a must to watch this on on a big screen with stereo effects   it however failed in comparison to last version to keep me on the edge of my seat i think this was due several reasons first the actor chose of christopher walken as the emperor really was a swing and a miss for me i like him in other films but here i dont think he fits the role   other things felt rushed fe how paul become so fast accepted with the freeman aswell as a lot of scene that lost any tension because any lack of consecuences was lost due to the rushiness of the scenes and the plot armor of the main characters fe drinking the holy water wasnt exciting at all and the 2th time when paul drinks it just feels kinda repeatable     i was also annoyed by how zendaya was acting in some scenes kinda arrogant protective then maddly in love then again mad especially the last scene where paul tells her he will always love her but had to make a sacrifice to marry the emperor daughters for the greater good and save millions she gets mad and runs away her intentions felt childish and not really clear later i learned that in the books she did understand and it was a change off the books which i really dislike  i get that the harkonnen are evil but because they sometimes slit their underlings throats for little to no reasons make the characters feel cartoonish and just a cheap way to provide us a bad character where i would prefer that they had use the screentime to create more depth in the characters     overall i did like the dune 2 but for me it downgraded a lot from dune 1 which i found was a masterpiece i hope dune 3 wont follow the same trend
Mar 8 2024,positive,stunning cinematography powerful performances i didnt realize i had been woahing for almost 3 hours already such a thrilling masterpiece epic
Mar 8 2024,positive,this was a great movie  i am a fan of the dune books so this movie really brought the books to life the end of the movie suggested that there will be a dune part 3 so i cant wait for that
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie was so realistic it felt like you were sucked into the world of dune and not watching it but yet experiencing it the casts were amazing austin butler did awesome timothee did way better in this movie than wonka and zendaya really captured the scene on her speeches and emotionality the cinematography 1010 and i will 100 be watching the 3rd one if it ever comes out
Mar 8 2024,positive,just go watch it man  it felt like i was in the movie and i felt everything they felt its a powerful movie and the main characters killed it
Mar 8 2024,positive,great cinematography story can be difficult to follow at times but one of the better movies we have seen recently certainly better than oppenheimer
Mar 8 2024,neutral,just watched dune 2 possibly the most epic movie ever in terms of sets cinematography and score etc but i felt the script character development and lead performances werent great it lacked depth and i didnt care about any of the hollywood stars sorry i mean characters i love the book and ive liked most dennis villeneuve movies so was really looking forward to this but id only give it 610 dune 1 was probably the better film and controversial opinion but for all its flaws the 80s lynch movie was better than both
Mar 8 2024,positive,masterpiece will be looked on as a cinematic masterpiece and deserves to be the first one was a bit slow because its setting up the story but with part 2 lots of actionaction packed and will always remain as one of the best scifi films ever of our generation
Mar 8 2024,positive,this is an absolutely mesmerizing spectacle of cinema please watch this on imax
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the best movies of the 21st century so far
Mar 8 2024,positive,the greatest cinema experience of my life perfectly captures the novel i was left with my jaw dropped involuntarily for minutes on end denis does scale like absolutely nobody else
Mar 8 2024,positive,visually spectacular  musically flooring  dune 2s narrative of faith and againstallodds stirs the heart  the action meanwhile is absolutely delicious with enough royal infighting and martial arts to pay homage to the honored genre of high fantasy  the cast excels at the adoption of their individual ethos and chalamet shone with a breathtaking conflict between vulnerability and newfound strength  this one is definitely not one to wait for the streaming yall  watch it in theaters puhlease
Mar 8 2024,positive,maybe the best modern scifi movie it makes the part 1 better cant wait for more im going to see this a 3rd time on 70mm imax 
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the best movies ever 
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie was such an immersive experience i cant even describe how beautiful it was it somehow out shined the first movie even though it was excellent 1010 so easy to rank timmy slayed
Mar 8 2024,positive,magnificent epic and emotionally engaging  dune part 2 is everything you could want in a scifi fantasy film and it leaves you begging for part 3  a film that can only be described as a modern day masterpiece
Mar 8 2024,positive,visually is just amazing  way better than the first part 
Mar 8 2024,negative,lacks depth character development and themes this film is completely underwhelming the most attractive aspect is the cast expect to wait 94 minutes for anything eventful to occur lead characters portrayed by great leads such as zendaya receive maybe 20 minutes of screen time the film lacks emotion captivating characters and explanation to many holes of the plot the film leaves you with more questions than answers and not in a good way not even viewers paid to watch the third installment of the series should return a disappointing feature
Mar 8 2024,positive,best sci fi epic ive seen since the original star wars trilogy
Mar 8 2024,positive,the greatest fanadaptation ever made if you dont love the dune books maybe you love this movie less i cried a lot will likely be my favorite new release for many years denis is the dune fans hero
Mar 8 2024,positive,very cinematic it was one of those movies where i walked out not caring about it but the movie was so cinematic it was imax so i recalled how many of these moments felt and the humor blended very well with the movie as well the end did really hit its mark the knife scene was longer than ive seen any other duel in cinema and thats exactly what i want this was a really solid moment that showed how successful dune has been i wanted to really like the movie i would recommend it to everyone because it hit all the right marks its just not my movie i cant say im not a fan of scifi but i think the suspense got me sleeping an hour through i can really only remember only one flaw in the movie and that is the futurebutthenunborn daughters narration is completely unnecessary i wish someone can put florence pugh into some useful roles as shes been pretty bleak as of lately
Mar 8 2024,positive,a masterpiece a must see in imax or xd
Mar 8 2024,positive,i liked it a lot more than the first one i cant wait for part 3
Mar 8 2024,negative,boring to long to much going on couldnt understand half what they were saying
Mar 8 2024,negative,credit is due to production but  less than fifteen minutes into the film i wished i wasnt there not my type of entertainment
Mar 8 2024,positive,great to see part ii on the big screen best to see it in imax more action than part i great cinematography
Mar 8 2024,positive,visually creativily overall stunning
Mar 8 2024,neutral,visually stunning as youd expect inconsistent throughout liked watching a different story than the prior take on the book but seemed that is was working so hard on setting up for a third part they forgot to focus on the last half of this one
Mar 8 2024,positive,oh my godits beautiful
Mar 8 2024,positive,that was epic from start to finish
Mar 8 2024,positive,dune 2 is an absolute masterpiece easily the best film ive ever seen its a mustsee in imax for the most immersive experience but you might want to bring some earplugs as the sound can be overwhelming the acting is topnotch and the oneonone handtohand combat scene is the best ive ever witnessed its so intense it gets your blood pumping if youre a fan of epic storytelling and breathtaking visuals dont miss this cinematic gem
Mar 8 2024,positive,part one got me into the books seeing jessica become a reverend mother was something villeneuve pulled off incredibly well even though i knew the ending of the story i was still scared for pauls life zendaya has chemistry with anyone she stars with great movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,most unreal amazing movie ive ever seen literally absolutely spin tingling in imax truly this is a masterpiece im in awe it was a religious experience
Mar 8 2024,positive,very compelling story telling the visuals are awesome sound exceptional acting is compelling if you are already a dune  fan you will not be disappointed  if you did not see part 1 part 2 stands on its own  the ending leads us to wonder if this will become an ongoing franchise which the studios of course love the audiences well sometimes not so much  in summation if you loved the movie barbie you will hate this show  proof positive in my book that it is very much popcorn worthy
Mar 8 2024,positive,this movie and the one before it was visually stunning but just not as great as people seem to say at least to me i find them sometimes convoluted to follow and at other times just slow i think this movie would be better served to be 30 minutes or even 45 minutes shorter it is a watchable fun movie yes but all the hype is just not there for me and i wanted to feel otherwise
Mar 8 2024,positive,too long too predictable   expected more
Mar 8 2024,positive,definitely must see really liked this movie a lot i cant wait for the third one this one is much better than the first one was
Mar 8 2024,positive,i cannot wait to watch it the second time amazing
Mar 8 2024,positive,i gave 4 star only because feydrautha doesnt have enough screen time his character  his opening scene is the best part of the movie for me and we need more of him
Mar 8 2024,positive,reading the negative reviews is enlightening telling about just how uneducated so many people are about the herbert books having read them when i was a boy and finding out that the book is my exact age i find it sad how many people no longer read i not only read all of herberts books but his sons as well     this movie does elegant justice to his ideas it may not follow completely or faithfully to his storyline or the look or costuming of herberts vision but it exceeds the niceties that frank herbert once put on pages denis villeneuve creates a masterwork period perhaps a bit long maybe but it is a story that needed to be told and i am so glad he did not crunch everything into one movie like david lynch did back in the 80s it is unwatchable now though it has its charms in some ways but this is an altogether different animal like comparing adam wests batman to christian bales rise not even a reasonable comparison    go see this movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,as a fan of every dune release i throughly enjoyed part 2 even though they repeated several aspect from part 1 the cinematography was on point and pauls rise to fit the prophecies kept in line with all the previous years looking forward to part 3  i suggest that you look at part 1 before you look at 2
Mar 8 2024,positive,an epic well executed
Mar 8 2024,positive,believe the hype this is one of the best movies ever made
Mar 8 2024,positive,im have read the original 6 books twice  im kind of a dune fanatic  so despite no appearance of st alia of the knife i was floored by the spectacle of dune 2  just bought a new copy of dune messiah and will keep my dune fix fed that way
Mar 8 2024,positive,it feels like we have another star wars so happy that people who were not born when lord of the ring and star wars was made can experience the same thing also im from québec so 10 out of 10 movie best director
Mar 8 2024,positive,its rare that a sequel is just as good if not better than the first movie and dune part two i would say was just as good as dune part one
Mar 8 2024,positive,looked and sounded amazing however the pacing wasnt as good as the first film there was no build up to the action sequences and it lacked any kind of suspense paul didnt seem that bothered about his grandfather being the darth vader character he was just like yeah whatever and it wasnt really mentioned again worth seeing if you enjoyed part 1 i doubt id sit through another one at the cinema though and hollywood will be milking this with tv shows etc in the coming years no doubt its certainly not the masterpiece some would have you believe its more to do with the fact that its slightly different from star wars and all the marvel movies which most film goers are sick and tired of
Mar 8 2024,positive,amazing movie with amazing commitment to the storyline but during the most intense scenes i kept thinking thats willy wonka
Mar 8 2024,positive,i have literally waited 20 years for a decent onscreen adaptation of the books this is everything i wanted the changes the movie made to the books were fantastic and worthy similar only to lord of the rings return of the king level quality thank for finally having a movie worthy of the books please continue and take as much time as you need just please get it right thanks
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies ive ever seen
Mar 8 2024,positive,im going to see it again and possibly again  and then again cant wait till i can buy it and watch it all the time   wasnt overalled by part 1 but wow this one blew me away im in withdrawal that i have to wait for saturday sooo many golden moments but when paul promises to not try anything fancy when he pimps his first ride on grampa worm  faaaaaaark that blew me away  what a ride goosebumps even thinking about it bring on saturday rematch idont go the flicks much but man im making this movie a habit incredible
Mar 8 2024,positive,fantastic loved every minute beautifully paced very engaging great actingperfect execution kudos to villeneuve
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the best movie going experiences i have ever had amazing to look at and hear the time flew by as we were completely gripped the entire time easily the most fun i have had with an action or sci fi movie 1010 recommend seeing
Mar 8 2024,positive,one of the best films of the decade by far amazing job and work on the whole film from the very beginning to the very end
Mar 8 2024,positive,best movie ive seen since infinity war and end game a must see
Mar 8 2024,positive,best film of 21st century so far mind blowing experience incredible filming acting writing everythings just perfect about this movie
Mar 8 2024,positive,really really well done movie myself my wife and my adult daughter all saw it and collectively agree that it is the best scifi movie that we have seen in a long time no single aspect of this movie was not a 1010 we all cant wait for part 3 note none of us have read the dune novels but all of us did see dune part one which we were all luke warm about at the time highly recommended
Mar 8 2024,negative,what did i watch is my question its such a wtf movie for a normal person this was the most wtf movie ive ever watched there is nothing funny interesting or anything i dont understand the hype behind this    i like movies dont get me wrong but this was the worst movie ive put my eyes on i almost left the cinema since i saw like 45 others do it
Mar 8 2024,positive,intrigued by the hype i saw dune pt2 without having seen pt1 amazing movie with gorgeous cinematography and a strong plot i enjoyed it but i had to watch pt1 a few days later if you havent seen pt1 i would strongly recommend that you watch that first
Mar 8 2024,positive,the cinematography in this film is amazing austin butler is so scary as feydrautha not saying that the other actors in that movie did a bad job they did an amazing job the script that they were given is just as good as the actors i am not sure if this will be getting any awards love next year but it will for sure be one of my favorites of this year unless a ton of better movies come along which i highly doubt it
Mar 8 2024,positive,phenomenal perfect perfect
Mar 8 2024,positive,it was visually stunning for sure  the story moved very slow i kept wondering when it would end i do not understand the hype it was just meh
Mar 8 2024,positive,monumental dune part two fire all cyllenders and provide one of the best experience that you will ever see in theaters villeneuve amplify all the scope of herbert mythology and bring the best of what this universe can be the cast is excellent timothee chalamet is incredible rebecca ferguson is visceral and zendaya is a force of nature also javier bardem and austin bustley are great too overall you need to experience this movie so far the best of the year and also one of the best of this decade
Mar 8 2024,positive,phenomenal transcendent thrilling masterful dropdead gorgeous    at one point my heart was racing so hard and from the large soda that i started to hyperventilate    dune part two builds on the dune part one the way the hydrogen bomb was built off of fat boy and the trinity bomb both were epic but one is leagues nay  orders of magnitude better dune part two is the equivalent of the tsar bomba of movies in 2024 unparalleled heights of theater cinematography and storytelling run dont walk to your closest movie theater     and a note to those that are thinking of skipping this movie till its streamable at home on a small screen pirated in low quality or with interruptions be forewarned of the crime you commit against yourself and the arts
Mar 8 2024,positive,perfectabsolutely perfect
Mar 8 2024,positive,six stars fantastically huge more jaw drops per hour than ever great storytelling and acting best picture director actors production costumes sound and hans zimmers score does it again omg

Mar 8 2024,positive,truly an epic film  it would bring people back to the big screen if it werent for the absurd number of advertisements
Mar 8 2024,positive,overall a good follow up to dune part one  did not follow the book in several aspects
Mar 8 2024,negative,this movie is long horrible unwatchable
Mar 8 2024,positive,breathtaking in every sense of the word visually stunning with flawless special effects the sound tracks pierce your soul sending shiver down the spine the build up and anticipation for each next scene kept my eyes glued to the screen always wanting more the story seems to accelerate as it goes on bound for oscar glory
Mar 7 2024,positive,great movie with a few plot twist i love it
Mar 7 2024,positive,i genuinely cannot think of a film that has captivated my mind like this one the story the visuals the sound everything about this film is perfection i wanted to give it a standing ovation when it finished i truly deserves all the praise it has been given     a masterpiece

Mar 7 2024,positive,ive seen it 4 times in a standard theater and twice in an imax theater imax wins its still a good story even though like denis v i read the novels when i was a teenager more than 50 years ago im so grateful he was able to make his dream come true and i am alive to witness it
Mar 7 2024,positive,loved it brain candy at its best
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the best scifi movies ever made and one of the best adaptations of a book ive ever seen maybe the best and dune is my favorite book of all time 1010
Mar 7 2024,positive,super intense genius film making with so many layers adapting an amazing book with so much lore   this topped the 1st film in everything somehow in its cinematography score and sound design never has the sound design taken on so much life in a film  i loved it and was totally immersed in arrakis the whole film i didnt want it to end   im not sure how some found it slow unless they are missing the subtleties and missing that you need to pay attention to every scene every image every sound as it all means something   that is what i love in a film denis villeneuve has made a masterpiece
Mar 7 2024,positive,dune part one was a great film that introduced the characters and their struggles in the war to produce enough spice for the emperor i loved the first one and continue to believe its a great film    dune part two on the other hand not only continues the spark part one set but plunges itself into a cinematic masterpiece    denis villeneuves take on the 1965 novel puts the scifi saga in an aweinspiring jawdropping form of filmmaking history that it far surpasses anything else of the sort    austin butler as a heath ledgerinspired foe is frightening christopher walken as the emperor isill admit a choicebut somehow works within these worlds    timothy chamalet as the young prince turned messiah becomes intriguing when that switch turns on leaving viewers wondering what kind of leader his paul atreides may end up becoming    hans zimmers score is powerful the scenery is beautiful and the storytelling is as if star wars met game of thrones    dune part two and even part one are modernday classics and have certainly become my alltime favorite films i can not wait to see what happens in the third installment because these movies blew me away
Mar 7 2024,positive,incredible movie truly a cinematic gem
Mar 7 2024,positive,second movie review ive ever done   this movie was just wow when my husband asked me to go to the theaters with him to watch it part one we watched at home i was a bit weary because its such a long movie and i knew i wouldnt be able to take breaks if i wanted to i will say though that not one time during this film did i feel like i wish i could take a break or wonder when we would arrive at the end it was gripping and beautiful from start to finish   do yourself a favor and go see this masterpiece
Mar 7 2024,positive,epic i will be going back to watch it a couple more times i loved it sooooooo good
Mar 7 2024,positive,i am so honored to have seen such a wonderful science fiction series in my life it has become my favorite movie
Mar 7 2024,neutral,its really great but still wildly overrated     did not really feel the chemistry between the two leads though more time should have been spent with them but it just ends up feeling like typical teen love in a monarchistic context
Mar 7 2024,positive,i watched dune few weeks before part two and i though it was boring well part two is a little bit better the action sequences the sound this movie is damn loud score the performances of the cast especially those of chalamet butler  ferguson were just amazinghowever the plot was just so complex and weird some scenes were pointless and didnt add much to story i know there many people that love it but its not my taste
Mar 7 2024,positive,stunning visuals and fantastic performances in this truly spectacular blockbuster
Mar 7 2024,positive,true to book with its cultural prejudices but still compelling  like a rogue lawrence of arabia
Mar 7 2024,positive,action packed  focused entertainment    i enjoy movies that are considered hard to follow  it keeps my attention drawn to each character and incident    i was delighted by the lack of ugly language  thanks to all the film makers and actors who made this a superb movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,great actors  great writers  great special effects  great cliff hanger
Mar 7 2024,positive,the movie exceeded my expectations the thriller was all there  the theater was awesome and the movie house was fantastic  it was a long movie but the explosive story line kept me on the edge of my seat constantly  i loved dune  part two and had a wonderful time seeing it  regal cinema is definately incredible at quaker crossing in orchard park  i sat in amazing comfort for the whole movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,great effects and they did a great job of distilling a complex story into something understandable
Mar 7 2024,negative,why to long  story is very poor save your money 
Mar 7 2024,positive,brilliant film  bring on dune messiah
Mar 7 2024,negative,the story line was too rushed in places and too long in others they didnt develop ideas fully enough before they move to a new scene
Mar 7 2024,positive,perhaps the finest cinematic experience since the two towers a little meandering and aimless in the first hour but as the first explosion happens so the movie explodes as well     by the end youre left in awe i cant wait to see this movie again one of dozens of future watches im sure
Mar 7 2024,positive,now that was cinema phenomenal score visuals and performances
Mar 7 2024,positive,breathtaking cinematography fantastic acting enchanting music unforgettable acting this movie is a masterpiece

Mar 7 2024,positive,not gonna lie this is the best cinematic experience ive had in 2024      the visuals  music is simply outstanding and the actors were phenomenal particularly zendaya  timothee im eagerly waiting for part 3 
Mar 7 2024,negative,worst movie of the year
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was one of those movies that  followed part 1 and did not disappoint you were able to stay focused on the story line with a few surprises thrown in cannot wait to see if part 3 gets made
Mar 7 2024,positive,loved the special effects the movie was very entertaining loved the scifi theme the acting was very good

Mar 7 2024,positive,probably the best movie ive seen in theaters 
Mar 7 2024,positive,fantastic wonderful
Mar 7 2024,positive,definitely one of the best movies ever
Mar 7 2024,positive,maybe better than the 1st movie definitely enjoyed javier bardems character more in part 2
Mar 7 2024,positive,hot take it was better than the back half of the book i had my quibbles mostly about wishing more of the ecological themes of the book were more present but overall what a sumptuous triumph
Mar 7 2024,positive,excellent movie the rhythm of the first part was perfect the scenes at the harkonnens planet were very well done the battle of arrakeen was too quick but i must say i enjoyed a lot paul giving his tactical orders on a small scale terrain model i found that very realistic i found the treatment of the character of alia very well thought i didnt have seen the time pass although the film was quite long
Mar 7 2024,negative,sorrybut this is not a great movie  it feels soulless and hollow the visuals did not capture my mind nor heart  zendaya is just meh  d for costumes and setdesign
Mar 7 2024,negative,as a 9th stage guild navigator i protest the exclusion from these movies we are central to why spice is being mined on arakkis because it is the substance which evolved us so that we can form wormholes in space fold space this is central to the evolution of all the landsraad across the galaxy plus too many narrative changes that arthur c clarke would not have approved of paul dissing chauni is bs paul as harkkonnen bs hinting paul becoming megalomaniacle bs the whole bene gesserit box testing feyd rautha bs ok so solution we need lynchs narrative and real actors replacing these covid era mediocre actors but dennis as art director ill give him that
Mar 7 2024,positive,an astonishing achievement
Mar 7 2024,positive,absolutely epic and made me goosebump greatest movie in 2024
Mar 7 2024,positive,this movie brought the perfect mix of scifi and adventure i lost myself while watching and even though i enjoyed part 1 part 2 simply blew me away the visuals were incredible the story was captivating the dialogue kept me interested the lore is fun to read about the creativity used to bring this universe to life was done perfectly this is the best movie ive seen in over a decade and i dont say that lightly they knocked it out of the park
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the best films ive seen in a while and definitely one to see on the big screen some of the visuals on the big dolby screen i saw it on were absolutely breathtaking and there were parts where i truly felt like i was in the desert the story is strong anyway but the film gets the pacing perfectly right enough narrative to give depth but ebbs and flows seamlessly between this and jawdropping action proper 1010 stuff
Mar 7 2024,positive,amazing effects and of course great story line loved the books and am loving this version of themcant wait for part 2
Mar 7 2024,positive,ive loved everything about this movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,loved it wonderful and captivating from the start  what a beautiful piece of work this film is  i was immersed in this film from start to finish  cast is spot on and chalamet is spectacular as paul attreides  i highly recommend this film
Mar 7 2024,positive,br é como se víssemos a criação de uma nova obra de arte um espetáculo simbólico audiovisual    eua its as if we saw the creation of a new work of art a symbolic audiovisual spectacle
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was totally a great follow up and stayed well within the book there was some overlap and inserted parts to cover description in the book but well done  cant wait for part three
Mar 7 2024,positive,this generations star wars and lotr rolled into one
Mar 7 2024,positive,everything positive everyone is saying about this movie is pretty much 100 true hope this lead to a new resurgence of truly quality films i came in with high expectations and they were surpassed in every metric the intricacy and attention to detail in every single aspect of this movie from the breathtaking scenes to the rich music scores perfectly paired with the rest of the movie i am not one to rewatch movies in theaters have max 23 times my whole life i think this will be 4
Mar 7 2024,positive,this 5 star rating is a testament to just how good everybody involved was because we didnt know the extended story of dune and the 34 years wait time for denis to get his team round the next slice which should have left us in a mad rage after two epic films but didnt because dune 1100 deserve the full treatment put ticks next to great acted characters cinematography hans on the musics pauls direction of the whole ambience as pt2  in fact big huge tick to cover the whole film story handling and everyone in it or who worked on it  i expect to be tucked into my imax holographic futuristic cinema booth by 2027 or i get a little more fiery  1010
Mar 7 2024,positive,great movie  was good to see a film at the cinema that deserved to be seen there
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the greatest cinematic events of our time an incredible blend of faithful adaptation creative and grounded special effects and great casting and acting packs so many events into one movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,enjoyed part 2 of dune a lot the two parts make for an outstanding audiovisual experience a bit disappointing that the story is clearly drug out for part 3 which seems to every producers strategy today pauls s transition toward the end would have benefited from a bit more clarity
Mar 7 2024,positive,cinematography is hauntingly good  the actors did something incredible  the sound sells the story   it might never be better than this
Mar 7 2024,positive,the best movie my life
Mar 7 2024,positive,every interaction every frame every ounce of dialogue matters we are blessed to have lived in yet another monumental denis villeneuve masterpiece 
Mar 7 2024,positive,dune is a great scifi franchise so far the original dune was one of my favorite movies growing up the new franchise is great so far looking forward to part 3 putting yourself in paul atreides shoes is a fun ride
Mar 7 2024,positive,wow that was an amazing movie my hands were tense the entire time with very little breathing room that culminated in amazing spectacle once this movie gets going it does not stop
Mar 7 2024,positive,dune part two is outstanding and a must see in imax incredible
Mar 7 2024,positive,best sci fifantasy movie ive seen since 2003
Mar 7 2024,positive,great adaptation of the book even when not 100 accurate but so much fun to watch every shot is a painting highly recommend
Mar 7 2024,positive,i found it  i think dv took too many liberties with the source material to bring it up to todays times great scenes fine acting
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was a remarkable achievement emphasizing the last movie and never skips a beat its very hard to come by a movie that will go into your top 10 anymore this is definitely top 3 it is this generations empire strike back 55
Mar 7 2024,positive,just see it for yourself
Mar 7 2024,positive,incredible cinematography  needs to be seen on a really big screen
Mar 7 2024,negative,3hrs and i kept checking the time on my phone huge let down the acting was terrible and also the dialogue just didnt cut it for me the action cgi sequences looked amazing and reminded me of empire strikes back but in a desert the contrived totalitarian colonialist and fundamentalist bravado was also boring paul going on about holy war i did like the concept of him being a fourth dimensional being after drinking the water of life giving him the ability to see both past and future i must admit the production design and interior  architectural sets really were phenomenal just overall the acting was super cringey except for austin butlers feydrathau pity he died in the end he was the least boring character in the whole movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,1010 did not miss a single beat and rythme to strong story telling to strong acting and cgi good job
Mar 7 2024,positive,for a 3 hour movie it was very good but went very quickly couldve dived into certain parts of the storyline more but incredible acting effects and story portrayal i hope theres a part three
Mar 7 2024,positive,captivating mind blowing this movie transports the viewer into the movie  special effects were on target  the best movie ive seen so far
Mar 7 2024,negative,no doubt the world of dune is extensive and complex but where for example the hobbit movie succeeded to stay true to the original story not counting the third part of it that what was completely unnecessary the dune 2nd part fails badly    stilgar is wrongly portrayed as a narrowminded overly religious desert fool lacking almost any sign of dignity and intelligence    the nuance that about three years pass between paul being accepted by fremen missing out that has a son with shani has a sister not talking from the womb of jessica but actually there  a child reverend mother and final battle are for some weird reason is missed outgets replaced by  well nothing of essence really and that is just for the starters   one of the very few positive points is the character of feydrautha and yes the impressive desert scenes with and without the worms   i wanted to like this movie so much but unfortunately i can not give it more than two stars  if you have read and liked the book id say youll do better skipping this movie as it is falls short on too many fronts
Mar 7 2024,positive,wow a masterpiece that need to be seen no matter if you are a fan of science fiction or not
Mar 7 2024,positive,it wasnt bad it was competent in the source material i still think david lynchs dune is a better work of art but it wasnt bad it was enjoyable there were subtitles though i didnt realize movies in the theater came in subtitles now for the hearingimpaired i applaud that for its inclusivity i just wish it was more clearly labeled on my ticket maybe it was either way it got me thinking why do i bother going to the theater any more the food was okay the beer was good but i cant smoke weed in the theater like i can at home while i enjoy the film why did i just drop 60 on mediocre food and a subtitled film i could have just turned off the subtitles at home sorry folks but i think ill be watching my films at home going forward so long and thanks for all the fish
Mar 7 2024,positive,the second part of the third liveactionfilm adaptation of the incredibly dense 1965 science fiction novel dune by frank herbert visually stunning and technically superb it suffers from some odd casting and storytelling choices that lead to a decidedly flat third act and frankly anticlimactic ending this is largely due to the source material one of those books that has often been described as unfilmable if youre unfamiliar with the source material you may love it if youre a fan of the novel youll likely find it a valiant but frustrating attempt
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was an awesome experience watching it on big screen i watch the first one on small screen the first part is slow burn but then the 2nd and final act was superb
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the greatest films i have ever seen   liked the first one but this was much much better
Mar 7 2024,positive,its a perfectly alright movie amazing visuals good acting but a fairly confusing and at times boring story worth a watch but not the greatest scifi movie ever like some would say
Mar 7 2024,positive,wow   yes the filmography is fantastic but the sound the sound is so impactful and masterfully done
Mar 7 2024,positive,probably one of the most emotional  beautiful movies ive seen  the combination of great acting screenplay music wowjust wow  some parts were dry but over all my hair stood on my skin watching it  it raised the bar even higher from dune part1 and now i cannot wait for part 3 bravo castcrewdirectors and mr zimmerman for such beauty when you make music
Mar 7 2024,positive,i still remember where i was when the first dune movie was announced now after all these years im even more excited for whats to come before watching the movie i read many praising articles and reviews but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it dune part two delivers exactly what it promises  a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written its a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most purehearted leaders to descend into chaos the film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the harkonnens and the fremens insane harmonization with their planet the fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed leaving a lasting impact on the viewer the investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on denis villeneuve has done it again and this time he has hit a home run collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation greig fraser denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema it not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself with its skillful use of practical sets lighting and digitized effects this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive they do not distract from its main focus which is the storytelling the film follows a love story that defies all odds as paul assumes the role of the messiah chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well in the first act pauls character undergoes significant changes he tries to distance himself from his mothers actions by joining the fremens cause to liberate their planet from tyranny however he remains unaware that jessicas plan is already in progress despite this the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments the empire is in a state of despair as the fremen successfully destroy the harkonnen spice reserves one by one this has pushed the bene gesserit to their limits and as a result the baron has deployed his most valuable weapon feyd rautha the second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable and to top it all off denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence in the end paul finally realizes what he has to do he takes the water of life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause but proceeds anyway by doing so he loses his one true love yet he stands his ground in an incredible handtohand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an emperor once again hans zimmers astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories i highly recommend watching this film in 70mm imax print if possible  lets all hope that dune messiah will become a reality
Mar 7 2024,positive,dune part two is a masterpiece this is art that deserves to be seen in the highest quality biggest possible screen and the loudest sound you can handle i was left speechless at the immense beauty of this truly epic and ambitious film it is a jawdropping and goosebumping experience i got nothing but praise    the film is visually stunning everything from the cinematography set design the production makeup costumes and the visual effects are all perfectly crafted the cinematographer greig fraser is brilliant and every film hes worked with are all pure visual artistry hans zimmer is back again with the music and score both dune films sound really incredible unique and just perfectly fitting theres really not much that can be said about hans zimmer if you know the guy the cast are of course excellent with some of the best talents in the industry     the staggering scope of this film is truly massive and ambitious the book by frank herbert is thought impossible to adapt and as one of the readers and fans of the novel i can really say so the richness in lore the character work the story and the complexity of the book is just too difficult to adapt but here comes one of my favorite filmmakers denis villeneuve he just brought dune to the big screen and he did the impossible job and he sure did it very well dune part one is great in its own right it laid the ground and served as an introduction dune part two is even more epic and twice the greatness it is the culmination of the entire dune story and it delivered magnanimously i just couldnt ask for a better film and better adaptation     both dune films are products of a passionate heart and a genius mind and also everyone involved in the film did a job well done we not only got a brilliant piece of literature we also got the adaptation it deserved for everyone to enjoy and be grateful for
Mar 7 2024,positive,where is the end
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen 
Mar 7 2024,positive,truly exceptional if ever you were looking for a reason to head back to the theater this is it i hands down recommend the imax version
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies of all time
Mar 7 2024,positive,breathtaking see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 7 2024,positive,best si fi movie that iv seen
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was visually stunning the costumes and effects were amazing all the actors deserve praise this was such a good movie and id 100 go to watch it again bring on part 3
Mar 7 2024,positive,great visuals had multiple scenes that felt very powerful and well done the beginning part was a bit slow but the second half of the movie was very long is a long movie so dont drink much before the movie starts
Mar 7 2024,positive,really enjoyed it  but left me feeling something wasnt coming together  have to say the ending had departures from the book that were odd guessing to save time from a film that was already long for theaters to tolerate  but while it was a definite lift from previous iterations of the material it didnt come together in the final acts to this viewers satisfaction  perhaps this material is so vast it requires a 10 episode 10 hours or 20 episode 20 hours series done by someone of quality like this films denis certainly is  par to hollywoods detriment the film spent a ton of time on female characters who were limited in book and didnt add to the total thus wasting time that could have allowed the story to unfold better to herberts excellence the author  this film while done to denis standards and quality in almost every dimension more honored previous medias key scenes with different final acts  huge fan of denis  im just not keen on the final acts here
Mar 7 2024,positive,its a beautifully stunning movie  the story is a beautiful unfolding of paul  jessica atriedes becoming accepted by the fremen   the cinematography is gorgeous  pauls first ride on a sandworm is breathtaking i found myself holding my breath watching this sequence  the fight sequences were a wonder to watch  i will be seeing this movie again and again i loved it
Mar 7 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Mar 7 2024,positive,loved every bit of it
Mar 7 2024,positive,epic film see it in 70mm imax
Mar 7 2024,positive,absolute perfection beautiful cinematography an amazing story made just to entertain if hollywood could learn from this movies could be good again paul is a great main character
Mar 7 2024,positive,this is a cinematic masterpiece the ensemble cast delivers a performance that is as moving as it is impactful the music and sound hit me in the soul finally cgi done right it feels real
Mar 7 2024,positive,peak scifi with masterful cinematography
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was excellent spoiler alert paul is painted as part villain and there is a plot shift where he kills the baron not his unborn sister  also chani does a runner which i cannot remember from the book a must see
Mar 7 2024,positive,i created a rotten tomato account just so i could give this movie 5 starts as a big fan of the books i thought nothing could top dune pt l and ive never been happier to be incorrect along with the original star wars trilogy and the blade runner movies this is one of the best scifi movies ever made cannot wait to see villeneuve bring messiah to life
Mar 7 2024,positive,saw this movie the second time now  i can see this receiving all accolades it deserves the stunning visuals and immersive and emotional sounds hans zimmer is pure genius make this movie a one of a kind gem kudos to denis villeneuve the cast and the team behind this immensely astonishing film  in my own words i would describe this film and its storytelling like a real vivid dream part of the fans now who will hope to remember and celebrate this movie for a loooong time     ps i highly recommend watching part one first oh i cant wait for the third movie and see anya 
Mar 7 2024,positive,i am seriously considering this as my favorite movie of all time its even better than the first one i am so shocked and impressed a group of 40 of us saw it and were so impacted
Mar 7 2024,neutral,very slow and boring until the end
Mar 7 2024,positive,it may not be my favorite 5 stars movie but i have this kind of feeling to had watch an amazing experience that will not disapear if i watch it again and again its a real new aventure at theather as star wars or lotr before it i hope there will be more to build a new incredible saga you may not love the story the way its adapted some choices right thats my case however the experience shocked me and its what a great film do i think it worth it
Mar 7 2024,neutral,impressive visuals but little suspense felt inevitable the fremen would win from the first scene
Mar 7 2024,positive,the movie was jam packed with action went to imax to watch it
Mar 7 2024,positive,this movie truely deserves a 55 rating more spectacular and reasonably paced than the first movie though bit confusing towards the end  what was the emperor doing in  the ferman land trying to get captured i guess lol but overall great movie great casting  javier bardem zendaya rebacca ferguson and josh brolin all rocking it
Mar 7 2024,positive,i very rarely give movies 5 stars but this one lives up to the hype and exceeds it cant wait for part 3
Mar 7 2024,positive,im speechless  a masterpiece  one of the greatest movies of all time
Mar 7 2024,negative,big fan of the novel and i really like dune part 1 but part 2 is not good the first film followed the novel fairly closely this one departs radically from the original story its been said that the novel is unfilmable but i guess well never know since villaneuve decided to re write the second half of the story so that it became a film about chani the movie is about 2 hours of watching zendaya and chalamet whine and cry about fears and feelings in a picturesque desert landscape there are a solid 45 minutes of actual story progression engagement and action if you wanted to see a film about an angry looking young man named chani and his boyfriend paul working out relationship issues in the desert this is your film if you hoped for a worthy follow up to the first film you struck out i dont think this even needed to be a stand alone film since its largely comprised of filler scenes and pointless dialogue i think wed have all been better served if the 2 hours of filler were just deleted and dune part 1 was made into a 4 hour epic ala lawrence of arabia seriously chani and irulan are both very minor characters in the novel in this film we see more of chani than any other character including paul and irulan is much more pervasive than gurney or stilgar in fact stilgar has become some sort of laughable comic relief character like dunes version of c3po not sure why these decisions were made but a ball got dropped somewhere this film isnt a travesty like the last jedi but it certainly is a disappointment
Mar 7 2024,positive,that timothy chalamet is so hot right now javier bardem steals the show zendaya is cold as sand
Mar 7 2024,positive,only sad im gonna have to wait years for this series to continue gonna have to turn to the books
Mar 7 2024,positive,at certain moments i got chills which makes me think that this movie series has the potential to be classic material only time will tell i personally had a great time
Mar 7 2024,positive,the first 40 minutes building the know characters put more moved a bit slowly but after that the pace was perfect and story beautifully constructed it could have been longer by 30 minutes once the story took off
Mar 7 2024,positive,i love this movie ive seen it twice now
Mar 7 2024,positive,one of the best film in history its absolutely cinema
Mar 7 2024,positive,this is a very good sifi movie we like it very much
Mar 7 2024,positive,dune part 2 was a fantastic movie with great action and amazing performances by the cast
Mar 7 2024,positive,amazing visuals and soundtrack
Mar 7 2024,positive,my husband and i really enjoyed this movie and plan to go back to see it again in theaters such a great story of a boy growing into a man and learning to work hard to lead others as he tries to put revenge and saving his new friends and community at the top of his priority while struggling to follow his love and love of the people or   fate loved every second great fight scenes knives guns bombs and desert worms it was amazing
Mar 7 2024,positive,i liked this movie  dune part 1 and part 2 now made more sense after seeing part 2  i never read the books but it was so much better than the dune 1984 version  but growing up with the 84 version i have a little more nostalgia for some parts of it  overall this new version was great  i wished they had more scenes with the sandworms  this makes me now want to read the books  hopefully wb will do the other books as well
Mar 7 2024,positive,very good movie looking forward to part 3
Mar 7 2024,positive,great action consistent with original book
Mar 7 2024,negative,it was very dark violent and kind of depressing basically kill them all i know its supposed to be good vs evil but the slaughter is excessive
Mar 7 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece cannot wait to see it again
Mar 7 2024,positive,visually the movie looked fantastic the fight scenes are extremely well done about halfway through the movie i felt like the pace slowed down a little but it picked back up i think its a must see at least once but with how long it is and how complicated the plot can be at times rewatchabilitly might not be the best overall great movie best experience in theater
Mar 7 2024,positive,an absolute blast of a movie visually stunning would 100 recommend someone to go watch it this is the epitome of cinema as a format
Mar 7 2024,positive,i had the pleasure of seeing the 70mm film reel version of dune part 2 this was simply the apex cinematic experience the movie is absolutely firing on all cylinders with epic scale attention to detail cinematography art direction and score all a the story of dune is the greatest science books series ever written and this was a great adaption of that material in the penultimate entry to this triology
Mar 7 2024,positive,great job taking off from where the first movie left off its kinda hard to believe skinny ass timothe chalamet is really this big time fighter but other than that the rest of the casting is solid story is strong plenty of action lovesex could be increased but probably wanted to draw in the children audience
Mar 7 2024,positive,excellent especially in imax
Mar 7 2024,negative,i really dont understand what people find good about this movie it is awful
Mar 7 2024,positive,visually this movie is stunning and the score of this movie is equally as amazing the storyline is very interesting but i did feel the movie dragged on a bit towards the end
Mar 7 2024,positive,loved it  cant wait for the next movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,amazing movie great cinematics great sound and a very very shocking twist definitely a movie for the books
Mar 7 2024,positive,all actors were great especially timothee chalamet  zendaya was good too but a little too obstinate  hated austin butlers voice  anya taylorjoy was only in it for 14 seconds  did not like the ending didnt realize they were setting it up for another sequel  did not like that they letterboxed it on the big screen  still an awesome movie
Mar 7 2024,neutral,cinimatic was outstanding the producer deviated too far from the books and the ending was highly unsatisfactory in that it left out several critical feel good parts and the viewer is left with an obvious hole that probably will be filled in during a dune 3 if such a thing ever happens
Mar 7 2024,positive,great visuals engaging story wonderful theater experience
Mar 7 2024,positive,filmed beautifully  sound was absolutely amazing  acting was phenomenal
Mar 7 2024,positive,incredible visually with great score fantastic job bringing the story to the screen  really well done even if you have not read the novel
Mar 7 2024,negative,i enjoyed the book and the 1985 film which i walked out of at the end feeling exhilarated  not so with this film yes great spectacle sound and effects but i found this film boring  the acting rather poor and the story was really not conveyed  i reluctantly stayed for the whole thing hoping it might eventually redeem itself but it never did
Mar 7 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the interaction and tension between paul and chani  the scope of the desert  the loyalty of the fremen   i thought the final knife fight scene was well played  the ending felt a bit lacking hanging but ok
Mar 7 2024,positive,very good follow up to dune the story has some deviations to the book but it is still very accurate the acting is amazing all around the action cgi and filming makes a very solid ensemble the music transport the film more then you know quite frankly i have very little negative to say about it you must see it in theatre to enjoy it fully i give it 90 some says its like another empire strikes back it surely has the vibe of it but it is its own thing
Mar 7 2024,positive,this a a good movie so nice to enjoy free time from news doom and gloom highly recommend this movie
Mar 7 2024,positive,i feel obligated to create an account on rotten tomatoes just to tell that this movie is the best  have seen in all my life looking  forward to the part three and im starting to reading all book trilogy
Mar 7 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece cant wait to watch it again
Mar 7 2024,negative,the movie was soo boring i almost fell asleep i cant understand anything they should not even consider making a dune 3
Mar 7 2024,positive,the movie was breathtaking the cinematography the actors and everything were sublime 1210  
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was very good i really enjoyed the story line and the great special effects
Mar 7 2024,positive,its entertaining and thats what i go for  is it like the book well maybe about 70 but the 30 thats changed imho very much changes the tenor of the story  there are some very slow parts but overall not bad
Mar 7 2024,positive,honestly it was too long of a movie but felt like they cut so much of the ending of the movie i was so confused on what was happening
Mar 7 2024,positive,very well written the pacing was perfect the acting superb  very few weak moments in the movie the special effects really worked well but one fight scene in particular avoided the short scene version in my opinion  the only way this story gets told better is by making it twice as long again yes some suspension of disbelief is needed  but overall an excellent film  i do feel the main actor is undersized for the role but hard to knock his performance
Mar 7 2024,positive,the atreides score that plays throughout the movie was hauntingly beautiful    ill take your daughters hand  and lead them to paradise gave me chills   also love this line whats happening mother your brother attacks the great houses the holy war begins so powerful   this was both amazing and heartbreaking to watch    1010 flim
Mar 7 2024,positive,the movie constantly kept at your feet never wrote and felt a movie as this one constantly creating emotion within you even with the minimal dialogue the cinematic  were spectacular and put star wars to shame feeling the story feel real
Mar 7 2024,negative,snore fest  timmy boy about as exciting as a wet towel  at least zendaya had some fire and spark  bardem tried hard to move it forward but was like pushing a timmy boy rock uphill
Mar 7 2024,positive,everything you wanted for part 2 is here in this movie if you liked the book you will like this movie if you liked part one you will love part 2 pacing is on point and action feels larger than life on the big screen
Mar 7 2024,positive,very excitingspecial effects are wonderful
Mar 6 2024,positive,awesome beautiful visuals unique believable action scenes intriguing subtle details in the places that matter models vs cgi works well and venevue is a fine director in that regard battle scenes lasers artillery and even nukes were a glorious addition i was hoping for but umm dont you need to take cover from atomic blasts anyways the movie is faithful to the book which was nice however there are quite a few moments of amateur acting painfully obvious 1takes and cheese lines that zendaya girl needs acting lessons for god sakes as for christopher walken i love that guy but perhaps due to his age he had absolutely zero of his past style and flair for this film perhaps its time for him to retire even josh brolin seemed flat and uninspired maybe covid cut backs and time restraints hampered this film otherwise who are these awful dialogue writers venevue is hiring for his otherwise spectacular scifi films one scene where paul has an aspergers fit yelling thats not hope after his mother had me running to pick up his ritalin rx at the pharmacy all in all its a mustsee but couldve been more polished venevue doesnt do director or alternate cuts unfortunately so it is what it is the spice must flow
Mar 6 2024,positive,this was a perfect scifi movie part 1 was boring but this wakes you up to a whole new universe best scifi to me with foundationlove dune 
Mar 6 2024,positive,if you enjoyed the previous dune youll really enjoy dune ii we really liked it
Mar 6 2024,positive,dazzling spice this is the best movie ive seen in years production value plot speed emotional connection cast  all 1010 i want to watch it again and again
Mar 6 2024,positive,its was amazing movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,solid 10 exceeded expectations all around must must see in theatres preferably imax been a dune fan since the 80s and so happy i got to see this with my son best movie in a long time
Mar 6 2024,positive,best true science fiction movie of my life i was left stunned the audience cheered and clapped at the end something i have not seen since the 80s blockbusters have returned
Mar 6 2024,negative,i like the movie ok but im tired of zendaya being like a bigger part of the story than paul atredes and im tired of her sulking all the time zendaya is over rated and only plays one character the story is super dumbed down they didnt even tell people what the spice was about im not seeing part 3 i have no idea why everyone loves it but i dont
Mar 6 2024,positive,in awe of this movie after watching it yesterday unbelievable the music as well  a time of quiet between the storms its a magical piece of music from hans what a film could go down in history as one of the best ever
Mar 6 2024,positive,the best movie ever cant wait to see it again
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing film truly an amazing achievement
Mar 6 2024,positive,a visual epic that is nearly beyond comprehension villanueva delivers his vision to the screen with an arsenal of a cast that is in impeccable form throughout master class
Mar 6 2024,positive,phenomenal movie  best i have seen in a long time
Mar 6 2024,positive,a more serious trip into the dune universe those who liked the 80s movie with its pomp and pagentry might find this version a bit flat however the effects were great and the cinematography was beautiful worth the trip to see it on the big screen
Mar 6 2024,positive,i like movies that are long as long as they are entertaining and this one sure was
Mar 6 2024,positive,masterpiece dune will go down in history and become a scififantasy classic
Mar 6 2024,positive,after all the hype ive heard about this movie i finally went to see it today  i can only think that because everyone says its amazing that everyone that follows parrots the same thought and opinions about dune part 2 because they think they should like it  it was beautiful to look at no doubt but the story left me utterly bored in places i couldnt sit through it again   and others in the theatre  were actually laughing at the movie for instance when everyone was riding the worms and using them like buses people were laughing hard
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best scifi movies ive ever seen the writing story telling acting and visuals are all top notch chalamet and zendaya are the future of hollywood rebecca ferguson was also incredible please see this on the largest screen available thank me later
Mar 6 2024,negative,more overhyped cgi poop on a platter i dont know what movie any of these critics and people who are giving it rave reviews are watching but its gotta be something other than what i saw and these people have obviously never read the books cgi effects wise some things are great but for the most part its just nonsensical and is even far off book in lots of ways none of the actors convey any sort of conviction or belief in the parts and lines they deliver it seems as if they just took a bunch of notable actors and had them regurgitate their lines in 1 take and saidyeah thatll do dont waste your time just stick with the original 1984 david lynch adaptation or better yet read the books and imagine it as frank herbert intended
Mar 6 2024,positive,picks up right after the first and is as good as you would think so well done between story and his rise
Mar 6 2024,positive,great movie however its quite violent and should have been rated r for this reason not for the faint of heart for sure
Mar 6 2024,positive,loved itbest scifi ever
Mar 6 2024,positive,fantastic a great way to develop from what we saw in part one and it just seems like the best is yet to come
Mar 6 2024,positive,how do i give this more stars timothee chalamet paul turns in an insanely haunting performance thats subtle until its not then he explodes watching part 1 before part 2 emphasizes that slow change of paul pushing more that narrative that hes struggling morally and the second he makes a choice he leaves you chilled to the core what an immense tear through this complex lore and history that he made look effortless speaking of effortless lets talk about zendaya chani and austin butler feydrautha absolutely dominating their screen time ive never seen her look so betrayed ive never seen him be so absolutely psychotic any hand to hand combat is absolutely committed to my memory because the three of them were at their highest peak in part 2 i think i could word vomit about this for hours days weeks months ive never seen something so close to the books in my life bravo denis
Mar 6 2024,positive,better than part  one
Mar 6 2024,positive,always worried when a book i love is made into film this exceeds any expectation loved it  will see again and again hope his film of dune messiah is released in my lifetime
Mar 6 2024,positive,excellent acting special effects and fights but a weird continuity thing at the end
Mar 6 2024,positive,good action great overall filming time flew by
Mar 6 2024,positive,sometimes drawn out but still worth watching  cant wait for part three
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune part two was even better than i dreamed it would be beautiful and impressive
Mar 6 2024,positive,a movie that deserves the title epic this adaptation of the book takes some calculated liberties which pay off in making the story fresh exploring some of the characters and giving this work real relevance truly a triumph
Mar 6 2024,positive,we have mixed feelings as i had a little higher expectations but that said the movie did enough to make us agree that we will see the next one when it comes out
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune is the new gold standard form exceptional world building whether in the realm of sciencefiction or fantasy super casting great acting brilliant design and execution of all visual effects that seem astonishingly real a brilliantly crafted film in every way
Mar 6 2024,positive,good movie very good actualy
Mar 6 2024,positive,incredible sequel plenty of moments in this movie where the acting directing and music were as good as it gets 
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best films ive seen in theater ever see it on the best screen possible preferably an imax screen its worth it
Mar 6 2024,positive,awesome awesome awesome even better than the first one part iii will be unbelievable  cant wait
Mar 6 2024,positive,such a good movie denis villeneuve might just be my new favourite director ive ordered my copy of the dune book and have been listening to dune lore podcasts all day today since watching the film last night its really lit a fire under me the movie is so epic so original so imaginative so dark and weird and mysterious and captivating the cinematography is vast and masterful the costume design is badass and hyperrealistic as though were really seeing what life is like 20000 years in the future the sound is disturbingly awesome too not just with hans zimmers huge sweeping wave sounds but the subtle background sounds that make the whole alien nature of this world come alive the plot is followable enough that it hooks you but theres enough left unsaid that leaves you wondering and wanting to learn more the dialogue too is poetic and uncliched and the acting and the settings and the action scenes and the effects and everything else is so cool and mystifying and intriguing     you know when you read a kid a story and sometimes they get so into it that they start mimicking the actions of the characters in the story unconsciously swinging the sword as the hero swings his well i caught myself nearly doing this a few times in the cinema some of the fight scenes were so intense i was flinching my legs in support     just a really good film i loved the first movie but the second has really cemented for me how special these movies are a modern classic go watch it
Mar 6 2024,positive,an absolutely superb movie and adaptation as a long time fan of the book i was moved to tears by just how beautifully this brings herberts worlds to life great acting and awesome visuals with a magnificent soundtrack
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie is phenomenal i have seen it three times twice in imax highly recommend to watch this in imax as it is intended to be seen and once in standard it has to be one of the best movies made in my lifetime that i have seen  although the first movie might have been slow it was perfect world building for this movie and its ultimate conclusion  after watching this movie and the first it is safe to say that i want more and i will be resorting to the books to scratch that itch for dune that i have
Mar 6 2024,positive,this is one of the best movies i have ever watched and the best scifi bar none
Mar 6 2024,positive,exciting emotional sequel to the already amazing dune by denis villeneuve stellar performances amazing music absolutely aweinspiring visuals well worth seeing on the biggest screen possible
Mar 6 2024,negative,walkedout after about 20 minutes boring moments of brutal violence  sacrilegious commentarywaste of time
Mar 6 2024,positive,i think as a 65 year old movie attendee we need to bring back intermission for restroom breaks and snacks for movies over two hours long
Mar 6 2024,positive,lifelong fan of the books delighted by this adaptation
Mar 6 2024,positive,great movie but not sure why most of the battles and fighting are still with swords and knives in an era of galactic travel   the ending seems to leave the door open for a part 3 not based on the books i presume and hopefully not going the same way as the disappointing ending of game of thrones 
Mar 6 2024,negative,part 2 seemed very cheap and small scale next to the first didnt like it
Mar 6 2024,positive,truly stunning cinematography and scenery the acting was superb from everyone as well as the buildup for dramatic scenes i thought that the attention to detail really helped tell the story  like the focus on the sand snorkels before fighters rose from the sand for an attack the focus on the thumper calling the worms the focus on all of the steps taken in preparation for attaching lines to a worm in order to ride them    i will not rate this as a perfect movie in order to carry the storyline there were some detours from the original storyline that would have helped to define the timeframe and buildup like the personal loss of paul and chanys baby boy  but as a sequel this was a spectacular movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,fantastic story amazing cinematography and epic sound  try to see it in imax  its awesome
Mar 6 2024,positive,its a big budget movie for those who havent read the book those of us who have will cringe at the deviations to the point they will wonder if the director actually read the book or just the cliff notes
Mar 6 2024,positive,my teen daughters said that it was so good but they are disappointed with the cliff hanger
Mar 6 2024,positive,powerful with a tremendous story that follows frank herberts book relatively well  strongly recommend seeing it in an imax theater  it will feel like you are riding the sandworm yourself
Mar 6 2024,positive,its the best thing ive ever seen in my life if i was obsessed with the dune saga before now ill be obsessed for life
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune 2 is a cinematic marvel that captivates from start to finish the visuals are breathtaking transporting audiences to a vivid and immersive world the cast delivers stellar performances bringing depth and emotion to their characters the storyline is engaging blending action drama and intrigue seamlessly the films score enhances every scene adding to the epic atmosphere overall dune 2 is a mustsee for fans of science fiction and cinema alike offering a thrilling and unforgettable experience
Mar 6 2024,positive,i have to wait for dune 3
Mar 6 2024,positive,the movie flows very well making its runtime that surpasses its predecessor not only feel like it went by quicker but had me in the theater wishing for more the acting was amazing a standout was javier bardem as stilgar he stole the show most times he was on screen even while zendaya and timothée chalamet are delivering both of their best performances in my opinion there is next to no filler in the film so use the restroom before the movie because if you step out during it you may be lost at some parts overall this is now one of my favorite movies and i would recommend anyone who watched the first film to go experience this one and anyone who hasnt watched the first film to watch both as soon as possible
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune 2 a sequel better than the original and just a overall amazing story characters and action   negatives some fight scenes were shot kinda meh some scenes felt like they could be cut and trim down  mixed the runtime was kind a little to much but its not that terrible but felt it could speed up a little   positives the story was top notch this sequel was just as amazing as the first film 1 new character played by austin butler was a badass and reminded me of frieza timothée chalamet was just as amazing in this film than the first and he definitely grew there was 2 surprises that i didnt see coming and i was wowed every returning character was great in this film especially zendaya josh brolin and javier bardem the action sequence were shot amazing and the visuals were breathtaking the final battle with 2 important characters was shot amazing and i felt every impact the ending was awesome and just left me on a massive cliffhanger and i want more now  to sum up dune 2 its a sequel just as amazing as the first film the characters were amazing the story was amazing the visuals were breathtaking the scope and scale amazing all the greatness aside the runtime could have been trim a bit and cut 10 minutes other than that problem i loved this film and is among my favorite sequels i give dune 2 45 loved it see it
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing cinematography and sound a masterpiece
Mar 6 2024,positive,story visuals and soundtrack are mesmerizing picks up right from part 1 it grabs you right away and does not let you go so much happens that its worth watching 2 or 3 times to really absorb the plot and characters
Mar 6 2024,positive,part 2 is so good its feel like paul was born to be a king born to be hero as the movie is born to be lisan al gaib the lady moms paul is a smart character too she make me feel that all the things sheve done or planed is for paul and her daughter chani is dune part 2 have more scene than part 1 which is good paul finally revenge for his father and his people as my view   the time 3 hours would never be enough i can watch all day long  the content super duper positive   the music soooo good  the scene perfect  you can randomly take a photo and make it become yours background image    you must watch as imax scene its very worth your money and i cant wait to watch part 3 of dune
Mar 6 2024,neutral,completely mediocre to me  i thought the original movie was better dune 1 was also better at times i was truly bored  the acting was average at best  especially the lead character tremendous hype for this movie  i would only recommend it if you had nothing else to do
Mar 6 2024,positive,enthralling story telling with fantastic scenes and music
Mar 6 2024,positive,didnt like the character changes from the book especially alia there was not enough time jump 7 or 8 months with the fremen is not enough and the end seemed rushedconfusing those knowing the story well might be disappointed those not knowing the story would just be confused should have been three movies tbh
Mar 6 2024,positive,awesome special effects gotta give them credit for that chalamets transition from a goodhearted guy to someone embracing the destructive fate he tried to dodge is pretty smooth but hey some plot bits dont quite click first hes sent on this crazy desert journey to prove himself and bam next scene hes back chillin with the fremen then zendayas all grossed out packing her bags to head north but whoop next scene shes back in the south with him feels like the director went for a marathon movie and then chopped out some story bits still cool effects and a wild ride overall
Mar 6 2024,positive,intelligent and engaging story about religious myths manipulation of the masses power and abuse of it our 12 and 15 year old ranked it as one of the best movies they have ever seen and i agree at least visually great acting and since we had just seen wonka around christmas wow chalamet is a really great actor not just good great theatre imax berlin germany
Mar 6 2024,positive,not the be all end all of film but a solid sequel good action in latter half
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune part one was awesome dune part 2 is just drawdropping epic everything about it from start to end was amazing i thought i already knew the story so it wont surprise me but i was dead wrong the way the story was told with this movie is just best motion picture award worthy and countless awards this is a must watch film on imax
Mar 6 2024,positive,loved the photography clever use of cinematic elements for narrative storytelling and beautiful visuals brought by villeneuve epic soundtrack from hans zimmer just a great film overall watching it was a delight
Mar 6 2024,positive,saw in imax format and wow was it worth it incredible visuals with insanely immersive sound had me wanting part 3 as soon as the movie was over so good
Mar 6 2024,positive,great movie the visuals and acting was top notch but the lack of proper character development keeps this from being a 5 star for me
Mar 6 2024,positive,a visual masterpiece but the vibe feels very different from part one
Mar 6 2024,negative,a movie of incoherent tediumtimmy the charisma of a wimpmuch quasi religious mumbo jumbolots of beach shots and worms hidden by sand wormsdid rebecca ferguson fall asleep face down on a newspaper
Mar 6 2024,positive,brilliant adaptation of the books
Mar 6 2024,positive,i like the movie a lot but i think thats because its such a great continuation of the first movie  im not sure how it would work as an independent feature but im not saying that it couldnt hold its own  im saying that its an excellent continuation of the first one  i didnt realize the length of the film until the movie ended and i saw the time  i never felt a need to look away or lose interest
Mar 6 2024,positive,this was a great movie as someone who read and loved dune this movie was a fantastic representation of the book it doesnt match perfectly but all the key parts are there i felt like i was on the edge of my seat even though i already knew what was going to happen there were some powerful moments that i think they did a great job of bringing to life action packed from start to finish fantastic immersion and visuals
Mar 6 2024,positive,beautiful movie great soundtrack    because it had been so long since i watched dune 1 i spent parts of this movie having no idea what was going on definitely rewatch the first movie before viewing this one     but thats on me for doing a rewatch beforehand
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune part two  97  lisan al gaib dune part two was nothing short of a cinematic marvel truly living up to the immense hype surrounding it timothee chalamets performance was nothing less than spectacular as we witness his mesmerizing transformation into a messianic figure every scene unfolds as a visual spectacle immersing us even deeper into the captivating world introduced in part one the meteoric rise of timothees character to power is portrayed with sheer brilliance offering a captivating glimpse into the internal struggles paul endures the film masterfully navigates the tension between his visions of leadership and the harsh reality he faces the seeds planted by his mother come to fruition delivering a powerful narrative a surprising twist involving zendaya adds a layer of complexity to the storyline as she becomes a pivotal force in the movie only to be left behind when strategic alliances take precedence the opening scenes thrust us back into this mesmerizing world showcasing freman battles and paul earning respect with each step stilgars role as the ultimate hypeman provides a boost to pauls confidence making for compelling character dynamics the breathtaking wormriding scene adds another dimension to the film leaving us eagerly anticipating more encounters with these iconic creatures in future installments denis villeneuve and his team have undeniably set a new standard for scifi sequels seamlessly blending storytelling pacing action romance and suspense the exceptional acting seemingly flawless casting choices and the overall cinematic experience make dune part two an unparalleled journey as good as advertised this film deserves a spot on your mustwatch list head to your local cinema and immerse yourself in a world that transcends expectations  i strongly recommend experiencing this on the big screen official sundaynightstreaming rating of 97
Mar 6 2024,positive,a beautifully faithful adaptation of frank herberts thrilling novel timothe chalamet zendaya and austin butler lead the next generation of young actors while stellan skarsgrd rebecca ferguson and javier bardem give some of their best performances to date the visual effects are amazing and the action scenes are so well done a morally grey movie that makes you think but one that will thrill you oscar nominations are on the way for this movie bring on dune messiah
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie is good in every perspective
Mar 6 2024,positive,plot was pretty in line with the book good action and cgi sometimes background effects were so loud you couldnt hear dialogue
Mar 6 2024,positive,best movie of 2024 would love to watch the third part
Mar 6 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal one of if not the best scifi movies of all time such great execution cannot wait to see the next one denis villeneuve has in store for us
Mar 6 2024,positive,im still in awe after watching dune part 2 it was absolutely mindblowing to realize i was just watching one of the greatest movies ever made thats how good it is
Mar 6 2024,positive,beautiful entertaining cinematic on every front this movie is a masterpiece
Mar 6 2024,neutral,rather boring so much droning overly dramatic music but too little action  i felt this movie was just a filler to get from part 1 to part 3
Mar 6 2024,positive,great movie saw it in imax seeing again in imax do yourself a favor see it in imax you will be blown away
Mar 6 2024,positive,no spoiler review   i love movies that i can watch twice this movie as well as the first  is a movie that can be watched multiple times while still maintaining the interest and amusement   i see this franchise becoming the next star wars or lord of the rings with each movie ending in an anticipation for the next one   this particular one was more of a romance genre however  it packed enough action and adventure that it kept me locked in   most movies in theaters are predictable and can get strung out however  this is not the case i found myself gasping at a particular point and that never happens  the only reason i didnt give it a full 5 star is how it ended it needs more closure in case a third never comes out then well be stuck creating our ending   dont miss out on watching this movie on the big screen you wont be disappointed
Mar 6 2024,positive,well done this movie is a masterpiece
Mar 6 2024,positive,continuing series  like starwars
Mar 6 2024,positive,took my daughter to see this and she loved it now i gotta see part i havent seen her this excited about a film  in a while what can i say after almost 40 years since david lynchs film adaptation fans of the 1984 film and the book finally get a film franchise worth spending money on definitely going to see it again in imax next time
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen and likely the greatest scifi movie ever made
Mar 6 2024,positive,the movie was better than dune 1  action filled and a little sad in places
Mar 6 2024,positive,please please please continue this saga with this director this kind of film making gives me hope for the future of movies
Mar 6 2024,positive,absolutely gorgeous movie everything was so good its not the book but its a wonderful thing of its own  hopefully we can get a third
Mar 6 2024,neutral,great special effects  good transition of chalamet from a good heart to one who is accepts the destructive fate he tried to avoid  however some of the plot elements dont hang together 1 he is asked to go on a long treacherous journey through the desert to prove himself yet in the next scene he back with the fremen again  2 zendaya is disgusted with him and pack her bags to go back north yet in the next scene shes back with him in the south  seems like the director made a longer movie then had to edit out parts of the story
Mar 6 2024,positive,by far one of the best films i have ever seen in theaters blown away
Mar 6 2024,positive,a cinema experience unforgettable the sound score visuals everything was perfect
Mar 6 2024,positive,it is possibly the best cinematic experience i have had in my life well done
Mar 6 2024,positive,smart cool gorgeous  nearly everything about the film is stunning  the deviations from the book are totally forgivable
Mar 6 2024,positive,grand is the word id definitely be up for part 3 which you start to anticipate about half way through given its actual pace the journey is highly engaging and stunning to look at though there were however some odd scene shifts and dangling plot lines and if anything the film increased my admiration for the unfairly maligned david lynch effort which covered the same material and more in a single film highly recommended however
Mar 6 2024,positive,lots of fun  only minor quibbles from one of my favorite novels
Mar 6 2024,positive,just seen this movie and it might be one of the coolest movies ive seen in the last few years the cast is perfect almost every great actor which hollywood has its very welldirected shout out to the director    the only thing that i didnt like is how long it is i think its extended to eternity    in conclusion its a mustseeabsolutely the greatest sequel
Mar 6 2024,positive,saw it twice in imax boy i never had goosbumps like this watching a movie this is perfection in every sense of the word watch it in cinema enjoy life
Mar 6 2024,positive,epic in every way while still spending time on the characters and making sure theres emotional stakes not flawless but a dang good time at the movies and the most gorgeous movie ive ever seen villeneuve hits another one out of the park
Mar 6 2024,positive,trust me this has been the most captivating cinematic experience ive had all year denis villeneuve has truly surpassed himself with this masterpiecea remarkable comingofage creation the cinematography is nothing short of enchanting greig frasers visuals are stunning as always demonstrating his mastery behind the camera while all the actors delivered commendable performances its paul and zendaya who truly shine their chemistry resonating effortlessly  all that being said the film is visually breathtaking if you enjoyed the first part youre sure to love the second this is a cinematic journey you cant afford to miss make sure catch it on the big screen
Mar 6 2024,positive,greate combination of story and technology   while scifi movie are mostly depend upon vfx dune part two give you chance to see mesmerizing collaboration of character building  acting skills story telling and nevertheless mind bongling larger than life size vfx and cinematic marveolous
Mar 6 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time the sound effects and cinematography are incredible
Mar 6 2024,positive,villeneuve shows that he is a genius in being able to adapt the dune books to the big screen effectively the visuals are spectacular with great performances from the cast
Mar 6 2024,positive,i had so much fun watching it i liked the quick plot realistic battle scenes subtle conflicts on the love front the emperors shaky authority and fall and the complete disappearance of rival forces im looking forward to part 3 in particular the process of becoming a fremen and the siege of arrakis will likely remain in my memory in the future
Mar 6 2024,positive,the nearly three hours can be a little exhausting but the effort is compensated quite well by the development of the plot and characters and its a blessing that you dont have to read the original book to understand everything waiting for the next chapter
Mar 6 2024,positive,it shouldnt be called part two because it was a sequel to the first it was the same movie  just redone dune redone
Mar 6 2024,positive,the second half of the book is better than the first and while part one was great this is breathtaking just like in the book once the fremen arrive on the scene things really get interesting what an adaptation this is a stunning achievement by villeneuve amazing casting extraordinary effects the soundtrack is astonishing and the action doesnt let up all the while staying so faithful to the original story
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing story music and visuals loved it
Mar 6 2024,positive,great adaptation of the book  somedetails were ommitted for the movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,i wish i would have seen it on imax but i did see it in a theater with dolby atmos and the soundstage was incredible the story was fantastic too and i cant wait to see it again
Mar 6 2024,positive,definitely watch this in imax the sound makes you rumble in your seat especially the whole sandworm scene  youll know which one im talking about
Mar 6 2024,positive,action packed throughout the movie great storyline 
Mar 6 2024,positive,this is the greatest movie i have ever seen in theaters hands down from the acting to the score and the cinematography i cant remember any experience that has come close to this go see this movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,constant action outstanding effects
Mar 6 2024,negative,the first movie gave me hope that someone other than the tv miniseries might honor the writting of herbert this movie ruined that for me not even close to the book
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie went hard from start to finish so much character development and story to see in this film
Mar 6 2024,positive,best sci fi movie ive ever seen probably the best film of 2024 i bet its definitely gonna snatch up some oscars the only thing that took me out of it was christopher walkens portrayal of the emperor other than that fantastic film
Mar 6 2024,positive,for fans of the series the display of this one was excellent  solid amount of storytelling and charecter development  good balance of action and conversation  i thought their were some parts that could have used even more background but the movie would have had to be another hour
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen in my life especially as a fan of frank heberts work even with some changes i thought it was a very sensational film
Mar 6 2024,positive,keeps you on the edge of the seat for its whole run time the characters are fleshed out each frame of this movie was made with love for the craft
Mar 6 2024,positive,the comparison between the two movies and the book is unfair the book is much better than the movies theres no denying that the first part of dune was a reasonable adaptation this second part was a very good adaptation however beyond being an adaptation dune part one was a good movie whereas this dune part two was a very good movie  if we stick to the film as an adaptation it will lower its rating but if we focus on the film as a pure and simple cinematic work its a great film and surely if not the best film of the year it will be among the top 5 its a movie to be seen and rewatched in the cinema at least twice its genuinely good
Mar 6 2024,positive,lisan al gaib very epic movie ganyan dapat mga movies ngayon 1010 overall i also like the cinematographyp
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was so good i love the changes denis incorporated the actors performances were fantastic i was almost out of my see at during pauls speeches
Mar 6 2024,positive,the muaddib of the scifi movies thanks denis villeneuve for this great adaptation it is already iconic
Mar 6 2024,positive,a masterpiece of the scifi genre  villenneuve continues to show hes one of the great directors of our generation and one of the great sci fi directors of all time  the cinematography and sound are spectacular the whole cast is fantastic and timothee chalamet transforms into the true movie star of this era
Mar 6 2024,positive,saw the fan premier and ive read all the books a lot of major story line changes but they are done in a way for everyone to be able to follow along without it being over complicated amazing film
Mar 6 2024,positive,in the end this can only be described as a noholdsbarred romp  director denis villeneuve jumps into what could easily be a sequel to the bythenumbers franchise and creates a feast for the cinematic senses
Mar 6 2024,positive,as someone who loves the books i can say the film made an excelente job they were able to cut of some parts that were a little bit slow to ad more action without losing the soul of the story i didnt like what they did to alia but the movie is so good that i barely missed her amazing soundtrack the time flys its just an outstanding job
Mar 6 2024,positive,brilliant epic visually stunning a treat for the senses a cinematic masterpiece sets the bar for science fiction movies a truly immersive experience that transports you for nearly 3 hours to another world a listers brought their a game testosterone and estrogen oozed off the screen battle scenes and hand to hand combat to rival anything that came before it truly a creative spectacle to behold no disappointments here 
Mar 6 2024,positive,impressed and touched by attention to detail and music is just perfect
Mar 6 2024,positive,i thought it was very well done  the story is very good and the visuals are amazing  a nice refreshing vacation from marvel and star wars while they figure their stuff out    cant wait for part 3
Mar 6 2024,positive,i had forgotten how violent the book was  the movie has lots of combat and other violence  not many peaceful characters in this movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,epic and amazing this is what we go to the movies for 
Mar 6 2024,positive,a true masterpiece of cinematography from the gorgeous wide shots of arrakas deserts to the close shots of heated battle dune part two holds up and surpasses the first installment of the dune franchise with a runtime of 2h 47 mins i felt every moment was used perfectly i was left wanting more at the end of the movie more of the emperor more of the revered mother even more of feydrautha    hats off to chalamet who gave a award winning performance and left me in no doubt the hopefully further movies in the dune universe will be just as awesome a must watch for any lovers of scifi and the grim reality of a universe spanning empire
Mar 6 2024,positive,long movie but not a boring second
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was amazing experience to watch this movie on theatre
Mar 6 2024,positive,a mustwatch especially on the biggest screen  fair warning its not really a family movie it is not star wars as in the lines between good and evil arent all that clear with that said it is a very honest portrayal of how a theocratic empire rises
Mar 6 2024,negative,i legit dont understand why people are saying this movie is that great ive got so many questions first off why do they fight with swords if they have laser weapons and rockets also whats up with the batman voices why does everyone speak like batman because they have dry throats also people will hate me for this but zendaya her acting is not great to say the least in this movie     the first movie was good but i created and account on rotten just to say that this movie isnt as good as people say it is
Mar 6 2024,positive,can there be such a thing as a perfect film dune ii is a masterpiece
Mar 6 2024,positive,an absorbing cinematic experience this film is a must see masterpiece the stunning visuals take you deep into the world of dune amazing cast
Mar 6 2024,positive,a mustwatch in dolby  imax cinemas
Mar 6 2024,positive,utterly stunning the best possible adaptation of this work even despite its sometimes radical deviations from it powerful visceral kicks the legs out from under you terrifyingly relevant greatly exceeded my expectations all the stars
Mar 6 2024,positive,have you ever watched a movie that made you wonder how you can possibly continue your life without being involved in the world that the movie has sketched dune 2 is a gem of a movie and should serve as the go to example of how fiction is done well    the only flaw with this movie is that it isnt 2 hours longer
Mar 6 2024,positive,a scale and story i havent seen the likes of since lotr two towers it was absolutely amazing
Mar 6 2024,positive,even more visually dazzling and fully realized than its predecessor dune part two sets a high bar for sciencefiction filmmaking and director denis villeneuves future projects
Mar 6 2024,positive,i loved this movie doesnt feel like a 3 hour movie but its an absolute classic does the books justice for the most part i am a huge dune fan and i loved this awesome
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was awesome looking forward to part 3
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was very well done couldnt remember very much about dune 1 and that was ok but i think trying to watch it without having seen dune 1 or reading about the movie would be a bit confusing  script excellent cast excellent cinematography and costumes gorgeous
Mar 6 2024,positive,really well filmed and thought out scenes cannot wait to see the next movie when it comes out
Mar 6 2024,positive,this was pretty close to the original not as good as the old one on acting but still better than part 1 of this trilogy but its more action and modernized so that gets it some points there and a few different takes on the book and original movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best films ever made pure cinema masterpiece enough said
Mar 6 2024,positive,not sure how to grade it any other way than 55 but wish i could go higher a triumph of cinematography world expansion and direction timothy comes alive as paul and rebecca fergeson is a perfect villain honestly  just please see this in the cinema  total subversion of the chosen one trope the epic battles were not exhaustive i loved it
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing need to see it again what an absorbing cinema experience
Mar 6 2024,positive,its mind blowing new favorite movie unlocked 
Mar 6 2024,positive,when part 1 came out the parts left put made sense and i had hoped would show up but with part 2 the story has been changed from the book and that left the movie dissapointing such as still no spacing guild no alia paul amd chanis relationship story was changed as well and the time was compressed in which the war on the harkonens was shortened overall a passable movie but with the change in story from the book i was dissapointedworth watching the one time but thats it really
Mar 6 2024,positive,visually mesmerizing  this movie had me on the verge of my seat  another denis villeneuves masterpiece
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune series is my favorite all time now  the visuals the story i love this part 2 so much im going go see it again i enjoyed all 2 hrs and 45 minutes of it
Mar 6 2024,positive,the movie is just epic even better than the first one and thats saying a lot
Mar 6 2024,positive,even as a long time dune reader this film is awesome
Mar 6 2024,positive,phenomenal performances by an amazing cast beautiful movie and score the wait was worth it
Mar 6 2024,positive,saw part 1  thought it was lame with the glowing reviews of part two on youtube i had to see it 3 hrs ago i left the theater after watching part two its really good please see it on the big screen  x  imax  xd   go on the bargain day soon if need be this is what movies are about big stories on big screens  with big sound systems zendaya is actually good in it in part one she wasnt in my opinion
Mar 6 2024,positive,fantastic action stayed true to the book
Mar 6 2024,positive,movie is peak cinema a must watch film
Mar 6 2024,positive,incredible on so many levels i havent read the books so theres that unlike many i appreciated and enjoyed the pace of the first hour i would have liked to see it the pace continue throughout the rest of the film yes i would have sat through and enjoyed a longer film i thought they should have taken more time to rally the troops and takedown the powers that be felt a bit too quick a bit too easy the baddies seemed more shrewd calculating and ruthless in the first part less so in the second in other words i wish it were a series having said all that i really enjoyed the film and will see it again so many impressive elements such a good time at the movies
Mar 6 2024,positive,excellent continuation of dune excellent story great acting and a beautiful movie to watch i was on the edge of my seat much of the movie i cant wait for part 3 definitely go see even if you missed part 1 but i suggest watching part 1 first
Mar 6 2024,positive,movie was amazing granted it starts off a bit slow but does not come up short on surprises i hope everyone enjoys it as much as my wife and i did
Mar 6 2024,positive,i dont rate movies but this one is different dune part 1 perfectly sets up this movie to be the climax so far in the story the level of immersion in this film is unreal i recommend watching it on imax in the center of the theater for the best experience sources  trust me
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen i am racking my brain to think of a movie that i have enjoyed as much in the last 510 years the cinematography is gorgeous the score is amazing it is reminiscent of lord of the rings game of thrones and star wars but would never be mistaken as a ripoff deserves every bit of praise that it is receiving
Mar 6 2024,positive,this is an extraordinary movie in every sense the way it deals with the issue of faith and power is just incredible
Mar 6 2024,positive,absolute worth watching riveting 
Mar 6 2024,positive,incredible are you serious peak scifi my guy awesome
Mar 6 2024,positive,literally wanted to walk right into a second showing and watch it again  fantastic
Mar 6 2024,positive,denis villeneuve does it again this is dune at its finest the film was absolutely a blast from the acting to the soundtrack this film was the complete package timothee chalamet and zendaya absolutely are stunning balancing a beautiful connection that pours out into this film action sequences and fight scene had me begging for more in the words of christopher walken  i got a fever and the only thing that can cure it is more dunenot actual quote i wouldnt be surprised if this didnt get film of the year easily
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie is blow away and the epic scope and acting are perfect definitely see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 6 2024,positive,a lot more action than the first must watch
Mar 6 2024,positive,visually stunning epic scale wonderfully actedand no lectures or whoa oak prop a ganda just filmmaking at it best as for villeneuve he might be the best director on the planet at the moment
Mar 6 2024,positive,made the right choice watching this in imax you can feel the room shake when the sand worms are being baited visually stunning had a really good time at this one
Mar 6 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece  one of the defining movies of our generation
Mar 6 2024,positive,denis velleneuve may be the best director in hollywood right now amazing sequel
Mar 6 2024,positive,its a good movie just too long
Mar 6 2024,positive,this film with part 1 made me like blockbusters its the 7th art
Mar 6 2024,positive,massive cinematic gorgeous love it
Mar 6 2024,positive,its been decades since a part 2 of a movie hits the mark for me and this was it i cant believe we waited so long but it was so worth it perfectly done
Mar 6 2024,positive,dune part two was amazing just when you think the producers are going to cut the movie and make you wait a few years for part 3 it keeps going picked up right where it left off plus more the movie is full of action adventure  some major plot twists i will have to catch it again highly recommend go see it
Mar 6 2024,positive,it has big worm energy
Mar 6 2024,positive,must see very well scripted and done this is what star wars should have been could have been and wasnt
Mar 6 2024,positive,before i went to the movie yesterday i watched the 1984 version and then the 2021 version so i was all prepared for the background of part 2   i loved the movie and the cinematography was fantastic cant wait for part 3 and i hope im still alive to see it because i turned 82 yesterday
Mar 6 2024,positive,a visual feast crew probably still shaking sand out of their shoes austin butler stole the show
Mar 6 2024,positive,best and longest movie ever engaged the whole time and the plot is magical
Mar 6 2024,positive,if you are going to see it watch it in imax to get the full spectacle
Mar 6 2024,positive,ive read the books seen the first dune movie many times seen dune pt 1 several times and just watched dune pt2 i was amazed with the visuals acting and following the original story  great movie i need to see it again its that goof    six stars
Mar 6 2024,positive,only not 5 stars because it was a touch long
Mar 6 2024,negative,omg part 1 moved slowly and this was no better if you did not see part 1 you will be lost and if you are thinking about seeing part 1 just pass
Mar 6 2024,positive,stunning flawless incredible literally breathtaking
Mar 6 2024,positive,great movie i really enjoyed the first and this was better 
Mar 6 2024,positive,minus one star for playing with the chronology and characters and minus one for neglecting the weirdness and other major worlds and groups in the first book of this universe should have been an hbo series
Mar 6 2024,positive,pretty intense very loud sometimes hard to understand the words but very good
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie is like the dark knight to batman begins
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie fixed everything wrong with the first movie and somehow with a plot so thick with subplots everything feels so clear almost three hours and i wish it was longer cant wait for the next movie if its green lit
Mar 6 2024,positive,best movie of 2024 i know is early however is goint to be hard to see a better movie this year or maybe in the next couple of years
Mar 6 2024,positive,closest thing ive seen to a perfect movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,excellant  almost a 3 hour movie and i still didnt want it to end
Mar 6 2024,positive,epic fight scenes were awesome
Mar 6 2024,positive,very action packed few parts were little confusing and took alot of unexpected turns thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 6 2024,positive,great movie enjoyed it more than the first dune
Mar 6 2024,positive,loved it visually amazing could have lasted another two hours and i would have cared
Mar 6 2024,positive,sooo  long  an the volume was so high
Mar 6 2024,positive,did not live up to the promotions of expectations copy the voice of batman trick infra red filming unique for sure relies on special effects which were good a bit overdone and under acted very entertaining for sure but not a home run a little slow paced
Mar 6 2024,positive,most entertaining movie our family has seen in a long time
Mar 6 2024,positive,very long but a huge improvement over part 1
Mar 6 2024,positive,intense and epic  visually stunning  featuring some of the biggest new and old movie stars  dune is a book that needed this movie
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie was so epic great follow up sequel
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing film far exceeds part 1 with its scope and visuals 
Mar 6 2024,positive,amazing cant wait for part 3
Mar 6 2024,positive,a masterpiece epic see it on imax better than the first one and that one was amazing 
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie was so amazing best movie since end game
Mar 6 2024,positive,stunning visual and sensory experience
Mar 6 2024,negative,i had so much difficulty understanding the dialog that i left the theater an hour into the movie i didnt know what was happening and it was frustrating i may watch it again when i can have subtitles
Mar 6 2024,positive,book nitpickers may disagree but i found it a great rush of action and character development after the first half hour  i felt genuine chills at times and that is saying a lot at my age  despite a huge number of deaths there was little blood  highly recommended
Mar 6 2024,positive,best cinematic experience in years
Mar 6 2024,positive,gives me faith in movies again a 
Mar 6 2024,positive,superior followup to a masterpiece unforgettable imax experience beyond expectations
Mar 6 2024,positive,this movie meets or exceeds expectations for nearly all moviegoers  the acting and the visual masterpiece that denis villeneuve puts together are mesmorizing  fans of the dune series will likely leave the theater asking themselves dune without the spacing guild what is that exactly  there is a reason why the spice must flow  taking liberties with the story line by omission is ok i guess but no spacing guild  really
Mar 6 2024,positive,i have to say that i was disappointed and left wanting too many things were left out and glossed over from the novel it feels like they missed the point of the story they replaced dialogue with stunning visuals and overwhelming sound they did not do enough with paul and chanis relationship the loss of their first son or pauls reluctance and final submission to accept a destiny that he feared it was like watching anakin skywalker fall to the dark side and submit to a life he did not want but was fated to perform the movie should have felt like the ending of a novel concluded but the film left everything unfinished for the 3rd film based on the 2nd novel
Mar 6 2024,positive,hands down one of the best movies ive seen in over the decade denis villeneuve is a master at his craft while timothy  austin as well as the rest of the cast are exceptional five stars
Mar 6 2024,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Mar 6 2024,negative,dialog was incoherent for the most part much of it whispered or mumbled what wasnt was often in some sort of fake farsi with subtitles that went by too fast to be read and the talking was endless mostly nothing happened could not follow the plot because i could not tell who was fighting who and it was just preposterous why with all their tech are they fighting with blades i read the book part 1 was ok i kept having to look at my watch it was a waste of my water
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was fantastic didnt mind the few liberties taken with the story  looking forward to seeing it again
Mar 6 2024,positive,as far as visuals go the film was spectacular and some of the scenes were really well crafted  it is difficult to compress the dune universe into a film for sure some scenes were presented without explanation but i think hoped the audience would just accept whats happening without questioning it  chani is the worst character though she has only two facial expressions  and added very little value to the story rabban has only two volumes shouting and kissing feet but the casting of fayuab the other bad guy was a masterstroke
Mar 6 2024,positive,i found it to be very well made the actors were great the special effects were on point no complaints
Mar 6 2024,positive,awesome film  great special effects chalamet was terrific as paul and zendaya was great  marvelous adaptation
Mar 6 2024,positive,watched it today it is a visually beautiful movie and the special effects are top notch i know it differs in some respects from the novel but i read it so long ago that i cannot recall every specific thing i guess there will need to be a part three since so many things were unresolved at the end    i will confess that i felt that having christopher walken as the emperor  was a serious miscasting of that role in addition that whole scene made very little sense since you would expect the emperor to have better security    all in all a good movie entertaining and it had rebecca ferguson 
Mar 6 2024,positive,magnificente film as a reader of herberts books denis villeneuve exceeded expectations in adapting the first book i eagerly anticipate him making a part 3 and indeed succeeding in this storyline finally showing the dangers of religious fanaticism
Mar 6 2024,positive,excellent film engaging with the storyline  my friend and i enjoyed dune part two to its fullest thank you very much for keeping movies exciting to partake in
Mar 6 2024,positive,this is why we go to the cinema to be carried away and surprised i expected to see a very good film i left having seen a masterpiece the same feeling as after seeing the empire strikes back with the desire to know what happens next and the desire to watch this second part again and again
Mar 6 2024,positive,absolutely breathtaking beautiful film
Mar 6 2024,positive,brilliant breathtaking  all the negative reviews about this film are due to a misunderstanding of the story itself it seems too complex for too many people already or simply written by people who dont appreciate beauty creativity  and the art of cinema  its simply a masterpiece
Mar 6 2024,positive,every timothée chalamet movie is amazing and this was so good in the visuals the story the characters everything was amazing must see
Mar 6 2024,positive,i have never sat in a movie theater and felt on the planet dune is a masterpiece of sound and epic scale every act is better than the last the entire cast is perfect the entire score is perfect this is absolute cinema
Mar 6 2024,positive,my five word review    cinema as it should be
Mar 5 2024,positive,while the first movie felt like strictly story building to me part two is far more of an epic there is plenty of story and action leaves you wanting part three immediately
Mar 5 2024,positive,they did it finally dune done right just about perfect
Mar 5 2024,positive,very entertaining a lot of action throughout
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies ive see  easily the best film to come out in the past decade simply stunning unbelievably entertaining just fantastic
Mar 5 2024,positive,not sure how to understand it or exactly what angle to see the movie from
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of my favorite movies of alltime truly epic exhilarating and layered science fiction at its absolute best it took me a couple days to just come down from the experience
Mar 5 2024,positive,three words piece of art purely flawless film either plenty of action character development story building and so much excitement left for the third film of the saga simply outstanding
Mar 5 2024,positive,best move ever made imho this is an accurate depiction of the book and the cinematography is sublime as is the acting soundtrack sfx sets direction production i could go on the storytelling is perfect and exquisitely paced timothy chalamets portrayal of paul atreides is mature and believable but javier bardem steals the show as he does in the first movie there are slight comical elements to his character but in a good way that does not spoil the mood    this is a must for scifi fans or anybody who enjoys a proper classic movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,fantastic havent seen an epic like that since return of the king
Mar 5 2024,positive,it was a good action film they may have tried to put too much into the film because it jumped a bit without explanation otherwise i enjoyed it
Mar 5 2024,negative,the visuals are good but im not gonna lie the dune movies are so boring some may like it and that ok my opinion is it just drags on for almost 3 hours and all they did was fight in a desert the entire time
Mar 5 2024,positive,plenty of action  great story line  actors were awesome cant wait for  part 3
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time amazing special effects compared to other modern movies great soundtrack too
Mar 5 2024,positive,masterpiece    slight changes from the book but expected in a movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,loved it was much better than the original
Mar 5 2024,positive,this movie is so good im obsessed
Mar 5 2024,positive,i loved the movie was captivating the entire time i think timothy deserves an oscar
Mar 5 2024,positive,well made awesome sound n visualsno mindless kung fuie looie deeper story there better be a part three
Mar 5 2024,positive,a scifi movie like no other dune part 2 is exhilarating who knew a world of sand could be so visually rich timothée chalamet zendaya florence pugh and austin butler all put in award worthy performances dune part 2 is likely to be a movie that will be talked about for many years in the category of greatest scifi films and sequels
Mar 5 2024,positive,visually stunning with amazing music hard to take your eyes off the screen and some real emotional moments with genuine jeaopardy for many of the characters cant fault the acting with some powerful performances particularly the female cast cant wait to see it again
Mar 5 2024,positive,great movie  it came full circle and has met and exceeded expectations    i hope the series continues
Mar 5 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time long but kept moving fun 3hrs
Mar 5 2024,positive,everything was insane such a masterpiece
Mar 5 2024,positive,amazing movie it was a masterpiece of a movie better than the first one
Mar 5 2024,positive, my goodness what a film dune movie part two is the film i wanted to keep wanting more you dont feel the almost threehour cinematic experience this type of film is why you go to the movie theater and they exist for this visual and complete story immersion outstanding storytelling acting and music score i would love to see this in imax for a second view and i would love to chat with people about it i highly recommend it this film could be watched as a standalone but honestly watching both films back to back is a cinematic experience you truly want to check out 
Mar 5 2024,positive,it was great movie its long hut i never felt bored
Mar 5 2024,negative,choppy editing decent watch once movie series when dune 3 comes out i think ill pass
Mar 5 2024,positive,a fine followup to the part 1 that dragged a bit in the middle and then wrapped up in a rushed finale part 2 falls a bit short of part 1  the pacing was uneven with the middle a bit bogged down and the finale feeling quite rushed  walken felt like a weak character while charlotte rampling continues to carry the bene gesserit cult along with her menacing character  rebecca fergusons character arc was perfectly done
Mar 5 2024,positive,i cant wait for the next one
Mar 5 2024,negative,after really anticipating dune 2 we were sorely disappointed if you are a frank herbert fan of his dune series this is a far cry from them not sure why the writersproducersdirectors felt the need to change this dynamic story so much that it wasnt dune if you just like a big sweeping scifi then this knockoff is for you   the characters were anything but in tune with each other alia atreides doesnt even appear as a child when her grandfather is about to die chani is a spoiled brat that never bothers to become a sayyadina and the harkkonens arent red headed  just pale blobby people if you enjoy tearing up classics then this mess is for you there is a lot of explosions and special effects so for those who really enjoy eye popping efx over strong storyline go for it i for one found this movie a waste of time if you enjoy dune the book series i highly recommend the syfy three parter dune dune messiah and children of dune even though this version had light haired caladan characters instead of the darkhaired as depicted in the book and the atreides twins are portrayed much older this was a much closer adaptation to the first three books
Mar 5 2024,positive,wow the movie just gets so much right with the visuals the acting the tone and the musical score its epic its entertaining it keeps your eyes glued to the screen i didnt even notice the almost three hours runtime until the credits rolled  my scifi agnostic girlfriend couldnt wait to see it again before we even left the theater     i read the book way back in highschool so its not all super fresh in my mind im sure there are tons of inconsistencies and minor details changed for the screen adaptation and there is a little bit a barrier to entry with the backstory but i feel like the also exceptional dune part one sets it all up perfectly      see it on the biggest and best screen you can but if you cant get your prime viewing seats id wait for a later less crowded showing all those poor people in the front row will need neck braces after its done
Mar 5 2024,positive,faithful to the book and much better than  part one
Mar 5 2024,positive,this movie had many moments that moved me numerous chilling moments of what a little faith in something or someone can move others to do think or feel great movie all around
Mar 5 2024,positive,im a christopher walkin fan but feel he was miscast here it was a distraction   zendaya did okay but spends a lot of time just frowning the rest of the cast was excellent   the sound effects and music should win academy awards they were amazing and made the movie  ive never read the books but the director did an excellent job making the stories cohesive loved it overall
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the best cinema experiences ive ever had brilliant movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,its an objectively pristinely crafted film this is cinema at its finest one shouldnt experience this on a 40 inch tv for the first time you really will thank yourself for seeing it where it was intended to be seen everything comes together in this film the cast perfect the score perfect the writing perfect i could list more because everything is perfect great films exist but rarely do we get a convergence of brilliance like this its in my humble opinion the biggest milestone in cinema i dont say that lightly like you may assume

Mar 5 2024,positive,epic cannot wait for part 3
Mar 5 2024,positive,fans of the books will have a lot to appreciate here general audiences may be left confused if this film is building as is rumored towards a big screen adaptation of dune messiah then the groundwork is laid stunning visuals and audio design    i miss the lynchian thoughts in this series instead we are told a great great deal    they straightwashed the baron but we knew that was coming

Mar 5 2024,positive,it was good but we didnt know there would be a part 3 later very disappointing
Mar 5 2024,positive,i really liked the last dune film even more so on my second viewing dune part two is bigger more engaging and even more impressive while no film is perfect this is one of the best ive seen in years bring on dune part three
Mar 5 2024,positive,great movies i just wish we didnt have to wait so long for part 3
Mar 5 2024,positive,a remarkable imax experience denis villenuve is goated 
Mar 5 2024,positive,literally one of if not the greatest sci fi movies in my 25 years of life gonna need a good sound system for this
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune part 2 for me atleast was a whole lot better than part 1
Mar 5 2024,positive,a perfect science fantasy epic perfect pace perfect cast perfect directionthis film has it all a true masterpiece the kind of movie hollywood needs right now so mind blowingsee it on the biggest screen possible so epic bring on dune messiah
Mar 5 2024,positive,a good balance of storytelling and visual spectacle  well acted nicely paced long movie that i didnt think about how long it was while watching
Mar 5 2024,positive,the best scifi movie of all time
Mar 5 2024,positive,a surprise to almost no one dune part two is good what comes as a much bigger surprise is that it isnt just good its incredible a landmark cinematic achievement that is able to improve upon every strength and weakness of part one while still adding even more fantastic material it excels in every aspect dune part two is easily the most visually stunning well written and compelling blockbuster since the lord of the rings in the face of modern hollywood mediocrity dune part two puts to shame anything put to screen in recent memory it deserves nothing less than to be enthusiastically praised as a true masterpiece
Mar 5 2024,positive,best on many levels action thriller mystic romance  well done
Mar 5 2024,positive,absolute epic tale rebecca ferguson gives an amazing performance set designs the best ive since endgame the story and plot are a bit choppy in the beginning but the movie goes along at a good pace and battles last enough to one wanting more cant wait for part three
Mar 5 2024,positive,some parts were just long still a great movie it felt like stretching to get to 3 hours
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune part 2 review      youtube shorts version        tiktok version  
Mar 5 2024,positive,this what people wants to watch and cinema at its peak good performance by all of cast members too
Mar 5 2024,positive,i have read the entire set of dune books numerous times and this movie is the best retelling of the story yet i love the magnificent scenery and the acting of zendaya the movie truly makes you believe that you are on the dune planet and both physical struggles and political struggles are taking place
Mar 5 2024,positive,great movie lots of action excellent scenery nice cast of people but a surprise ending
Mar 5 2024,positive,very epic movie amazing soundtrack sandworm10
Mar 5 2024,positive,gorgeous movie one of the best movies of the year the acting was top tier just watch it for yourself its a perfect movie no words
Mar 5 2024,positive,easily the best blockbuster movie of all time dune is my favorite book ive read it 4 times and this movie exceeded every expectation i had everything was nearly perfect the acting the visuals the score ill be back to watch this at least a couple more times in the theater
Mar 5 2024,positive,for decades now the public has been told dune cannot be adapted villeneuve has now seemingly done the impossible  dune part 2 is a monumental achievement whose flaws pale in comparison to its brilliance running at 25 hours dune 2 almost feels too short and im already clamoring for extended cuts and a third film
Mar 5 2024,positive,this film was a beautifully tragic scifi epic the likes of which we have never seen before timothee chalement sorry if i spelled this wrong was incredible and definitely better in part two than what he was in part one austin butler was unhinged and absolutely terrifying as feydrautha the rest of the cast is amazing as well the scale of this film is enormous i have never seen a film as large in scale since maybe lord of the rings the world building is once again great the religious themes were interesting and unique the action intense and well epic that is the only word i can use to describe this film epic dune part two is truly a work of art
Mar 5 2024,positive,amazing epic  does not disappoint  stayed pretty close to the book the parts they left out didnt hurt the movie at all
Mar 5 2024,positive,overall the movie was spectacular to see but a lack of understanding about the effects of the water of life and a failure to see how paul can predict the future will have a negative impact on the next movie an easy example would be why did paul need to ask his mother if leto had known she was harkonen paul can speak directly with his father he knows what he knows unless the goal of the trilogy is to paint a stark difference between religious and nonreligious peoples paul will need to be accepted as supernatural as chani did in the books
Mar 5 2024,positive,a masterpiece  best sci fi movie since interstellar in my opinion
Mar 5 2024,positive,so incredibly intense a must see in large format an improvement on the first one for sure
Mar 5 2024,positive,lifetime fan of the novel and could only wish for a proper visual adaptation  villeneuve does not disappoint with either of the parts  so well done both visually thematically and emotionally  now just have my fingers crossed that hell make the adaptation of dune messiah
Mar 5 2024,positive,a scifi large in its scope masterpiece action cinematography sound effects  performances are elevated timothée zendaya austin javier rébecca josh  florence  way better than the first one amazing score dennis villeneuve did that 55
Mar 5 2024,positive,even better than part 1  exceeded expectations and the soundtrack outdoes part 1 as well and that says a lot
Mar 5 2024,positive,i loved the visuals and the heart throbbing sound timothee chalamet was amazing its unbelievable that the same actor performed the role wonka as well as the swashbuckling prince in dune people who have not seen part 1 should watch it before seeing part 2
Mar 5 2024,positive,incredible movie all around i think it is superior to the first in terms of sheer action higher stakes and character development timothy is a boss in this movie and does an incredible job action sequences are top notch as is the cinematography and score only one moment in the film felt a bit rushed but in terms of running time it might have been necessary also an almost unrealquick leap in personality change felt a bit jarringunwarranted for the quickness of it but i highly recommend and most definitely recommend seeing it on the big screen cant wait for the next one hope it happens
Mar 5 2024,positive,top 3 alltime  1 one upon a time in america  2 dune 2  3 top gun maverick
Mar 5 2024,positive,sensational chills every act go see it in the cinema because i got a 4d experience basically  the speakers reverberation made my chair rumble with the earth worm and war  cries  so cool also if all the girls didnt already have a crush on timotheé chalamet thy do now
Mar 5 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece wonderful blend of adventure action mystery thrill and romance elements as this ip comes from before popularized scifi franchises like star wars it can be seen how attempts have been made to spinoff certain aspects from dune but not nearly as well as this original story
Mar 5 2024,positive,i loved everything about it
Mar 5 2024,positive,its an outstanding movie i loved it waiting for part 3
Mar 5 2024,positive,stunning captivating so much about this movie was amazing the fight choreography was beautifully crafted the strength that they gave chani how in depth they began to reveal characters and bringing the film closer to the books was all outstanding
Mar 5 2024,positive,a gorgeous followup trip to the 101st century  i love the way the story has been expanded to fill what will presumably be a 8 hour trilogy  i loved every second of this film  although i will see part 2 many times the long suffering wait for part 3 begins 
Mar 5 2024,positive,has lotr return of the king vibes a masterpiece
Mar 5 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic as someone whos read the original book three times and seen all the previous iterations of the novel this is without a doubt the best by a long shot there were some alterations made to work within the film format but frankly i thought it all worked well and added a bit of mystery for me as a viewer that i enjoyed really awesome work denis heres to hoping for a 3rd and a 4th
Mar 5 2024,positive,a visual and acoustic masterpiece
Mar 5 2024,positive,the best movie ive ever seen and the only movie review ive ever written
Mar 5 2024,negative,the movie was choppy editing was horrible there were inconsistencies with how the actors looked between scenes sometimes they had blue eyes sometimes they didnt the scenes didnt match or flow i kept asking where did that come from regarding the worms do the worms stop to get passengers on board
Mar 5 2024,positive,incredible movie spectacular soundtrack one of the best in science fiction  it made me want to go back to the movies because i was sick of bad movies like marvel or the latest star wars  im going to read the books just for the movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,i want to love this movie despite being in a confused state throughout the film i enjoyed what i was seeing visually the lack of dialogue didnt work for me although its an aspect that would lessen the more i learned about the characters and world i just dont get much of a chance at that within the movie despite my uninvolvement of the dune world and its characters i still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing    other than the overarching plot scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey the first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not many characters simply appear in the movie some deep into the runtime including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it some characters appear very briefly and dont do much at all the motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script we see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes when we couldve just been told that theres nukes the nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that couldve been replaced with plot    i would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect austin butlers character was great why because he was so one dimensional the battles are the best you mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who the score was amazing oh the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes even the twist ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes this film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff the number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of dune 2 is the cinematography this should be a leg that a great movie stands on not the foundation although the direction and technicality of the look of dune 2 is epic the writing and editing are faulty maybe upon rewatches i would like it more since i might understand more of the details after getting those details from other sources but its still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is
Mar 5 2024,positive,was not true to the books as other renditions were  never read about harkonen canibalism   sadism yes   eating other people 
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune part two was fantastic i absolutely enjoyed it
Mar 5 2024,positive,it is indeed better than the part one in storytelling the audio and cinematography was amazing i really enjoyed it in the cinema however the love story between paul and chani wasnt convincing to me felt kinda awkward zendayas performance in the later was plane i couldnt understand what she wants to express hopefully in part three it would be much clear
Mar 5 2024,positive,i liked dune i loved dune 2 pitch perfect throughout it isnt easy to make 3 hours fly by but this most certainly did and it even left me wanting more absolutely amazing epic stupendous etc etc etc
Mar 5 2024,positive,cinema messiah    just when you thought oppenheimer was the top of adult spectacle along comes dune 2 as much as i enjoyed the first part the second leaves it in the dust literally and every other way    the scale of the film the effects the worms the witches all take second place to the characters  tcs paul austin butlers amazing villain rf as the witch mother ss as fatso  all great  but javier bardem steals this film as he did no country and that sill james bond movie this films star is desert fanaticism and the emotional pull of the revolution in which bardem finds himself as the john the baptist figure this really is what star wars should have been all along but never was villeneuve is perfect as the director here  he captures the big in the small and the huge in the big zendaya is also central to the drama but she is not so great but maybe thats not all her fault    it is long slow and moody as hell so unless youre prepared to be pulled along with the story you might just fall asleep not me  it all worked for me it is an absolute triumph of a scifi one of the very best unlike the first film it seems real and not pretend    pee first then settle in and be prepared to be astonished
Mar 5 2024,positive,relentlessly stunning and haunting
Mar 5 2024,positive,absolute must see a star wars movie for a new generation
Mar 5 2024,positive,a cinematic feast alright but has deficiencies like some others thought part 1 was better and whisper it zendaya has too much screen time shes just not a confident enough presence for the role also thought it was just too clinical and clean too story boarded however very much worth a night out in the cinema
Mar 5 2024,positive,stayed basically true to the storyline  great effects and sound support
Mar 5 2024,positive,i also wanted to add that i viewed the movie in a new screenx theater wraparound screen and the experience was amazing
Mar 5 2024,positive,mesmerizing massive engaging one of the greatest films ever created
Mar 5 2024,positive,such an incredible movie all around  acting visuals storyeverything is a masterpiece
Mar 5 2024,positive,the movie followed the book closely with very little creative liberty keeping the integrity but adding some more realistic features timothee and zendaya as well as all cast members gave brilliant performances the music pulled you into the world of dune making it hard to come back to the reality of the theater room 1010 movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,youll feel embarrassed you ever thought star wars was good
Mar 5 2024,positive,denis villeneuve along with everyone making this picture set the bar high for scifi and filmmaking in general beyond expectations with visually stunning frames and storytelling with an unforgettable soundtrack by hans zimmer a charming film that shows the beauty of arrakis
Mar 5 2024,positive,loved every moment of this movie  just different enough from the book to make it compelling and new but still faithful to the story and characters
Mar 5 2024,positive,at a level of artistry rarely seen on the big screen dune part two illustrates what defines cinema to transport the viewer to a different world the passion behind this project seeps from the screen as one peers into this nigh mythological environment with a piece of filmmaking this immersive its story of visions prophecies and the chosen one  a trope so exhaustively common in scifi and fantasy  becomes all the more sorrowful
Mar 5 2024,positive,its a masterpiece this film will be remembered as an alltime great this is why i love movies
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune part 2 was the best scifi i believe ive ever seen  the scenes were breathtaking and the actors were at the top of their game
Mar 5 2024,positive,okay buckle up because dune part 2 is an absolute rollercoaster of epic proportions picture this mindblowing visuals heartpounding action and characters so cool they practically ooze charisma this sequel takes everything we loved about the first installment and cranks it up to eleven as a cinema fanatic and a diehard dune fan let me tell you this movie is pure magic from the breathtaking desert landscapes to the intricate political intrigue every frame is a work of art and dont even get me started on the performances  each actor brings their agame making you feel every moment right down to your core so if youre looking for a cinematic experience thats out of this world dune part 2 is where its at trust me you wont be disappointed
Mar 5 2024,positive,great visuals outstanding acting and awesome knife fight scenes could be closer to the original source the book but lets see how it will be developed in part three
Mar 5 2024,positive,the greatest movie i have ever seen
Mar 5 2024,positive,great film a mustsee in imax if possible
Mar 5 2024,positive,best science fiction movie ive ever seen
Mar 5 2024,positive,visually thrilling narratively epic
Mar 5 2024,negative,it was scary to participate in the dumbing down of america i wanted to walk out when i realized scenery was dark and dismal and  i couldnt see the action really a guy riding a giant worm is that all you got actually no it gets dumber
Mar 5 2024,positive,before dune parts 1 and 2 the most faithful book to scifi movie adaptation was lord of the rings not anymore wow part 2 channeled frank herbert visuals were stunning acting was brilliant producers of this saga didnt worry about pleasing this or that group they just made a great movie faithfully using the source material disney and sony should take heed
Mar 5 2024,positive,incredible incredible incredible     this is what excellence looks like in film every second had me captivated wanted to rewatch it immediately after my first viewing cannot tell you how good this is
Mar 5 2024,positive,if there was any cgi i couldnt tell almost three hours went by in a flash loved it
Mar 5 2024,negative,to long not as good as the original
Mar 5 2024,positive,great visuals smooth pacing worth every second
Mar 5 2024,positive,silence    i loved this movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,brilliant absolutely brilliant my review wont do justice to this so i will just say modern masterpiece cinema

Mar 5 2024,positive,i loved the first one and i love the second one best sf movie of the past 2 decades
Mar 5 2024,positive,denis villeneuve did it again  image and sound are one the images are completely stunning and the soundtrack made by hans zimmer is powerful i got chills multiple times because of this perfect symbiosis  i definitely recommend this movie which will take you into an other world 
Mar 5 2024,positive,a must seen movie better than the first one  cant wait for the third
Mar 5 2024,positive,long live the fighters long live cinema
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune 1 was incomplete masterpiece  and dune part 2 is completely masterpiece i just say to everyone just go and watch in theatre dont wait for ott release you can feel this movie only in theatresbig fan from india 
Mar 5 2024,positive,storytelling and visual effects are superb and transport you into another world for the almost 3 hour movie i wish i could stay longer
Mar 5 2024,positive,this is exceptional  the scenes on geidi prime are part of what makes this movie stand out but really the whole thing is quite cohesive  as a bonus its a lot faster paced than the first part as far as i remember  would absolutely recommend
Mar 5 2024,neutral,the mystery is gone denis and team have opted to turn a great science fantasy story into a squabble between two teenagers one of whom literally pouts like a spoiled daddys girl in the final scenes one scene follows another with little or no connection how do they take a worm for a trip like its a greyhound bus where did these laser guns that the fremen used come from and why does this make a few thousand of them superior to a far more numerous and advanced enemy like the harkonnens lynchs dune made the fremen advantage clear if denis et al had taken more time to develop the essentials of this story than delving into a social experiment showing how the fremen are aw shuckstheyre just like us there would have been more majesty than a glorified friends episode paul atredes was the messiah despite the weak comedy and open blasphemy herberts sequels title dune messiah kinda lets that one out of the bag good point i liked the harkonnens stellen skarsgård was an excellent bad boy the special effects and sound were fantastic and inspired awe despite the insipid fremen business   in
Mar 5 2024,positive,a great film doesnt seek to make a billion dollars  its called to it and it delivers  and if the box office is low  itll still be the only thing ive ever needed it to be   dune part 12
Mar 5 2024,positive,great continuation of the dune saga the adaptation is very close to the books visually stunning audibly incredible as im huge dune fan i loved it and hope to see adaptions of other books in the series
Mar 5 2024,positive,words cannot describe dune part two no better than phenomenal breathtaking and above all a masterpiece from the performances of the cast to the ground breaking cgivisual effects this film is truly a worthy sequel
Mar 5 2024,positive,l i t e r a l l y out of this world lisan al gaib
Mar 5 2024,positive,epic in every aspect  it is a true cinematic experience i felt immersed deep in the world that is so wellbuilt that i was still living in it while i was walking out of the theatre and next day in the office everything in this movie is beautiful and poetic i was going to list the best aspects like acting directing music and so on but this does not make sense here as a whole the movie is a masterpice every piece and aspect of it make it truly epic if this was the main course how will the dessert be
Mar 5 2024,positive,i like the movie it was a great
Mar 5 2024,positive,beauty is in every corner of the film in the actors in the battles in the desert and even in the giant worm
Mar 5 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece give the creatives behind this all the money to do whatever they want go see it on the most grand screen you can find a good edible or entire container in my case makes for an epic viewing experience
Mar 5 2024,positive,this movie was an absolute masterpiece to watch unfold loved the first movie and this movie literally had me drop my jaw in some points which movies rarely do these days i cannot explain what we have just witnessed in this movie it is unfathomable i might be glazing but who cares when its just that good the directing style is a master stroke from denis the cinematography was something i havent seen before ever deserves all the praise it gets
Mar 5 2024,positive,better than starwars
Mar 5 2024,positive,amazing cinematography and acting but so long dragging out a story without enough closure at the end just another wait to see what happens next trying to be another star wars with many many episodes
Mar 5 2024,negative,this 4d experience was horrifyingly bad i want a refund
Mar 5 2024,negative,my review failed to upload and i lost it because i did it on my phone my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Mar 5 2024,positive,the movie was phenomenal and great visuals although i have mixed feelings about the ending overall a great film to catch in theaters
Mar 5 2024,positive,it wasnt a bad movie it just wasnt great at no point that i was like oh man this is epic they lean too hard on the music cues to make a scene seem epic when it really wasnt
Mar 5 2024,negative,big disappointment after the first part  the visuals are good but it was a shame to dumb down the original wellwritten characters marveldclike pointless endless swordplay the display of religious fanaticism was largely successful  an ideal film for naive ignorant brainless viewers who are emotionally at the 14yearold level
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies you will ever see in the theatres amazing epic and beautiful 1010
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the best movies in a long time story telling was amazing
Mar 5 2024,positive,this film isnt just a scifi blockbuster its an experience like no other dune part 2 is simply a masterpiece no question about it this movie has not only shown that movies arent just entertainment its pure art on a screen from start to finish i can guarantee you dune part 2 has open the world to the film industry to a lot more people and well be seeing a lot more highbrow scifi films to come     long live cinema
Mar 5 2024,positive,one time watchable movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,saw it yesterday  it is magnificent does very well in terms of paul character development in comparision to books heroes fells much more like humans than like symbols   chani gets more attention than in books  visually it is stunning   1010 would reccomend
Mar 5 2024,positive,this was an okay adaptation of the second half of the original dune novel  be aware though that the ending in the movie is before the ending in the book clearly set up as a cliffhanger so they can make a dune 3 and 4 and 5 and so on given that herbert wrote 6 novels and his son has written more plenty is left to work with  the cheap setup ending really ruined the movie for me  david lynchs ending was much superior to this ending  and saying lynchs awful movie did something better is sad bc the lynch movie was horrendous  the acting special effects and most of the story were okay but the sellout bid for another movie ending really torpedoed this for me  avoid the movie if you like closure
Mar 5 2024,positive,i dont know how they fit so much movie in under 3 hours such a massive and amazing movie a shame that wb was greedy and held out its release timothée chalamet gives one of the best speeches in a movie that ive heard
Mar 5 2024,positive,awesome movie must see again
Mar 5 2024,positive,fireeee loved it 
Mar 5 2024,positive,fantastic scifi epic great story building and character development the action was brilliant and you really cheer on the heroes final act is breathtaking only things stopping me from half a star more is wanting to see more space travel scenes particularly a scene with the guild navigators also wanted to see that creepy ass spiderhuman pet
Mar 5 2024,positive,this is the better version of star wars
Mar 5 2024,positive,definitely worth the hype
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune part two is a scifi sequel to the 2021 film adaptation of the book the movie takes place right after the first film with timothee chalamet as paul atreides who teams up with chani zendaya and the fremen to seek revenge against the people who destroyed his family now i remember going to see the first movie and not knowing anything about the book or this movie all i knew was that it was a new scifi film that people said was more mature than star wars and the amount of excitement i had when i walked out of that theatre was just the beginning because this movie exceeds just what the first part started i feel like this movie does a lot better with setting up the story explaining key factors and context and also teasing what is to come in a possible sequel the acting in this movie is so phenomenal especially the chemistry between chalamet and zendaya we were just beginning to see their relationship in the first part and this movie really fleshed out these characters and how this movie ended for the two was really fascinating to me and makes me wonder if well see these two again like we did the two new additions to the cast were florence pugh and austin butler and i was really intrigued to see who they were and the roles they would play and they both were amazing as well you could really feel the antagonizing threat that butlers character was in this movie while also watching them set more up with pughs character and her destiny was interesting to me the visuals in this movie were gorgeous you can tell that the vfx team really worked hard on this movie there were certain shots in this movie where they were just breathtaking and made me appreciate how beautiful cinema like this truly is the action in this movie was both entertaining and thrilling and there were parts that really made me feel the threat that was at stake with the music cues and how effected i felt while watching the sequences play out while watching this movie i was even debating whether dune might be better than star wars just with how big the scale felt just in these two movies alone i truly am enjoying this mature scifi tone that i feel is lacking with star wars i also feel like this second part does better at establishing rules and explaining certain things better as the first movie felt subtle and like the writers were holding back and afraid of revealing too much too early my one gripe or negative thought with this movie is there were many times where i felt like certain scenes werent focused on enough and like the movie was skipping forward so much to pass time and i just feel like that messed with the flow and pacing a little bit but overall this movie does flow much better than the spice does in the first part overall dune part two is not only an established adventure that ends with a more closing conclusion but both enhances the first movie while also letting this part bask in all that it offers action visuals tone direction production performances this movie truly might be top 5 movies of the year for me dune part two gets an a
Mar 5 2024,positive,loved everything bravo denis
Mar 5 2024,positive,outstanding production excellent acting brilliant sound and superb cinematography this movie treated its audience with a level of respect having allowed us to figure out some of the nuance rather than dumbing the movie down unlike so many other popular novel adaptations peter jacksons lord of the rings is guilty of this

Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the best movie of the year for sure
Mar 5 2024,positive,love the casting action and the overall design  conception plot seemed rushed some worthwhile details and dialogue lacking development of chanis character interesting though some development of pauls character were sacrificed in many ways an outstanding adaptation of book however it is not the book which cannot be surpassed
Mar 5 2024,positive,loved it action packed and cant wait for dune 3
Mar 5 2024,positive,this is what good cinema should be epic and on a grand scale with deep and meaningful adult themes and writing and a wide array of great actors im not even a dune fan but this movie might of made me one 1010 best movie i have seen since pre covid restored my faith in actually going to the theater

Mar 5 2024,positive,instantly one of my favorite movies ive seen i didnt love the first one as much as everyone else did but this one peak cinema
Mar 5 2024,positive,the storyline followed the book quite closely although the scenes from the movies were improved upon  the fight scene between fayed and paul was beautifully choreographed  the speach to solidify his assertion was as powerful as the use of his name as a weapon  riding the worms excellent the best  even the mothers worm carriage fitted perfectly  loved the movie great finish to the book and setup for book 2 cant wait
Mar 5 2024,positive,confusing but epic great cast
Mar 5 2024,positive,pretty good for the most part but deviated from the book a bit too much especially the wokefying of chani
Mar 5 2024,positive,really good wish i got to finish it but the movie theater caught fire
Mar 5 2024,positive,25 hours and it surprisingly keeps pace great story line amazing actions potential to be one of best not thee best series ever

Mar 5 2024,positive,fantastic movie it totally exceeded my expectations
Mar 5 2024,positive,visually very impressive great production design  grandiose self important  but did i care
Mar 5 2024,negative,this has to be the absolute worst adaptation of dune that has ever been made  it didnt follow the book from the first 5 minutes in or onward i wouldnt waste my time or money to go see it if you have ever read the book if i was the director i would bury my whole body in the sand for a 1000 yrs it sucks 
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune part two might have been one of the best movies i have ever graced my eyes and ears on wtf from tiny details like the sand falling off churning machinery to the epic coloring and sound effects the entire film was incredible the acting felt realistic not over done with crazy facial like a musical theater performance which i feel from a lit of scifis it did the books justice and brought it all to screen perfectly overall i left the movie theater feeling like this was the climax of all media i have ever watched
Mar 5 2024,positive,by far the best movie of 2024 it will win every award as part one did dune messiah will be even better
Mar 5 2024,positive,better than part one starts off a bit slow but picks up a lot as the movie goes on
Mar 5 2024,positive,yall need to glaze the imax experience
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune 2 was so fucking good if you meet anyone who doesnt like it just go ahead and tell them to cut their losses and kill themselves because theres no hope for them
Mar 5 2024,positive,truly one of the greatest film ive seen
Mar 5 2024,neutral,visually beautiful film but very slow  its not my style but for those who like it go ahead and watch it  best special effects ive ever seen but the story didnt keep me intrigued  its not for me
Mar 5 2024,positive,considerably more direct and conventional than the first dune but great visuals fine acting and enjoyable nonetheless
Mar 5 2024,positive,awesome hollywood movie magic fun this sets up a trilogy i think they are trying for a typical movie franchise 
Mar 5 2024,positive,an amazing adaptation of the book genius screenwriting and epic action ending confused me a bit i didnt think the book ended like that will have to reread everything else was focused intense and extremely well done rest of hollywood please take note
Mar 5 2024,positive,a bit dark but super intense and entertaining
Mar 5 2024,positive,i loved this movie filmmakers crushed it beautifully done go see this in the theaters if you can the ambience is worth it overall a compelling storyline that fuels a strong third film while still coming off as a strong continuation from the first movie which is hard to do with a sequel
Mar 5 2024,positive,cinema you rarely see it
Mar 5 2024,positive,a cinematic experience wonderful storytelling in a world filled with life and lore coupled with magnificent acting from a talented group complimented with astonishing visual effects
Mar 5 2024,negative,dud part two is more like it not enough action  boring
Mar 5 2024,positive,loved the movie  however the end was rushed there was a big buildup of both feyd r and the relationship btwn paul and chani and out of nowhere he proposes for the princess hand there was no development of that transition it happened very quickly the books pace is more balanced the feyd collosseum scene was unnecessary and very long and alia still not being born is frays far from the book
Mar 5 2024,positive,its a perfect movie an epic 
Mar 5 2024,positive,it was a pleasant experience
Mar 5 2024,positive,fantastic film a true cinematic experience havent felt this transported in a while definitely watch in imax while you can
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune 2 was as pretty good movie i liked how much action there was but there was a lot of great scene and the battles are impressive and i love the action that i think the movie was better than the original movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,visually  giedi prime was the most amazing thing ive ever seen literally wowd in the theaters  truly a masterpiece
Mar 5 2024,positive,great excellent wonderfull  life is not in vain when watching this movie soundtrack a time of quiet between the storms gave me goosebumps very majestic
Mar 5 2024,positive,a brilliant sequel denis villeneuve and his fantastic cast deliver a true sf masterpiece once again cant wait for part 3 
Mar 5 2024,positive,exactly what i was hoping for in a sequel
Mar 5 2024,positive,as the pacing wanes and swells there is a constant pulse of auditory and cinematic pleasure in this epic outing
Mar 5 2024,positive,my vocab is too limited to describe the spectacle of this movie just go see it
Mar 5 2024,positive,the best movie of 2024 its sheer perfection chefs kiss muah
Mar 5 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and i did so as soon as the trailer started i dont want to give it away but i found these to be the most creative trailers that ive ever seen in support of an imminent movie ask for the film itself absolutely spellbinding fastpaced provocative and very very cool
Mar 5 2024,positive,visually exceptional great acting and special effects
Mar 5 2024,positive,this was a very good sequel to the first film i really enjoyed it i think it was better than the first one lots of action and good plot development and storyline awesome 
Mar 5 2024,positive,the characters the cinematography the music everything about this movie was perfect there were so many scenes that left me with chills
Mar 5 2024,negative,this movie is only another lame blockbuster this movie did not give the importance to the details from the first movie such as the importance of the planet dune the movie was rushed only for the action because i guess thats what makes money im sorely disappointed the character development was lacking many details were unnecessarily altered that were of importance hollywood is going down i could only rely on a24 movies now 
Mar 5 2024,positive,it was not as good as episode 1 i did not feel they handled the beauty of the books they didnt even touch on the weirding way
Mar 5 2024,positive,this was a breathtakingly beautiful film with impressive soundtrack and phenomenal acting from the cast fans of the dune book will definitely have some issues with the changes made in the second half of the film but these things are unavoidable with adaptions while there were some pacing issues in the middle they were not significant this is a truly enjoyable film that needs to be seen in theatres
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune 2 is simply one of the best theater experiences ive had in decades the cinematography is exquisite it holds close enough to the books to cause no major complaints the casting was dead on and the pacing fx etc were on point    it was an ideal theater experience the sound images story direction and acting all came together for a perfect theater experience it held my attention without fail for the entire length of the film and left me wanting more it was immersive to a degree that im not sure ive experienced before and set the standard for what a big screen movie should be in this era
Mar 5 2024,positive,i was pretty excited to see this movie i felt the first one set the stage pretty well with a perfect reimagining of the awesome original however after an about 14 of the way through the movie it began to slip then slide to and fro i felt like the director tried to do too much injecting a lot of details then racing to another subplot the supporting characters were very artificial some actors over acted while others under acted climactic scenes were brushed over in a moment of gratuitous gestures it was like villenueve was directing with one arm tied behind his back and delivered a rough draft and they ran with it just didnt feel like it was in line with his resume to date
Mar 5 2024,positive,freaking epic  this is fantastic cinema mythology and a wonderful movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,best scifi film since empire strikes back and maybe the best ever
Mar 5 2024,positive,whilst visually very impressive i feel that the first instalment of the saga was better i feel the movie shied away from establishing shots which made the scope of the film feel quite closed off the second antagonist to the film the emperor i feel was miscast given all the mystique built up in the first entry the sardaukar army also had a fantastic set up only for them to feel very underwhelming
Mar 5 2024,positive,it was an incredible film first time ive left the theater impressed in a long time the acting was incredible the cinematography was fantastic definitely a must watch and will be the best movie of the year
Mar 5 2024,positive,great plot and action some time skips but still good enough detail
Mar 5 2024,positive,honestly i found it slightly better than part one since this contains more action sequences cant wait for part three
Mar 5 2024,positive,it has stunning visuals fantastic acting and a powerful story the pace is a little slower than i expected it is a demonstration of what comprises good cinema
Mar 5 2024,negative,i am an italian user i watched the film a few days ago apart from the excellent special effects even the action scenes i found the film quite boring i found the cuts made in some points which sometimes made it unclear and almost hasty some passages a film well done on a visual level but i didnt feel the same emotions as the first film perhaps too high expectations reading the reviews that defined it as a true masterpiece which in my opinion it wasnt everyone with their own opinions obviously
Mar 5 2024,positive,superb follow up to part one its intense exciting well acted and brilliantly filmed one of the best science fiction films in many years see it on the largest screen you can find
Mar 5 2024,positive,lot of action wont bother the length of the movie must see
Mar 5 2024,positive,this is the best scifi sequel since alien 2 or the empire strikes back the cinematography and art direction are flawless  the actors give excellent renditions and villanueva becomes a new spielberg and beyond in this beloved series
Mar 5 2024,positive,the second dune was true to the book although some  details were omitted but overall well told the characters were rich and well acted cinematic quality was great of course worm travel was excellent and the freman walk will likely be a dance move if it isnt already
Mar 5 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant  music cinematography performances and wardrobe all the highest possible quality

Mar 5 2024,positive,movie of the year maybe movie of the decade
Mar 5 2024,positive,i will say it is an improvement from the first movie from the visuals the action the drama and even the performance  i will admit that a couple of parts i kinda wanted more but those are my kind of nitpicks and i wont say too much as to avoid sharing spoilers to everyone  even from someone who still hasnt read the books i will say this is one of the most phenomenal movies out there in cinema history for the 2020s  its worth a watch and i will say this is worth being a nominee for movie of 2024 along with a couple of other categories  910
Mar 5 2024,positive,seeing it in imax was astonishing that sound staging with action was just unrelenting the story was great the difference from the 80s version is similar if you see the original deleted scenes but dv understands and wants to explain how and why the manipulation of people was done it has legs for a 3rd and 4th movie and i will be seeing it again in imax i just cant get over how well it all gelled together best scifi i have seen in yrs
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen peak performances by zendaya butler and chalament visually unbeliveably stunning and a soundtrack that shows us the genius of hans zimmer once more
Mar 5 2024,positive,dune was good and so was dune 2 they both should have been spectacularly mindbending an audience tells the tell following a movie if the crowd stays over to talk and decompress from what they just witnessed or let out any emotional response you have something special the writers and director missed the golden opportunity to deliver the casting was fine the story behind dune is epic im left with a feeling you get on a blind date when you meet the wrong person
Mar 5 2024,positive,fantastic film one of the best scifi and space opera films of all time
Mar 4 2024,positive,visual and acting are top notch script and pace are horrible lots of jumps that i only understood because of book ignored parts of the books and diluted the religion part of the book
Mar 4 2024,positive,i loved the continuation from part one and how deep they go into the lore
Mar 4 2024,positive,awesome movie about time
Mar 4 2024,positive,an exceptional acheivement not only visually but also in storytelling
Mar 4 2024,positive,simply soberb as scorsese would say thats cinema
Mar 4 2024,positive,masterpiece i will watch it millions of times  perfect
Mar 4 2024,positive,not as accurate as id hoped when compared to the book but overall pretty good
Mar 4 2024,positive,in general i like denis villeneuves films but not this time    its not easy for me to say but i have to conclude that this is the first film that so masterfully uses emptiness or nothingness this film is like an empty vessel like a lifeless desert it is beautiful in its own way but it contains nothing but sand the world of the master turned out to be sandempty the characters seem completely lifeless to me the dialogues are emotionless deliberately pretentious i dont see much sense in them they are absolutely not interesting to listen to and they only confirm the shortcomings of the work i would characterize the painting as minimalism in the void  a reflection of the inner world    fiction is one of the most difficult and expensive genres and frank herberts novel is a real masterpiece that requires special attention    and i am well aware that to bring such a work to the screen is a huge work and beyond everyones power and the setting and ent itself are tricky to perform and contain many pitfalls    villeneuves vision and style in my opinion somewhat damaged the original source the book text has been shortened and changed which in turn affects the meaning of the story conversations between the characters orientalstyle gibberish seem like childish gibberish which makes them ridiculous and annoying without any benefit it seems to me that the picture is not fully completed the events are too compressed and leave many unanswered questions the role of christopher walken in the film turned out to be quite poor and insignificant he simply had nothing to play and the antiheroes remained underdeveloped unsaid and even the most important villain faded from the narrative villeneuve could not come up with any intelligible arch for him this once again shows the shortcomings of the creator it is difficult for him to give personalities but it is easy  images the visual part of the work overshadowed the drama leaving a feeling of fading and emptiness to fully understand and analyze this picture i will have to revise it although i absolutely do not want to do this because the visual style of the director in this picture turned out to be a common method that offers nothing but minimalism contains neither meaning nor emotions but only small images on a large empty canvas    i will conclude my lengthy discussion with the words of leonardo da vinci where the spirit does not lead the artists hand there is no art
Mar 4 2024,negative,as a longtime herbert fan i have a mixed opinion on this remake my method of rating was determined by how well the movie conformed to the original herbert characters depicted in his writings plot devices for cinematographic flow and entertainment are completely different for example in lynchs 1984 version of dune the director made creative choices to advance the movie and entertain the audience hero paul atreides overcomes enemies and sets everything to right with a distinct movie conclusion lynch stayed true to herberts characters even if embellished throughout villeneuve has strayed from my one key principle of noveltomovie storytelling he changed the motivations of certain key characters this is particularly true of chani perhaps im most sensitive to this as chani has been one of my favorite characters for many decades herberts chani was central to paul in attaining his maximum potential chani exemplified the power of women in a mans world she supported paul compensated for his character weaknesses and anchored him to his humanity herbert relied on subtle and not inyourface feminine power which by the way successful women have accomplished for centuries villeneuve created a belligerent brooding and vindictive character in his version of chani to assimilate with modern audiences perhaps men believe that women need to reiterate these traits to make them formidable ridiculous to me this is complete sacrilege against herberts character further the chemistry between chalamet and zendaya is forensic at best totally decimating herberts love story probably as a direct result of the atrocious character rewrite this begs the question villeneuve what makes you think you know better of how to portray chani than herbert himself when it comes to the fremen the movie does provide a documentarylike and truetolife aesthetic and rendition of herberts vision
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie exceeded my expectations in every way very faithful to the books when i left the theater i immediately wanted to go back in and watch it again love this movie i hope dune messiah is in the works if not it should be
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing cinematography interesting storyline superb acting
Mar 4 2024,positive,wow just wowawesome and im not even a sci fi fan
Mar 4 2024,negative,if you are a fan of the book series this strays from the book so much the plot is almost unrecognizable while its visually appealing and the special effects and costumes are better than the david lynch version this is so disappointing from a story perspective  i really tried to give this one an open mind but it was just annoying i found the acting just okay for the most part i did feel that zendaya was ridiculous but perhaps thats exactly how her script was written i think im done giving denis villeneuve a chance as a director this is now the 3rd stinker of his ive struggled through
Mar 4 2024,positive,great second part to the story very entertaining interesting new characters excited for messiah
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely majestic filmmaking and one of the finest science fiction films of all time incredible visuals matched with a most intriguing story make this an easy suggestion to anyone that appreciates film i cannot wait to watch this film again and again
Mar 4 2024,positive,beats out top gun 2 oppenheimer  barbie imo best movie of 20232024
Mar 4 2024,positive,good action but the monotonous desert is broken only by a monochrome scene and the plot was trying  madeup emotional issues not really present in the book makes up most of the film as well as some important character changes that are cringe characters forced to take actions they did willingly in the book
Mar 4 2024,positive,thats epic has to be seen on theater
Mar 4 2024,positive,see this in imax before its too late great movie but wont be as good at home was definitely worth it better than the first one still really like the original best though
Mar 4 2024,positive,dennis villeneuve and his team have without a doubt set the bar for what  every scifi sequel should aspire to achieve he created the most masterful balance of storytelling pacing action romance suspense that i have seen on screen in a long time the acting is another level as well timothee chalamet austin butler and cast too many too mention but all noteworthy have also performed at an inspiring level this movie will make your jaw drop and is absolutely worth the price of a ticket and that ticket should be to an imax theatre
Mar 4 2024,positive,best conceptualization from books to screen i could imagine it was a gift to me and the best movie ive seen in years
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen lost count of the times i got chills down my neck pure perfection in every conceivable way
Mar 4 2024,positive,awesome but i couldnt get popcorn bucket 
Mar 4 2024,positive,lisan al gaib    the movie was much more fast paced than part 1 and it definitely felt like after they held back on part 1 they were blasting through part 2     the movie explored complex topics such as religion colonialism etc in a very intellectual way
Mar 4 2024,positive,beautiful grand huge but also intimate in many ways i preferred the first one i guess because of the awe i felt seeing and hearing these alien yet fascinating visuals and sounds for the first time  however this film has several moments which surpass the first one the lore deepens and im looking forward to seeing where it goes   i do think the director should remain the same throughout but well see  my favourite character was the mom she looks so interesting   overall a banger 55
Mar 4 2024,positive,the absolute must see sci fi movie of the decade i was not the biggest fan of the first movie but part 2 was mindblowingly epic
Mar 4 2024,positive,a vivid and excity visual interpretation of the second half of book 1
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of if not the best sci fi films ever made visually and audibly stunning definitely watch it in max
Mar 4 2024,positive,probably would have ended it a little differently instead of keeping it open for a sequel but a solid tribute to the book and dune legacy  really enjoyed it
Mar 4 2024,positive,incredible a cinematic masterpiece with a score that rattles your soul acting that immerses you and a story that keeps your heart racing an experience that must be seen in cinemas
Mar 4 2024,positive,started a little slow but what a great movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,a cinematic spectacle not to be missed villenue did a wonderful job with this movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,a masterpiece  an incredible cinematic experience  now bring us dune messiah
Mar 4 2024,positive,stunning and breathtaking a masterpiece in my eyes
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie while not bad just left me expecting more not as good as part 1 imo
Mar 4 2024,positive,incredible 1010 would watch 3 times over if my girlfriend allowed me
Mar 4 2024,positive,excellent adaptation almost better than the book
Mar 4 2024,negative,they made an unbearably long movie longer with countless gratuitous wide shots of the protagonist walked towards the camera in slow motion the pacing was a nightmare watching this movie felt like punishment i would have walked out if i didnt go with a friend
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best experience i had in a movie teather
Mar 4 2024,positive,it is absolutely wonderful in all its disciplines i will go to the cinema repeatedly to see it again
Mar 4 2024,negative,love dune and all the books went to the movie cause i am a fan however if you havent read the book how would you follow the story no mention of the space guild the mentats the weirding way the blue eyes the power of maud dib is just not there very disjointed the director is giving chani and oversized role vs the books and alia is hardly mentioned glad i went butagainif i wasnt a die hard fan would be totally lost suggestionwatch the 1984 movie before you watch thisorread the bookeven better thank you
Mar 4 2024,negative,ill add myself to the minority of reviewers who didnt care for the movie  most of the audience sat there at the end a lot bewildered yes it was epic in terms of effects but the artistic license changes and omissions were annoying no guild the alia change the jihad coming too soon the biggest wtf was probably the timeframe no way he did all of this in six to eight months to be believable also there were a lot of characters who were miscast as a dune fanatic meh
Mar 4 2024,positive,i really really enjoyed this this world is fascinating to me and i loved all the different aspects of it the cast is so good like potential top cast alltime i loved this and think denis and frasier did an unbelievable job of making this world look fantastic and feel real cgi is top notch shooting on location makes movies so much better well done    
Mar 4 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece the entire movie had great acting story telling anticipation sound etc i enjoyed every minute of it
Mar 4 2024,positive,pretty awesome performances all around this is a really ambitious complex movie designed to bot entertain and make you think if you you enjoyed the first part then dont fear the saga is in safe hands
Mar 4 2024,positive,followed very closely with the book  frank herbert wrote this story forty years ago and this was the best interpretation yet  the technology made it possible to show how herbert pictured dune
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part 2 was a master piece a really cultural reset we are lucky to live in this moment at history
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune 2 far exceeded my expectations i can hardly wait for part 3
Mar 4 2024,negative,i was excited to see the sequel but when it finally came i was disappointed so much of the movie was played in slow motion with melodic music playing in the background in an attempt to build tension or drama but in my opinion there was far too much of that for a movie that was almost three hours it felt like not much happened an hour or more couldve been cut from the movie and nobody would notice
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was epic  absolutely incredible  must watch in the big screen  make sure you catch it before it leaves imax and dolby theaters
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually astonishing  one of the best movies ive seen with this kind of effects and cgi  unnecessary  boring long storyline
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is one of those great movie experiences you get to have only once every 5 years i felt as thought ive seen 3 very intense movies
Mar 4 2024,positive,adventure great acting new props kept you on the edge of your seat
Mar 4 2024,positive,any work of visual art  which is always very nonlinear  is somewhat lessened by trying to describe it in very linear written languagebut my best take  this was a masterpiece in every regard and certainly including the stateoftheart cgi in the battle scenes except one  for lack of a better wordtone  to me the tone of the movie was a bit off as compared to dune part 1  it just wasnt as highimpactstunning as the first which had to be exceptionally good or a followon movie this one was never going to be made  if there were one thing and there wasnt that id point my finger at in this regard it would be the overall feel of the relationship between fremen warrioress chani and paul atreides  and as for that in a word  forcednot authentic  this may be because of both the natural lack of chemistry between the two leads and the overtime of attention on them in this dune series version    best i can do for putting a finger on the issue of tone
Mar 4 2024,negative,visual spectacle with lack of substance its a steep departure from the book and characters motivations dont seem well flushed out chani lack purpose and serves only to be a rebellious teen visually its amazing though
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved it made some changes according to the book however they were necessary changes in my opinion should see it in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,this was one of the most impressive movies in terms of world building to have come out in a long time the hyper realistic vfxs paired with the sheer scale of all the different places that are shown is jaw dropping
Mar 4 2024,positive,just saw it in imax great experience loved the story and the battles within it i highly recommend it
Mar 4 2024,positive,a true cinematic experience the positives speak for themselves and the only drawbacks i can see right now are changes from the book i understand the changes but i wouldnt blame book fans for taking issue with these things i wish there was the timejump and that there were more surreal and trippy elements but that might add to the runtime so i get it id be remiss if i didnt say that greig fraser and denis villeneuve are this decades cinema dream team thank you studio overlords for green lighting this project hopefully this will signal to the industry that moviegoers hunger for something grounded and substantial over forgettable cgifests
Mar 4 2024,positive,its a masterpiece i cant wait to add it to my library
Mar 4 2024,positive,best scifi film from this current century one of the 10 best of all time period
Mar 4 2024,positive,wow i was glued to the screen even though it was a nearly 3hour movie i left the theater wanting more
Mar 4 2024,positive,epically long with spectacular battle scenes carried by some big names worth watching in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,different in pacing and tone than part 1 but equally as beautiful lost in the insane visuals and scale are one of the best sound designed movies since interstellar
Mar 4 2024,negative,if you havent seen star wars lord of the rings avatar the matrix or gladiator then youll enjoy the dune films  still cant get my head around why theyre stepping off intergalactic spaceships to fight with blades  at least george lucas had the good sense to put laser swords in his space opera and make the protagonist somewhat likeable
Mar 4 2024,positive,the only time i looked at my phone was to check how much time there was left because i didnt want it to end    i never review movies and in fact i hardly go to the cinema but after watching the trailer and the reviews for this one i felt like i had to and oh boy it sure did meet my expectations what a great movie if you liked the first part i remember watching it and being a bit like meh youll love this one     as other people have pointed out even if you are not that familiar with the dune world like me the plot is very easy to follow yet almost every minute in the movie there is something happening that is interesting and relevant to the story   in fact apart from a very very few cheesy scenes you know like the typical hero doing some acrobatics and killing a bunch of people or the love scene that leads to a kiss i must say there arent many moments where you could even get bored    after drinking my whole soda and holding myself for what it felt like forever i finally decided to sneak out and go to the bathroom when one of the couple of these love scenes started and i had to literally run back to my seat because i was too afraid i was going to miss something important indeed when i arrived back after a minute the scene had already changed and something important was going on    totally recommend it i cannot wait for part 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolute must see even if you arent a sci fi fan dune is the greatest scifi film of its generation true masterpiece if there is one film to not be missed in the theater its this one
Mar 4 2024,positive,lives up to the hype this is epic cinema done in a way we rarely see anymore i havent stopped thinking about it since i saw it the story is multilayered and deals with some of the darkest aspects of humanity  including the wielding of superstition and religion to manipulate the masses the production is absolutely topnotch and sets a new bar in scifi filmmaking i feel giddy that a movie like this was actually made and people are excited about seeing it it gives me hope for the future of cinema     there are some valid criticisms of this movie as there are some unexplained plot holes and some of the events feel a little rushed  but these are minor complaints when taken in context    to those claiming its all cgi  ai google the pics of the actual sets they built for this movie including the massive emperors throne room and dv didnt take a whole team to the arabian peninsula so he could create yet another greenscreen marvel movie     this movie is the real deal go see it and support great scifi filmmaking
Mar 4 2024,positive,not since the lord of the rings has a book been so well adapted to film
Mar 4 2024,positive,the epic scale of vision and artistry expands ones mind beyond imagination to all the individuals who made this movie possible i say bravo absolutely a masterpiece for the ages i cannot wait to see the next installment
Mar 4 2024,positive,one time watch on a big screen not much more
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part 2 is just the most thoughtful mature and wellcrafted scifi movie with the ending we needed after the ambiguous ending of part 1 just the very best scifi movie of the last decade
Mar 4 2024,positive,for a fan of the book too much has been changed or is missing chani is not betrayed and does not take off in a rage a terible way to end the movie the only purpose i can think of for this flagrant deviation is to force the studio to make part 3 by not giving the audience closure  also what happened to is pauls son where is thufir hawat pauls sister should have been born and freaked everyone out no money ws spent on showing the grandeur of the imperial court why be emperor if you can only afford dingy and bare rooms often visually stunning and mostly good but in the end an unfaithful interpretation
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was ok not as good as the first part visually stunning of course and great special effects doesnt follow the book like part one did no chemistry between the leads though
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually stunning emotionally gripping the best film i have ever seen i was immersed with the characters and story from beginning to end i had to stop myself rising out my seat when paul speaks at the council this is a masterclass in sound design and exposition vs visual storytelling every scene with feyd rautha is somehow heavier than daemon targaryens presence in house of the dragon i cannot wait to see it again
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a movie with a very endearing plot and characters that you can get close to in this movie they develop concepts that they showed us in part 1 the only problem i see with the movie is that it can be complex to understand and that it is a movie with a very extensive story other than that the movie is perfect in everything
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is a masterpiece of cinema
Mar 4 2024,positive,we were immersed once more in the art and creativity of this wonderful story i anticipate dunes to be a world hit and to become immortalized forever tc was amazing i see an oscar and zendy gorgeous and bold we missed duncan  i wish he couldve made it  great movie i crave for whats to come dunes 3 i cant wait
Mar 4 2024,positive,great action great character development perfect casting must be seen in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,no words can start to grasp how you feel while watch this masterpiece i can only assume this is what people felt watching the empire strikes back when it first came out this was art this was 65 stars this movie deserves all the praise it will receive for years to come if possible for you to do please go and experience this culture changing film
Mar 4 2024,positive,the best of the best bravo 
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is by far the greatest movie i have seen in a long long time i cant tell you how refreshing it is to go the movies and see an extremely well made movie might even take the spot of greatest of all time scifi movie it was three hours long and i could have gone right back into the theater to watch it again
Mar 4 2024,positive,technically flawless film
Mar 4 2024,positive,enjoyed it very much
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best seconds part ive ever seen in my life
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing villeneuve has done the impossible made a great movie out of a book long thought unadaptable
Mar 4 2024,positive,great film makes the very alien worlds believable and real helps if youve seen the first film my minor quibble was one of the bad guys did the liking a knife as a shorthand way of showing hes a psychco thing that has become a cliché
Mar 4 2024,positive,brilliant fight scenes and the worms
Mar 4 2024,positive,truly the best movie ive ever experienced    i need more
Mar 4 2024,positive,theres so much to say but also so little to say perfect movie imo acting is perfect soundtracks are amazing cinematography is what we are used to it from greig fraser you can see how much everyone cared for this movie and it pays off one of the best experience ive had in cinema
Mar 4 2024,positive,i saw dune part two on imax and it was stunning epic cinematography amazing sound a longtime fan of the book series i cant get enough quickly enough to satisfy my appetite for this adaptation im not even upset that some of the original story has been tweaked a bit
Mar 4 2024,negative,the film ignores the novel paul and chanis relationship is portrayed completely wrong doing zendaya no favors   by the end we are hoping the next sandworm eats her  they ignore one of the most critical scenes and perhaps the best line from the novel at jamiss funeral rites with a key moment taken from paul and given to jessica    the entire point of the novelpaul essentially transcending humanityis played as a side note which they had to do for their completely misguided take on chani to work  gurney is a weak shadow of his musical self in the book  the birth of alia and her role at the end   erased    the mumblingand most deadlycount fenring  gone    mentats as essential advisers gone    ferguson and bardem are great though they end up making stilgar a figure of ridicule    the more i think about it  the worse it gets dropping it from three stars to 25     make that 20
Mar 4 2024,negative,nowhere near as good as the original oneguess will satisfy the younger generationsquiet messy and so boring thoughacting is also mediocre from the younger oneszendaya is just awful  ruined the characteri feel the higher rating are biased
Mar 4 2024,positive,an outstanding cinematic experience it must be watch on imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,as a part two dune has its signature deep twists and turns  i will have to see it again to catch what i missed the first time  it is full of excitement  glad to finally really see the worms 
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing movie definitely ended great fyi no post credits
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is the definition of epic an absolute masterpiece that i cannot wait to watch again my wife and i considered going outside and buying tickets for the next show but alas we had grown up things to do an unbelieveable movie that if the 3rd does the business may make this the greatest triliogy of all time
Mar 4 2024,positive,while it wasnt one of my favorite movies theres nothing to complain about it  by any quantitative metric the movie is perfect
Mar 4 2024,positive,beautiful movie you really escape and the universe feels believable and fresh
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually stunning and a very good followon to part 1
Mar 4 2024,positive,great entertainment a must see  this movie will keep you engaged from start to finish  finally a movie worth the price of admission
Mar 4 2024,positive,came with medium to high expectations but the plot cinematography locations actors performance and more blew my mind 1010 movie but there is so much more story to be told
Mar 4 2024,positive,the movie is awesome
Mar 4 2024,positive,i actually made a rotten tomatoes account simply to relay what a triumphant achievement this movie is it is a surreal and immersive journey displaying an unmatched level of visual beauty the movie does stray from the book in some ways but it does so intelligently and with narrative purpose the costumes writing cinematography and acting are all top notch and the musical score is absolutely perfect this film is a career moment for everyone involved simply stated it is one of the best movies that i have ever seen
Mar 4 2024,positive,saw it last night in imax   incredible movie cinematography score acting pacing story foreshadowing so good best movie of last 510 years definitely going to see it several more times
Mar 4 2024,positive,a sequel that is better in every single way a sequel should be
Mar 4 2024,positive,epic  the cgi was amazing the whole movie was amazing
Mar 4 2024,positive,the two part telling of the story of dune book 1 was amazing the intensity and atmosphere of the dune books was captured flawlessly by these 2 movies the characters came alive and most importantly the character of paul developed through dukes son fugitive freeman fighter to messianic leader whether you loved the dune books or just want to watch an awesome sci fiction adventure into a unique world watch these movies cant wait till they adapt dune messiah and children of dune
Mar 4 2024,negative,i went in with high expectations because of all the reviews from youtubers and tiktockers however not only is it boring its worse than the first part in the end it lifts a little very disappointed
Mar 4 2024,positive,nearly a perfect movie the final battle feels a tad rushed and would have liked to see more of it that is the only reason it doesnt reach a perfect score
Mar 4 2024,positive,this might be the greatest movie ive ever seen in my entire life  the cinematography the set the acting everything was just great  this movie was almost 3 hours yes but i could have watched for another 5  1010 im going to see it again 
Mar 4 2024,positive,perfection peak film making
Mar 4 2024,neutral,do not go see the movie dune part two2024ratedpg13 it was not that good i went to and sawdune part two2024at 300pmct sunday march 03 2024at great movies places namedalamo drafthouse cinemamovies placesin austintexastxi wrote my comments here at 1138amct monday march 04 2024
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely loved the film the screenplay removed whatever was unnecessary for the screen and everything works brilliantly and denise got to tell the story he wanted to tell somethings couldve been stretched in the final act but nothing that keeps it from being a great movie ignore the contrarians and just see it for yourself
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune messiah is an epic story about the desperate play for power and survival of paul atreides against the wills and plans of several powerful factions in an intergalactic future  a dependency on a crucial resource only found on one planet gives paul reason and motive to manipulate the native people to become their messiah  pauls rapid rise to power leads to an abrupt ending with a souring betrayal and sufficiently used populous  regardless the cinematic experience was immersive and i can still feel the blade paul grasped that slipped through his hands 
Mar 4 2024,positive,in a wordepic  if youre looking at the run time and feeling anxiousdont  it holds your attention    i know dune is based on a book series and had a movie way back but for me it was better to have no knowledge of the source material  going in without expectations made this a great movie      watched dune part one at home on hbo max and it was great to be able to see part two in an imax theater as the visualssound were incredible    and for anyone making star wars comparisons remember that dune predates the original sw and was influential to george lucas as he was developing his story
Mar 4 2024,positive,darn near the perfect movie  hollywood take note this is what you get when you assemble real talent and they work together to produce a true masterpiece  ironically i doubt this will qualify for best picture because it does not hit the dei quota tragic
Mar 4 2024,positive,the cinema industry needed this movie denis villeneuve is a great director and dune 2 is his master piece
Mar 4 2024,positive,the cinematography filled me with awe  such a great job of following the book as well    i found i couldnt look at the violence of which there was plenty even though it wasnt graphic  im just a battle whimp
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is a great movie  it is a must see for all dune fans
Mar 4 2024,positive,seriously incredible movie expands and elevates the first and really incredible effects acting is stellar just a incredible experience
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved it best movie since the pandemic ended
Mar 4 2024,negative,unreasonable plot  everyone else is useless  only the protagonist is awesome  only fun humor
Mar 4 2024,positive,saw this with the kids was enthralled with it cant wait to see the third movie would like to have seen the navigator guild play a role in it its only hinted at the other changes all make sense and you really can see how he was able to take control with his presence the changes to chani are also pretty good  people say that there wasnt enough chemistry but to me it looked pretty good  you can see her conflict really well  excellent movie would recommend to anyone who was a fan of the first one or likes epic fight scenes
Mar 4 2024,positive,great follow up amazing visuals and directing and acting took off a half star for adaptation which i thought got clunky at times
Mar 4 2024,positive,it lost a star because it didnt follow the book in places and changed the story line  alia where are you it was also slow in several places
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing plotline which as complex as it is you can still follow the sound effect were phenomenal the battle scenes really pulled you in this adaptation followed quite closely to the book i loved seeing those connections throughout the movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,the visuals were breathtakingly stunning  not just the desert but the other settings as well  love the complexity of the plot  when you leave the cinema unsure of who to root for and who to dislike you know that the story was very good
Mar 4 2024,positive,it met and exceeded every bit of the hype i had read beforehand as a lifelong fan of dune it surpassed my every expectation
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune 2 was epic timothy chalamet was the sugar and spice with everything nice
Mar 4 2024,positive,wonderfully done my only problem will be waiting for the sequel
Mar 4 2024,positive,an incredible film back to back the acting and everyone involved was excellent do yourself a favor folks and see it in imax if you see one movie in imax ever it should be this one
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is pure action and very detail to it one of the best movies ive ever watch
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best scifi films ive seen in years everything from the visuals to cinematography to the acting this movie knocked it out of the park
Mar 4 2024,positive,for a film thats almost 3 hours long it sure didnt feel that way what can i say both the film and experience in imax was astonishing the visuals sound story acting was all top notch austin butler killed it as feydrautha if you enjoyed the first dune youll no doubt enjoy this entry as well i highly recommend this film for anyone who loves actionscififantasy stories or if you want to escape reality for 3 hours either wayi loved dune part 2
Mar 4 2024,positive,i felt the movie was well written very good ci with much more action than part one i took away a half star because the movie concluded on a cliffhanger but i have read that a part three is in the works and will conclude the trilogy if you saw the 1984 movie dont expect to see the same thing after paul ingests the water of life i never read the book but what i have been told this movie follows the book much more closely than the 1984 movie so im lokking forward to the final film which will probably be released in 2028
Mar 4 2024,negative,while dune part 2 is visually stunning as a fan of the book i was disappointed by the changes made for the film adaptation the director seemed afraid to confuse audiences with the time jump that occurs in the book series resulting in the loss of much of the complexity of the fremen culture far too much effort was put into setting up for the next book in the series leaving me with the feeling that this film was merely a dream sequence of one of the possible futures that paul sees the biggest disappointment by far was the changes made to each characters story and motivations especially chani
Mar 4 2024,positive,there are few issues with this interpretation of the book however they are very small compared to the grand scale of this opera
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely worth going to the theater for weve been majorly let down lately with movies being awful or just not worth seeing in the theater and this one i may go see again it was that visually appealing im not a critic so i dont really know what else to say other than we need this quality of movie back you can tell everyone genuinely cared about this story and it was a damn good story
Mar 4 2024,positive,i really liked this movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,its been a long time since ive left a movie theater having the thought of i need to see that as many more times as i can on the biggest screen possible
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic  lots of action lots of emotion loved it
Mar 4 2024,negative,its very loud long and languid it was ai made and it was not very creative i almost fell asleep and it bored my 13 and 11 year old kids
Mar 4 2024,negative,easy to follow if you read the books but the writers changed just enough to show that they think they are better at writing than frank herbert i just wanted to watch dune the prequel to their fan fiction rewrite of the later books
Mar 4 2024,positive,so amazing such a visual spectacle
Mar 4 2024,positive,in short dune part 2 is a film worth seeing and appreciating all its visuals are beautiful and delightful to see the acting work of the entire cast is more than competent it is brilliant it feels like piece by piece this universe is settling its bases correctly and concisely however despite all this i do also believe that the opinion of it is a little exaggerated being the same compared to films like the lord of the rings i truly respect that a new science fiction saga arrives and that it impacts the way it is doing it but i do believe that the saga is still far from being considered a classic maybe its just a matter of time before my perspective on the film changes but by now dune part 2 is a good film with its respective defects that i hope will last and be an example to follow in other production companies
Mar 4 2024,positive,not even close its the best movie ive seen in years i hope there is a four hour long directors cut which includes all the bits that were shaved for time but even that aside its a great movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,i love bald dudes now 
Mar 4 2024,positive,the visuals are amazing and the soundtrack makes u feel like ur floating
Mar 4 2024,positive,predictable even without seeing the original sappy and loud all facts
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually stunning interesting story and amazing sound
Mar 4 2024,positive,spoiler free   the dune franchise  part 1 and 2 is not perfectly executed there are some minor pacing issues but it is genuinely one of the most immersive worlds ever put to screen and as good as anyone can possibly hope for it feels real the world is real     when i think of the word immersive i am implying that the world feels lived in the world isnt begging for you to understand it with contrived exposition but it does instill a sense of curiosity dune makes you want to understand it exposition is done with subtly characters dont always show their hand and the world feels like a place you need to learn     and for a huge scifi epic i love that about this franchise i believe it     backed by an incredible score unreal sound design and mesmerizing visuals that looks like you are actually looking at reality importance is placed on its fully realized characters you completely understand everyones motivations and nothing feels contrived to move the plot forward you believe the relationships are real and the characters convince you its lore and world are as real as our own     that is what blows me away it feels grounded and huge at the same time     one issue is pacing in its final act but when you watch it you understand why also i consider part 1  2 the fully fleshed out story watching one without the other makes the story feel incomplete so i cant say its perfect     but what dune offers is unprecedented in scale and believability go to the theaters and genuinely enter this world     there is so much more to talk about but the long and short of it is dont miss this we have to support movies like this to convince hollywood that we want quality at even the biggest scale
Mar 4 2024,positive,near perfection but dont forget your earplugs
Mar 4 2024,positive,the beauty of that film is out of my comprehension cool thematics were explored in a very fluid way the narrative has no break every scene leads to something important images were so clear the universe felt real to me perfect casting with chalamet as paul atreides zendaya as chaki and much more i will watch it another time at least 
Mar 4 2024,positive,villeneuve delivers yet another masterpiece stunning visuals combined with a faithful depiction of frank herberts magnum opus make dune part two nothing short of nearly perfect
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune 2 is a large screen spectacle that has been missing from hollywood of late simply put see it on as large a screen as you can and hopefully compliment that with a strong sound system
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely outstanding cinematic experience probably the best film ive seen in my recent years
Mar 4 2024,positive,great continuation awesome giants scenes very moving when its supposed to be
Mar 4 2024,positive,i love scifi fantasy and all types of fiction this movieseries has taken a spot in not only my favoritegreatest sci fi movies ever watched but just as one of the greatest movies i have ever watched pauls character development from the first to the second along with his relationship with channi the tension between him and his mother the funny but serious moments of stilgars glazing and just the overall tone and pacing of this movie are done phenomonally i hardly ever review movies but i felt like i had to write just how amazing this movie is i saw it with my girlfriend who didnt like the first movie but she thouroughly loved the second one im going to watch the first and second one again with my friends this week and i plan on watch this movie for a 3rd time in theatres again because of how much i loved it after wonka i thought timothee was a goofy guy but after seeing this movie you understand just how amazing timothee chalamet is and how this movie is the sci fi movie of our generation watch dune 2
Mar 4 2024,positive,the sound was at times overpowering but the acting was superb and the sets and clothing was absolutely spot on the movie run time was great  and i would highly recommend it to others
Mar 4 2024,positive,timothy chalamet does an excellent job evolving into the role of a slightly deranged leader
Mar 4 2024,positive,blown away by the closest adaptation to the book so far
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune pt 2 is a cinematic masterpiece that must be seen in the theater  every element of this film is of the highest quality and completely enjoyable
Mar 4 2024,positive,epic what the starwars sequel trilogy should have been in tone and scope cannot wait for part 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,excellent movie continues the saga of the dune legacy
Mar 4 2024,positive,do yourself a favor and familiarize yourself with the back stories of this universe but then go see this  was great might go see a second theater showing
Mar 4 2024,positive,too long and disjointed  i doubt people that hadnt read the books could follow the story part 1 was much better although not as good as the original movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,i was actually surprised when it had ended because it was so good i never lost interest
Mar 4 2024,positive,great movie  locked in from start to finish cant wait for dune 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,been a long time since i was fully engaged by a cinema release the sound music and visuals 100 gripped me yeah there are some plot holes but forgivable
Mar 4 2024,positive,a treat for the senses dune part 2 wraps up the story with an epic and powerful spectacle
Mar 4 2024,positive,what the cinema was made for unbelievable film
Mar 4 2024,negative,great visual effects but weak story line confusing and too long  would have been just as good shaving of an hour
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved timothee chalamet
Mar 4 2024,positive,does denis never go wrong  well in this movie he keeps me on the end of my seat there are parts here and there where i think i have to watch again to give the last part of the star in all its a beautiful movie it follows the story well and underlines the struggle of growing up and making sometimes impossible decisions the epic music and incredibly beautiful filmmaking make this a mustsee movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,good not great  the first movie was better and this one relied exclusively on the character development from the first to prop up the plot  i would say this movies success is more a reflection of the lack of good options at the theaters over the last two years  i would watch again but shouldve done so originally on my couch
Mar 4 2024,positive,even i a northern nonfundamentalist for the original film cant deny any aspect of this absolutely encapsulating and brilliant film
Mar 4 2024,positive,the worms and the battles are amazing
Mar 4 2024,positive,i really respect the fact that this thing is almost relentless in its bad vibes no cheering you are only be overwhelmed
Mar 4 2024,positive,incredible movie    i liked dune 1 because denis really slowed down the pace for world building    dune 2 absolutely benefits from this decision incredible movie unbelievable pictures and the score from hans zimmer is just goosebumps    the movie has everything slow quiet scenes and on the other hand the action fighting scenes out of nowhere i felt goosebumps on my skin more than 56 times    go and watch dune 2 in cinema
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part two is great it has incredible action captivating drama and a stellar cast the only main issue i have is the ending after waiting 3 years to see the conclusion of the first dune we got another cliffhanger i would have preferred something that wrapped up the story in a somewhat satisfying way but what we got was just something that sets up another sequel
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was okay nothing to write home about i could have waited for this to be on hbo lol two movies that built up to a third movie is really dragging it out we spent half of the movie with him in training i almost fell asleep twice
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely a film to watch but given the premises the budget and the heights to which the film aims i felt like it really felt short in some aspects the special effects most of the acting and the fight scenes are stunning among the best ive ever seen however the story lacks a lot the first hour keeps the world building we saw in the first film almost arriving to the point at whpich boredom starts to become overwhelming then the action scenes start with the freman starting to fight the invaders for me the problem from now on is that you never see a struggle the good guys just completely waste the arkonnans without any type of organized resistance or attempt to repress them they just continue sending small groups to them to be massacred in the desert until when the main bad guy appears magically plot hole in my opinion discovers the hideout of the good guys and massacres everyone again in a one sided battle not shown on screen in which nobody even tries to resist until that point the fremen where easily massacring the other guys but suddenly as the plot requires it the bad guys are better then them then the good guys organzie themselves and again you have a  one sided battle in which the bad guys just get massacred it makes you ask yourself why they didn t do it before if it was so easy the film doeesn t really transmit the feeling of a struggle it seems like if both sides receive power ups to then become static again waiting for the power up and response of the other side as if in a tennis match furthermore also most of the side plots are confusing and badly explained i arrived at the end of it really confused to then discover that there wasn t really an end the film just gets interrupted in the middle of yet another fight in overall is a film to watch and then forget good cinema experience but that s all
Mar 4 2024,negative,boring and weird lacklustre fight scenes directionless did i mention weird
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved this movie     no further comments necessary
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is why we still need to go to a theater to experience movies i was completely taken into the story and transported to the dune universe i had a smile on my face from the beginning and marveled at all the amazing things we were treated to on the big screen nit pickers will pull apart the small flaws in this film but what is a perfect film that is subjective this accomplishes what the best films do they give us a break from our small worlds allow us to take a break from our problems and enjoy some needed fresh air and enjoy a needed mental vacation only a short distance from our homes if you love good scifi and need an escape definately go see dune part 2 i reccomend seeing part one for the first time or again to prep your brain for the setting but definately go see it in the theater in all its big screen glory
Mar 4 2024,positive,not a boring moment not once  if you enjoy movies about prophecies then go see this one
Mar 4 2024,positive,although it can be slow at times the action characters and thrilling visual more than make up for it timothee chalemet and austin butler are huge stand outs and make for a great dynamic hans zimmers score is thrilling and boosts the already amazing visual aesthetics  i am very excited to see where this story goes in future instalments
Mar 4 2024,positive,this film was more than a movie it was an immersive experience dune part two is so effective and grand that it catapults you into another world the world of frank herberts dune one of the most beautifully crafted and captivating films ive ever seen dune part two has entered the realm of my top 5 favorite movies for sure a masterpiece of scifi that i will be sure to enjoy many times over may thy knife chip and shatter if you happen to miss out on this amazing adventure enjoy
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was different than last movie all over the place but i was able to keep up i like the new twist and the more indepth to the whole story along with the changes
Mar 4 2024,positive,this outdoes the original in every way everyone turns in incredible performances i would have picked someone else to be the emperor because his presence distracting but his role is rather minimal if you are a scifi fan you must see this movie in the theater
Mar 4 2024,positive,music way tooo loud and disrupted conversation on screen  anti climactic ending  maybe leaving it open for dune 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,stunning visuals i have never read the books so came in with little expectations or knowledge of the series first dune was great and part two was unbelievable
Mar 4 2024,positive,i believe that dune part two was better than the first one but it still just has a lot of slow parts these movies are mostly for diehard fans because sometimes the storyline is hard to follow overall though the cinematography is truly amazing and something that needs to be seen
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolute cinema watch in biggest screen possibile scifi is back
Mar 4 2024,positive,so i was debating if i should watch this move in a theater or just wait till it comes out digital and omg thank good i watched it in the theater the movie had me hooked from the beginning till the end everything in this movie is amazing from the actors to the amazing camera shots and the best music ever the fight scenes were amazing and the cgi looked like it was real life all and all i give this movie a 1010 and i kinda want to go to the theater to watch it again wold 100 recommend this masterpiece

Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part two is the epitome of where art and science fiction converge magnificent grandiose and sensitive it stands as a masterpiece
Mar 4 2024,positive,more of a spiritual experience than a film it is dream states drug scapes enlightenment a tale of fate a hans zimmer music video and a madmans rise from humble to messiah if the first movie gave you chills in your neck and into your shoulders and up into the bottom and middle of your skull this one will give you more

Mar 4 2024,positive,truly epic great character and story work with one of the best scores of the last couple of decades  very subversive movie that is not shy about it thoroughly absorbs herberts themes about the dangers of hero worship
Mar 4 2024,positive,best movie i have watched in a long time possibly of all time the 3 hour run time does not feel like enough as you will be sucked in from the beginning and wont want to look away dune part two is a true masterpiece and is much more than your average dystopian scifi film
Mar 4 2024,positive,did a good job on the backstory of the main characters
Mar 4 2024,positive,the filme is perfect there are some things that are different in the first book but regardless it is a master piece the songs the environment and the adaptation are breath taking and i dont even want to get in the character development paul feyd chani and some other characters

Mar 4 2024,positive,a must watch no words needed for this movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time planning to rewatch again we made the mistake of not seeing it in imax great visuals soundtrack and storyline this sequel was definitely better than the first movie i wish it were longer the time flew by
Mar 4 2024,positive,if you enjoyed the story andor the visuals of the first installment then this becomes a mustsee watched it yesterday and was impressed to say the least brought so many different elements to bear all within the first hour and the story came to a very tense and resonating culmination towards that last half hour very well paced and edited to match the screen time and did not feel too long or drawn out to me my gf was compelled and she usually isnt one to be immersed much into a storyline i would say highly impressed with the adaptation pacing and editing for sure kept the viewer not just entertained but invested in the characters and the storyline although not a stand alone piece this second part i would surmise be the better of the three parts in as far as the story development and action are concerned highly enjoyable in the right format i would say definitely watch this in imax if at all possibleworth every penny
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually brilliant the music intense and well suited to the dramatic story line skipped parts of the book that werent necessary but kept the best parts 1010 for me
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely breathtaking one in a decade for sure will gonna watch it in imax again
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece very impressive and immersive
Mar 4 2024,positive,first review im writing on rotten tomatoes simply because i cant believe some of these expert opinions  seriously youre giving it a 35 what the fuck is wrong with you     i watched it in dolby atmos of course and what can i say  honestly the best cinema experience ive ever had  maybe even the best movie ive ever seen the cinematography is amazing the sounds  music is amazing and i simply love the story its something new its exciting and its not as generic as most other movies even though its 3h it never got boring i was even leaning forward in my seat at times really scaredexcited for whats going to happen  i usually never have this     sure opinions are subjective but if one rates this masterpiece as a 35 one is crazy
Mar 4 2024,positive,a masterpiece see it in the biggest loudest place you can find
Mar 4 2024,positive,a gritty chilling dramatic stylistic epic that perfectly adats it source material into an incredibly visual universe the next star wars indeed
Mar 4 2024,positive,despite trying not to laugh initially at austin butler sounding like a bald space elvis this film is everything that cinema was made for whether you are a seasoned veteran of the dune books and stories or you love scifi and fantasy there isnt a trilogy of films that i have been so excited and enthralled with since lord of the rings or star wars villeneuve has created something that will stand the test of time in cinema and hans zimmers soundtrack is stunningly beautiful there is no part of this film that bores you even the parts that are perceived to be slower are still so engaging and the ability to build character arcs for those characters that are only in one film is excellent   dune part 2 in short is a cinematic masterpiece
Mar 4 2024,positive,i found this the best piece of cinema i have ever seen its amazing so well done and best characters ever
Mar 4 2024,positive,i can only imagine that the way i felt after watching this movie is how people in 1977 felt after watching star wars for the first time denis villeneuves vision for this story accompanied by greg frasers cinematography and hanz zimmers score is a visual and emotional masterpiece the characters are so compelling the story makes you feel every emotion and the action is thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat this is a masterful scifi adventure its star wars for adults
Mar 4 2024,positive,for the most part i liked the movie enough to watch it i absolutely loved part 1 and watched it several times i have read the book and i expected some changes to the story because the book is massive with content and i can accept that part 1 did that well part 2 however deviates from the story especially with  the character chani to the point it damages the story i think the director honestly thought he could do better than a great source material  the absence of  young alia from movie was also disappointing and unnecessary at this point im pretty worried that dune messiah will be a giant waste of time
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is without a shadow of a doubt the greatest movie of the 21st century and possibly of all time it definitely deserves a spot up there with the greats like empire strikes back and the two towers as this movie is the definition of perfect     dune 2 delivered in every way meeting and even exceeding all expectations i am truly lucky to be alive to witness this movie as i did in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,filmão do krl this switch descrever 500 oscars habe the best fight and war scenes ever fuck star wars i love star wars thought
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely fantastic this will for sure be an oscar contender for the 2025 awards the cinematography is phenomenal and the action is superb
Mar 4 2024,positive,a fantastic adaptation of the book continued villeneuve got the scale bang on once again paticularly the battle scenes visually even better than part one his rendition of guedi prime was superb and of course all tied together with another brilliant score from hans zimmer im sure its going to be just as good on a rewatch
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually spectacular so good to have a near perfect film experience after the general dross that have been served up over the last years
Mar 4 2024,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this  did not disappoint
Mar 4 2024,positive,wow great film that was worth the wait not having it last fall was discouraging  loved every bit of it found myself very moved by it  3 hours is long to sit but the movie held you in your seat  a
Mar 4 2024,positive,this gave me everything i wanted from the dune universe and more an amazing adaptation pacing was right acting brilliant visuals were phenomenal and the slight departure from the book worked in my opinion
Mar 4 2024,positive,im just here to praise the strong female characters
Mar 4 2024,positive,a  cinematic masterpiece must watch in the biggest screen possible
Mar 4 2024,positive,i dont care how many parts they make  im in for all of them  the cast the cinematography script and acting  all top notch 
Mar 4 2024,positive,i watched the first one yesterday watched 2nd one today 3 hour movie way too long nothing special

Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part 2 is an amazing movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is going to be a generational movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,the best imax movie experience ever legendary story stunning photography masters soundtrack a nearperfect movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,even if youre not a fan of the dune series books games movies short series etc or an avid follower of the muaddib this movie is by far the best one so far the fact that the writers did their absolute best to show only the most important moments is astonishing the cinematography is on point the sound is awesome definitely recommend watching the movie in cinema or with good sound system  headphones the plot was clear but well presented the whole package was complete  after the 3 hours have gone i did not feel like ive spent 3 hours strapped to a chair it was a pleasure watching this go watch it 
Mar 4 2024,positive,an excellent film with stunning sets landscapes and an outstanding cast
Mar 4 2024,positive,as a reader who is addicted to anything dune i can confirm dune part 2 is very cool d
Mar 4 2024,positive,i loved it the world building the music score best of all time the brutalism the acting the epic scale the action and above everything else the athmosphere this is how its done this is science fiction for adults i got severe goosebumps from watching the rise of the kwisatz haderach an absolute masterpiece dune 2 delivers on the promises of the first film and opens up for a third installment
Mar 4 2024,neutral,think everyone was disappointed in how it ended too many subtitles  weird names of the tribes etc just a movie you dont walk away from with a good feeling you just say to yourself why did i waste 3 hours of my time wouldnt see it again if you paid me
Mar 4 2024,positive,i really liked the dune saga and part 2 was not a disappointment
Mar 4 2024,positive,this might be the best movie ive ever seen
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was great but im not into sifi n wish it was 2 hrs instead of 245 hrs
Mar 4 2024,positive,massive breathtaking
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved it  it combines farfuture sciif with mysticism and it does it so beautifully  my favorite type of movie by far
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing movie worth watching it has me in the edge of my seat for the entire of the movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely stunning effects will there be a part 3  it has been a long time since i have seen a movie so impactful i literally felt like i was in the actual movie my heart stopped multiple times this is on the same level as the greats such as  lord of the rings and star wars i plan on seeing it a second time
Mar 4 2024,positive,theres too much to compliment and praise about a nearly perfect film so i will focus on my nitpicks 1 walken did a good job but he pulls me out of it 2 florence pughs princess irulan needed just the slightest bit more development  3 gurney  rabbans fight should have been a bit longer and more intense for a better payoff 4 the final battle between the harkonnensemperor and the fremen was a little too easy for them to win although the battle was incredible 9710
Mar 4 2024,positive,its impossible for me to give anything less than 5 stars this film is what the cinema was made for denis villeneuve is a visionary genius cant wait to see it again
Mar 4 2024,positive,excellent film best ive seen in a long time
Mar 4 2024,positive,beautiful sets and landscapes excellent cast one of hans zimmers best score with the vocals of lisa gerrard that bring awe to yet another level best version of dune so far but ending is not satisfactory now we expected dune 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,great movie but it fails to really tell the accurate story with its changes to chani and a few others when will directors ever learn that we dont want their own version we want the authors
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a long time the first movie was solid this second movie was epic i remember seeing dune in the 80s and this reboot of the series puts it to shame bravo denis villeneuve
Mar 4 2024,positive,symphonic epicness and world building of lord of the rings awesome
Mar 4 2024,positive,one of the best films of recent years the story the visuals and the music are all of the highest standard
Mar 4 2024,positive,imax version is epic  great action great audio good acting  expands on the og dune and part 1 cant wait to have this for the home theater   storyline seemed to jump forward 2 or 3 times where it felt like they had to edit parts out due to time  maybe a director version someday   i would give it 5 stars then
Mar 4 2024,positive,excellent as you might expect given parti previously  of course leavesopen the ending for subsequent sequels from the dune franchise  not sure how long they can keep up this quality level though
Mar 4 2024,positive,it start right of the previous movie and it gets better and better it is in all honesty a must see movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,thrilling wellpaced fantastic writing superb directing powerful performances and otherworldly score and sound design     dune part 2 is fraking great
Mar 4 2024,positive,this was an incredible movie the acting cinematography soundtrack were all phenomenal there were a few times were the dialogue was hard to hear this is 100 a movie you should see in dolby imax or whatever giant screen you can find
Mar 4 2024,positive,i love it great production and powerful music
Mar 4 2024,positive,great cinematography and amazing musical score one of the best franchises of the genre and an extremely impressive follow up to what was already a fantastic start in dune 2021
Mar 4 2024,positive,its everything we hoped it would be
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part two was hands down one of the best cinematic experiences that i have witnessed in the last 30 years this film is meant to be seen in the theater on the biggest screen possible for those who thought part one was more on the slow side with more character development will be very pleased to hear that part two ups the ante with the action spectacle there was so many iconic scenes and visuals that its hard to say which one was my favorite our newcombers for part two with austin butler florence pugh and christopher walken are all awesome austins character especially is very good and he transforms into the role some may not even realize that its him in the role as his features and voice are both unrecognizable here i cant wait to watch the in depth behind the scenes to see how this movie was made music composer hans zimmer does an absolute terrific job once again on the score as it is epic on so many levels part 2 does such a great job of story telling that even if someone missed part one they would still understand what is transpiring im already looking forward on what part three will have in store for us dune part two gets the highest rating score possible with a perfect 5 stars out of 5 go see it
Mar 4 2024,positive,something is going on with the sound system some part were super hard to hear what they were saying
Mar 4 2024,positive,best movie of all time
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was an amazing epic movie loved it want to see it again already looking forward to the next one to come out
Mar 4 2024,positive,cinematography storytelling sound and acting all suberb  villanueva is masterful im a dune geek and love these movies as much as a love the books
Mar 4 2024,positive,basically i loved everything about diane part two including the cinematography music art direction direction and acting on my second watch the film impressed me even more than on first watch
Mar 4 2024,positive,i saw it twice and left both times tearing up ive not been so mesmerized by a film for over a decade the story the acting the cinematography the music an absolute masterpiece
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is hands down one of the best films ive ever seen in my life 10 out of 10
Mar 4 2024,positive,next trilogy im into love everything about it
Mar 4 2024,positive,dome is a really good movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,as epic in scale as it is complex in narrative dune part two continues the dune saga in an exceptional fashion
Mar 4 2024,positive,a little on the long side but definitely everything the first movie brought to the table and more a lot more light hearted which helps with a near 3 hour film of literal doom and gloom its hard to see next years oscars not give this movie all the same accolades as part 1 but since its a sequel im sure the lazy voters will snub this greatly all the characters get more depth which is a plus the lure that the dune ip has to offer is something that todays audience can eat up like theres no tomorrow the story was easier for me to follow this time around its just that some of the names escapes me at first and it didnt help that everyone either spoke like batman or whisper talked and the sound was both loud and demanding on an enjoyable scale i highly suggest seeing this in imax this movie is great and i look forward to future projects if you dont like the franchise or any of the cast members then this movie probably wont tickle your fancy but if youre turned off by anything in the film why are you watching if you love cinema this is a movie to be experienced not simply seen 
Mar 4 2024,positive,a little on the long side but definitely everything the first movie brought to the table and more a lot more light hearted which helps with a near 3 hour film of literal doom and gloom     its hard to see next years oscars not give this movie all the same accolades as part 1 but since its a sequel im sure the lazy voters will snub this greatly     all the characters get more depth which is a plus the lure that the dune ip has to offer is something that todays audience can eat up like theres no tomorrow the story was easier for me to follow this time around its just that some of the names escapes me at first and it didnt help that everyone either spoke like batman or whisper talked and the sound was both loud and demanding on an enjoyable scale i highly suggest seeing this in imax     this movie is great and i look forward to future projects if you dont like the franchise or any of the cast members then this movie probably wont tickle your fancy but if youre turned off by anything in the film why are you watching if you love cinema this is a movie to be experienced not simply seen
Mar 4 2024,positive,wow great movie  wood see it again   that good
Mar 4 2024,positive,simply one of the best movies ive seen in years go see it
Mar 4 2024,positive,a complex actionpacked beautifully imagined science fiction epic there were no popcorn tub gimmicks or imax for me  just a decent seat near the center of a smalltown onescreen movie theater it still knocked my socks off feels like a onceinageneration moviegoing experience on the order of peter jacksons lord of the rings and the original star wars trilogy i suspect this will start a lifelong love of dune for many young viewers and should delight most readers of the frank herbert books where the movies story and characters deviate from the literature it tends to elevate or streamline concepts in a surprising and satisfying way i can see how this film may leave some viewers confused or how it might disappoint those who want a more faithful telling based on the novel  an impossible wish but an understandable one  but anyone with a pulse should find it well worth their time to at least watch paul atreides attempt to ride the sandworm
Mar 4 2024,positive,satisfying end to the movie and was pretty true to the book some fans will gripe about the dialogue or the changes to the chani arc but overall it felt good held to the pace and spirit of the books visually it was stunning visionary entertainment i think frank herbert would have been pleased pretty well acted throughout stilgar was less a fanatic in the books but i was ok with that chani and paul were well acted their love wasnt romantic but felt lived in like an older still loving couple whod been around each other for along time i personally wasnt a fan of the walken casting for the emperor he was ok i would have preferred sean bean or someone of that type bean can bring a nobility and pride while being flawed im thinking of his performance in lotr which could have had some of that same feel anyway still a marvel to look at and ill probably see it again
Mar 4 2024,positive,visual effects are insane this movie did not disappoint left the theater feeling empty hearted because i still wanted more it has been a while since ive watched a quality film great job to the whole cast and crew they all did an amazing job i cant wait to see the final chapter of the film
Mar 4 2024,positive,its impossible to summarize dune part 2 because none of the typical analysis applies  what it does better than any modern science fiction film is take you there dune part one showed you another world but part two throws you into that world and it does it forcefully there will be many different view points on what people felt and saw on that journey but what wont be in dispute is that they were on a journey     thematically these movies share far more with the godfather 12 than say star wars  it is about weilding power and the price you pay for doing so  those details are not always pleasant the good guys do not alway win and the ones that do often lose much of what they care about in the bargain
Mar 4 2024,positive,intense and incredible piece of film making it feels slow but moves along steadily at the same time which is quite a trick the book is pretty ponderous at times it works on more than one level as well its a story about fanaticism the price of leadership and blind belief and stays true to herberts vision while making some great tweaks  the role of chain is really powerful great acting and austin butler is terrifying
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part ii is a great sequel to the first however for anyone who has not yet seen part i it may be confusing the cinematography and storyline are arguably the most impressive features of dune part ii the acting in certain moments is not the best but that is made up by the stunning visual effects and cinematography
Mar 4 2024,positive,great action and effects very complicated story told in a complicated way some dialog was hard to understand even in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,tactile and epic  every piece of machinery and grain of sand is felt through the screen  the battle sequences in dune part two reach toward the level of quality in setup scale and character payoff seen in the lord of the rings trilogy    the sound design is so detailed  you can hear the hydraulic hiss of the thumpers reloading in closeup shots but when a father angle is shown you can only hear the bass of their rhythmic thud on the sand  hans zimmer provides and even better soundtrack this time than in part one
Mar 4 2024,positive,visually spectacular dialog was fantastic stunningly beautiful adaptation from book to screen proves once again disney ruined starwars the only struggle in the movie is christopher walkin as emperor great job i will see it in theater again
Mar 4 2024,positive,what a perfect movie dine is fire
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie belongs in the sequel hall of fame
Mar 4 2024,positive,all good so far cant wait for the next part
Mar 4 2024,positive,greatest theatrical experience ive ever had the honor of living
Mar 4 2024,positive,exceeded all expectations cant remember a scifi  fantasy this good in past 5 years at least
Mar 4 2024,positive,so weird it makes you want to live in desert so you can live in the world of dune  a movie once you watch you feel so detach to reality
Mar 4 2024,positive,great story visuals and epic feel what going to the movies is all about
Mar 4 2024,positive,great plot action sequences and soundtrack
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was an amazing adaptation of dune full of action and drama  great storytelling
Mar 4 2024,positive,very good movie i didnt really understand the blue water stuff but im probably stupid
Mar 4 2024,positive,this was one of the best scifi films ive seen in a while so well done  and they succeded in bringing dune to life  one of my favorite alltime stories
Mar 4 2024,positive,this will go down as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time it has a great spectacle and a great story a massive improvement over the first and this is a must see
Mar 4 2024,positive,a modern masterpiece through and through
Mar 4 2024,positive,i rarely give 5 stars this movie is 5 stars 
Mar 4 2024,positive,it is pure cinematography in the cinema it generated emotions in me it gave me goosebumps and that intensity with that soundtrack it is simply cinema
Mar 4 2024,positive,the best scifi movie i have ever seen  a fantastic scifi film with amazing cgi and a great plot
Mar 4 2024,positive,exceptional film this is what so modern sci fi should shoot for given the series and heavy themes they did a great job with the comedic relief score is incredible visuals amazing and stellar writing 1010
Mar 4 2024,positive,what a wonderful experience it was beautiful visually the score the acting the way the story unfolds      i loved the first film i wasnt surprised realizing the second was going to surpass dune     please see it in the theater
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie has spoiled in watching future movies it is the most visually and auditorily stunning movie i have ever seen you must see this in a good theater to fully enjoy the work that the production crew has put together worth every penny
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was amazing i caught myself just in awe multiple times throughout the visuals the story line the acting just everything it was perfection
Mar 4 2024,positive,masterpiece seen 3 times now
Mar 4 2024,positive,first off dune part two does justice to frank herberts visions when he authored the book the complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so    focusing less on comparisons around the book dune part two feels unique to the first movie regarding their similarities of how part two upscales everything that part one did right and removed every criticism i had with it the pacing of dune part two is crafted excellently    each arc in the story is written and filmed like a greek epic with timothée chalamet being your heracles simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss    i especially was a fan of austin butlers performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to feyds psychotic tendencies    chalamet stepping up as a leader in his heros journey is a transcendent experience as he quickly transforms from bland intelligent and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind overall paul atreidus becomes an actually interesting character    this movie had some unintentional comedic moments the fremens reaction to anything that paul did made my nearentire theater laugh three times    already this review is getting very long but props to hans zimmer for creating yet another majestic score for a movie    thats not all i have to say but you get the picture
Mar 4 2024,positive,epic this is what action scifi movies should be the entire movie was an experience i havnt felt in a theater for a very long time
Mar 4 2024,positive,great cinematography and acting  the storyline was easy to follow 
Mar 4 2024,positive,this was definitely a blockbuster movie and a must see for all who were fans of the first movie  loved the acting and cinematography  i didnt give it 4 stars due to a couple slow parts 
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was so awesome highly recommend it
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie captures all of the pages of the source material from the book perfectly step by step i have never been so impressed with a movie series that has stayed true to the book and left out all of the hollywood exaggeration and sway from the story magnificent
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was very well directedi really thought that the visual effectsset design costumessound effectsmusic score by hans zimmerstory casting were all out standingacting timothee chalamee  zendaya and the other supporting cast were all be very convincingat the least  timothee chalamet and zendaya both deserve nominations for an oscari can only hope that academy of motion pictures will give this movie the recognition it deservestwo thumbs up from me
Mar 4 2024,positive,wow exceeded expectations  top 5 ever
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part two is spellbinding science fiction with plenty of brains and spectacle this movie continues where the previous film left off and is just full of visual flair and many jawdropping moments i do feel i preferred this movie as its more payoff and less expositionfocused i do feel i liked the film because there are multiple moments that are just spectacular on an imax screen and the way the story and characters come together progressing the story as well as setting up for more is done really well i think the performances of this movie are all good but it is really the direction and visual style of director denis villeneuve that makes it stand out he has solidified himself as one of the great modern directors and someone who just knows how to make good scifi overall it is a great continuation of this universe that i enjoyed seeing in the theater and think gets better the more i think about it    update not even a week later i went to rewatch this thing in imax this movie is outstanding and the story really clicked more for me upon the second viewing i think this is one of the finest scifi movies of recent memory and denis has really crafted something special here and i cant wait to even watch it again in the near future
Mar 4 2024,positive,breathtaking
Mar 4 2024,negative,ridiculous confusing long and pointless it didnt end cleany and there is obviously a part 3 coming but i wont be going but nice costumes lol the first dune part 1 was a tad better but was also in need of some serious editing long does not equal good story matters and this just has a terrible story that i never cared for i never cared for any of the characters there were so many stabbings and shootings as to make one sick  have fun    these films will not stand the test of time
Mar 4 2024,positive,exceeded my expectations i really enjoyed the movie 99 out of 10
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely mesmerizing fantastic
Mar 4 2024,positive,in ideal sequel fashion dune part two takes each element that made the first film so appealing and amps it up to nth degree the action the visuals the performances the stakes  everythings much more impactful and impressive this time around gotta say though if they somehow find a way to bottle whatever the first half of this movie was running on hollywood will have tapped into the kind of god mode none of us couldve imagined possible the color palette the camaraderie the character development even the budding relationship between paul and chani honestly something i never thought would end up being one of my favorite parts was just so fulfilling to see none of this is to say that the second half is lesser or bad its just different bigger and rife with more implications for the future of this franchise something about seeing the humble beginnings of this journey on arrakis that i really vibed with also you gotta love the slow burn buildup around austin butlers feyd rautha both the actor and character are just having such a blast and im here for every minute of it really really enjoyed this if the past decade of cinema has taught us anything its to throw as much money as possible at denis villeneuve moviegoers eyes and ears im looking at you hans will be better for it
Mar 4 2024,positive,perfect ending for this part of the story i only hope they continue telling more
Mar 4 2024,positive,best imax theatrical movie this year and last year hands down

Mar 4 2024,positive,so accurate to the books the arena scene shot in infrared was stunning great acting great production overall the best film ive seen in the last year
Mar 4 2024,positive,beautiful yet turgid dune the movie planet where every inhabitant speaks in the same gloomy monotone as every other inhabitant its like a single bland personality inhabiting a hundred different  characters bodies all of them slogging through utterly pedestrian dialogue for 25 hours its relentlessly monotone and tedious by hey it looks good no doubt director denis villeneuve has boasted in an interview that he really hates dialogue and jeezus is that ever obvious in this gloomy slog every character speaks every line as if its an epic profundity from the lips of a byzantine priest
Mar 4 2024,positive,the end was just phenomenal i wasnt thrilled about the last 45 minutes until i was there and now i know why it was that long
Mar 4 2024,positive,simply amazing  loved it even more the 2nd time i saw it
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved the visuals  soundtrack a lot happens in the story action scenes are excellent 
Mar 4 2024,positive,fantastic there were a couple liberties taken from the source i think by necessity but they pulled off the story beautifully not to mention the tone of both halves was perfect chefs kiss  muah i hope a way can be found to continue the story with the same love dedication and hard work that was put in to these 2 movies definite must see

Mar 4 2024,positive,the imax soundtrack was set way way too loud but the movie was a faithful adaptation
Mar 4 2024,positive,i really enjoyed dune part 2 although it was a very long movie and i definitely felt it while watching the film i understood that it had alot of story building to do im not mad at it i would rather for book to movie adaptations to capture most things that has occurred if you dont really care to capture the cinematic art piece in theaters its ok to enjoy at home on your couch and take breaks in between if you cant sit through the whole movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing visually stunning and amazingly written
Mar 4 2024,positive,its a good movie the scale look and sound of the movie is epic the story mostly follows the book no major complaints cause if youve read the book you know the challenges my biggest meh is for the limited amount of sophisticated dialogue i think denis felt he had to keep both movies simple for larger ticket  ive seen it twice and ill see at least once more in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,very short 2hr 46 min
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant portrayal of the book authentic actingstrong character development over time  desert scenes were amazing eg desert views wormriding appreciated the realistic presence of people of color in the desert regions soundtrack music was hauntingly beautiful and fit the setting stunning military and fighter scenes  captured well the plans within plans for powerholding and manipulation to gain power javier bardem was wonderful i am waiting for dune part 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,this was the first movie ive seen fill a theater at an early showing on a sunday for good reason this work lived up to the hype a modern day star wars must see closest thing i will experience to what it must have been like back then

Mar 4 2024,positive,its the best movie of the actual cinema a true cult movie in the make
Mar 4 2024,positive,a true 55 movie well worth watching i think its the best scifi franchise since the original star wars    so great watching in theaters is a must truly impressive
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie is a gripping and wellacted film that skillfully builds suspense it showcases the enduring influence of dune on science fiction particularly on works like star wars the film leaves me hopeful for a wider recognition of its impact on the genre
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is a great example of cgi enhancing a story instead of carrying a story ive never never read any of the new novels but ive heard so many stories about it i was also told that there was no way they could turn this into a motion picture however after watching both part one part two this is probably the greatest cinematic experience since lord of the rings
Mar 4 2024,positive,its a shame hollywood cant make more movies half as good as this one in todays day and age
Mar 4 2024,negative,lost storyline things happen out of nowhere extremely loud and predictable they try to lift this kind of movie by adding all those obnoxious sound effects that end up making you stand up from your seat and leave the place altogether i wish they would give money back for what we paid for such a boring movie
Mar 4 2024,positive,i thought it was an epic production and followed the book very closely which i really enjoyed
Mar 4 2024,positive,amazing cinematography acting and story id give it a 96

Mar 4 2024,positive,epic hard science fiction faithful to its source material
Mar 4 2024,positive,engaged throughout the whole movie loved the whole show
Mar 4 2024,positive,ive watched this 3 times now this is a monumental piece of work the kind that only seems to show up once every few decades i never thought id see another cinematic miracle after peter jacksons the lord of the rings denis villeneuve is one of the goats of cinema with his audacity in adapting frank herberts dense scifi epic into this spectacular cinematic masterpiece he has honoured frank herberts work so well transposing the spirit and key themes of the book to tell this compelling story     dune part two is made at the highest level of craft from cinematography production design visual effects and sound everything feels so tactile and real  hans zimmers score is just sublime here especially with the love theme  the casting is just impeccable and i wish i could spend more hours with these characters watching this on imax is the only way to fully experience this epic     now i need dune messiah to finish pauls arc i need it more for chani and princess irulan     final verdict greatmother sandworm out of 5 stars
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was a complete out of this world experience it is one of those movie events for the generations like interstellar avatar star wars first trilogy
Mar 4 2024,negative,very slow and boring too long id rather watch bad batch or kc undercover

Mar 4 2024,positive,alamo fcked up the last reel change over and we lost such a powerful line from jbardem  wtf  yes the film is epic
Mar 4 2024,positive,one word to describe it phenomenal
Mar 4 2024,negative,do you like not knowing what is going on and having your eardrums blown out this is the movie for you absolutely no flow from one scene to the next and no explanation on how they get off the worms once they are done riding themperhaps the biggest disappointment
Mar 4 2024,negative,i went to see it tonight 332024 the special effects were great but they changed the story waaaaay too much it was somewhat unrecognizable and i can see they did this just for the purpose of turning dune into an ongoing series part three will be uncharted territory
Mar 4 2024,negative,a lot of sound and fury signifyingnot much    i read the book 20 years ago and it was fun  this movie is not fun and takes itself way too seriously      visuals were good but i couldnt figure out why the bald guys were doing bad stuff to the arab guys  i spose i could look it up butyawn

Mar 4 2024,positive,so amazing and the visuals and music was amazing too
Mar 4 2024,negative,pacing slow  nothing original  darklylit  hard to stay awake yes i read the book saw previous fil treatments of story  wait until it streams
Mar 4 2024,positive,with exceptional showings from alist actors like timothee chalamet austin butler and rebecca ferguson and hollywood heavyweights such as villeneuve and zimmer dune part 2 is a movie set up for success it manages to radiate an aura of mystique that seems to finally capture the evasive spirit of the original novel on the silver screen villeneuves unmistakable craft has established himself as one of the premier auteurs of the scifi genre setting a new standard for films of the future  in spite of this however despite the initially slow pacing the movie still manages to create a romance that seems excessively bland and generic in nature
Mar 4 2024,positive,this is an epic masterpiece comparable to lawrence of arabia
Mar 4 2024,positive,there werent any scenes that werent perfect  i assume there will be a part three and now i need to go back and watch part one  somehow i missed that

Mar 4 2024,positive,spot on even if long but then the story is long sooooooo well done in every way casting for 2 leads was perfect for both parts sf reader here and never could stand herberts writing but the story make great movies    special xfx and sound should no must be experienced in a theater like imax or regal rpx  better in rpx as it has seat thumpers that make you a part of all the actions    part 1 was 5 stars part 2is 4 12 as some of the visual and the story itself are not as dramatic
Mar 4 2024,positive,cinematography and sound were untouchable
Mar 4 2024,negative,slow and boring i   want my money back
Mar 4 2024,positive,love the story love the cinematography casting also amazing
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was an amazing performance and i liked the balance of comedy that was added throughout because it gets dark
Mar 4 2024,positive,dune part two is absolutely brilliant its better than part one in pretty much every way possible dune part one was just a setup while dune part two truly is the real deal dune part two is about paul trying to gain the trust of the fremen at the beginning of the movie there were many that believed paul was the messiah but there were also many that didnt believe it anyway the final act of the movie is by far the best part it includes a lot of action and breathtaking visuals the acting was also incredible the acting of the first movie was already pretty great but the acting in this one is even better i also loved pauls character development in this one seeing him go from being just the dukes son to becoming an all knowing hero who can see the future was incredible to watch overall dune part two truly is amazing and its definitely the best movie of 2024 so far
Mar 4 2024,positive,i didnt quite fully understand the meaning behind why everyone kept calling dune part two dpt epic i understand now    having read all the books thoroughly enjoyed dune part one dpo and then to watch a backtoback early release double feature of dpo and dpt i can say im beyond impressed impressed truly doesnt even begin to embody and sense of the granduity of dpt    dpt seamlessly picks up from where dpo left off creating an even more immersive experience nonetheless beyond my imaginable capabilities somehow dpt increases the meticulous level of attention and detail to the films mise en scene    the costumes once again go above and beyond im not sure how to even put it into words they looked real they fit the scenes they looked like they belong    the musical score i didnt think it could get better than dpo  i stand a fool the musical score for dpt leaves you with goosebumps for almost the entirety of the runtime if it doesnt achieve an award i will truly battle the great houses myself    the visual effects lost for words truly dont could encompass how stunning they are here youll have to lead on faith for this one    all the actors and actresses complete this film not like its their job but something they truly want to work on and truly do beyond their capabilities for and this shows    the hype is real the spice must flow the third dune must come    if you liked dpo you will lose it for dpt enough said
Mar 4 2024,positive,excellent cannot wait to see how they conclude it with dune messiah
Mar 4 2024,positive,wow a must see movie great story and could only be shown with current modern cg
Mar 4 2024,positive,its a good experience to see in a big screen
Mar 4 2024,positive,confused on the ending
Mar 4 2024,positive,omgoodness the twist that the movie took and the fighting scenes did not disappoint im ready for dune 3
Mar 4 2024,positive,after a second cinematic viewing i gotta say this movie absolutely swept me off my feet dune part two embodies the very essence of cinema gracefully navigating the spectrum from highs to lows discreet and thunderous moments and seamlessly weaving together a tapestry of buildup and action story and emotion    every accolade in the technical realm rightfully belongs to this cinematic gem from the meticulous craftsmanship in costumes and makeup to the masterful cinematography true to life visual effects and intricate production designeach element contributes to this films golden excellence and lets not forget the breathtaking score by hans zimmer undoubtedly propelling him toward yet another welldeserved oscar    denis villeneuve surpassing his own high standards has skillfully brought together a remarkable ensemble presenting a set of films that truly does justice to frank herberts universe special commendation must be extended to timothée chalamet rebecca ferguson and javier bardem for their truly aweinspiring performances on the screen powerful vulnerable and lighthearted moments brilliantly brought to life    for anyone considering a cinematic experience especially in the grandeur of imax dune part two stands out as a mustsee movie it is a guarantee that you will not be disappointed

Mar 4 2024,positive,as the first dune part the second was as amazing and breathtaking seen in imax
Mar 4 2024,positive,while im not as invested in this particular universe as i am in others and while it was slightly pretentious in tone this movie grabbed my attention with its awesome actionfight sequences its interesting twist and the powerful way they ended it denis villeneuve is a very skillful director with a detailed eye for filmmaking and i cannot help but like every movie of his that i see the villains especially the new younger one were intimidating and the internal disagreements and conflict that the freman had among themselves made the film less simplistic and more like it would likely be in real life among any group looking forwaiting for a prophet quality action visuals story and characterscharacter development makes for a quality film
Mar 4 2024,positive,great movie with suprior cinematography
Mar 4 2024,positive,great visuals bounced around too much and was too long

Mar 4 2024,positive,dune for dummies  visually excellent  solid cast  made no sense  dialog written for cretins  side chick angry pale drax mad and frightened   fun and completely forgettable
Mar 4 2024,positive,deviates a lot from the book in ways that work great for adaptation but it also seems like fight scenes were also cut short to keep the story moving the other main downside is the score isnt as front and center probably to highlight the changes after the first film from how long this took to come out i feel like a directors cut might be even better
Mar 4 2024,positive,definitely one of the best films ive ever seen in my life the experience was fantastic i spent more than 10 minutes with my mouth open trying to understand the film and its grandeur absolutely cinema
Mar 4 2024,positive,happy with the movie it was really well made and had some exciting spots even though there were also some slow spots

Mar 4 2024,positive,the epic scifi film we were all craving denis villenueve doubles down on everything that made the first film good making this film incredible the action sequences and visuals were astounding to experience on screen hans zimmers score is its own character and really carries the emotion of the film zendaya butler and bardem brought their agame and were great but chalamet really stepped it up from the last film and brought this intensity to his character this film was everything a scifi film should be intense action sequences an epic score emotional and characters we care about  dune part 2 isnt the best film ever made but it is definitely a science fiction masterpiece
Mar 4 2024,positive,kept the story close to the book epic cinematography that kept my interest through the slow parts wish it was shorter but accuracy beats budget

Mar 4 2024,positive,it is hard to make a pile of sand some awesome worms and a bunch of rag wrapped people be interesting for nearly three hours  i like the story of dune but the screen adaptation is no where near the movie of the century perhaps not even the last ten years  as usual the critics are living on some movie planet far far away  get real  worth the see one time kids will be bored to tears  save em people in the movie need em

Mar 4 2024,positive,i wish this would have been a miniseries it felt like they packed a lot into a couple hours but it was still good more interesting than the first one visually impressive intriguing storyline great buildup for the next one i will say though i dont really care for timothy chamotte hes too boyish to buy as a leader and a soldier
Mar 4 2024,positive,special effects and story great acting desert girl who plays love interest is not good actress they need to replace her
Mar 4 2024,positive,very exciting and intense the whole way through i hope part 3 comes sooner
Mar 4 2024,positive,i actively avoided all marketing for this film so i could watch and react honestly and open mindedly no movie speech has given me more chills up my spine than that of mauddib usul never read the books but man i was blown away magnificent artistry throughout and i felt like i wasnt bored at any single point i didnt know it was 3 hours but i swear it felt like 2 i need more
Mar 4 2024,positive,probably the best movie all year timothee redeems himself after embarrassing flop as willy wonka good story and greater adaptation of the book

Mar 4 2024,negative,dune 2 one of those unnecessary takethemselveswaytoserious religiously vicious movies and way to loud waste of 30 unless you absolutely love religious wars come to think of it are there any other kinds of wars besides religious wars technically very well done but for me just a big loud variation on the theme i feel bad for frank
Mar 4 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece such a breath of fresh air gave me faith in the cinema again
Mar 4 2024,positive,thought it was great i read most the books when i was younger followed the book as well as possible there is still more story to tell  looking forward to part 3

Mar 4 2024,positive,great epic talegreat cinematography sound storyline acting held well to book
Mar 4 2024,neutral,dont be duped by this movie  if like me you were led to believe that this is part 2 of a 2 part movie then youve been duped this is part 2 of a 3 part movie trilogy this movie has so many cliffhangers at the end there is no way there isnt going to be a 3rd part  i left the theater feeling betrayed i am sick to death of hollywood lying to me about stuff like this     anyone reading this be warned that 1 you need to go into this movie with the first movie fresh in your mind and 2 be warned that the movie does not resolve properly you wont leave this movie feeling satisfied   this movie doesnt review the first movie it just picks up after the first movie with no refresher course the first movie was 2 and a half years ago are we really supposed to remember every little detail from a movie 2 12 years ago no this was probably part of the plan all along wait so darn long for the second movie you almost have to watch the first one again oh and of course that means spending more money its hard to remember every little thing from the first movie but you need to know every little thing from the first movie to understand the second movie otherwise the second movie is a mostly confusing bunch of gibberish for the most part
Mar 4 2024,positive,a bit of a meandering slow plot line like first  at least there was a little action  resolution towards end  but all leading to another movie clearly
Mar 4 2024,positive,great movie all around game of thrones meets star wars
Mar 4 2024,positive,great movie kept my full attention the entire time

Mar 3 2024,negative,wait for streaming and fast forward through the excessive special effects scenes
Mar 3 2024,positive,i rarely give a movie a perfect score dune part 2 wasnt totally perfect however the cinematography scale special effects score and choreography were all some of the best ive ever seen in any movie mixed with fantastic world building and an absolutely captivating performance by timothee chalamet especially during the second half of the movie makes this one of the greatest films ive ever had the pleasure of watching its one of my top 5 movies ever
Mar 3 2024,positive,outstanding best one of the series for now
Mar 3 2024,positive,best scifi movie of the century
Mar 3 2024,positive,some gorgeous cinematographydigital landscape artistry but the characters were sadly clich and were too lacking in dimension to be impactful cutting a full hour out of the film would have at least made it a tighter rollicking piece alas the trend towards repetitive prolonged battle scenes dilutes any strong points the story may have had
Mar 3 2024,positive,very well done   a long movie that didnt feel long  i was riveted
Mar 3 2024,positive,exhilarating heartbreaking art
Mar 3 2024,negative,i was bored beyond belief far too long
Mar 3 2024,positive,done 2 is a cinematic masterpiece and is just as good if not better than the first one  the cinematography score and acting are all really good and deserving of praise   hoping for the next one to be made to finish out paul atriedes aka muaddib arc
Mar 3 2024,positive,isnt there any other actress other than florence pugh and sydney sweeney in hollywood i was expecting a resolution and end of this way too long movie but theres still more to come his sister is yet to be born and he turns into a worm  talk about stretching a book

Mar 3 2024,positive,i loved this movie so much that i created an rt account just to give it the highest rating
Mar 3 2024,positive,if you like the 1st dune movie then you will enjoy this one  the cast story and visuals are outstanding this is a must see on the biggest screen possible
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune 2 is an absolutely thrilling and biblical sci fi epic not only does it fulfil the promises made in part 1 but gives us hope to see more with dune messiah timothee charlamet like paul atreides has grown into his role and gives one of his best performances yet the whole cast are at the top of their game and hanz zimmers score rocks yet again the film isnt perfect but how denis villaneuve has managed to adapt such dense source material is just masterful
Mar 3 2024,positive,i had never read the story i didnt know the background it gave me a hard time on part 1 who what why i had question marks all the time but now i enjoy part 2 much better i know who paul is what the spice does and why paul wants revenge the better i understand it it means the more you need to watch part 1 before it theres definitely a knowledge threshold     when i watched it i could think but couldnt think deeply i accept paul as the saver but i dont accept how he becomes the saver if stilgar believes in me i could be their saver too i accept freemen hates sardaukar but i dont accept its because of spice freemen cares about the water much more than the spice tbh i accept freemen fight sardaukar but i dont accept how the rudimentary side wins the war sand worms vs spaceship    overall its a filmed poem an opera a sang you can enjoy it on a gigantic screen with dolby sound but please dont read my review    emotional personal careless score 810
Mar 3 2024,positive,perfect no notes     the adjustments to the narrative were not only necessarily for adapting it to screen but gave fresh fire to the storys central tensions and overall message
Mar 3 2024,positive,definitely must have bladder control as you wont want to miss a single moment of this epic running 2 hrs 45 min   details important to flesh out the stories are generally not left behind so even those who have never read the books you really should though will understand the complexities
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic  brought my family and friends its so well done
Mar 3 2024,positive,a fantastic continuation of the story it delivers on all accounts and brings us deeper into the saga
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing special affects  storyline a little to drawn out  get set for dune iii  everything left hanging
Mar 3 2024,positive,great film  the director did great with setting up tension and moving along without feeling the need to hold audiences hand  as a result there can be subtlety and mystery that warrants a second or third watch
Mar 3 2024,positive,very long   needs less preaching   needs more worms   needs more dave bautista christopher walken terribly miscast   beautiful set design
Mar 3 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece    christopher walken meh        not 100 accurate to book
Mar 3 2024,positive,the dune fighting and travelling scenes were breathtaking the use of colours was magnificent and extraordinary viewing in an imax theatre was definitely an epical enjoyment the pictures telling the scifi story were convincing enough to fuse viewer into its universe
Mar 3 2024,positive,10 out of 10 must see this movie sticks with you for a long time seen twice already i need more
Mar 3 2024,positive,i have not seen an epic so well crafted acted and executed since the lord of the rings trilogy the visuals sounds storytelling all take you into the world of dune
Mar 3 2024,positive,a rhapsodic masterpiece and triumph of human creativity the culmination of decades of technological and artistic evolution beginning with frank herberts completion and publication of the novel in 1965 and brought to life in a grand crescendo in 2024 by the peerless denis villenuvue this is a work infused with and possessed by such powerful spirit that watching it brings about a genuine spiritual experience the story is treated like a holy text and the cinema a holy temple one of the great works produced by mankind
Mar 3 2024,positive,i likes the first one better this didnt follow the story line  the rich subtlety of dune got lost in this
Mar 3 2024,positive,while the movie itself and the visuals make for a fantastic cinema experience and tells a wonderful story lovers of the book may find themselves leaving a bit deflated due to the treatment of some characters and the complete omission of others who featured in the first instalment and seemingly vanished without trace
Mar 3 2024,positive,well crafted but anticlimactic big and loud but in no way exhilarating maybe next time
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent part 2 of dune i really enjoyed this movie possibly even more than part 2 i cannot wait for the next one i havent read the books  so everything is unexpected for me timothee  zendaya are fantastic well done
Mar 3 2024,positive,simply incredible this has easily the potential to rightfully enter the history of great cinematic trilogies epic dramatic unpredictable but always grounded in a wellbuilt world all the actors give great performances and all the characters are believable and interesting an absolute must which improves on the first and manages to tackle many themes effectively
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is why you go to the cinema its an amazing picture beautiful shots with an extraordinary score it grips you and never lets go even after it ends you want more congratulations denis and company on a beautiful and gripping picture a must see
Mar 3 2024,positive,monumental and the best sci fi movie ive ever watched
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 is different from the romance to the action to the oddly satisfying deaths it has what you need i do recommend watching part 1 so you can fully understand this master piece 1010
Mar 3 2024,positive,wow just wow can a movie be any better i dont think so its a mustseeexperience highly recommended in imax theatre
Mar 3 2024,positive,really fun movie and the pacing was great im glad they extended the first book in two movies
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually lovely to look at  a lot of characters and action
Mar 3 2024,positive,cinematically stunning
Mar 3 2024,positive,second time seeing this movie only reaffirms my impressions i got before a masterpiece in scifi cinema one for the ages i hope we get a chance to see the director denis villenueve do dune messiah what a picture man
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent movie timothée chalamet continues his dominance and his growing career i was never much of a dune fan but after the first one a few years ago and now the second one i definitely am a new fan
Mar 3 2024,positive,it captures the book beautifully
Mar 3 2024,positive,this film was great cant wait for pt3
Mar 3 2024,positive,great and amazing movie highly recommend
Mar 3 2024,positive,phenomenal the chemistry between chani and paul is great just everything about this was great cant wait to see whats in the works for part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,the cinematography was absolutely spectacular the fighting was choreographed to perfection and the backgrounds were stunning overall a perfect movie if it doesnt win an oscar the oscars are rigged
Mar 3 2024,positive,truly amazing cinematic achievement better than the already great part 1 in all aspects great acting breathtaking cinematography excellent soundtrack i actually ended up wanting at least 30 more minutes this will surely go as one of the best scifi sequels ever really hoping part 3 is greenlit soon
Mar 3 2024,positive,beautiful visually  great cinematagraphy on the desert scenes
Mar 3 2024,positive,very good fast paced film great action but the characters need more depth
Mar 3 2024,positive,if dune part one was the fellowship of the ring of scifi then dune part two absolutely is the two towers of sci fi it is the best movie ive seen in about 5 years it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolute epic on all grounds pays homage to the source material with a stacked cast and an amazing adventure 
Mar 3 2024,positive,i think the movie was very entertaining with great visual effects
Mar 3 2024,positive,im a dune fan so my opinion may be bias   i love the characters the story line the action all of the above thank you
Mar 3 2024,positive,a scifi sequel that builds on everything even the heavy philosophical discussions that will evoke complicated feelings for some villeneuves dune adaptation continues to be visually epic characteristically layered and boldly unique
Mar 3 2024,positive,pacing was substantially slow in the first half too fast in the second omissions of world building like not describing the nuclear reaction of shields and lasguns making blade fighting important missing sardaukar infiltrators and certain missing characters like count fenring  and canon changes were distracting does show the terrible unstoppable momentum of the fremen jihad once it gets moving timothy chalamet was a brilliant paul in all respects  and the austin butler feyd ruatha was genuinely intense without being over the top beautifully filmed
Mar 3 2024,positive,definitely awesome the soundtrack is amazing i wish a couple fight scenes would have lasted a little longer but overall this was solid part ii was worth the wait after seeing the first
Mar 3 2024,positive,one odd thing i dont think that part 1 or 2 explained why spice was so important
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie to follow up with the first cgi was incredible   enjoyed the character development just a bit lengthy highly recommend
Mar 3 2024,positive,3 hours of movie and you still want more  congratulations tò villeneuve and all the cast
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic sequel to an already fantastic first movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,very cinematic very beautifully shot story pacing turned me off  not made for a causal movie viewing
Mar 3 2024,positive,like it all  no dislikes hurry and make number 3 its on mommas bucket list 
Mar 3 2024,positive,scifi masterpiece cant wait to see where the story goes from here
Mar 3 2024,positive,from start to finish  loved it  kept you on the edge of your seat
Mar 3 2024,positive,insanely fantastic film the acting chamalet was astounding the story the visuals the music spectacular
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing long but worth it acting cinematography storyline everything a
Mar 3 2024,positive,i am biased for knowing the novel and elevated the movie by almost a half star because it was a pretty strong adaptation of the original work more cinematic more movie like yet faithful to the original spirit other than that no contest on the grand scenes but pitiful character development or plot advancement very weak shallow antagonists it definitely will not stay at 90 imdb 
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually stunning with an incredible score and a handful of great performances denis villeneuve continues to make a case for himself as one of the best directors in the business
Mar 3 2024,positive,pretty damned impressive everything just seemed soo right writing directing cinematography action sequences casting character development script all in all a visual and sensory crescendo to be sure 5 stars easily earned i cant wait for the last installment
Mar 3 2024,positive,the good this visuals are awesome the action is awesome the acting is awesome   the bad its an overused plot rich kid loses everything moves in with the poor falls in love with a poor girl uses the poor people to rise up and take his rich life back   yes i recommend this film
Mar 3 2024,positive,exceptional movie i havent felt such emotion for a long time
Mar 3 2024,positive,cinematography and choice of story lines were reinforcing in exposition of the plot  i prefer it to the lynch version  but everyone has their own opinion and seeing all three is worthwhile  i enjoyed it
Mar 3 2024,positive,great film havent read the book i feel somehow sorry for chani the ending for me was little bit disappointing but probably it is similiar in dune novel
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune is a masterclass in storytelling worldbuilding and cinematography most characters are fully realized with motivations that push the story forward in interesting ways unlike a lot of films characters arent used to service the demands of the script therefore most people feel layered and threedimensional unfortunately i feel as though the antagonists could have been fleshed out more but that doesnt take away from the powerful moments that involve them if youre looking for a film with emotion striking visuals and largescale warfare then dune is the film for you
Mar 3 2024,positive,at this moment until part 3 arrive its the best film in this decade
Mar 3 2024,positive,long live the blockbusters this movie is everything and more that i expected from denis villeneuves adaptation of dune after the stellar part one epic visuals character portrayals and sound it was worth the over two year wait its a must see on the biggest screen
Mar 3 2024,positive,i didnt want the movie to end so good
Mar 3 2024,positive,what a great movie   i would definitely give this a 910  the action is top notch the acting is on point and the parts they adapted from the book makes this version feel like you are a apart of the environment  over all this movie hits the major points of the story and makes you feel as if you are there  if they could have had a small bit of innermonologue to tell you what was happening at the end it would have made that part a little more impactful   over all great movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies ive ever seen go out and watch it now
Mar 3 2024,positive,kept you in your seat
Mar 3 2024,positive,an absolute master piece the movie got my full attention through out the entire 2hours 45min the visual and audio enjoyment is on a total new level
Mar 3 2024,positive,my heart was just racing gotta be in my top list of all time so far hanz zimmer score was freaking incredible
Mar 3 2024,negative,if you read the book youre probably going to be disappointed in this movie  out of sequence events different story lines changes to characters and more  all that aside this movie seemed to meander around  not like the first movie at all  it was pretty but that was about it for me  hard to tell if there will be a dune 3 or if they will add things from the 1st book to children of dune
Mar 3 2024,positive,i was disappointed in the ending although it may have followed the book i wasnt expecting such a cliffhanger
Mar 3 2024,positive,banging close to perfect as it gets
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually and audibly spectacular performances effects story all well above the usual blockbuster fare well worth the running time which is paced brilliantly nonetheless  this one is an achievement of the highest order
Mar 3 2024,positive,sequel well potrayed nothing but equisit
Mar 3 2024,positive,very slow predictable time lime was confusing and the back and forth between dark and bright scenes made it hard to watch everyone around me was shifting in their seats due to being uncomfortable for that long and some were napping save your money and stream it from home and i watched in a dobly high end theater but it was a waste
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is a work of art this film is as close to perfect as you can get from emotion to amazing action and great character timotee does a amazing job dont know how to spell it amazing ending to set up dune part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing movie  very entertaining
Mar 3 2024,positive,liked it it was on the long side but great
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic a few deviations from source material i didnt like but overall and epic experience
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune 2 was incredible its early to say movie of the year but movie of the last 510 years from a scifi perspective it holds you and builds to an ending that is just incredible this may be my favorite movie of all time everything about it is just right
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved it
Mar 3 2024,positive,outstanding a reason to come to the theater
Mar 3 2024,positive,worth watching i enjoyed every second of it
Mar 3 2024,positive,i have watched dune part 1 100 times and to be seeing dune part 2 is so awesome i was actually on the edge of my seat and almost yelled out a multiple times pauls speech in the south gave me goosebumps im not exaggerating this is hands down the best trilogy ever made i will watch this again and again and again theres not a movie i havent seen and dune is better than them all cant wait for dune part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,watched it at imax it was brilliant sometimes i even had goosebumps
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best movies of all times
Mar 3 2024,positive,everything from the score editing and cinematography is top notch denis is able to catapult off the worldbuilding first movie to dive deeper into the prophecy paul has to deal with pauls struggle to fight for the fremen without fulfilling his visions is constant throughout the movie and the acting couldnt be better
Mar 3 2024,positive,a masterpiece of a film everything about this movie is amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,great story  kept me engaged the entire time  looking forward to part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,superb cinematic qualities perfect music score and magnificent costumes and acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,everything i expected and more i brought my 10yr old son that usually has a horrible attention span he watched it as closely as i did some scenes were so internally intense i couldnt remain still in my seat only question that everyone should be thinking about now how long do we have to wait for dune 3 messiah  please deliver us the messiah denis villeneuve
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent movie performances were great  austin butlers performance shows he has fantastic range could not take my eyes off of florance pugh though
Mar 3 2024,positive,the whole showstory is awesome well made movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,staggering achievement one of the best movies you will ever see
Mar 3 2024,positive,having to wait 24 minutes for the movie to start sitting through all the previews
Mar 3 2024,positive,in my opinion this film transcends mere viewing it is an immersive experience i consider it not only one of the greatest science fiction films of all time but also one of the most exceptional cinematic achievements since the release of interstellar i have not encountered a film that has elicited such a profound emotional response within me
Mar 3 2024,negative,way too dark and violent  celebrates gore and darkness
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent cinematography and music follows the books storyline closely and really captures the feeling of it truly draws you in and transports you from the movie theater into arrakis entertainment at its finest
Mar 3 2024,positive,great conclusion to the first installment of dune  the film is long but goes very fast  we really enjoyed it
Mar 3 2024,positive,better than part 1 that is all
Mar 3 2024,positive,im not a critic by i can confidently say that dune part 2 by far beautifully concludes a masterpiece started 3 years ago and an amazing portrayal of what the author would have dreamed to see on the big screen the acting special effects and the creativity has is simply captivating cant wait for the third move
Mar 3 2024,positive,a great continuation of the series and keep all the great moments going

Mar 3 2024,positive,exceptional movie 1010it is not such a good adaptation 610 there are changes in the story that do not make sense and very important parts have been omittedi recommend reading the book to see how the original story unfolds much better
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 was brilliant it was so much better than i expected and i expected a lot
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was everything we had hoped for a movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,stunning film one of the best storytelling films since lotr
Mar 3 2024,positive,overall i liked it but it was still a slow burn for most of the movie feyds character was refreshing
Mar 3 2024,neutral,oh its so boring it could be at least 80min so it would worth it but more than 2 hours unnecessary
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely stunning
Mar 3 2024,positive,what a masterpiece dune part 2 shines as bright as the sun as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time joining the ranks of star wars and many others that have changed the history of cinema for generations
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie was really good i just didnt like how it ended must going to be a part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,denis villeneuve once again proved that hes incapable of making something less than epic
Mar 3 2024,positive,like the fact that it ended just like dune1 most likely going to be a third
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the most spectacular movies i have ever seen absolutely breathtaking 
Mar 3 2024,positive,action pack revenge history of paul gorgeous movie definitely an imax must see
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part two is such a great movie this is one of the best movie experience ever true cinema  great acting directing story cinematography everything about it is great
Mar 3 2024,positive,i just saw part two last night  i thought part one was pretty good but part two was absolutely excellent they did an incredible job of fixing the disaster that was dune 1984  its not the easiest book to turn into a movie and yeah they changed a few things but i dont think a better job could have been done
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie was great for me it has good re play value i can go back and watch it again the action was very entertaining i will say its not for kids youve been warned lol
Mar 3 2024,positive,deepand i fully understand pt1 now
Mar 3 2024,positive,movie was near perfect great cinematography and sound
Mar 3 2024,positive,epic the only word to describe it
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved the action editing  cinematography the dialogue was sometimes cringy or borderline laughable when it came to the romance our protagonist and his mother become a lot less likable but im counting on that changing in the third film
Mar 3 2024,positive,awesome movie i would recommend watching the first one before viewing 55
Mar 3 2024,positive,as an addicted reader of the dune universe i can say it was an amazing movie  there were items left out that furthered the plot but i had hoped to see such as the guild  however like the rest of the audience in the imax i was stunned and speechless to the end  best scifi i have seen the movies in a long time
Mar 3 2024,negative,i dont care what others will say this movie was just a garbage that visually looks innovative it is somewhat better than the part one however the storyline was horrible complete failure in chemistry between characters they all felt really forced with zero emotional connections    and as a christian i dont think they should use such strong biblical words such as messiah water of life in a very foul and odd context using these words was a pure mockery to god and jesus christ    i wont even bother watching the sequel
Mar 3 2024,positive,setting up a great story if they continue with part 3
Mar 3 2024,negative,what a terrible movie scenes were cut short and had no buildup for the next scenes the best scene was the main character capturing a worm and thats all there is to say about that the so called epic battle at the end was horrific the enemy literally didnt put up a fight they got steamrolled by worms this movie is the equivalent of the gaming industry catering to the casual gamer
Mar 3 2024,positive,variations from the book but still make for an epic movie the first movie in a long long time to get excited about definetly a must see
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is no plastic popcorn movie like marvel and so many others this is a beautiful intelligent scifi epic the first hour was perfection the only nitpicking i have is the editing in the third act some scenes could have been shorter others longer but overall this was fantastic
Mar 3 2024,negative,i was disappointed by the script and how gratuitous the violence was it didnt contribute to the plot or the film in my opinion
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually stunning  great character development  worthy
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic movie first dune movie was great and this one is even better
Mar 3 2024,positive,just one word epic 
Mar 3 2024,positive,i liked the movie but it wasnt what i waited 2 12  years for  the story strayed from the book a bit
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best movies i seen in the last 10 years it looks absolutely phenomenal visuals are some of the best ive seen ever the sound is amazing acting is great it seriously is one of the best movies in a decade i really hope they finish out the series
Mar 3 2024,positive,somehow better than the first 2021 see it on imax if possible i really hope we dont have to wait 57 years for the third
Mar 3 2024,negative,it couldnt move any slower
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was a really great movie and adaptation of frank herberts dune though the movie strays a little from the book its really nice
Mar 3 2024,positive,liked part one and really enjoyed the muchanticipated part two
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal  story scope cinematography production casting and that soundtrack a refreshing reminder that hollywood can still produce amazing films in 2024 builds and improves on part one everyone ought to see this movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has created a true masterpiece with dune part two its up there as an alltimer with iconic scifi films like the matrix and blade runner we can only hope that a third installment is already in the works dont miss out on witnessing cinematic history once again in the realm of scifi spectacle this is one of those films that comes around every so often but leaves you utterly awestruck so head to the cinemas of imax for an unparalleled experience that will leave you wanting more
Mar 3 2024,positive,its good looking and fairly spectacular but ill echo a critic who said we saw most of the same spectacles in part 1 our two leads are very pretty but zendaya has more charisma than timothee in this one though thank goodness hes uncomfortable with being the white savior good score and hissable villains
Mar 3 2024,positive,compelling from beginning to end
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time epic storytelling cant wait for part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved that they took time with the story that builds to the action amazingly actors did really well especially timothy rebecca and austin great cinematography
Mar 3 2024,positive,i found it to be a little long
Mar 3 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in a long time great for a fan of dune or scifi l i was  on the edge of my seat the entire time
Mar 3 2024,positive,like i read recently this is why we watch movies why we go to the cinemas dune is a spectacular experience
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually striking and breathtaking magum opus from denis villeneuve technically brilliant with stellar performances from the ensemble with the tour de force being timothee chalmet and hans zimmers killer score
Mar 3 2024,positive,distilling a very dense novel into its esential themes and bilding up the role of chanis character
Mar 3 2024,positive,javier bardem being waste and some weak dialogue and are two of the few detractors from this outstanding epic
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely stunning an probably one of the biggest movies of our generation
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 is an absolute masterpiece my jaw has never dropped more in a movie the pacing is much quicker than part 1 and the cinematography is just plain epic the music score by hans zimmer is equally fitting epic and magnificent this movie demands to be watched in imax or an amc dolby cinema
Mar 3 2024,positive,the visuals and score was amazing but in the end tims acting and really everyones acting is the best they have ever done amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,refreshing to see a film with a vision and doesnt cater to the lowest common denominator an engrossing epic
Mar 3 2024,positive,movie of the year
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is cinema this is why we go to the theater 
Mar 3 2024,positive,well crafted movie  like that the movie wasnt gory or sexualized
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the most amazing experiences i have had at the movie theater amazing scenarios amazing soundtrack amazing acting the way the story unfolds and the tension could not be more impressed
Mar 3 2024,positive,in one word this movie is epic these dune movies are the best scifi movies since the original star wars this is definitely a theater experience i was sad i was not able to see the first one in theaters but this viewing more than made up for it  the sequel is better than the original and that is a high bar to pass for me  the story is fantastic  the visuals are stunning  the score will be bumped on spotify  the actors brought their agame too  cant wait to see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,full of character development action and excitement didnt realize almost 3 hours had passed terrific movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,better than the first one for sure i actually didnt mind the slight deviations from the book cause it kept me on the edge of my seat im really hoping theres a part three because it ended right where its about to get good
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie satisfactory and sufficient cinematography paced perfectly beautiful visuals
Mar 3 2024,positive,my only complaint about this movie is that it wasnt three times longer so we can spend more time in this world absolute perfection plan on seeing it several more times before it leaves theaters
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune 2 was a masterpiece can wait for the next one
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing visual and sound a most for movie lovers
Mar 3 2024,positive,delivered beautiful cinematic visuals with a great score  the story is great costumes special fx etcall top notch  im a big christopher walken fan but he was not well cast for his part as the emperor
Mar 3 2024,neutral,visually stunning and more faithful to the books than previous incarnations however beautiful actors posing and pouting zendaya still cant act she better get all the roles she can because once she turns 30 that is all for her still wooden acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has done it again  while he made a couple of minor changes probably to set up for dune the messiah this movie was truly a masterpiece  although the movie was over 212 hours it never dragged and kept us interested all the way through  cant wait for the next
Mar 3 2024,positive,ok very good movie great performance from tc austin butler is freaking awesome however some lack lustre scenes that really drag the movie out are difficult to watch its a very good movie but not a masterpiece in my opinion
Mar 3 2024,positive,awesome representation of the novel even if it doesnt get all the way to the end of the book leaves room for another installation
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely the best theatre experience ever this tops everything dont wait for streaming find the best theatre near your and watch the movie in that truly out of this world
Mar 3 2024,positive,when i left the theater and thought about what i had just seen one word came to mind  incredible
Mar 3 2024,positive,the sound system was absolutely amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,beautifully shot with a stunning score amazing performancesall in all a breathtaking adaptation
Mar 3 2024,positive,stunning movie acting picture music script absolute must see cant wait for the sequels
Mar 3 2024,positive,1010 theyre telling the story well and raw
Mar 3 2024,positive,giant fastmoving story was over toosoon
Mar 3 2024,positive,good movie  plenty of well known good actors cant wait for part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,together with the first part this is the best dune adaptation ever made and its great    the cast is great the story is compelling the cinematography is beautiful and even at its long runtime i was thoroughly entertained all the way through    i didnt believe that hollywood made movies of such a grand scale anymore but im glad they do    nuff said go see it
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic most visually appealing movie in many years
Mar 3 2024,positive,excessively violent very little plot advancement had my eyes closed for over 20 minutes total and story still ongoing somebody edit it already
Mar 3 2024,negative,the movie was just so slow and boring the dialogue was also uninteresting with many long pauses in between however the sgi the sets and the costumes were amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,beautiful soundtrack
Mar 3 2024,positive,very rarely do you see sequels outdo the predecessor but this one did just that
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing achievement deserves all the awards please give us dune messiah
Mar 3 2024,positive,very well made i have nothing to complain about highly recommended
Mar 3 2024,positive,this was so well done probably my favorite sequel movie since empire strikes back
Mar 3 2024,positive,im not normally really into scifi but this was outstanding in every respect
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best movie experiences ever ive read the books and understand why some purists get upset but i think all the changes benefit the movie and make it an unforgettable experience cant wait to see messiah made into a movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved the action and special effects very realistic just didnt like that they changed the ending unless there is going to be a dune 3    definitely a must see movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,best fantasyscifi since lord of the rings differences from the book are acceptable and were expected no major deviations from the primary source great acting and the best use of cgi in a very long time i loved it
Mar 3 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece in science fiction or in any other genre to be honest it has to be experienced to be believed
Mar 3 2024,positive,movie had me speechless will definitely be seeing it for a 2nd and 3rd time in theaters
Mar 3 2024,positive,very good story telling fantastic cinematography
Mar 3 2024,positive,it is a great movie probably the best movie of the year rebecca ferguson zendaya timothee chalamet and austin butler were great i believe if dune part 2 is successfulthis franchise will be the next star wars
Mar 3 2024,positive,one word  spectacular   this is truly a cinematic masterpiece to be witnessed in a big screen the visuals of first movie were impressive but this one even better every cast member did amazing job this is not an average sci fi where in every scene some ka boom action is going on but in every scene is important to the plotline the fighting techniques were so unique and the music by hans zimmer gives chills my favorite character is  lady jessica played by rebecca ferguson
Mar 3 2024,positive,again i was a little underwhelmed i still think chalamet is the wrong actor for the role of paul atriedes lots of explosions battle scenes etc etc but they left out part of the story it makes me appreciate david lynchs version from 40 years ago a little more it was more true to the novel for example the weirding modules were missing these modules amplify human sound into a lethal weapon alia was already born with powers of a full reverend mother in the original also this movie was way too long movies like infinity war and endgame move along at a much faster clip so you dont realize how long they are this one moved way too slowly dont get me wrong about villeneuve i loved arrival and i really liked blade runner 2049 this was a bit too much of a stretch cheers
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a complete movie right up there with the best hollywood has to offer nothing this decade has even come close
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually stunning did not like much of the films revisions of the books basic plot points compressing the time frame this movie takes place in is just stupid  paul was in the desert for years not a few months  i though the first act was far too slow  should have pulled feyd into the story much earlier
Mar 3 2024,positive,will see this movie again 3 hrs did not feel long at all
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing sound special effects acting   complicated storyline
Mar 3 2024,positive,big fan of the books and ive been pleasantly surprised at how  the writers adapted such a complicated story to a complete and cohesive screenplay the writing acting and effects are spectacular the sound production alone deserves an oscar must see on big screen
Mar 3 2024,positive,watched the movie on imax last night and its one of the best movies ive ever seen masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,positive,the second installment of dune a third is in the works  is visually stunning contains more action than part 1 and features new characters and better still good performances by favorite faces both new and long familiar in those roles  florence pugh  christopher walken and lea seydoux all make memorable if too brief appearances in this deliberately paced and engaging scifi saga  as he did in part 1 timothy chalamet leads the cast effortlessly giving another nuanced and emotionally balanced turn  the rest of the cast rebecca fergusen zendaya javier bardem austin butler and everybody else too many names to list here are colorfully entertaining and believable  mr butler and dave bautista are especially chilling as members of the evil harkonnens  whether youve read the novels or not youre likely to thoroughly enjoy this movie expertly directed by denis villeneuve
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie is good but it is not the masterpiece they promoted in any case the first part attracted more attention because everything was newer more original in this second part its just more of the same and in the middle of the film since there is not much more to tell a void is produced that to a certain extent is boring maybe they should have left it in a single 3hour film
Mar 3 2024,positive,when timothy duned all over the place i knew it was movie of the decade
Mar 3 2024,positive,outstanding effects its an epic film
Mar 3 2024,positive,i watched the film at the cinema last night where i would advise everyone to watch it this was the best experinace i have ever had at a cinema the filmmoviemasterpiece is amazing     the visuals and dramatic effects were unbelievable at times you will know if you have seen it i felt as though i was on a roller coaster and in the movie     the casting was phenomenal to have the lead and supporting actor and actress as the tim and zen just shown how amazing dv is     no disrespect to them both at all but having walken brolin bardem skasgard etc as supporting the supporting cast is just genius     i enjoyed the 1st film but it wasnt an 8 out of 10 film until i watched part 2 part 2 was a 1010 in my opinion and after watching it made me think yhat part 1 was a 910     dv made the part 1 just as a set up and introduction to the 2nd he didnt try to do something that didnt need doing because he was clearly so confident of his skills to make the 2nd a true masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is what cinema is about its a beautiful film with a stellar soundtrack the story has many subtleties but is very easy to follow the character of paul was a fun but also scary to watch develop throughout itll have you wanting to rise out of your seat with how intense it can get
Mar 3 2024,positive,i love the whole story i thought it was really well illustrated in the movie actors were great the scenery was great dynamics of the worms and right in the worms costumes were fantastic also seats were extremely comfortable all the people running in the shower really nice also and very accommodating
Mar 3 2024,positive,across the swing universe that is dune theres a lot visually and sound thats are stunning in this sequel that requires you to have seen and understand the concepts from the first movie     acting from austin butler as feyd ratha harkonen and christopher walken as shaddam who are visceral believable and fun to watch     unfortunately timothy chalametee and zendaya are barely believable becoming a couple in their lead roles and thats the sole negative to this film at times their relationship feels hard to fathom like hayden christensen and natalie portman wooden phantom menace and while it detracts it does not destroy the film     the cinematography is spectacular as is the sound see this on 70mm atmos sound if you can as the worm riding scene is worth the ticket price alone      javier bardem as stilgar steals the show as he brings warmth and humor to his role    rebecca ferguson as lady jessica is also amazing    at 2 hours 40 minutes its epic and sweeping and will have you riveted most of the time  i cant wait for the next one
Mar 3 2024,negative,i want two hours and 35 minutes of my life back  i cant figure out what draws someone to see this movie  part i was alright  after seeing part ii i dont want to ever see another dune movie again  painfully slow moving and fake alien languages requiring subtitles only make enduring this movie more heroic
Mar 3 2024,positive,really enjoyed it looking forward to the next one
Mar 3 2024,positive,truly epic movie  the visuals were stunning and the storyline was amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,villeneuve has a massive franchise in his handsall he has to do now is nuture it epic movie from the cinematography to the music to keeping to the original herbert storyline the second piece of this trilogy is damn near perfect hopefully he will produce everything thru the last two books of chapterhouse everyone involved with this production deserves merit to george lucas j k rowling and the late gene roddenberry you have company coming
Mar 3 2024,positive,cinematically this movie is flawless everyone brought their a game from the acting to the cinematography the directing the score everything is perfect however the pacing and plot is still slow if youve seen part one its more or less the same you would do yourself a disservice if you saw that but not this one its incredible what theyve pulled off in film as a storytelling medium
Mar 3 2024,positive,like dune part 1  dune part 2 was equally amazing both in the story and filming that holds as close as possible to the book cannot wait for part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,there was solid action  way to long and slow to deveope
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie was amazing and so refreshing to see denis villenueve did a fantastic job at continuing this franchise and i must say the coreography of the fight scene between austin butler and timotheé chalamet at the end was phenomenal i was also so pleased to see zendaya as chani in this movie more than in the last one portraying such beautiful character last but not least i need to put my congratulations to florence pugh and the makeup and costume team who did a spetacular job
Mar 3 2024,positive,phenomenal im trying to think of a better scifi movie ive ever seen and coming up blank the visuals acting and score are all amazing cant wait to see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,get movie in all aspects substance is everything and this movie has it all
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a good interpretation of the dune book but it actually leaves many holes for viewers who havent seen previous versions or read the book would have liked to see more of gurney halleck backstory less of the emotional bonding of paul to chani we know he cares after first five minutes didnt need a hour of this and the tradition of making fight scenes at night so no details have to end you can lighten the scene and still understand its nite the audience will understand and enjoy of fill would be better  my suggestion is watch dune 1984 version first and then all the missing holes from part 1 and 2 will be filled in story is needed to appreciative dune its not just effects
Mar 3 2024,positive,i cant stop thinking about it it was what good movies are made of
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie was too long the climax at the end was actually anticlimactic
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie deserves an oscar and i hope they dont forget about it since the oscars are so far away  the story arc thanks frank herbert the directing the acting the special effects the depth and complexity of the main characters the moral story behind it all superbly done  it will go down as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time
Mar 3 2024,positive,just falls short of the original but if this is to be the second of a trilogy then its a very solid part 2 the sound was the best ive experienced in a cinema
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely amazing no more words
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent fun movie cant wait for dune 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,not worth the hype thinly writtenoverlongoverrated af  overall above average 7310
Mar 3 2024,positive,a powerful film a masterpiece with a deeply profound cinematic experience one that i have never come close to experiencing before for me the best movie ive seen by far
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part two stands as a majestic work in the scifi cinema landscape an unmissable experience that demands to be seen on the grand canvas of the cinema screen this film marks a turning point defining a before and after in the genres cinematic history reminiscent of the revolutionary impacts of giants like star wars the lord of the rings and jurassic park    from the very moment the first chapter ends viewers are thrust into a relentless adventure backed by spectacular visual effects an exceptional cast an already immortal soundtrack and a plot so captivating that six hours would not have felt excessive denis villeneuve masterfully introduces innovative elements demonstrating a commitment and dedication that seem to elude many of todays productions    to say dune part two is a masterpiece is an understatement its a cinematic experience that those who love movies cannot and should not overlook a tribute to the greatness of visual storytelling it leaves you breathless and longing for more a mustsee
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 is the ultimate scifi film i was blown away of how this movie went way above my expectations that i anticipated every actoractress in this movie did a phenomenal job the highlight is obviously timothee chalamet as he brings the best performance ive seen him do and is really close of being one of my favorite actors in hollywood austin butler brings a terrifying and phenomenal performance in this film as well this film still leaves a chunk of me disbelieved of what ended down in this film so with this film already being a huge contender for film of the year 2024 it is gonna be hard for a movie to be as this good as dune part 2
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is an audiovisual masterpiece you must see in theaters you will later regret it if you dont     ive never said this before but this is clearly on the level of empire strikes back    there are some things to criticize with the writing in this movie i felt the battles in the first half came out of nowhere and seemed disjointed from the main story    also a certain scene happens that makes me think why didnt they just do that from the beginning    but you will quickly look past these criticisms because virtually everything else about the movie is perfect and its an epic the likes of which ive only seen a few times in my life
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved it action packed sequel  great special effects  terrific story line  great set up for dune 3  go see it in the theaters to get the ultimate movie experience
Mar 3 2024,positive,as a dune fan i am satisfied
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent even better than dune part one saw it in standard now want to go back and experience imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,the photography is stunning however the hero is not credible for me as he is overly aggressive the movie is a little bit like paris  stylish but the arguments dont seem to be thought through
Mar 3 2024,positive,fk this this is the best scifi movies ever
Mar 3 2024,positive,well this was very nice
Mar 3 2024,positive,fans of the book may see one or two minor issues but the cinematography is breathtaking
Mar 3 2024,positive,a space opera a cinematic epic whatever you want to call it this was a great movie experience
Mar 3 2024,positive,seeing this on the silver screen is the only way
Mar 3 2024,negative,the title says dune but the movie isnt dune    dune part 2 doesnt have the feel nor the story of the original movie or books  part 2 had very little with paul atreides becoming  muaddib  the ending was rushed and terrible    if directors want to make their own version of remakes they should change the title
Mar 3 2024,negative,while visually a very compelling movie the deviation from the book in several areas reduces its impact also leaving a great deal to be desired is the performance of zendaya who apparently has one expression for all occasions this could be due to the greatest deviation of character from the book or just an inability to emote human feelings to any great degree christopher walken was sadly miscast in this movie as the emperor a true injustice the absence of several important characters in the book most notably st alia of the knife and an unnecessary plot of a religiously divided fremen utterly change the ending in a most unsatisfactory way
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 does not miss on any level the action scenes are thrilling the story is impactful the visuals are breathtaking and the soundtrack is flawless
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing loved it  story telling amazing i 100 need more  
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the most spectacular movies ive ever seen its really worth seeing in the cinema
Mar 3 2024,positive,you know i always thought of chalomet as a bit of a dandy but hes pretty badass in this movie     and finally there is a film that really captures rebecca fergusons skills and charisma      it really is quite fantastic
Mar 3 2024,positive,they did justice to the book
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie made me create an account on rt just to write a review it is an engrossing and mesmerising cinematic marvel on track to be one of the greatest scifi movies of all time must watch on imax
Mar 3 2024,negative,better than part 1 doesnt mean it is good
Mar 3 2024,positive,faithful to the original story excellent filmography
Mar 3 2024,negative,the movie was impressive in terms of effects and costumes the worms had never been more beautifully depicted but this was a story of what dune could have been not what dune is supposed to be biggest disappointment was how core characters were so drastically different from what they were meant to be  which makes the movie flat and lacking any depth just a bunch of effects and fanaticism
Mar 3 2024,positive,there are a few moments while watching this movie i felt i was watching something historic happening in cinema its one of those films that will have longevity beloved for decades to come masterpiece for sure see it the see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,just a piece of art in all aspects one one of the best movies of all time
Mar 3 2024,positive,perfect example of scifi majesty script acting drama tension actionand all within the best looking film for a generation and a haunting soundtrack that takes you into their world hard to explain just how good this film isawesome
Mar 3 2024,positive,as i watched dune part two i had an increasingly sinking feeling oh no what have they done changing things when adapting a book is expected different mediums need different approaches but the changes need to make sense things i think are core to dune are missing from part two new things added dont work as well i wont list anything here due to spoilers ill maybe blog about it in a few weeks maybe not it certainly looks great and i rated it 610 for that not for characters and story you should see it but be prepared if you know the book you might get that sinking feeling too i had a second viewing prebooked i didnt go so disappointing
Mar 3 2024,positive,i enjoyed it a lot it was very action packed
Mar 3 2024,positive,great cant wait for part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a great movie  a lot of scenes were funny which i wasnt expecting  i saw a 830 am imax show and it was completely full
Mar 3 2024,positive,i loved it in every possible way hans zimmer great as always
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part ii joins the ranks of godfather ii empire strikes back  and top gun maverick as a superior sequel but also is a weird and interesting piece of sciencefiction entertainment that cannot be missed
Mar 3 2024,positive,awesome film all the actors are in his prime specially the scenes of paul and chani  the effects are superbs the plot they changed some thinhs from the book but nothing nothing to be upset  i like even more than part 1 like the empire strikes back or terminator judgement day i didnt notice the almost 3 hour long because every time something happend and ypu dont get bored  i really really like part 2 and i waiting for messiah or part 3  im definitly  going to watch again in 4d or imax or regular screen im ready for the come back thanks for this film 
Mar 3 2024,negative,needs more cowbell
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the most visually spectacular movies i have ever seen  strong acting screenplaymediocre turning what could hsve been on of the ten best movies i have everr seen into a conventional story of family revenge  even so auch a visual treat go
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a great scifi movie great acting high stakes best action scenes great handtohand combat with an awesome story i cant wait for dune 3  denis villeneuve take your time and give a banger for the dune trilogy with the next movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent  would watch it over and over
Mar 3 2024,positive,nearly exactly how i imagined it when i read the novel in the mid 60s and on but villeneuve made extremely smart decisions to tell the story in a movie  saw it on fri morning laser imax and intend to see it at least once more before it goes out of my area  the casting was perfect and all were amazing the two young leads pulled it off  so impressed
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic movie able to captivate the audience for the full 275 hour runtime
Mar 3 2024,positive,a scifi masterpiece for the ages a feast for all your senses that deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was alrightnot as epic as it was made out to be and honestly left me a little baffled reallyeveryone is going to rave about the movie but to me it was a decent sequelspace drama movies are sooo sticky because this is literally just trying to be star wars and cannot be that at all
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is literally a perfect movie there is nothing not to like about this this is a technical masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best if not the best movie ive ever seen  best theatre experience hands down  pure fire 
Mar 3 2024,positive,an exceptional craft of cinema i was blown away by the cinematography score and the beautiful performances of the cast denis villanueve has neiled it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,movie was quite slow at times spent to much time related to religious adpects and it bored me  could of rolled along quicker was ok
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolute cinema watch it on the biggest screen if possible
Mar 3 2024,positive,watched yesterday and was totally blown away i loved pt 1 and had high expectations  pt 2 was everything i wanted it to be and more will watch on imax later this week in london cant wait to see it again 
Mar 3 2024,positive,i really like the film the special effects are incredible  theres a huge differences between the first and the second part  well see more action and an evolution of the reation between paul and chani  the cast and the level of recitation are amazing  i saw it with one of my friend and we agree that weve preferred to see what happed in the head of lady jessica when she has drunk the water of life maybe that part is too quikly
Mar 3 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece how is this movie real just shows we have been used to sub par movies in hollywood easily one of new favourite movies ever
Mar 3 2024,positive,i enjoyed part 1 but part 2 is clearly the better of the two  it is one of those movies that you when you look back at it you were glad you saw it in theater  it was able to keep you entertained to where you didnt feel that the movie is almost 3 hours long
Mar 3 2024,positive,simply amazing will leave you speechless at the end credits the young cast excelled themselves
Mar 3 2024,positive,great followup to the fantastic first movie spectacular visuals and incredible world building throughout the film the only flaw was zendayas lackluster performance
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved it soooooo good
Mar 3 2024,positive,epic this movie has everything one of the best ive seen in a long time
Mar 3 2024,positive,a total immersion in this familiar and yet so foreign world the film focuses on the desire for power and paradoxically the fear of fanaticism a true symbiosis of image and sound a very good film that deserves a part iii 
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing honestly went through a whole deep dive on princess irulan i hope paul doesnt treat her the way he did in the books
Mar 3 2024,positive,wow what a film  the acting the score the special effects the storyline everything about this movie was great  and now i cannot wait for part iii  this is the best scifi franchise since the original star wars if youre on the fence about this movie go see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 3 2024,positive,you rarely see a scifi movie with a descent script and acting the cast was absolutely amazing the costume are also a stand out for some characters its not what you expect a good example is the costume of princess irulan everything is wrapped beautifully with breathtaking set design location and cinematography it will be hard to beat this movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie has an amazing first and second arc it feels like a direct continuation from the first film it does break from the book but overall the tone and key messaging is there    however the third act feels rushed like they are going through dot points to cover all their bases and rush to the finish line the payoff feel forced and dare i say it underwhelming    notwithstanding some large breaks from the book that dont really help in both character and events it still manages to tell a complete tale    this is a film that surprisingly i feel needed another part in order to be done justice dune messiah could have been a part 4    that said overall it is still a good movie and i cannot wait to rewatch with the first in time and judge them wholistically
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is a great piece of art it shows more what a great filmmaker villeneuve is and i also like the little details all the spoiler to the next movie aaliyah lady fenring irrulan and the joke from life of brian   so for me as a big fan of the books this movie is a masterpiece which will redefine the sciencefictiongenre like star wars did decades ago
Mar 3 2024,positive,im gonna tell my kids i watched this in theater 
Mar 3 2024,positive,best movie of the year and best sequel probably out there im so captivated in the world of arrakis and the twists in the movie are so cool and breathtaking timothee chalemet is my favourite actor so far and everyone else does such an outstanding job believe the hype this movie needs more glazing cant wait for part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually stunning and good casting the story line and character arc was good and an overall enjoyable movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,well paced although at times the movie does feel like a slow montage the cinematography and world building are beyond stunning a lot of care and effort has been taken to draw the viewer into the extremes of emotions that frank herbert pushed through in the books this is yet another stunning installation in a film franchise whose story was famously noted to be unfilmable a must watch especially while in the cinemas
Mar 3 2024,positive,an absolute epic masterpiece seen this in imax sound videography cinematography storyline acting costumesit had an almost spiritual mystical feel to it even more than the first one highly recommended movie of the year for me
Mar 3 2024,positive,what a great adaptation of the book i have a big imagination and this filmed lived up to my expectations and i didnt even mind the minor changes every performance was truly incredible and i could have had another hour of story and been happy
Mar 3 2024,positive,the cinematography the music its stunning going to see it again no doubt   love it
Mar 3 2024,positive,an excellent movie every shot is wonderful the sound outstanding and the plot slowly builds up the themes and ideas in a perfect manner
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is a modern classic one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Mar 3 2024,negative,to violent missed opportunity the baron will give me nightmares
Mar 3 2024,neutral,i had such high hopes if you have not read the bookwell i guess its a good movie if you have read the book and expected like i did that the movie was  going to stay close to the book you will be disappointed  spoilers for here on the book is about finding a way to not start a galactic was were millions die in this movie he follows the path that in the book he fought against also water destroys spice not the threat of nucks the guild is not threatened the houses that should have left decide to not support his rise to the thron i feel this 2nd movie is more about building a franchise than following the books im not even going to get into alia of the knife or the fact that his mom is the one pushing for him to become a leader of a jihad time war or gurney halleck and the saudakars parts in the second movie i wanted to like it i really did did so well on the first one first read the book 45 years ago been reading it every few years since wanted a better version that the 80s one i guess i wont live long enough to see the next version come out
Mar 3 2024,positive,a lot of it does parallel the original dune but they have changed a few of the ending scenes  getting ready for part 3 to come im sure  they never brought up the voice weapons  hm dont know why they had left that out  still a good movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely stunning    a masterpiece that impressed me as a hardcore fan of frank not brian herberts work what impressed me most is how impressed my nonfan family and friends were too    dune was fantastic dune part 2 was almost beyond belief     put a tear in my eye
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is a masterful adaptation of frank herberts original novel as well as stunning piece of cinematic art it builds on the wonderful base of part 1 and takes off in glorious fashion bringing to life frank herberts universe in ways that were beyond my imagination when i first read the novels in the 1980s
Mar 3 2024,positive,shittiest thing about this film is that nothing will be better
Mar 3 2024,positive,epic  masterpice     no more words are needed
Mar 3 2024,positive,some stuff was changed  i understand why in some cases but will have lasting changes in messiah if it is made  is hands down the best adaptation
Mar 3 2024,positive,exceptional the world building is incredible
Mar 3 2024,positive,it is entirely too loud  drags nothing really happens except blowing up things  i think it is just a holding period until the actual story starts to happen  the makers more or less made up their own story  this is nothing like the books
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was great fun there were some flaws but overall i loved it i will see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,i would have given it 5 stars if i wasnt so disappointed by the role zendaya got in this movie it was an epic movie with a bit of high school drama where all zendaya got to do is look angry pout and walk away angry with hurt feelings i would have wanted a much better role for her she did great her role lacked a lot of depth
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie all round dramatic sounds effects and perfect acting had me on the edge of my seat
Mar 3 2024,positive,what an aesthetic telling of a tragic story
Mar 3 2024,positive,just watched in imax i must say this is the best movie i have seen in theatres a must see in cinema cinematography and sound design is the best i have seen timothée chalamet and zendaya is next level in acting and denis villeneuve brought his a game for this movie 1010 for me
Mar 3 2024,positive,i cant believe im about to even say it but its even better than the first movie a must see
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing story line and video effects  great actors
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic atmosphere spectacular images but the plot was ordinary and boring to be honest    spoiler alert from this point on  there were quite a few of things very hard to believe eg the emperor so easy to catch guarded just by a handful of man and a lot of scenes were so predictable eg the duel at the end    meh
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is marvelous   the whole story is so touching and powerful
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a good movie highly recommended
Mar 3 2024,positive,so great and absolutely a magnificent movie timothees acting is accurate and totally impressive i really like it

Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was epic 5 s
Mar 3 2024,negative,beautiful confusing bloated and i didnt care if anyone lived or died strangely removed any real feelings of love humanity grounding humorless and big loveless and lacking poetic gravity the phrases heard as credits rolled holy lord too long what the hell this is a movie you will have to go pee in and anywhere is fine
Mar 3 2024,positive,you guys i have never posted a movie review ever but i felt the need to make an account and post a review for this movie this is quite literally the best movie that has come out in 10 years the entire fucking movie had my jaw on the floor the acting the fight scenes the love story the drama the score everything about it had me literally gagged i am so happy a good sequel like this has finally come out the first movie was slow but the second was a scifi cinematic masterpiece i will never be the same go see it right now
Mar 3 2024,positive,if you like the 1st the 2nd will not disappoint you simple as that
Mar 3 2024,positive,cinematic achievement visually with great story telling with a phenomenal cast
Mar 3 2024,positive,let me just say im lucky to have the chance to experience this movie in the cinema this will be the movie people keep talking about after many years simply stunning in all aspects
Mar 3 2024,positive,awesome  heres hoping there will be a part three
Mar 3 2024,positive,fantastic part ii  great adaptation of the moviemore action in 2 and more depth of characters and the conflict of empire
Mar 3 2024,positive,a spectacular achievement by denis villeneuve not since peter jacksons adaptation of lotr has anyone accomplished such a feat
Mar 3 2024,positive,wow so intense i had goose bumps definitely a big screen must loved it so much i hope there is a dune part 3
Mar 3 2024,positive,great adaptation of a challenging book visually stunning excellent cast
Mar 3 2024,neutral,great acting impressive special effects but about an hour too long     great ending but i literally nodded off three times during the first half of this film if you make it to the second half you will be rewarded     just not sure the unnecessary whispered dialogue and the plodding plot during the first half were worth the better executed second half    ostensibly this movie wasted big concepts like how belief in god and religion begets self fulfilling prophecies that are a result of brutal clannish ways that are prompted by the slavish reliance on the hate that belief in god begets     such potential with an amazing cast and stellar acting made insufferably long and ultimately not worth the 275 hours it demands of your time
Mar 3 2024,positive,i cant say enough about how spectacular the visuals and sound design are in this film its a cinematic experience meant for the big screen see it in a theater imax if you can the film also suffers from little emotional engagement similar to the first one i found myself emotionally disconnected from pauls and chanis stories nonetheless its still absolutely worth seeing in theaters for the spectacle alone
Mar 3 2024,positive,best scifi movie ive seen u naked better than the first
Mar 3 2024,positive,action packed movie with a complex storyline unfolding very entertaining
Mar 3 2024,positive,i am a dune fan and i enjoyed both dune 1 and 2 as much if not more than the original movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,haunting and a privilege to see in imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is so good i went to the cinema twice to support this kind of art
Mar 3 2024,negative,after seeing this i gave water to the dead the newly dead hope that these movies would be good
Mar 3 2024,negative,the worst movie adaptation of a book ive ever seen the story was completely butchered some of the special effects were good but not all
Mar 3 2024,positive,wonderful big screen saga story was well told special effects were well woven into the story if youre a frank herbert fan you will be impressed
Mar 3 2024,positive,its interesting how much i remembered from reading the dune novel 59 years ago i still have the 1965 paperback  im not sure how well people who havent read the novel would follow it  the film is visually spectacular and wellacted  however the plot doesnt grab me as much as that of the original star wars film later renumbered to star wars 4  maybe i dont feel as much sympathy because i never took drugswhich are needed because of the butlerian jihad
Mar 3 2024,positive,overall a great movie stunning visuals its true to the book vision which explores the journey of a young man into being shaped by a destiny outside himself as a long time herbert fan there was one sour note the director chose to make the split between fundamentalist believers and the more rational nonreligious led by chani this was no party of the scope of the novel and coopted the religious nuances of the novel into simplistic believersnon believers and it  made chani into a very different and frankly less interesting character than who she was in the novel
Mar 3 2024,positive,its long and ends with a cliffhanger
Mar 3 2024,positive,i do wish there was a better ending
Mar 3 2024,positive,have you found yourself forgetting why we go to the cinema in the first place let this movie remind you
Mar 3 2024,positive,the best movie ive seen since lotr return of the king epic spectacular and emotionally thrilling this is cinema at its very best
Mar 3 2024,positive,if you loved the first dune movie you will love this one best movie series since lotr in my opinion fantastic musical score beautiful cinematography classic heroic story and does not feel rushed as i watch the characters develop absolutely fantastic
Mar 3 2024,negative,cant believe this has such a high score there is so much filler and no real gripping plot extremely disappointed with this movie the 1st one had me hyped but this one was just soooo flat
Mar 3 2024,positive,what a movie hands down for part ii   i loved the first one but this one omg its an another level photography direction music fx sounds costumes color etc it was definitely worth the wait  the movie is about three hours but i wanted more i hope part iii doesnt take much time to be released  definitely will rewatch part ii couple more times
Mar 3 2024,positive,special effects so well done fine acting from all the actors but dark scenes made it hard to know who was talking
Mar 3 2024,positive,all that was missing was more to all the makers thank you for this art
Mar 3 2024,positive,thrilling emotional and above all epic dune part two once again finds visionary director denis villeneuve at the center of his craft and delivers a followup that not only lives up to its predecessor but also manages to surpass it in several aspects
Mar 3 2024,positive,your life will be inconsequential if you do not see this movie it is a masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,positive,im a fan yet there were too many slowmotion shots of person walking in the desert with cape fluttering sidewise in the wind and two contrived didnt need to happen fight sequences gladiatorstyle and at the end  more generally the amazing worldbuilding worms ornithopters desert survival etc happened in the first film but the second film served too much of the same for nearly three hours
Mar 3 2024,positive,omg so incredible
Mar 3 2024,positive,the bar might have been set for scifi epics the first hour sets everything up then strap your seatbelt on for an epic ride you will struggle to forget
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was so well done its amazing you gotta see this
Mar 3 2024,positive,gary movie was 45       sting and the princess got more back story this time    80s movie didnt even know why they were there    and this movie explained where they got the atomics original movie all the sudden last battle they got atomics out of nowhere    hes like the gritty real life luke skywalker     my 2 complaints i dont know how they get off the worms  an the 3rd act felt rushed  when letter and then battle and end credits
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely amazing picture effects music acting literally couldnt have been better
Mar 3 2024,positive,huge leap from the first movie and one of the best movies ive seen in the last few years rivals the fx of avatar the way of water and delivers a better more satisfying story
Mar 3 2024,positive,as visually stunning if not more than part 1  the overall atmosphere of dune is where it shines   i suppose my main criticism is that it runs a bit shallow and lacks the character depth it needs to be a true masterpiece  
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie but really long special effects were stunning excellent cast and score story line is slightly altered from the original but much easier to follow will watch again
Mar 3 2024,positive,without a doubt a sci fi film of a generation this is incredible i just watched it and can barely put into words how amazing it was 
Mar 3 2024,negative,im a lifelong dune fan having read all of the books several time the frank herbert ones and the brian herbert  kevin anderson prequels fillers and conclusion this movie has the bones of dune but gutted many of the characters and plot points all glossed over with stunning visuals and music i dont want to create spoilers but any fan of the books knows what i mean
Mar 3 2024,positive,i really like the story line it different from the original which was not bad it seems to leave it open for part three definitely were seen
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is amazing i had to see it for the second time its that good
Mar 3 2024,positive,so good  i hope three comes out before 2028
Mar 3 2024,positive,really good slow but interesting story line
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie keeps you on the edge of your seat i didnt want to go to the restroom i was afraid i was going to miss something
Mar 3 2024,positive,watched in imax after dolby cinema and yes i was right dolby is way better at immersion with its surround sound and vibrating seat and floor compared to imax yes the imax is bigger resolution more clarity but the sound and vibration of dolby is the best experience for any movie i would say
Mar 3 2024,negative,interminable  you needed to watch other movies to understand
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part two left me speechless this is a cinematic experience i wont soon forget    this is why we go to the movies    words cannot describe it     but here goes    monumental    colossal     powerful     epic    thoughtful    haunting    exceptional    staggering    transcendent    absorbing    immersive    unreal    gnarly    crazy    audacious    ambitious    visceral    technically immaculate     gorgeous    emotional    profound    i truly dont think there is anything i can say that would do this movie justice its both high art and a massive blockbuster ill never know what it was like to see the empire strikes back when it first opened in theaters but i imagine dune 2 comes close a staggering leap forward from what came before it while also feeling significantly more personal brilliant huge revolutionary scifi this movie is a generational masterpiece we are so lucky to be alive to witness this movie i have never seen anything quite like it before for years to come we will all talk about the wonder we experienced when watching this for the first time     dune part two was vindicating like less than five minutes into it i sunk into my seat and thought ok its somehow different and better than i imagined it kept that energy the whole film my mind is scrambled with thoughts so this review might be all over the place but regardless the main takeaway is go see dune 2 its the cinematic event of our generation believe all the hype you see it is the realization of everything ive ever dreamed genre filmmaking can accomplish we havent had a genre film quite on this level since the lord of the rings or maybe ever within the first ten minutes i knew we were within masterpiece territory once we got to the montage with paul and chani set to zimmers a time of quiet between the storms my personal favourite scene in the movie i knew the bar had been raised and by the time we got to the third act well i cant even describe the feelings of excitement i had the third act of dune part two is perhaps the most staggering thing ive ever seen on a screen i was in tears  ive never experienced anything quite like it in a cinema before dune part two is truly something special  it is the kind of blockbuster epic we dont see hollywood make very often these days and that is worth cherishing i spent most of dune part two slackjawed in sheer awe of what was on screen in front of me this movie is soulshattering and yet so exciting     as i was watching the movie i realized in the moment i was likely witnessing cinematic history unfold before me  this film is a generational masterpiece on the level of the godfather lawrence of arabia star wars and of course the lord of the rings this movie raises the bar to a whole new level  this film stands head and shoulders about 95 of current hollywood production i feel so lucky to have experienced a film on this level    denis villeneuves vision is on spectacular display in dune part two a bold journey that dives deep into the colliding tragedy of love and destiny the visual language and soundscape are mesmerizing you could feel the weight of this world sink in the ensemble of dune part two is wondrous especially zendaya and rebecca ferguson who command the screen and communicate so much with a single look timothée chalamet totally raises the bar with his intriguing buildup of character and austin butler relishes in sheer insanity everyone involved from hans zimmer and his mesmerizing score to joe walker and his terrific editing deliver some of their most incredible work greig frasers cinematography however eclipses everything the way his images characterize the world of dune is absolutely breathtaking and the meticulous arrangement makes every single shot look like paintings with which i would gladly cover every centimetre of my walls    dune part two is a colossal action epic the battle sequences dont take up a large chunk of time but when they arrive theyre incredible that final standoff between paul and feyd tense doesnt even begin to describe it this is a beast of a film rewarding in both the thrilling setpieces and rich allegory denis villeneuves eye for action and iconography blends for a nearly flawless blockbuster and an unforgettable cinematic experience this is a transcendent cinematic masterpiece that demands to be experienced on the largest screen possible denis villeneuve has created one of the best sequels of all time one of the greatest scifi films of all time hell  one of the greatest films of all time this is the lawrence of arabia of sciencefiction epics    dune part two is an astonishing scifi epic that surpasses part one in every single way denis villeneuve has realized his dream of adapting frank herberts masterwork to the big screen with the depth and scale it deserves in a tour de force we rarely see anymore truly in awe of all its craft from top to bottom and the perfect cast who bring these characters to vivid life timothée chalamet gives one of his most captivating performances to date certainly his darkest he commands the screen like never before zendaya is the heart of the movie while austin butler relishes in playing pure psychotic evil but the scariest performance of all might be javier bardem who perfectly captures the novels dangerous message of fundamentalism     in the end dune part two is a remarkable work of art its everything i want from cinema and sets a new standard for what we should expect from our blockbusters it absolutely blew away my expectations and i cant wait to see it again i dont have the words to accurately describe just how much i adore this movie it transports you to a world of pure immersion for 3 hours and the performances are lifealtering i may see this 10 times in theatres i cant stop thinking of how much i love dune part two and how it fills me with gratitude for what cinema means to me this is what the movies were made for this reminds me of why i love movies we dont get films this good as often as we ought to so savour it never has a movie transported me to another planet like dune part two it is as immersive of an experience as i have ever had in the theatre and will go down as one of my alltime favourite cinematic experiences i hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this on the biggest screen possible there is truly nothing else like it i love this movie not only is dune villeneuves magnum opus its the definitive scifi epic of a generation a tragic tale of blind fanaticism and corruption a spectacular soulful aweinspiring masterclass of aesthetics and mood beautifully echoing pauls turbulent journey that left me utterly speechless i cant believe we are lucky enough to have a movie like this it left me with this beautiful feeling that i had just experienced something truly special i teared up realizing that villeneuves dune is real that i got to see it and its a masterpiece    there is before dune part two and there is after dune part two i dont know if the world is ready for this movie it is gnarly it is crazy it is audacious it doesnt hold back wow i cant believe it exists but it does and its here bring on dune messiah    long live the fighters    long live denis villeneuve    long live cinema
Mar 3 2024,neutral,this movie is way too long and can be very boring at times also there is way too much confusion and dialogue in this movie very disappointed after seeing all the build up and no execution from the first one way overhyped
Mar 3 2024,positive,epic scifi story amazing cast and stunning visuals it just could have been 45 minutes to an hour shorter now we wait for part three
Mar 3 2024,negative,the movie sucked super disappointed after being so excited to see it

Mar 3 2024,positive,glogeous and elegance
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent 2nd part  so many surprises  visual effects  totally off the hook  a must see  will be going back to see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is an excellent adaption of the book honestly it feel a bit rushed at some points like it could have been broken into 3 movies but its still quite good
Mar 3 2024,negative,the cast was amazing   i was bored out of my mind and couldnt wait for it to end  it jumped around a lot made it frustrating  i think dune would be better as a series on hbo or something
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is as advertised a big engrossing epic worthy of the original material
Mar 3 2024,positive,really good but a bit too long at some points
Mar 3 2024,negative,visually great i thought it was boring just like the 1st one the main actor and his visions was dumb the girl brings nothing to the movie this movie was a waste of time the story isnt that good jason momoa and the mom were the only decent parts of this movie 
Mar 3 2024,positive,such a great sequel cant wait to see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,lots of action and story should have been longer several threads cut short
Mar 3 2024,positive,intriguing i didnt even realize that it was a 3hour movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,masterpiece of a movie in my opinion the best final 1 hour of any movie all time
Mar 3 2024,positive,such a deep and well written plot an absolute must watch had me on the edge of my seat for the entire last half of the movie timothée is such a great actor
Mar 3 2024,positive,all the hype was true pure cinematic masterpiece cant wait to watch again and again
Mar 3 2024,positive,the suspense will keep you wanting to watch more from the visuals to the music to the wonderful acting dune 2 is a great movie to watch if you want something intense nicely done
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing film cinematography absolutely stunning have never see something on this scale before
Mar 3 2024,positive,missing something that i cant quite put my finger on still enjoyed it tho certainly epic and well shot overly long and some parts rushed and confusing might hv to rewatch
Mar 3 2024,positive,enjoyable   beautifully done  need to read the book tho  much better
Mar 3 2024,positive,slow at times but the battle scenes are epic dragged a little but a fun watch in rpx

Mar 3 2024,positive,visually stunning and overwhelming in the best way allstar cast fantastic adaptation and a true success by denis villanueve
Mar 3 2024,positive,loved it worth the wait
Mar 3 2024,positive,a visually stunning movie building on and improving on the 1st in the series  there are several changes from the book but the alterations are not overly distracting and generally seem to be reasonable choices for the film
Mar 3 2024,positive,watch this movie the world building effects music score acting its sublime refresh yourself with dune 1 and then be prepared to be amazed
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was visual and dramatic however the film script had too many unforgivable holes for this part the tweaks to the novel in part one were noticeable but minor and tolerable in part two there were so many significant deviations and omissions that anyone who had read the novel or seen david lynchs version would likely have found it as mysterious and illogical as i did that being said maybe someone who knows nothing about the book or earlier movie might find it solid and entertaining it wasnt a waste of time and it didnt have to be faithful to the source to succeed it could easily have been better
Mar 3 2024,positive,delivers an intense experience that keeps you glued to the screen the story builds on the first film with thrilling action sequences never a dull moment and all powered by an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack its a mustsee for scifi fans
Mar 3 2024,positive,intense well paced top notch production
Mar 3 2024,positive,if deni isnt already shooting dune 3 he is a dic
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely without a doubt one of the best movies ive ever seen in my entire life i felt like i was watching history in the making while at the imax showing i never got to see lotr in theaters but i only could imagine this is the same feeling that viewers got when watching two towers in theaters this movie was so good it was almost a spiritual experience with biblically immaculate story telling the story score and cinematography are so massive it seemed to even pass the threshold of what a movie could be and became something that was a visceral experience to witness 1110 would recommend everyone to see it in imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,pretty dang perfect  ill be honest im typically a tough critic
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent austin butler stole the show

Mar 3 2024,positive,i enjoyed the action the storyline and the way it kept me interested in what was coming next and why  its very entertaining
Mar 3 2024,positive,if starwars and the dark knight had a baby it was called dune 2 this was a cinamatic masterpiece to be enjoyed on the big screen best movie that i have seen in years 1010
Mar 3 2024,positive,everything was awesome the only thing the i can complaining is the secuencial

Mar 3 2024,positive,well worth the wait
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is just a once in a life time movie pure must see in theaters
Mar 3 2024,positive,there was not a moment where i felt bored its a much watch
Mar 3 2024,positive,i loved every second of this movie from the second i sat down to the very conclusion was never much of a dune fan till recently but hell does this universe have me sucked in and begging for me hoping for dune part 3 to be greenlit 1010 movie i recommend it
Mar 3 2024,positive,moviereview dunepart2 dunemovie    dune is one of those franchise movies that you have to know the backstory or you have to know the book series or these characters in order to completely understand what is going on       this is a very long movie but its a good movie its not bad its very story driven and dialogue heavy theres not that much action there is plenty but theres not as much as you would expect     timothy chalamet does a phenomenal job like he does in most every movie that hes in but hes not always the vocal point even though hes the lead in this franchise he is the main character but sometimes he seems like an afterthought     florence pugh still dont understand what her characters point was she was there and gone and back and gone and back and then youre like oh wait a minute whats your purpose     rebecca ferguson is another lead she of course plays the mother and she does a fantastic job with what shes given and shes more prominent in the film       it was funny to see josh brolin and dave bautista battling because all i kept thinking was theres thanos versus drax     zendaya has a bigger part than she did in the last movie but she doesnt have a gigantic part like everybodys trying to make it sound like she still takes the backseat         and then the last character that would be considered a main character is austin butler and you can tell that they cut his lines or they did not give him very much dialogue because when he does speak he sounds like an evil elvis i am not quite sure what the deal is with that elvis voice and why he cannot shake it     overall its a decent movie to build up but just like every middle movie to a trilogy the middle movie is always very dialogue heavy and story building and thats exactly what this movie was just like the twilight series the hunger game series any of those series the third movie is always the big impact the first movie set you up and get you excited and then the second movie is always the bummer     im not saying this movie is a bummer im just saying that you really have to know these characters because i have no clue who any of them are and none of their names are something i can ever remember so now i know that timothy chalamet plays paul  but thats all i can tell you      it is worth watching if youre planning on watching the entire franchise there has to be a part three it just doesnt make sense for their not to be one 
Mar 3 2024,positive,i liked it almost as much as part one which i found more immersive and had a better score but this one has more action will likely improve as the first one did with repeat viewings so much to take in denis vs dune has all the makings of a timeless  classic scifi saga what a film has me looking forward to dune messiah in a few more years
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was amazing beautiful soundtrack and did a great job keeping me in my seat the first part was a 910 the second movie was a 9510 highly recommended
Mar 3 2024,positive,the best movie ive seen for the last 10 years the second part is even better   i enjoyed every minute  amazing and epic  definitely we will watch it second time in the movie theater
Mar 3 2024,positive,what a great film and a fantastic continuation of the first half of the story cant wait for messiah
Mar 3 2024,negative,visually beautiful looking thats it  full disclosure never read any of the books that being said most film adaptations are capable of tying together context material from the book or book series this film failed plot lines fell apart and contradicted its self failed to tie together character arcs basically it felt like an art project from hollywood to impress themselves would also like to address a psa if you suffer from epilepsy be prepared to have an episode by the continuous dark to blinding bright lights thrusted upon you if that doesnt trigger it the sudden shock of blaring loud orchestra music will like a young sibling waiting around every corner to scare you your left waiting in anxiety for the sound stop your heart the audio tech was tasked to saving the movie by jolting the viewers every 3 minutes with deafening sounds since the story couldnt keep our attention my advice stream it when available
Mar 3 2024,negative,i was asleep the entire time it was like watching a lullaby
Mar 3 2024,positive,really enjoyed part two just as much as part one
Mar 3 2024,positive,i loved the movie it meets the great variety that we look for in science fiction movies there are so many possible outcomes the setting is magnificent the dunes are beautiful and prominent i look forward to part 3 with great desire i loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo dune
Mar 3 2024,positive,the perfect answer to criticism of the first film being too slowpart two is action packed suspenseful full of surprises especially if you havent read the books and the score was chilling the epic cast delivered phenomenal performances loved it from beginning to end and have seen it in xd dbox seats and tomorrow imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a phenomenal film and easily a top contender for best movie of 2024  seeing dune part 1 2021 is a must  to understand and appreciate part 2  highly recommend seeing this in imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing visuals flawless performances loved it
Mar 3 2024,positive,great soundtrack and an unexpected ending
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie was absolutely stunning there was never a dull moment and as a book reader i think this movie was executed perfectly dune 2 is hyped up for good reason and it sure did not disappoint
Mar 3 2024,positive,just a cinematic and emotional triumph in every way
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was a masterpiece start  end was amazing cant wait for part 3 
Mar 3 2024,positive,far more intelligent than most of the current blockbuster franchises  no michael bay or marvel hooray
Mar 3 2024,positive,intriguing epic storytelling showing the rise to power equal time for both sides  amazing and contemplative  dont expect star wars its the quiet introspective moments that give this movie the emotional gravitas it needs  easily one of the best sequels of all time
Mar 3 2024,positive,dennis v hit it out of the park with this one all i can say is wow and please go see it in imax 
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely amazing from start to finish
Mar 3 2024,positive,superb acting directing writing cgi all of the things it really brought a great dynamic between the main characters and their change over time and their different responses motivations to events it made me love hate and respect these characters all at different times in the best way i ended up hating how a character was not because it was poorly acted or directed but because the acting and directing was so great you hate or love these characters because they are portrayed well set in a magnificent story
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was awesome the visual effects were stunning
Mar 3 2024,positive,easily one of my new favorite movies   the film is a work of art
Mar 3 2024,positive,worth seeing in imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,although this movie has almost a three hour run time i found myself fully engulfed from the word go and never checking my watch there is a different tone to this sequel compared to the first film but its neither positive nor negative there are a few loose ends left opened at its conclusion but its very likely that those issues will be attended to during the third film should it be green lit overall dune 2 was exceptional movie but please watch dune 1 first before attending and go to the bathroom before the trailers end
Mar 3 2024,positive,on par with empire strikes back and the dark knight as one of the best scifi sequels of all time a masterclass in film making that did an outstanding job adapting a difficult book the changes made sense for moving to a film format and takes nothing away from the message and tone of the source material see it on the biggest screen you can find
Mar 3 2024,positive,holy schmoley dune ii was incredible better than dune i villeneuves distinct style makes it impossible to look away as the film is all at once beautiful visceral mesmerizing and realistic the only somewhat negative aspect is the acting of zendayashes pretty lame but you get past it the musicscore and sound effects rattle your seat so go and see it in the theaters
Mar 3 2024,positive,gorgeous got me sucked into it from minute one till the end loved it
Mar 3 2024,positive,if you are a fan of the book you will be a fan of this as close to what i imagined it to be while reading the book understanding that they had to translate the story to the cinema and the need for hollywood drama  hence the liberties they took to timeline and adding an antagonist that was not in the book
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal
Mar 3 2024,positive,910 solid movie but still didnt crack my top 10
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent sequel great movie all around i wished the last battle scene wouldve been a bit longer but still a solid movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,a work of art beautiful transitions amazing score perfectly clear and smooth character development leaves you wanting more so many critical points in all society the perfect mix of space fantasy and war
Mar 3 2024,positive,we enjoyed the movie they tried to pack so much into part 2 and  at some point we couldnt keep upbut the cinematography was excellent if youre a dune fan lengthy movie but didnt feel like it
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece the cinematography and sounds design are fantastic and paul atreides is an absolute beast of a character cant wait for messiah so we can see alia in all her glory the cast was amazing just absolutely stacked this film is going to win a lot of awards
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing it was easily the best movie ive ever seen in theaters 10x better than when interstellar or avatar came out i really hope there is a chapter 3 to close the story out
Mar 3 2024,positive,this was amazing get up and go see it now right now go why are you still reading
Mar 3 2024,positive,good movie to kick off the year with
Mar 3 2024,neutral,dune 2 was a disappointment there were major pacing issues and at three hours you better keep things interesting they really worked hard trying to make zendaya this bad mofo girl boss and it didnt work dune 2 wasnt all terrible the villain was pretty good and the ending was excitingalmost good enough to make up for the mindnumbing first act overall its a decent scifi movie but not nearly as good as the first villeneuve dune
Mar 3 2024,positive,this was an incredible film the drama action cgi acting story and sound were all phenomenal i can find no problems in this film other than the fact that the emperor went to arrakis where his enemies were i think that was a bad strategy but it must have been for some reason i didnt catch and if this is what happens in the book i cant complain about accuracy this film was absolutely gorgeous making it narrowly beat movies like avatar and avengers endgame when it comes to cgi and its overall better than avatar the action was just so awesome and the drama was just unreal the movie was so nostalgic and powerful and i was completely immersed in it this is the best film i have seen in a movie theater so far everything in it was gold and i expect it to win many oscars the directors and actors of this film did an incredible job and this movie is a mustsee and a perfect 1010
Mar 3 2024,positive,the performing 1010    sound 1010    content 810    general best movie ive seen in a long time so fun seeing new actors getting in spotlight as well
Mar 3 2024,positive,superb acting spell binding sets intrigue but flat flawed character in predictable ending

Mar 3 2024,positive,10 times better than the first
Mar 3 2024,positive,good story lots of action and great choreography
Mar 3 2024,positive,movie too long they spent too much time training paul leaving less time for the meat of the story paul very hesitant to take on his role  dont remember chani leaving paul in the book interesting segway
Mar 3 2024,positive,i love the first one and part 2 is even better it was the shortest two hours  46 minutes of my life i could have sat there  watched for hours more very few movies are worth going to the theater to see nowadays this is one of them
Mar 3 2024,negative,took for ever to get to the good parts of the movie could have been cut down to a 1hr 45 minutes my friend slept through half the movie since it didnt captivate us 1st movie was much better
Mar 3 2024,positive,one the best movies ive seen a long time better than part one i cant wait for dune 3 
Mar 3 2024,positive,these are the type of movie that make the big screen such an important resource go see this in a theater
Mar 3 2024,positive,spectacular best sci movie ever direction special effects cinemaphotography editing sound script will blow you away
Mar 3 2024,positive,it spent way too long on the religion aspect but all in all it was a good movie with great visuals
Mar 3 2024,positive,incredible all the way through
Mar 3 2024,positive,this is easily the best movie of the last 20 years comparable only to the original star wars and lord of the rings i will be going back to watch it again  absolutely amazing
Mar 3 2024,positive,i thought it was a great continuation of the series it showed a lot more than the original movie it told a great story but i think they rushed the ending a little bit loved the empress zendayas performance was just ok everyone else did a great job
Mar 3 2024,positive,love it love the difference between the original and part2
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually excellent solid story with great acting

Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely stunning film visually stunning
Mar 3 2024,positive,excellent continuation of movie 1 great acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,great sequel and im still confused and lost whats going on
Mar 3 2024,positive,what an incredible experience denis villeneuve is a master of scope and storytelling and has done the impossible with adapting the novel the cinematography from greig fraiser is impressive as hell as well as the sound design and the wonderful score from hans zimmer the visual effects are soo grounded in the world that they look and feel real and doesnt look fake or out of place the performances are great too but the ones that stood out were josh brolin javier bardem christopher walken and austin butler who are just killer saw it twice on friday and its my favorite film of the year so far
Mar 3 2024,positive,well beyond 10 out of 10  acting cinematography and incorporation of so many key concepts from the frank herberts first book all exceed expectations  with the important orientation out of the way in dune 1 dune 2 gets straight to business and it pays off  i cannot wait to see it again
Mar 3 2024,positive,magnificent  deviates from the book but yhe results may be better than yhe book  a must see
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies of all time a great balance of tragedy and humour
Mar 3 2024,negative,it strays too far from the book  their eyes are not even blue  pauls sister doesnt kill the grandfather    the guild is not mentioned at all  the emperor is not sent to be stranded on his planet  plue chaney does not leave paul  jessica reminder her that consorts are more important than wives who are not loved by their husbands
Mar 3 2024,positive,as good as the first the modern star wars
Mar 3 2024,positive,good but way too long lots of unnecessary dialogue lacked action
Mar 3 2024,positive,after my 2nd viewing i believe it might be the finest scifi film ive ever seen  state of the art
Mar 3 2024,positive,intense sitting on my chairriveting loved it
Mar 3 2024,positive,this was epic if you like the first dune this does not disappoint  best movie so far in 2024 by far
Mar 3 2024,positive,very good we loved it
Mar 3 2024,positive,on one hand i loved the movie my heart was thumping the entire time and it did not feel like a 3hour movie keep in mind i love the dune story i have been waiting for this movie since i saw the first one i know all the lines the music and even chakobsa words i love the arc of pauls character and his inner struggles i love how he comes to grips with his faith and how he finally surrenders to it after all that is what it means to be human   however despite all this the movie does not convince me that paul truly believes he is the kwisatz haderach even in the end when he gains control of it all it still feels that he is doing only to avenge his father he has taken the water of life and convinced all around him but he has not convinced himself like stilgar we all see the signs except the one himself im not sure if this is because of his love for chani who fights against the prophecy with every fiber of her being or his hate for the bene gesserit and their calculated manipulations of mankind   i have to say i enjoyed the movie but i was hoping for a hero that despite his self doubts will eventually make the leap and embrace who he really is
Mar 3 2024,positive,it has a dynamism that i really liked love how it can explote my feelings in important scenes i love how the story is told and the actors are very splendid1010 if you love scifi you will love dune
Mar 3 2024,positive,a real cinematic audio visual experience thrilling sound and music lush settings and cinematography gripping story with excellent performances my only gripe is the ending looks like a part three may be in the offing
Mar 3 2024,positive,better than part one
Mar 3 2024,positive,my favorite movie as of now
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing in all aspects
Mar 3 2024,positive,its one of the best movies i have seen in my lifetime the acting was superb the cinematography was perfect and the story was told spectacularly this will go down as one of the greats
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely amazing the cinematography and soundtrack was so intense the characters had more time to develop my only real concern is that the ending felt rushed and varied from the book ending so excited to see how that leads into messiah
Mar 3 2024,positive,some omissions and diversions from the book why was zendaya look so irritated all of the time but for the most part lived up to its epic expectations
Mar 3 2024,neutral,while visually appealing with vibrant colors and intricate cinematography the movie fell short in delivering a satisfying story telling experience
Mar 3 2024,positive,exceeded my expectations  if you enjoyed 1 i dont know why you wouldnt like this
Mar 3 2024,negative,weird and disjointed
Mar 3 2024,positive,watch on the biggest screen you can could definitely watch again in theaters 
Mar 3 2024,positive,not as good as first part in my opinion and editing left a bit to be desired but the cinematography and hanz zimmers simple yet powerful score made it good viewing
Mar 3 2024,negative,i didnt even finish the movie yet i just wanna go home man
Mar 3 2024,positive,too long but action pact special effects great acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,cinematography production value music
Mar 3 2024,positive,genuinely one of the greatest sequels ive ever watched breathtaking visual effects amazing writing and 1010 acting has twiststurns plus it sets up for a stunning sequel i really hope they deliver
Mar 3 2024,positive,must see excellent piece of modern art watch now
Mar 3 2024,positive,well paced narrative and good story telling  the ending  was  a bit of a surprise   amazing  and sustained world building with believable characters  ive been looking forward to this movie for 50 years
Mar 3 2024,positive,love the new story telling and the movies make use of every minute of the time and keep you engaged the entire film  only a couple things bother me about the new story telling with a lack of explanation of the pain felt with within the box  the book and original movie do a good job explaining the amount of pain that is felt  plus the child i expected to have been born by the end of part two
Mar 3 2024,positive,wow  one of the best cinematic experiences i have seen in several years a truly stunning movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,epic expansive visual frightening loving laughing some of the words that come to mind must see for sci fi fans and lovers of expertly directed and acted movies go just sayin
Mar 3 2024,positive,beautifully filmed movie i loved the book and loved the movieboth parts
Mar 3 2024,positive,visually stunning amazing performances narratively captivating it is indeed a cinematic piece of art
Mar 3 2024,positive,epic people complaining about either the length or story changes   its a tough and long book to adapt and denis nailed it for the big screen keeping the plot lean as it can be to make sense   the focus is paul for his adaption part 1 2 and yet to be greenlit but cannot imagine why it would not happen final chapter 3 covering dune messiah   personally i enjoyed 1 and 2 equally anyone bored with them i say no soup for you
Mar 3 2024,positive,great adaption of the book very good visuals and sound lots of action and was well cast normally dont repeat movies without some time but seen it twice on opening weekend
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 surpassed the first film which i thought was a difficult thing to do however denis villeneuve pulled delivered another epic film the cinematography and layout of this film was masterfully executed this is a must see on an imax screen
Mar 3 2024,positive,amazing make sure you watch part one before you go and see this so you do not miss any details
Mar 3 2024,negative,boring people power fight weird
Mar 3 2024,positive,best film to hit the big screen in a long time
Mar 3 2024,positive,likely the best sifi movie made in the 15 years brilliantly written  acted edited  and shot please hollywood give us more cinema of  this quality
Mar 3 2024,positive,probably the best movie ive ever seen i can only hope they make a part 3 if is a must watch in the movie theaters
Mar 3 2024,positive,im a huge fan of the series i read the book after seeing the first movie in theaters when it came out even though i had now idea what was going on i still liked it now it has became one of my favorite books and i have gained a lot of appreciation for the first movie this movie is no different even though some parts were left out or changed the parts they left outchanged fixed a lot of the issues i had with the amazing but flawed book overall an amazing movie now one of my favorite movies of all time
Mar 3 2024,positive,great acting great visuals great story great sound design great settingnot really much to complain about  a thrilling scifi epic with great characters and a thoughtprovoking plot  despite the films daunting length some bits at the end feel a bit rushed
Mar 3 2024,positive,the dune trilogy is quickly becoming the third best series of all time only next to lotr and star wars artistically dune is trumps both it is a masterclass in filmmaking from the costumes to the music to the cinematography denis villanueve will go down as one of the greatest directors of our time
Mar 3 2024,positive,slower pacing than the first movie but filled with plenty of jaw dropping moments and beautiful cinematography must see if you were a fan of the first movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part two expands upon what made the first one a great setup that leads to the payoff that made dune part two as extraordinary as it can be and further exceeded my expectations
Mar 3 2024,positive,wayyy better than the first
Mar 3 2024,positive,wished they would have incorporated more of the good parts from the original however it was still very good  timothe chalamet  rebecca ferguson and zendaya are all very good in their roles
Mar 3 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece i cant remember ever sitting through a movie this long without it becoming slow however the way this movie was structured i was engaged throughout the entire time incredible script writing powerful performances from the entire cast and dont even get me started on what the entire crew contributed to production im happy to be alive during a time where i was able to experience this 1010 55 a if it was possible
Mar 3 2024,positive,a true blockbuster in every form stunning visuals and well paced action make this a movie worth seeing dont let the runtime keep you from seeing this movie every moment is worth it i would gladly see this again 
Mar 3 2024,positive,first good movie of the year  finally something worth watching  visually stunning  true to the books as far as i can remember  only weak part for me was timothy as paul  he just doesnt have the gravitas imho to play a perceived messiah but he did pretty good
Mar 3 2024,positive,pretty good  awesome for todays standards  story is great but its from a book action scenes are ok  i think the allure is that its fresh and interesting    these are good movies but    i didnt walk away with any scenes in my head that said i need to watch that again    its fresh a new style a new concept from an old book  provocative    but thats all its only a good movie because its well made and the book that i havent read is a complex plot and setting    the acting isnt stellar  they all have screen presence but theres a lack of emotional impact    action scenes are ok but not moving    b movie    ratings  a  watch several times again sone day  b  watch once more  c  wont watch again  d  regret paying for a ticket  f  production team should find another job      definitely    might
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely incredible film
Mar 3 2024,positive,great movie its better the first one  must see it  in imax
Mar 3 2024,positive,breathtaking and a beautiful masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the greatest films of all time
Mar 3 2024,positive,i loved it but to tell the truth i loved the part 1 more it just a little less mystery in part 2 compare to 1 yet is as entertaining im hoping warner brothers will continue and give us dune 2 my guess it wont be part 3 since the first two parts covered book 1 of the novel especially after showing some future that hasnt happened in this one cant wait
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a while absolutely must see
Mar 3 2024,positive,top 5 movie in my opinion
Mar 3 2024,positive,wow see it on the big screen
Mar 3 2024,positive,for a part ii and almost 3hr movie they left a ton out but i still enjoyed it
Mar 3 2024,negative,the pacing was way off this should have been sooooo much more than it was huge let down with the worst film adapted ending since the original it
Mar 3 2024,negative,i did not like this movie i walked out before it ended waisted my time and money
Mar 3 2024,positive,no spoilers but this movie left me feeling like when is part 3 coming it could have been an hour longer the 1st movie was amazing and this one was better great job with this film
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part two 2024 ½  rewatched mar 01 2024  devin clines review published on letterboxd    he who controls the spice controls the universe    summary  an angry and defiant paul atreides and chani deliver many of the best and most intense moments of all they both yell glare and scowl all throughout zendayas expressive enraged eyes are onpoint if looks could kill  firstclass cinematography visuals lighting sound design performances from its main cast sets casting editing costume design dialogue and directing  the 3rd act and final scenes are where this film shifts into a whole new gear of legendary greatness last 25 minutes were insanely cool  timothy chalamet zendaya austin butler florence pugh rebecca ferguson and josh brolin in particular all bring their a games the entire cast pretty much all deliver at consistently high levels of greatness
Mar 3 2024,neutral,did not follow the book or the previous movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,just an amazing part 2  hopefully there will be another
Mar 3 2024,positive,i cant believe there is going to be a part 3  34 of part 2 was all talking
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was an awesome amazing movie i just wish it stayed a little more true to the book and not the original movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,i read the books and have seen the other adaptations  this is by far the best movie version both visually and narratively  a few edits from the book actually make the movie better  the story and the characters are the main focus not the special effects which help tell the story  like epic movies this tells a story and lends itself to discussions with friends and family  i look forward to part 3 and hope hollywood makes more of these type movies that have excellent stories and acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,true to the book with some excusable exception  i did feel that some of the scenes with the fremen went excessively longer than they need to be  imagery was fantastic a must see on the big screen
Mar 3 2024,negative,dune or dull    so slow so many long and drawn out scenes music is uninspiring   waited all this time for a snooze fest    i almost fell asleep waiting for something to happen  subtitles would have helped for some scenes that were drown out with music        way too much of the dune religion and holy war emphasis  fine for the books but in a science fiction adventure movie      what happened to the weirding way and the weirding modules    seems the director wants the audience to stare at each scene three times longer than necessary    there were some cool battle scenes but only at the very end    im calling it                                           dull part two
Mar 3 2024,positive,thrilling and epic follow up to the 2021 scifi thriller eager to see what happens next
Mar 3 2024,positive,as soon as you put the book out of your mind you can enjoy it as a movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,great story line and acting
Mar 3 2024,positive,great action beautiful desert scenery fabulous acting and directing
Mar 3 2024,positive,even though its not 100 true to the book or frank herberts vision its close enough and both visually  contextually stunning well done
Mar 3 2024,positive,one of the greatest scifi movies of all time the visuals the soundtrack i felt at different times happy sad anxious shocked scared  every single emotion you want to feel at the movies i felt the escape every single cast member delivered exceptional performances regardless of the size of the role part one was beautiful and engaging but it was a little confusing for those not already familiar with the storyand a little slow hoeven it built the structure for the absolute spectacle of part 2 and i will be waiting on pins and needles for part 3 denis villeneuve is on track to create possibly the superlative saga that has blessed the silver screen
Mar 3 2024,positive,this movie was amazing it makes the output released by marveldisney the past few years look even more embarrassing especially with the amount of money they spent i felt like i was visiting a real world and place the cinematography was beautiful the score impactful the entire cast solid the story took its time while being engaging i wasnt totally sold on timothee chalamet and zendaya in dune part 1 but was pleasantly surprised with their work in dune 2 the practical and cgi effects were believable and not overthetop and served the story i actually liked the changes they made to chani and lady jessica and thought it enhanced the story i felt overall denis villeneuve made a fairly faithful adaptation keeping to the main themes of the book my only tiny gripe is i would have liked a little longer final battle and ending part in general felt slightly rushed however those are very minor complaints to an otherwise fantastic movie that will take its place in my top scifi movies of all time like alien blade runner star wars the empire strikes back and 2001 a space odyssey this is a mustwatch on the biggest screen you can find i saw this in imax and i already want to go back to see it a 2nd time
Mar 3 2024,negative,i was really looking forward to this movie after the glorious first part sadly it failed to enthral the sweeping visuals were stunning but the pace seemed somehow to be too slow and too fast at the same time lengthy scenes with little dialogue as paul goes from being neophyte warrior to elite fedaykin and acknowledged messiah so fast his unborn sister remains in the womb the whole time and his son with chani never has time to appear let alone be born      the dull palette of colours used on every single planet became tiresome my partner gave up pretending and fell asleep at several points and i was tempted to do the same the end of the film as paul gains revenge for the destruction of his father and house atriedes should have stirred some emotions but it didnt and we left the cinema feeling deflated
Mar 3 2024,positive,good movie overall but wasnt better than part 1
Mar 3 2024,positive,the movie was awesome the action sequences were very well made and taken although the movie is long i never felt bored or zoned out at any part of the movie some parts of the movies looked like they were cut out as they suddenly transition to another part of the story but still a must watch in theater i watched it in amc dolby and it was worth it
Mar 3 2024,positive,good movie but over hyped from what people are saying  if your looking for action might want to find a different movie cause its only in the last 45 min
Mar 3 2024,positive,truly amazing movie superb acting 3 hours and i wanted more
Mar 3 2024,positive,beautiful sound and visuals great performances did not feel like 3 hours im obsessed this proves that dune could be adapted
Mar 3 2024,positive,i liked the movie but as someone who has read the dune books many times i will reserve my unhappiness with the film to just one thing chani did not get mad ride off
Mar 3 2024,negative,totally screwed up every major plot line going forward made paul nothing but an angry kid out for revenge even after what should have been major turning points well mad move that destroyed the plot and development
Mar 3 2024,positive,the best thing ive seen in the theaters in the past few years please continue on with the good work villaneuve
Mar 3 2024,positive,so glad this was the movie i chose to see my first trip back to the theater and it didnt disappoint this is what i love to see
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune 2 leaves off where the evil harkonnen just flattened the house atreides quarters in the last act we are left with a very weak opponent in a dismal 4 of atreideans scrounging for food and shelter in an already deadly desert paul and his mother eventually find forgiving freman and the story pushes forward if you liked dune 1 for its brutal and unforgiving clashes between atreideans and harkonnen this sequel doesnt disappoint in the least bit it goes deeper into the lore of what a freman really is youll see friction between different groups among them youll see how they house the water of the dead in secret seeches tunnels and the trust or lack thereof between paul and his mother and the freman were introduced with the barons psychotic nephew a welcome treat especially in the end and the whole reason why the harkonnens destroyed the atreideans while in arakis i know im going full geek here so ill say this its a phenomenal movie its not perfect though i think part 1 checkmarked every weakness in the telling of the initial story but part 2 does leave you with some irksome questions some scenes where paul accepts a potion water of life that gives people like paul and his mother a bene geserit simply a witch that can foretell futures almost infinite powers through time it is a bit rushed and were left to just accept his transformation to rule this was crushing to me and i hope they can release an uncut version of his growth in the future other than that holy cow is this film beautiful it is slow the first hour or so so be aware of that usually when a movie attempts this its not that they dont know this its that they want audiences to become completely immersed in the world these characters live in the score is godly the visuals again just sinfully perfect and the ambience it generates is sublime we are witnessing a star warslike event here with these movies like lord of the rings after it i feel the dune series to be refreshing since so many movies the past two years have failed miserably score 9510
Mar 3 2024,positive,i was left in my seat utterly speechless this was a fantastic sequel and movie all around  you have to see this movie on the big screen and enjoy it as an experience cinema is back
Mar 3 2024,positive,same as before but better an every way
Mar 3 2024,positive,absolutely loved this film im a sucker for the book and this movie delivered on what i expected there were some bug character changes but im curious to see where they will go i was on the fence when i heard walken was playing the emperor but he did a great job

Mar 3 2024,positive,wouldve given it 5 stars based off of the first 75 of the movie but the end strayed enough of the way from the book that it affected how magnificent the climax couldve been whats sad is that it didnt seem necessary nor did it add to the story because the source content is excellent the end felt rushed and disappointed me
Mar 3 2024,positive,boring almost nothing like the book acting was good
Mar 3 2024,positive,part two continues to follow frank herberts wonderful books beautifully we recommend rewatching the first part before watching this second part it picks up exactly where part one left off but could be confusing to a newbie our only disappointment is that it is clear there will have to be a part three hope it wont take very long

Mar 3 2024,positive,films like this so rare these days  absolute masterpiece in cinematography music dialogue polictal tussel of this monumental universe 
Mar 3 2024,negative,unfortunately this movie should have been named dune part 2 sand and lullabies the scenes of blowing sands and orange skies along with the lilting lullaby music was melded to a perfected amalgamation of nap time bliss i have never in my time fallen asleep to a movie in a theater especially not one i was eagerly waiting for going to have to rewatch it with mass amounts of coffee and sleep in preparation
Mar 3 2024,positive,well done being familiar with the book or rewatching part 1 will make following the story easier

Mar 3 2024,positive,three hours felt like 90 minutes and i still wanted more of it this movie is visually stunning the sound effects had our theatre chairs shaking javier bardem is the real star of this movie providing fatherly advice with comic relief ill be watching this again and again
Mar 3 2024,positive,an overhyped 3 hours of sand dust fire and noise
Mar 3 2024,positive,builds beautifully on the first movie surpasses it and sets up perfectly for dune messiah even the parts that diverge from the book seem to have been done thoughtfully
Mar 3 2024,positive,just as intense as the first one  the action doesnt let up the sound and visuals are simply mind blowing we came to see giant worms and we were not disappointed already ran into other moviegoers at the chapters looking to buy the books im excited to see if house ordos appears in the next movies as i played dune as a child on the old 486 1010 try to watch in imax if you can

Mar 3 2024,positive,brilliant cinematography acting and score never really connected with the characters and felt that a lot of context was missing from certain events
Mar 3 2024,positive,fascinating and thrilling
Mar 3 2024,negative,what fucking 3 hour shitshow without sense or purpose such waste of zendaya is outright fucking criminal cake fucking suits suck

Mar 3 2024,positive,effects great  storyline understandable
Mar 3 2024,positive,lots of action and suspense
Mar 3 2024,negative,i found this boring very boring in fact it was so slow with so little happening

Mar 3 2024,negative,confusing storyline stunning visual effects ruined by overbearing sound effects  first film in years i was glad when it ended
Mar 3 2024,positive,good movie great acting especially by timothée chalamet couple weird story changes but not so far off the rails to screw it up sound and choreography great this will win some awards for sure
Mar 3 2024,positive,dune part 2 is the type of movie that reminds you why the imax experience exist  you do not just watch this movie you experience it the visual storytelling is on another level and it must be experienced in imax with its visual and audio fidelity
Mar 3 2024,positive,what cinema should strive to be the vision is magnificent at times unbelievable kickstarts a great 3rd movie and what i foresee future spinoffs
Mar 3 2024,positive,although the middle act felt summarizedrushed it was still an amazing movie

Mar 2 2024,positive,loved it interesting going into the history of the family epic film
Mar 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie however i am afraid of what part three might be about i feel as there should have been more information to the deal of the birth and life of the bela jas rein the mother of paul
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was a masterpiece from start to finish one of the best things ive seen in years if you have the opportunity to see it in imax do it
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic scope stacked cast strong performances this leaves me wondering if this is the end of the film adaptations of frank herberts classic our will there be more the door certainly seems to be open
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely mesmerising powerful beautiful and definitely epic   watch it again and again
Mar 2 2024,positive,i love the casting and the pacing of this movie it delivers the story and keeps you engaged i was not disappointed
Mar 2 2024,positive,saw it at the regal stonecrest at piper glen theater the movie was amazing but the superoverblown bass vibrating the seats was way too much we were sick of it before the previews were done turn that nonsense off it makes me want to avoid that theater
Mar 2 2024,positive,visceral deep imaginative thrilling
Mar 2 2024,positive,outstanding it made me read the books and thats impressive cause i dont read books by the way the final scene without spoilers i literally lost my breath so watch its worth it
Mar 2 2024,positive,super fun youll want to make sure youve watched dune 1 recently but this movies good
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterpiece villeneuve is the man
Mar 2 2024,positive,if you have read the book you will be rather annoyed with the meaningful diversions in characters motivation although the action is in line with the books if you have not you will likely enjoy the film a great deal i suspect the changes make it hard for people who know the book to enjoy it as much as they would have liked  were they made to fit the long book into a movie length story that would be understandable but they are merely taking the story in a different direction
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie was so so it had some fun moments but couldshould have been cut by an hour it seemed to drag along at times the real problem was that the amc theater showed 40 minutes of previews before the movie 40 minutes i have never walked out on a movie before it began but i was ready to this time amc you really ruined our experience 40 minutes to show previews and tell us how wonderful and special you are is at least 30 minutes too many
Mar 2 2024,positive,its perfection epic in every way
Mar 2 2024,positive,just saw dune 2 i was absolutely blown away exceeded my expectations all the way every star in this film brings it 10000 timothee and zendaya excel in this and austin brings his a game in this film as the dark prince feyd rautha he stole the show in every scene he is in he is terrifying in this javier bardem and josh brolin are great on camera together rebecca ferguson is phenomenal as lady jessica everyone is top notch this film is the cast of a lifetime casts and films like dune 2 dont come along very often anymore this film is made up of the biggest stars in hollywood highly recommend this movie true sci fi masterpiece this film is a true cinematic experience go see dune 2 today definitely seeing this again amazing work denis villeneuve
Mar 2 2024,positive,the perfect sequel it is one of the rare gems that significantly improves on the first installment our generations empire strikes back
Mar 2 2024,positive,spectacular movie i was so impressed with the visuals effects great writing and acting a real masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,a complete masterpiece and excellent sequel to the first dune movie the cinematography and score are immersive well written and allow for the story to be told in such a magnificent way dune part 2 will go down as one of the greats
Mar 2 2024,negative,movie was slow at the start and dragged on good special effects but not as good as madmax by far dune 3 will be out for sure as the ending shows that
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing loved it this movie was epic and did not disappoint i loved everything from the cinematography the music my man hans zimmer smashed it the acting was amazing great performance from all the cast particularly loved austin butlers performance 1010 i hope we get a part 3 i would highly recommend that this film is seen at the cinema it was a work of art duneparttwo review filmreview cinema austinbutler tchalamet florencepugh zendaya hanszimmer masterpiece

Mar 2 2024,positive,epic  loved every minute wish it didnt end cant wait for dune messiah and children of dune
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is artwork must see exhilarating from start to end  timothee is oscar worthy
Mar 2 2024,positive,a worthy sequel for the ages dune part 2 will leave a lasting impression on fans of the original novels and fans of scifi in general see it on the biggest screen possible
Mar 2 2024,positive,i literally created an account here just to review this movie that is how much it impacted me   this is by far the best cinematic experience ive ever had i had chills during the entirety of the it and sometimes i wanted to cry because of how good it was everything about it is perfect the cinematography the score the acting the pacing not one minute is wasted not one second feels boring i could not take my eyes off the screen at any time i wish i could drink this movie bathe in it inject it into my veins
Mar 2 2024,positive,on the edge of my seat the whole movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic a work of art
Mar 2 2024,positive,still a few issues some carried over from part one and some new holding it back from perfection but this is an epic production only let down by some minor pacing and script issues score and sound design are once again astounding with visuals and themes just as compelling how denis managed to make this cautionary tale even more foreboding than the source material is a wonder performances are brilliant cinematography spectacular and vfx mostly flawless bring on messiah
Mar 2 2024,positive,perfect perfect film genius adaptation i cant imagine it done any better
Mar 2 2024,positive,i loved the first but this takes it to a whole new level absolutely gorgeous and such great character and storytelling highly recommend
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic film will vie for best picture cinematography set design soundtrack and more
Mar 2 2024,positive,great story and both the casting and acting was terrific
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two is a fantastic followup to the first and was a much more gripping and exciting chapter in this story although it felt like there was something missing to take it to the next level that being the highest level 455
Mar 2 2024,positive,need a movie about the harkonnen
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was epic you have to to see in the cinema and imax if you can because it just hits on another level
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic dune experience hoping to catch this on imax as well
Mar 2 2024,negative,boring they had lost the majestic feeling of the first part pauls and chanis love story felt forced and awkward zendaya does not seem to be very talented actress mainly one sour expression on her face all the time all worth seeing happens in the last 30 mins of the movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,its rare for almost three hours to pass by and find yourself back on earth and not wanting to leave the theater  what a trip part two was
Mar 2 2024,positive,unbelievable sequel to a fantastic movie loved austin butlers performance could barely even tell it was him zendaya and timothée were great as expected i was also mostly interested in how christopher walken would be as a villain and im glad he was better than i expected and a great story too great film
Mar 2 2024,negative,long and boring  the sound level at the imax theatre was so loud i was afraid my phone warning system would go off  the main characters were not engaging and timothy cs character very self important  meh
Mar 2 2024,negative,the watch really got hard after the midpoint in the movie the directors didnt bring true value of emotion to the table in my opinion i was on the edge on dune 1 but that was not it
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing visually and sonically
Mar 2 2024,positive,if a movie comes out and you have to look for the tiniest of problems and you find none whatsoever then you have a juggernaut on your hands this experience is flawless and brought my love of the theater back in full force    this movies probably the greatest epic i have seen in the theaters since lord of the rings with a storyline akin to the best years of got and a scifi world that captivates you the way star wars first did all those many years ago    see it on the biggest screen you can not even kidding dbox imax dolbyyou can thank me later  its breathtakingly epic and borderline overwhelming with a scale and intensity bursting out of literally every single scene some of the slow scenes just pummel your senses with scale and awe you cant look away and you can feel the film feeding on your senses and transporting you into a completely different world    a true modern masterpiece of film  it has all but confirmed my loveloss for modern day cheaply made superhero spectacles  it has made them all look like cheap childsplay in comparison    this is the film we have been waiting for folks  it has finally arrived  the new standard 
Mar 2 2024,positive,even though i havent read the books i still really enjoyed it its so well done from the acting to the sets to the music
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic probably the only film series ive seen that really follows the source material music is terrific and to see one of the greatest books series ive read presented so well visually with acting that also keeps close to the source material was both thrilling and chilling  must see even youre not a fan of science fiction  bring on dune part three
Mar 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed dune 2021 but it definitely felt like mostly setup and worldbuilding it even ends right when things are about to get interesting does dune part 2 deliver on all the setup    short answer yes the story is incredibly engaging and thoughtprovoking what makes dune so special is that it isnt just a typical revenge or good vs evil or chosen herotype story there is more to everything with very creative dilemmas that our main character has it does have the typical romance story in the first act but it is handled wonderfully and then used with great effectiveness afterwards the second and third acts are just phenomenal storytelling the director denis villeneuve just pulls you into this world and manages to deliver an emotional rollercoaster experience that will mesmerize you     on that note every actor is amazing timothée chalamet had to convince the audience that his character was becoming a frightening leader in part 2 and he absolutes excels zendaya is great and has excellent chemistry with timothée which makes their characters romance believable javier returns with more of a substantial role and he is magnificent he provides some levity to a very dark story but does it naturally compared to the forced humour that is thanks to mcu movies in terms of newcomers austin butler gives a very topnotch psychotic performance as feyd he felt like a frightening presence additionally christopher walken is a crazy casting for the emperor but he absolutely works all the returning actors continue to deliver terrific performances and newcomers such as florence are excellent additions    part 2 also has a lot more action set pieces these sequences are a lot better than the first movie as they are choreographed and shot more clearly the 3rd act has a very entertaining sequence and the final fight itself is an epic way to end greig fraser returns as the cinematographer and he might be one of the best since roger deakins every shot is just beautiful and really captures the world of dune perfectly hans zimmer also returns and he delivers more or less the same epic music score as the first film the set design is still gorgeous and the costumes are still as wonderful as ever    i only have minor nitpicks and that is the movie can feel a bit fast at times this is notable during the first act where it sort of breezes over pauls initial time with the fremen i also kind of wished the emperor and princess irulan had more appearances considering their vital roles the character thufir hawat from dune 2021 is also nowhere to be seen in part 2 despite his fate being unclear from the first film i honestly wouldnt have minded if this film had 15 more minutes to add these additional scenes     overall it is rare for a sequel to be this good but dune part 2 is one of the best sequels it delivers on everything the first movie setup while also being a stellar scifi film denis villeneuve is one of my favourite modern directors and i hope he gets to make that final dune movie that he wants i know i will 100 be there to watch it if it happens
Mar 2 2024,positive,i loved part 1 and if you did too then no doubt youll love part 2
Mar 2 2024,positive,visuals were amazing sound design was an auditory feast the story was beautifully told through great acting and remarkable scenes
Mar 2 2024,positive,i loved it it stayed very true to the books as far as possible i hope a third one is made the story is so vast and amazing
Mar 2 2024,positive,5 stars for sure just as good if not better
Mar 2 2024,positive,interesting changes to make the whole thing more digestible for general audiences without going too far to often the hardcore source materials fans
Mar 2 2024,neutral,dune part 2 has amazing cinematography and visual but i felt asleep at some points during both part 1  part 2  pacing is way too dragging and storyline is just average for me this movie is so overrated 
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is not for everyone its not a stand alone just show up and enjoy you have to know the backstory and premise it feels like its 4 hours long with spots of action in between long slow parts it has its cult following and thats the audience also its part 2 of an obvious part 3 on the way i saw the original way back when and it felt similar not even close to the best sci fi movie ever if you like interstellar or a space odyssey and you know the backstory of dune then this could be for you i felt like it could have been a made for tv miniseries
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent film another great edition to the saga
Mar 2 2024,positive,ofcousre it is expected that the movie was gorgeously filmed and visualized however i was most impressed with chalemets strong performance towards the conclusion as paul is accepting his destiny
Mar 2 2024,positive,with a phenomenal score and spectacular storytelling and visuals dune part 2 is an entertaining scifi film thanks to chalamets compelling performance and villeneuves direction
Mar 2 2024,positive,today i watched in dolby atmos and felt immersed in the story next saturday im watching in imax and i cant wait  best movie ive seen onscreen in decades decades
Mar 2 2024,positive,from the moment the film begins you are instantly pulled back into the world of arrakis and you pick right up seamlessly from the first film the cinematography is just as amazing as the first film i solid second film that will leave you wanting to sit through another 3 hours to see the house of atreidis reign supreme
Mar 2 2024,positive,movie was amazing a spectacular to watch acting was perfect never read the books and love the story
Mar 2 2024,positive,this was such an amazing followup on the previous movie it expanded the world in some very amazing ways and left me wanting so much more at the end whatever happened next in the story will be truly amazing lets go
Mar 2 2024,positive,this hit you so hard that youll forget youre watching a movie it immerses you so deeply the music is hauntingly beautiful and experience is thrilling im still reveling from the adrenaline 24hrs later 1010
Mar 2 2024,positive,id call it a great movie if it was its own source material     why do directors and writers feel the need to bendwarp a timeless story to a modern audience they obviously had someone read the book because to feels familiar to the story frank herbert wrote why couldnt they just follow the book or come up with their own story dont buy the rights to make a movie based off a book if you are going to make major changes to character relationships and motivations     if you made it this far it comes down to this good movie poor adaptation hopefully the next time around its adapted the writersdirectors read the source material more closely
Mar 2 2024,positive,a good movie but it did not do justice to the book  so much was left out and changed
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely gorgeous to watch on the imax loved it austin was amazing
Mar 2 2024,positive,it is just epic you can feel the gravity of the scenes and it is a great set up for a third movie i cant wait this movie is to a 100 denis villenueve empire strikes back

Mar 2 2024,positive,best movie ive watched by far it was filled with action all the way to the end the graphics and the cinematic scenes were great and i would recommend to watch u will not be disappointed
Mar 2 2024,negative,watching this is like having a fever dream story feels disconected bad guys are made in such way that they are evil just for sake of being evil   choreography was just funny as if i were watching children play fighting  except for general vibe of desert scenes this movie is just boring  imma put it on when i wanna fall asleep fast 
Mar 2 2024,positive,a moment in cinema we can all enjoy a masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic picture great pace awesome acting the story really got me pumped zandaya was a bad motha    overall best movie 2024 so far 
Mar 2 2024,positive,as a fan of the herberts books i am so pleased that the creator of this film is someone who shares that love and that is what this film is  a labor of love masterful cinematography an unforgettable score by hans zimmer an exciting cast flawlessly combined to produce the best scifi film since the empire strikes back
Mar 2 2024,positive,saw it in imax and it was visually stunning definitely seeing it again
Mar 2 2024,positive,good movie  not so much scifi as fantasy also  too long  worm riding was cool though
Mar 2 2024,positive,very well done part two of the dune series
Mar 2 2024,positive,with amazing photography and soundtrack dune 2 is a mustsee at the cinema it can run a little long but the acting and visuals keep you immersed in this universe
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing a must see in dolby the sound and visuals were off the charts but the story was incredible after seeing zune 1 with that ending i was hooked but this time around i am absolutely going bonkers to see how they are going to end this incredible story in zune 3 cant wait
Mar 2 2024,positive,cinematography was exquisite story compelling and acting was great just phenomenal i cant way for part iii
Mar 2 2024,negative,this is the worst movie ive seen in a very long time  if you think this is any good you need to get yourself checked out  chalamet is an awful actor and over does it constantly in this garbage movie  everyone else was ok  this almost put me to sleep  id rather watch paint dry then watch this garbage again
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was a really sensational and very well made liveaction science fiction movie sequel it had really flawless special effects really brilliant cinematography really marvelous cast really wondrous characters really amazing action really incredible humor really fantastic drama really awesome adventure really phenomenal music really well done costumes really splendid makeup really cool sets really wonderful visuals and a really captivating story in my opinion i think its going to be one of 2024s best movies ive ever saw in the kingsized imax format in my whole life i strongly recommend this film to scifi fans of all ages
Mar 2 2024,positive,i cannot articulate how much i love this movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,too slow very dry movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,i was impressed with dune 1 and was looking forward to dune 2 unfortunately it didnt live up to the first one the movie dragged on with war scenes they have a laser that slices through the spice excavators but then they use knives to attack the enemy on a scale less intelligent then a civil war battle stay tuned to doomed 3 theyre going to have a space battle just like star wars may the farce be with you
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen from the character building cinematography storyline
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie is a cinematic masterpiece i dont know what to say its just awesome you should definatly watch it in the thatre it realy adds up
Mar 2 2024,positive,if you are someone who was hyped for dune 2 it delivers this film not only has great world building arguably better than its predecessor but also it has great character building the cinematography is no joke each scene is a spectacle made to be seen on the big screen the performances are amazing timothy chalamé is amazing as paul or ursul zendaya guves her performance of a lifetime for sure an oscar worthy performance but the real star of the show to me was austin butler as nabaron no matter what sort of a24 movie or martin scorse type film comes out this year austin butler gave the best  supporting actor performance of 2024 end of story the direction of this film is so powerful as you can feel the amount of thought put into each scene my one con of the film is there are a few things sprinkled throughout that are just plain old dumb for example spoilers the reason the emperor gives to paul for killing his father and his people felt very weak like he sent out his whole army to kill the duke of arrakis because he felt like the duke was a weak man like what anyway this is a must watch in theatersoverall 9510 wb make dune 3 as soon as possible please
Mar 2 2024,positive,great special effects on a grand scale  the story moves along quickly among the various characters  looking forward to part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the most ambitious movies youll ever see every shot is breathtaking and thought out the best actor in this movie is whoever the camera is on
Mar 2 2024,positive,legendaryone of the best films of 24 its indeed was worth the wait duneparttwo
Mar 2 2024,positive,so good had to watch it a second time in imax  epic
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was gooooooood acting visuals storyline they did a ridiculous job
Mar 2 2024,positive,i enjoy how theyre weaving in the relationships with the main characters
Mar 2 2024,positive,let me preface this review by stating that ive read all six of herberts dune books and dig them hard not bragging because who brags about reading books except losers just giving an honest take     so i took my girl to see part 2 who has neither seen the first movie nor read the books and heres the deal folks   there are three types of people going to see this movie     1 first time seeingexperiencing dune narrative  2 saw the first villeneuve dune film a few years ago  3 read the books       if you are in the 1 camp good luck fam youll have no idea whats going on and will have severe difficulty appreciating the plot line    if youre in the camp of 2 youll probably love it and gas it up like youre a dune junkie and act like you know whats going on but you wont youre just a groupie imo     which leads me to the third camp 3 as an avid frank hebert fan this film was perfect it actually followed the plot of the novel much more closely than his first film and when coupled with the incredible imagery and film score thank you christopher nolan and hans zimmer i cant deny that i was cheesing with delight the entire 3 hours     suffice to say this film is an absolute gem but only for the correct crowd dont look on rotten tomato ratings 94 and go see this just because it got a 94 you will be disappointed unless you have a grasp on the storyline preferably having read the first book
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best cinematic experiences ive ever had
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing i cant wait for the third
Mar 2 2024,positive,mediocre at best  even though it was long it felt like the director just threw a lot of scenes together the hope of it being a coherent whole    i thought part 2 was worse than part 1  and tbh the more i reflect on the story telling and characters the more i realize why tolkien thought dune was a bad book
Mar 2 2024,positive,i was very disappointed in the ending left so much up in the air for the life of me i dont know why this movie was remade i havent read the book maybe the idea was to follow the book more closely maybe in 3 years there will be a part 3 to answer my questions
Mar 2 2024,positive,i am an avid dune reader and i loved the movie dune part two so well cast and the special effects were phenomenal
Mar 2 2024,positive,wonderful film while the runtime felt slightly longer than the first film it was a great cinematic experience it was visually stunning and the sound was excellent this movie is meant to be seen on an imax screen its better than part 1 but only slightly the acting was impressive and i especially loved seeing some of the bigger blockbuster actors playing smaller parts and demonstrating some range
Mar 2 2024,positive,simply outstanding
Mar 2 2024,positive,i loved the first part but this easily topped that everyone involved at the top of their game and this is easily in my top 10 films of all time possibly even top 5 well be talking about this film in generations to come
Mar 2 2024,positive,most epic movie ive ever seen
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellentjaw dropping cinematography is amazing and the story is 
Mar 2 2024,positive,what an epic and cinematic movie  loved it  need to experience it in dolby or imax
Mar 2 2024,positive,movie starts off very well at times it then becomes monotonous unless youve seen or read the books it lost its ability to be a live action entertaining movie when the mother starts talking to the newborn baby and nobody can figure out who belongs to which family
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie is a treat in every aspect just breath taking cant wait to watch it again and again and again
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved the acting cinematography musical score and kept our attention   need to keep track of first story a bit
Mar 2 2024,negative,so boring scenes are inconsistent and the story makes no sense there is really no explanation how anything works its a movie that if you dont think about is ok but if you think at all about things you realize is actually very dumb
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was fantastic visual effects were really really good acting was good as well i honestly found nothing wrong with it whatsoever
Mar 2 2024,positive,omgi have no words to say about this movie but one word that im definitely going to say is masterpiece that it
Mar 2 2024,positive,great pace solid acting excellent special effects and beautiful cinematography  i will see it again  well worth the wait
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie dune part 2its 2 hrs36 mins like the storyline
Mar 2 2024,positive,awesome lives up to the hype
Mar 2 2024,positive,word of mouth people word of mouth spread the word dune 2 is a cinematic masterpiece that will transport you to the spice flowing desert planet of arrakis and more from the first shot to the last the world building feel so natural and intuitive we get to spend a lot of silent and intimate moments in between moments with all the characters because of which the big moments feel like they were earned not given the dialogues are simple regarding the religious themes and ideas of the fremen culture so if you listen and follow carefully it will all make sense every single department of dune 2 has given us the cinema fans and the film industry a masterclass in filmmaking   dune part two is a 2 hour and 46 minutes of cinematic masterclass
Mar 2 2024,positive,the film was absolutely phenomenal from the visuals the story the acting and the musical score this movie definitely solidified chalamet zendaya butler and pugh futures in the acting industry
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterpiece much better than the return of the king
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is one of the best movies ive ever seen   the sound the music the pictures the story everything was at a nearly perfect level im definitly going to watch it a second time in the cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,my family enjoyed this movie especially when mahidi rode the worm and then when they called the worms
Mar 2 2024,positive,just a beautiful cimamatic movie that did justice to the original book
Mar 2 2024,positive,very well done  excellent movie  i highly suggest you see it in an imax
Mar 2 2024,positive,while i do have slight nitpicks with the film this is an overall fantastic cinematic achievement it builds on everything that made the first film such a marvel and results in a scifi epic that puts most other blockbusters nowadays to shame  full review youtube9h00c68bkrgsiadvxlw5w2jt3efm
Mar 2 2024,positive,this has to b one of the best movies of the century this goes on my top 5 list of best movies 1010
Mar 2 2024,positive,so good ive booked to see it again
Mar 2 2024,negative,way to take a great story amd utterly screw it up in nonsensical ways
Mar 2 2024,positive,best movie of the decade going to see it again soon amazing performances all around the vfx show how cgi should be used and the plot makes it feel a lot shorter than 3 hours anyone who was maybe bored at the lack of action in part 1 will have no such complaint for this    and for anyone wondering yes you do have to see part 1 to understand whats going on
Mar 2 2024,positive,i truly believe that this is the best movie of all time perfect and completely flawless in my opinion the cinematography perfect the acting perfect the sound design perfect the fight scenes choreography spaceships story absolutely perfect flawless i dare say
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved it 
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie took time to develop story and also provide details which will lead to a part 3  did t just let the good guy win leaves you wanting more really excited to see where they take it
Mar 2 2024,positive,terrific production and visual effects extremely entertaining movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,couldnt wait for this movie to come out and it did not disappoint loved it  will watch it over and over
Mar 2 2024,positive,great sequel  excellent set pieces  amazing sound  a cinematic experience that must be seen in imax  demerits for the emperor walken  he was fine but wish he would not have been so much himself
Mar 2 2024,positive,a potent pitcher of highend modern spectacle poured into poetic cinema a surething for anyone who enjoyed part one great film
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was really good start to finished so a good build up and character archsi will probably try to see it again before e it leaves theaters 5 out of 5 easily
Mar 2 2024,positive,theres nothing like dune part two which feels like it could only be conceived by denis villeneuve and the best possible crew around him everyone is working at the top of their game to create one of the best theatergoing experiences of 2024    full review 
Mar 2 2024,negative,i do not like subtitles it was boring  no plot  my husband i walked out after an hour special effects were practically nonexistent i dont know how anyone could have rated this as one of the best scifi movies ever
Mar 2 2024,positive,definitely worth the wait great visuals and a story told in an exciting way with some great acting even had me thinking of life of brian in places
Mar 2 2024,positive,enthralling i was on the edge of my seat during some scenes excellent acting phenomenal effects planning to try and see it again in theaters
Mar 2 2024,positive,fantastic flick denis villeneuve is the chosen one
Mar 2 2024,positive,round 3 imax was just on another level this is the movie to watch cause it will only age with grace and still be amazing each watch
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved the ending maybe there is a part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two was by far the best science fiction film ive ever watched the thing about dune based on the novel by frank herbert is that director denis villeneuve knows how to tell a story and he did that with dune part two the world that he created for the film arrakis was visually stunning to the audience the cast was amazing particularly timothee chalamet and zendaya and javier bardem was really good as stilgar overall dune part two took frank herberts novel dune and he created an unattainable story 10 out of 10 epic scenes with the sandworms and the battle sequences throughout the film would recommend it loved the book and loved the second half of dune a mustwatched masterpiece of storytelling and world building
Mar 2 2024,neutral,all dune movies are slow and depressing   one long pity party   i prefere star wars and star trek types of sci fi movies   outer space movies yes dune movies no   walked out at the two hour mark    oh well
Mar 2 2024,positive,spectacular if you told me movie theatres were made just so we could see this movie i would believe it
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is now my favorite movie ever the story is inspiring the visuals are out of this world and the music ohh the music thank you denis villeneuve jespère vraiment que tu aura ton oscar tu le mérites plus que tout
Mar 2 2024,positive,part 2 further expands on the tapestry presented in the first this is brilliant
Mar 2 2024,positive,i liked the war and the sandstorm
Mar 2 2024,positive,a stunning second chapter that will surely earn some oscar nods  not having a familiarity with the source material i was expecting a more satisfying conclusion      must be seen in a theater to be a appreciated
Mar 2 2024,positive,if you are a fan of the novel andor enjoyed part one guaranteed youll love this one i think youll get actual chills if not you may find some parts of the film to drag a bit or seem rather opaque but there is still a lot to enjoy i would think  theres a lot more action with less to set up  i really hope this does well enough to bring us dune messiah at the least villeneuve really really gets the source material such that he really portrays the spirit and themes in a way well suited for cinema  it feels 100 accurate to the novel even though this is certainly not literally the case i was annoyed for example by many of the unnecessary and jarring changes made by peter jackson et al to the middleearth films but villeneuves dune just sings
Mar 2 2024,positive,i am sure that the people that have not read the books will love this movie as for people that have read the books myself included  they will probably be disappointed by many areas that were emphasized to get a young audience rating the ending left a lot to be desired based on the book
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely breathtaking from the moment the film stated to the moment the credits rolled i cant wait to experience dune  chapter 2 once again
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is by far the best science fiction movie of this millennium i will preface that if you did not like the first movie you probably wont like this the story is very overarching with cuts to scenes that dont follow paul or the freman the story may be confusing if youre not fully invested in the story however this feels like cinema the performance of the cast is incredible the visuals and sound design are at a level that i havent ever seen i could go on with how much i love this film but ill stop here go see this film because this is a cinema and if this doesnt win the 2025 best picture will go down in one of the biggest upsets in awards history
Mar 2 2024,negative,very disapointing the movie was slow and major changes done to the original material felt unnescessary
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie love the story and special effects
Mar 2 2024,positive,this a movie for the agessure to be one of the best movies of the year as well as one of the best scifi films ever and one of the best sequels ever produced its a zenith of genre filmmaking    its epic its massive its gorgeous its thrilling technically its perfectthe stunts the sound the special effects it ups the ante over the first movie which i love on almost every level    denis villenueve cements himself as one of the greatest working directors and one of the greatest genre filmmakers everright up there with spielberg lucas and nolan
Mar 2 2024,positive,exceptional follow upi have no noteswe all loved every minute  its the empire strikes back of our time
Mar 2 2024,positive,great visuals with near flawless effects some weird narrative choices with pauls sister and chani
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent story drags just a bit in the middle helps to have read the books the ending was superb unlike oppenheimer
Mar 2 2024,positive,just a great movie i dont have the words that would do it justice highly recommend
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing pacing visuals storyline plot everything
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie the word epic doesnt do it justice see it on the big screen if you can
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic and dynamic best theater sound ive ever heard  period
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two was ok austin butler made it better it was way too long of a movie  not one id buy for keeps
Mar 2 2024,positive,they wasnt lyin phenomenal film
Mar 2 2024,positive,an amazing movie one of the best i have ever seen
Mar 2 2024,positive,simply an amazing piece of art even if you are not a sci fi fan i feel like i was transported into a different world and was on edge the whole time i didnt want it to end i could watch this for 5 hours and still not be bored just go watch it in theatre 
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie not one of the greatest like some critics are saying comparing to lord of the rings and others but still a great movie 55
Mar 2 2024,positive,talented brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular never the same totally unique completely not ever been done before unafraid to reference or not reference put it in a blender sht on it vomit on it eat it give birth to it
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece the experience of a lifetime in the theater no weak points a completely immersive movie in every way
Mar 2 2024,positive,phenomenal movie with all star cast  plot  was true to the original exceptional cinematography  long movie but well worth it
Mar 2 2024,positive,movie was awesome but imax picture quality was terrible and jittery at times
Mar 2 2024,positive,very good well directed very action good story line entertainment to the end
Mar 2 2024,positive,a few major differences from the book but wow what a movie i didnt want it to end i will see this film at least 5 times at the theater cause that is where this movie needs to be seen a triumph
Mar 2 2024,positive,as someone who knows the whole story i wasnt troubled by the changes because some of what didnt end up in part 2 will almost certainly be in part 3 some of the other changes were interesting i dont know if they were necessary but my partner who doesnt know anything about dune was intrigued so it will probably work on the general audience but for me i dont mind changes in adaptations the movie is as good as the first if you find yourself disappointed thats a youproblem
Mar 2 2024,positive,visually and sonically amazing plot is good and interesting saw in imax very worthwhile
Mar 2 2024,positive,if there is one word to describe this movie is perfection from the visual effects to the story line itself is a masterpiece by none other than director dennis villeneuve liked everything about this film
Mar 2 2024,positive,uauuujust uauuu blow me away what a moviegasm
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was really great i cant wait for the next one 
Mar 2 2024,positive,a very pleasurable cocktail    dune part two is an unmissable experience weaving together war drama and captivating worm encounters into a thrilling narrative     denis villeneuve has made sure that it works as a therapy for the eyes with each frame so well crafted hans zimmers mesmerizing background score enhances the viewing experience  also complementing the stunning visuals  grand landscapes the action sequences are improved compared to the first part  are surely more intense    timothée chalamet zendaya  the other cast deliver their bloody best the chemistry of the main lead adds depth to the storyline     with its immersive worldbuilding and flawless execution it is definitely a largerthanlife experience that demands to be seen only on the big screen cant wait for part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,i was riveted by the tension and action beautiful cinematography as expected and the music never fails i just started reading the book and enjoy the changes the movies made both mediums have their value the first part established atmosphere and this movie took off with action and character absolutely a wonderful movie the sound mixing is incredible and i love how the design team crafted the fremen technologies violent but not gratuitous highly recommend
Mar 2 2024,positive,a masterclass continuing to raise the bar in all aspects of cinema this series feels like this generations lord of the rings and was amazing in imax most changes from the book made total sense
Mar 2 2024,positive,the best film i have seen in a long time i was on the edge of my seat for 25 hours  the film exudes power i will watch this film again many times i know that
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen
Mar 2 2024,positive,stunning visuals awesome sound score and excellent acting make this every bit the equal of dune part one although spoiler alert the plot line is condensed somewhat meandering and  at least in the end  veers away from the book it sets up part three  as well as giving increased agency to a female character that was not as prominent in the book some may look unfavorably on this i know i was a taken back at first blush but i understand the directors reasoning and it does really set up tension for part three i was going to say the last movie but herbert wrote several not as good imho sequels and i could see this turning into a series of movie sequels albeit sooner or later with a new cast of characters   timothée chalamet finally finally captures the essence of paul  after futile efforts in earlier versions that is what makes this movie as well as the previous one really work and a tip of the hat to the director tremendous vision
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part 2 does alot more to explore the culture and characters that were the focus in part 1    its where it succeeds it starts of plots that we see until the very end which wasnt apparent in part 1    the action is top notch and adds to the suspense the dialogue and acting weve seen in the previous movie where the movie lacks is a plot that still feels like prior knowledge to the dune books would get most of your enjoyment alongside how corny some of the dialogue comes across which clearly wanted to sound more epic    im loving the cast who have invested more into their characters standout performances by timothée chalamet florence pugh and javier bardwm the cast did great and although some of the acting wasnt that good it didnt ruin their performances    its an improvement over part 1 it ended on a better note where i felt interested in whats to come and only the beginning act started to drag its an enriched movie where im sure theyll be more stories to tell in the future
Mar 2 2024,positive,less true to the novel than the first movie was but in mostly ways that really made the experience shine not as reliant on understanding the lore as the first phenomenally well done acting choreography and music
Mar 2 2024,positive,i didnt watch dune part 1 when it came out and was lucky enough that my local theatervue kerkrade the netherlands was running a marathon of dune part one and two back to back     and let me tell you it was worth it the movies are truly able to captivate the viewer and make them forget that time is actually passing by those 5 and a half hours passed by so quickly it almost felt like only 2 hours the story and characters are well written and the special effects are truly stunning this is a must watch for anyone that even remotely enjoys scifi stories
Mar 2 2024,positive,a dream come true i could not have possibly hoped for a better adaptation
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely stunning visually and audibly made no  sense of the 1984 story have never read the books but this is easy to follow and beautifully made
Mar 2 2024,positive,extraordinary adaptation top tier across the board
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterpiece of the sand
Mar 2 2024,positive,incredible film from the acting to the score seeing it in imax was a mindblowing experience
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinematography great story dune part two serves its purpose by give house atreides its honor and giving freemen there lisan al gaib   but comparing to its dune part one it lacks the curiosity   moreover there are where it gets slow and sleeps took over you nevertheless its a good movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,been waiting for dunes second chapter and yes it was well worth the wait what a great sequal i really could not pick anything bad out of the movie visuals and story line was on point just when i started to settle into the movie another scene to put me on edge starts dune part 2 will keep you going start to end and now im back at the cant wait to see whats next
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely blown after once again by this amazing movie series the cinematography and cgi are out of this world or should i say dune
Mar 2 2024,positive,flawless long live the fighters long live scifi cinema 1010 
Mar 2 2024,positive,spectacular thrilling and amazing what going to the movies is all about
Mar 2 2024,positive,was even better than part one really enjoyable experience in theatre
Mar 2 2024,positive,top tier cinema here imax really enhances the experience and finally not used as a gimmick loved all of it
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two explodes onto the scene exceeding expectations with its grander scale and emotional depth villeneuve masterfully crafts a visually stunning experience building upon the world he meticulously established in the first film the action sequences are breathtaking seamlessly blending practical effects and cgi    paul atreides and chanis bond intensifies adding layers to their internal conflicts supporting characters like lady jessica and stilgar shine further enriching the narrative while the near 3hour runtime might deter some and newcomers may struggle with the complex plot dune part two is a triumphant return to arrakis offering a thoughtprovoking exploration of power destiny and the consequences of ambition fans of the first film and scifi epics will find this a mustsee
Mar 2 2024,negative,waste of time nothing like book or first move and they set it up for 3rd movie thats 3 hours ill never get back
Mar 2 2024,positive,everyone involved in this project brought their absolute a game not agame a the actors are absolutely at their peaks with austin butler timothee chalamet zendaya javier bardem and rebecca ferguson delivering gripping performances villenueves vision is realized and defined so well that you cant help but be pulled into the world and story he crafts the visuals alone are worth the price of admission and the fight scenes are extremely well done this is how cgi should be used in modern cinema i cannot emphasize to watch this on the biggest screen possible
Mar 2 2024,positive,the kwisatz haderach is longawaited a seed planted many generations ago the tale of arrakis and its spice is told with fluidity gravitas and epic action politics and manipulation over millennia are coming to fruition    if you have not seen part one watch it before this one the actors and actresses gave terrific performances this is a moment like the one we experienced with the lord of the rings be a part of the experience and enjoy the return to epic moving going
Mar 2 2024,positive,words cant say anything  the masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,the best movie i have ever seen hands down
Mar 2 2024,positive,a master class in cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,just not my kind of movie but the visual affects were out of this world
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was the best film ive seen in years
Mar 2 2024,positive,the first movie took about an hour to really get going part 2 does not have this problem and is fantastic from beginning to end this is the best movie i have seen in years
Mar 2 2024,positive,a stunning breathtaking and emotional movie literally one of the greatest scifi movies ever made great cinematography writing and performances and of course zimmers incredible score diehards may be a bit irked by the liberties villeneuve took with the ending among other things but clearly it was a setup for dune messiah and didnt take away much from the overall story
Mar 2 2024,negative,the acting and visuals are wonderful but the director was so devoted to doing his version he turned it into fanfic the story sucked
Mar 2 2024,positive,i thought it was great action packed
Mar 2 2024,positive,visual perfection everything was a marvel and i genuinely cannot wait to see the next one but alas im given no other choice but to wait im stunned at how herberts dune was so skillfully turned into cinema and a masterpiece at that
Mar 2 2024,positive,have absolutely no complaints
Mar 2 2024,positive,i feel so lucky to have watched this movie in the cinema denis villeneuve has truly accomplished a magnificent job the visual effects performances and storytelling were amazing
Mar 2 2024,positive,a sci fi epic unlike anything ive ever seen  loved it
Mar 2 2024,neutral,the movie is very long  and a lot of scenes are just made to feel even more so by camera just staying on a blank face  i loved the effects  i feel like the bulk of the movie could be better served with cutting out the long scenes and having more just raw action  the acting was pretty blah as the average emotion was im so bothered just being here talking to you by literally every fremen in almost every scene   without spoiling it the director got way way more into the religious aspects of the major character and had believers and dis believers which was interesting  overall its a fun movie to see but way way too long for the content delivered  but they do leave it open to potentially go into the second book  which only scifi and their miniseries have ever attempted to go into what happens after book one
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie really enjoyed this 2nd  part dont think the series is done yet either believe 3rd is in the mix cant wait
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinematography great score great acting great story great movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,modern star wars in the sand
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie everything was great except for character arc development and dialogues wish denis spent more time on it rather than on battle scenes very masculine movie with greatly depicted desert life key message of the book and next book was delivered to us in a simplistic and clear way which i loved cast was solid and dealt with material given to them gracefully timothee was standout during transformation and entire act 3 of the movie cause he was given solid material for showing his acting skills also worm riding scene was beautiful and gracefully dealt by everybody including timothee the movie might be  not everyones piece of cake due to niche genre
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two is a perfectly executed film greig frasers cinematography is just as wonderful as his work on the first dune and the batman if not better deniss direction is swift sharp with not an ounce of waste its all relevant to the telling hans zimmers score is electric and powerful the effects are perfect this film is expertly crafted and incredibly well made i could not help but be in awe by it for most of its run time and not just with the larger than life moments even with smaller more subtle moments hold as much weight the cast here is phenomenal as well chalamet might be this generations defining actor austin butler josh brolin javier bardem everyone is fantastic i love the complexity of the characters the politics and how this world works that being said im more of an admirer of these films i cant say i love them or connect with them emotionally as far as flaws go i think about 1015 minutes of the second act could have easily been cut as a lot of it is repeated exposition and gets very stagnant but the film ends strong
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved it  cant wait to see what happens next
Mar 2 2024,positive,i think the first movie was better this one was okay but found myself bored in parts of it
Mar 2 2024,positive,best movie of the last decade  absolutely outstanding
Mar 2 2024,positive,pretty much a perfect sci fi movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie visually amazing and definitely worth the theater experience a tad on the long side but they had a lot of material to cover
Mar 2 2024,positive,builds incredibly upon the first movie improving in almost every way amazing visuals and acting the cinematography was great and it sets up the next one well
Mar 2 2024,positive,best movie i have seen in years
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie was good and looked amazing however i feel like the story was rushed and moved away from the book a bit too much in areas
Mar 2 2024,positive,the dune part 2 movie is simply wonderful
Mar 2 2024,positive,it is as a 5 star rating would suggest a absolute must see rarely does such mainstream sciencefiction make one think and feel as much as dune can the enthralling score and use of silencesound stunning cinematography fantastic acting and meaningful narrative all make this movie entrancing to watch
Mar 2 2024,positive,ive just came out of the cinema feeling myself as a kids when i saw star wars in 77 in the last 10 years or more most of the syfy films dont offer much emotions and quality content there are still a few directors such as denis villeneuve that respect the audiences and have the the passion to work at a high level in cinema cinematography production design sound editing sound and special effects hard to beat i hope this dune 2 makes a lot of money
Mar 2 2024,positive,riding the worm should have more details on how it is done
Mar 2 2024,positive,audio and visuals are second to none in that regard this movie is a masterpiece however it definitely feels disjointed and a little all over the place at times spent way too much time on austin butlers character movie really dragged in the middle and the ending felt rushed its good but just doesnt capture the magic like part 1 did
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing scenes only two sets felt like cgi everything else was flawless
Mar 2 2024,positive,much better than expected
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved it great movie lots of action interesting themesseems to me like theres going to be a part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,honestly i loved this movie even more than the first zendaya and austin butler delivered show stealing performances i foresee this movie sweeping the next awards season
Mar 2 2024,positive,better then the first one by a mile the visual effects are chefs kiss action packed  not the hugest fan of dune but this one is enjoyable
Mar 2 2024,positive,the action scenes were tremendous  sound was excellent cast was great  the scenes were shot beautifully  the story was better than the first cant wait for dune 3
Mar 2 2024,neutral,the movie starts out slow but the story does get good and picks up however it does have parts where it is confusing the biggest problem comes at the end the final battle just seems like they rushed through it a lot of it ended up on the editing floor its a dud whats makes it worse is they just leave everything open ended no explanation or conclusion its just figure it out on your own to make it end the way you want thats why it was so disappointing if they concluded the movie then i would have been happier but walking away its like trying to figure out how it all ties in
Mar 2 2024,negative,it was boring you shouldnt watch if youre a fan of older movies
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic thats perfect word to describe this incredible movie   this new adaptation of frank herberts book by denis villeneuve deserves to be seen on big screen on imax for his incredible visuel effects and big scenes but also for its epic story little bit readapt for discovering new heros and new characters interpreted to perfection by wonderful actors   this is epic amazing incredible emotional and so much more to be described   now the only way is went to see this on cinema 
Mar 2 2024,positive,i think it was really good although it had one or two parts that led me confused the twists not saying so i dont spoil and ending were interesting to me
Mar 2 2024,negative,didnt get to see the movie fandango app sold us the wrong date and fandango will not refund    so this low score is for fandango not the movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,part one lived up to the original and part two fell short the fight scene didnt come close to the original and was quite boring the original dune kept me on the edge of my seat and i felt part two was a waste of my money
Mar 2 2024,neutral,first of all i havent read the book so i dont know if the movie is faithful to the book    the movie is really impressive visually the special effects are great some scenes like the one with the worms are really impressive  but the continuity of the scenes is not really good the movie is too long and some scenes are boring    part one of the movie was interesting because we discover the world of dune and the characters but part two doesnt give me the same feeling
Mar 2 2024,positive,ya know when u get those ads for movies and its like see it on the biggest screen possible well they werent lying about this one it really does enter you into its world and everything about it seems magical its even better than the first
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie is sublime
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic you will never get close to the mountain of pages of these epic books this gets you as close as you can while being accessible and entertaining as a film dune 2 may well be my favorite movie of all time and dune will need to play right before it to get the full effect
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie seemed to lose steam halfway through maybe because i didnt really feel the emotional beats of the characters
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent movie i wish it were more faithful to the novel but other than that i thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 2 2024,positive,significant deviations from the book aside it was a brilliant adaptation for film while respecting the source material in a way that is enjoyable for fans and newbies alike  absolutely loved the film soundtrack and imax experience
Mar 2 2024,positive,a modern masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,a masterpiece  i cannot wait for part 3 
Mar 2 2024,positive,really well executed outstanding cinematography sound design    i found christopher walken distracting but thankfully he had few lines    also i was a bit confused by the plot in the previous movie why was paul trying to start a chocolate business and singing all the time    other than that top notch
Mar 2 2024,positive,first it doesnt feel like a 2 and a half hour long movie it moves so well acting is fantastic and the visuals combined with the score are breathtaking i would see it in imax if you can as brilliant as the first
Mar 2 2024,positive,great experiencing soundtrack awsome and the cgi amzing
Mar 2 2024,positive,great experience watching it in imax
Mar 2 2024,positive,visually stunning    i appreciate not rushing to tell the story
Mar 2 2024,positive,i liked the focus on the spirituality of the piece and the role of paul as the messiah  the bene gesserit story line was definitely present  i also thought they did a good job of showing just how mean the harkonnen are  i thought there would be a little more of the final battle in the film with the fremen against the sardaukar but it wasnt a deal breaker
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is the definitive cinema experience what a fantastic film
Mar 2 2024,positive,surpassed part 1 by many levels the only complaints i have is that it should have been longer than 2 hrs  46 mins and damn theres no imax in our city pure adrenaline from the 1st act down to the 3rd peak cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,firstly this movie is a visual masterpiece the techniques used will become the bench mark for imax films    secondly rebecca ferguson had the best performance in this movie austin butler was strong also charlotte rampling was the perfect cast for her role    third the movie tries to pack in too much and as a result ends up rushing certain portions i feel in this way it is similar to the dark knight rises    fourth the musical themes could have been more prominent i found it was the soundscape lacked melody    fifth the source material is not exactly the same as jamis wife harah is supposed to become one of pauls wives according to fremen custom    i think the scene where jessica becomes a reverend mother could have been better it wasnt the same as the book    the movie could have been more captivating but in the end it just felt over stimulating and rushed
Mar 2 2024,positive,good stuff all good stuff see it you wont regret it
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic  even better than part 1 the visual and sound effects are awesome  better than the book
Mar 2 2024,positive,an epic achievement
Mar 2 2024,negative,a shallow gary stu copy of lawrence of arabia where the hero has no motivation other than the plot and he instantly wins every difficulty he comes across
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best sequels ive ever seen everything is great especially the cinematography
Mar 2 2024,negative,so much worse than first one
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie great visuals and scenery kinda jumps around quick but very good

Mar 2 2024,positive,loved it  it had everything  i knew it was going to be a long movie but i didnt notice because it was exciting from beginning to end  looks like another dune will eventually come out but i was really pleased with the way they ended dune 2  it was quite an amazing film
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved it cinematography sound score acting all tops i found the editing in a couple spots were off but suspect it could be fixed in a slightly longer cut near perfect film for me 475 stars out of 5 if it were possible
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was a very good movie better than part one in my opinion worth going to see in the cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,the amazing effects and the immersion  best film of my life
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune 2 was an amazing movie very close to the book

Mar 2 2024,positive,everything i wanted to see and more  a must watch
Mar 2 2024,positive,this was awesome a must see in the theater a completely immersive experience im still kind of in shock at how good and impressive this was
Mar 2 2024,positive,i saw the first dune and it immediately entered my top 5  when i saw trailers for dune 2 i was a little worried they might try to go hollywood to appeal to more people but that is exactly what did not happen  i feel this movie is a perfect continuation of the first movie and now dune part 1 and dune part 2 are both in my top 5 of all time this movie is outstanding and needs multiple viewings
Mar 2 2024,positive,magnificent epic visually stunning and one of the best cinematography ive seen with sci fi everything was 1010  a truly must see film
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two is a cinematic definition for me although the first movie was majestic enough to entertain me it wasnt appealing because of its nature the world the idea was not catchy but the second movie is total craziness throne wrestle character development gigantic action all together magnificent a masterpiece the new star wars
Mar 2 2024,positive,stunning cgi perfect acting and superb action sequences a must see
Mar 2 2024,positive,a masterpiece  does not dumb things down for its audiences and is a class act in movie making from the acting to the enormity of the frames  villeneuve is a scifi master
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two a triumphant return to arrakis  buckle up spice lovers dune part two is even bigger and bolder than the first expect stunning visuals epic battles and deeper dives into the fremen way of life chalamet and zendaya are on fire and the story gets even juicier with more action and character development whether youre a dune diehard or a scifi newbie this ones definitely worth the trip to arrakis
Mar 2 2024,positive,we really enjoyed this addition to the dune series it was very loud at times as the volume can fluctuate especially those high pitch notes much like the first movie good action and a little bit of romance drama makes want to go read all the books so i know whats going to happen cant wait to see it again
Mar 2 2024,positive,visually stunning and true to frank herberts original story this film is epic in ways i was only dreaming of
Mar 2 2024,positive,a visual masterpiece    i had this thing in mind that no matter how hard the critic appreciate the movie i wont get my hopes up even though dune was so good in itself    having read the books and loving the dune universe i feel this lived up to my expectations while watching the first shot of the movie my eyes were glimmering i didnt really know where to look as there were so many things to look for the colorgrading in the opening shot was phenomenal and as the eclipse goes away you could clearly see the beauty of the planet arrakis    for the general audienceplease have an idea of dune universe before going into both the parts it is not just another movie for nerds you will really know how good is your attention span during the course of the film
Mar 2 2024,negative,disjointed  too much yelling
Mar 2 2024,positive,after watching this film i was truly at a loss for words this movie captures the heart of film itself in all areas i could go on so many rants about how beautiful and extraordinary it was the cinematography was absolutely stunning the actors were phenomenal this is truly one of the best movies in this generation an absolute must see that i hope becomes a classic
Mar 2 2024,negative,the violence was over the top for me the storyline was not very easy to follow and its a 3 hour movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,the relationship between the key characters and the way the story unfolded  the worm rides were creative special effects  disappointed with the ending but it seems like it leas into a dune 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,there was an annoying crackle through the film
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a saga worth investing in simply a masterpiece perfect in every way
Mar 2 2024,negative,repetitive ritualistic killings interspersed with some good acting
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time will definitely be going back to the theaters to see it again but this time im taking the whole family
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal a cinematic miracle captured so astonishingly that no words can explain the soundtrack the cast the visuals the themes and motives best movie of this generation mind blowing sequel
Mar 2 2024,positive,if i hadnt reread the book recently i believe i would have rated it a lot higher i didnt feel this movie was as immersive as the first one for a movie that was almost 3 hours i still feel like it only hit the high points there wasnt a lot of dialogue but what there was had a lot of exposition there were many changes and important deletions from the story that would hsve made it more impactful including the ending which i feel fell flat i couldnt wait to see the first one again but i doubt i will see this one a second time too much of a slog
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing simply amazing  books and original film  a great  as much as pt1 was underwhelming pt2 is magnificent   doesnt follow the novels closely but still a must watch  read the books as well 
Mar 2 2024,positive,great visuals must be seen in a theater
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent movie storytelling was done well
Mar 2 2024,positive,just an incredible movie

Mar 2 2024,positive,the best movie of 2024
Mar 2 2024,positive,very different not what i expected at all i enjoyed the film
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie is awesome but the beginning is a bit slow
Mar 2 2024,positive,gorgeous visuals compelling performances especially zendaya and chalamet accompanied by zimmers sumptuous musical score see it on the biggest screen you can find imax is chefs kiss this is peak cinema storytelling
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was a cinematic masterpiece an experience i will never forget watching and will always remember definitely worth watching it in imax thoroughly enjoyed it the cinematography was beautiful and the acting is top tier i did not expect coming in to truly love it while i thought the first film was decent dune part two is literally mind blowing timothee and rebecca ferguson performances are the true standouts definitely will watch it again at the theater long live the fighters 
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen and watching it in imax was an incredible experience it could have been a 4 hour movie i didnt want it to stop
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune pt 2 was amazing i might be in the minority but i thought pt 1 was incredibly boring it felt like almost 3 hours of setup pt2 actually felt to me like a blockbuster film that i wanted the first one to be i was extremely entertained and never once looked at my phone wondering when it was going to end like pt1 i would highly recommend to anyone if others out there got bored with pt1 read a quick 23 minute summary then watch this one
Mar 2 2024,positive,a monumental epic unlike anything ive ever seen before
Mar 2 2024,neutral,ok i enjoyed it  the cinematography was amazing  but this  time the story did not grab me it dragged and the characters just dud t come through lack of suspense chemistry whatever
Mar 2 2024,positive,everything about this movie was epic the score the cinematography the performances from the entire cast zendaya is such a star i was blown away by her specifically the ending was heartbreaking but so beautiful
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolute awesomenes everything is in place the cinematography costumes cgi and vibe are amazing with genius story and characters played by awesome actors some of them deserve an oscar
Mar 2 2024,negative,it was ok it was really long and a bit slow took my kids based on the trailer it was a long movie to sit still through good story might be better for at home where you can pause it and get up and stretch
Mar 2 2024,positive,peak cinematography this movie just brought back cinema the visuals directing score and acting are jaw dropping
Mar 2 2024,positive,stunning visuals soul rending audio and incredible story pacing   as a huge fan of the books i am very happy with the story arc   hopefully in the next installation we will hear from the bene tleilax
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely amazing sequel to the first instalment as a fan this movie gave me goosebumps in many scenes which emotionally got me attached to the movie and loved the characters even more i hope denis gives us a monster of an ending in the final movie of the trilogy dune part 3 messiah
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterful cinematography majestic score simply phenomenal
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is the way dune shouldve been made  its all that simple
Mar 2 2024,positive,go see this at the theater as a fan of the books and a huge fan of the og dune movie i approve 100 this is how you do it
Mar 2 2024,positive,i did not like how the chani character was changed from the book  i understand other changes to simplify some story elements the ending was a disappointment having chani walking out and going to the desert was a horrible way to end it i am a huge dune fan and have read all the books but very disappointed on how the chani character was changed from a supporting and loving companion to paul to a nonbelieving sullen character
Mar 2 2024,positive,the best sequel they ever made this was a wonderful experience acting story music everything im a big fan of timothée but in this austins acting is also extraordinary the story was told beautifully its more amazing visually than dune part 1 i feel like im in the desert too i think this is the best movie that denis villeneuve has ever made so far the casting is the best id like to watch it again thank you very much everyone for this masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,im 34 years old some will say im old some will say im young regardless in my 34 years i have never watched a film that has gripped me the way this desert world has gripped me    from the score the casting the visuals i am left floored this movie assaulted me an exhilarating assault    just watch it
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune ii was a symphony of color and emotion the contrast given to sharpen the character motion and action it might be the best scfi movie ever created
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely amazing  a must see 
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely breath taking cinematography   the film encapsulates you from the first minute till the last excellent to say the least awesome visuals and story telling with an uncompromising musical score
Mar 2 2024,positive,the best movie i have watched
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent acting and scenery impressive and realistic computer graphics they changed the character of duke atraides from a charismatic leader to an almost tyrannical demigod not sure i liked that although it fit the tenor of the follow on books
Mar 2 2024,negative,i had been looking forward to the movie for quite a long time but being a fan of the original books i was quite disappointed mainly because of the changes some of the cast did well zendaya she was really good in the movie but i just couldnt get into it really disappointed to be honest
Mar 2 2024,positive,a triumph of film making the story the acting the music and cinematography nothing compares go see it
Mar 2 2024,positive,it might be on of the best movies ive ever seen its long but worth every moment
Mar 2 2024,neutral,tedious an hour too long i want my 3 hours back
Mar 2 2024,negative,with references to the cult of the madhi and many other islamic tropes herbert continues the british tradition of worshipping the cultures they colonized he does so with the self loathing patronizing manner of we have lost connection to godnaturewhatever that these simple natives maintain  tired
Mar 2 2024,positive,i think this is an excellent movie from the images music fight scenes and excellent movie setting  the plot carries the true spirit of the dune novel in the book  the actors with great acting all brought to me many emotions from pentup suspense to suffocation to bursting the ending of the movie is also an open ending promising part 3 will be even more attractive and complete  there are only a few small minus points the emotional aspect between chani and paul has not been fully exploited the role of princess irulan was cut for a lot of time so it is not complete in the middle of the movie i wanted the pace of the movie to slow down a bit more to portray the characters psychology as well as the reasons for their choices  combining the above huge pluses along with a few small insignificant minuses i think dune part 2 is a movie worth enjoying outside of imax theaters  my score  8510
Mar 2 2024,positive,i consider myself lucky to be alive to experience this movie    a total masterclass of movie making by denis villeneuve this movie is simply perfect from a to z    chalamet zendaya butler pugh ferguson bardem and everyone else are unreal and the score by zimmer is out of this world    thank you denis just thank you
Mar 2 2024,positive,i know its a bit early to say but so far i think this is the best movie of the year after watching the first movie i knew this one would be good as well and it ended up being even better highly recommend
Mar 2 2024,positive,saw this last night ive been looking forward to it since the first film wasnt disappointed its beautiful to look at the cast were great perhaps with the exception of zendaya who seems to just play zendaya but generally just a brilliant cinematic experience  couple of gripes were deviations from the book specifically the paul  chani arch and the missing characters some of whom were in the first film  seem to have been cut in this one and others who just dont show up at all  but otherwise amazing going to see it again but this time at an imax as i think it will enhance the visual experience even more  studios and creatives take note this is how you do big budget movies and a true cinema experience
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a modern day classic film  the theater experience for this film is immersive in the imax or any premium sound system theater  best experience ive had at the movies since the avengers finale dune part 2 is one of the best sequels  a strong early  contender for best picture  the film itself feels grandiose in many aspects every generation has their iconic sagas  star wars harry potter  marvel  indiana jones etc dune has made its mark as the film series of the 2020s
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie also example for lazy writing   people are scary to worms 1st part they are free cab in 2nd part how peoples are getting to it  how they connect and drive worm   sand strom played a role in 1st part explained as no one can survive  in 2nd part climax shown as biggest strom coming and it cause zero damage  what is use of shield in both part it is useless if using it or not people are dying same apply to machine and vehicle all will explode   what is the power to emperor and why everyone afraid of anyone can be become emperor by marry her daughter and no one stop   this story this old book adaptation i accept when i see this as movie now it seems like crossover of star wars and matrix   why this character feyd rautha in colosseum he fight with shield against people who are injected and weak himself asking to baron vladimir why one was not inject while leaving his planet an army shown and they are useless   how feyd rautha knows fremen colony it was said like no knows their hiding places how fremen fighters missed to notice that huge ship coming   why stilgar believes paul is the one to learnunderstand fremen life stilgar ask paul to travelwalk deserts alone in next scene chani training him   gurney says that paul family stored warheads which is enough to destroy whole planet ok what is use of it used to destroy a single mountain   much more most 2nd part raising so many questions on both part what is exactly spice why no where explored how rebecca ferguson kidnapped in part one what do people eat water is precious what shield doctor wellington switched off why devil hand on a planet showedhow pauls note reached emperor
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent movie well executed great storytelling
Mar 2 2024,positive,lord of the rings quality and game of thrones in space plus a bit of jedi powers    this is epic and rare movies that they dont make it like that anymore    please make dune 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic film  visually spectacular  great story characters
Mar 2 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece on all levels
Mar 2 2024,positive,better than the first part beautifully shot
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune is truly a magnificent film i had thoroughly enjoyed the first installment and deemed it the best film i had ever seen now having watched the second installment i am truly impressed
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a complex movie to review and i wouldnt doubt it of there are divergent opinions here    the first 90 minutes or so of the movie were just amazing  visually spectacular  tight plot    but then as they started to get to the next phase of the plot it started to sprawl  the whole scene on the harkenens planet with the gladiator scene was both visually spectacular like 300 or something of that ilk but also felt like a diversion   you had characters like zendayas and rebecca fergusons who would just drop out of the movie for extended periods as they switched to another part of the plot as someone who read the books i understand why they continued to follow certain plot lines  but trying to keep it all together was hard  i think in an adaptation that was less focused on the books they would have just cut whole elements of the plot and characters out    but for me personally i think the epicness and grandness of the movie made all it worth it  but i could totally understand someone else feeling like it was a bit of a mess    one other thing  you cant look at this movie as a stand alone movie  ultimately they are creating something like a 9 hour long movie and they are just releasing it in parts  so i wouldnt even think about this as the 2nd part in a trilogy  this is just the middle part of a movie where the final part has not been released yet
Mar 2 2024,positive,certain parts of this movie i can appreciate the acting some novel effects but it was draggingly long soaking in moments i didnt care about and leaving out ones i did i felt like i did when i was 8 and had to go to a long church mass and this one was almost three hours
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part 2 is nothing short of a monumental achievement in the art form of science fiction adaption  filmmaking  the greatest science fiction film thats not called 2001 a space odyssey or interstellar dune part 2 is quite simply the best blockbuster of the last decade for science fiction films
Mar 2 2024,positive,finally we get an adaptation worth watching dune surpasses all other scifis stories to me not to mention hans zimmers score is just superb
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely sizzles in every aspect on every level catch it while its in theatres folks this is one of the greats
Mar 2 2024,positive,a great epic of this century beautiful story telling imagery and acting top performances cant wait to see again
Mar 2 2024,negative,visuals and soundtrack interesting but script drags i became bored
Mar 2 2024,positive,great adaptation  and companion to part one exciting fight scenes and dialogue  cannot wait for part 3 hope there is a part 3 and its similarities and differences from the book
Mar 2 2024,positive,what a movie loved part 1 but part 2 blew me away the acting was phenomenal and dont get me started on the visual effects ive never seen something look so real in my life
Mar 2 2024,positive,what a beautiful cinematic climactic masterpiece denis villeneuve is a genius and the cast performance was outstanding they better get an oscar nomination
Mar 2 2024,positive,remarkable achievement truely blessed to witness deni work cant wait for messiah  lone live cinema long live fighters
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing masterpiece cant wait for part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,better than the first one  more actioned packed 
Mar 2 2024,positive,movie was so good i had the urge to rewatch it after i left the cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,i went and saw it first day got out of the theater driving home i was like man they shouldve  brought back sting  it increased my appreciation for his interpretation apart from that the movie suffers with an almost 3 hour run time i was constantly looking at my watch just thinking theyre going to rush the ending my disappointment was complete at the ending  with zendaya and her unnecessary  go girl moment  ptsd reemerging coming from the matrix resurrections  ending  apart from psycho elvis and the ending which i prefer lynchs version at the end of the day it all depends on how denis will end his run on dune if this sequel even matters or deserves the praise i had a lot of hate after walking out the theater but after remembering the main message of dune by frank herbert you realize where denis is pushing this story and see he is on the right path my expectations  for the next sequel are now higher because  of where hes going with paul this is not empire strikes back paul is not luke return of the jedi could have sucked and empire would have still been remembered with love and nostalgia denis can still prove that dune is unadaptable if he messes up the sequel and dune part 2 will be remembered for a waste of time or wasted potential  apart from all my issues it looks amazing in imax i loved that the vision is there for scifi fans it raises the bar on what can be done by just a little bit paul and chanis charming love story drives this movie all the way to the ending there is no human spider in this one but it creates a lot of visuals that i am still wanting to go see it again because of them timothy is giving off jesus vibes barden is carrying the supporter role with charisma brolin is interpreting the rage for revenge from the first movie and rebecca is the best mom in this movie the cast gave a great effort loved seeing the legendary christopher walken  as the emperor  an experience yes but a flawed achievement in scifi flim
Mar 2 2024,positive,a fan of dune the scifi mini series they did a great job with sticking to the main story the visual cinematography music acting and character story development are amazing dont know why but this give me the vibe of nostradamus prophecy of the saviorjesus came back and bring on the holy war in the my of his father to save his people life is like a self fulfilling prophecy
Mar 2 2024,positive,i have never in my life been as gripped by a movie as i was by dune part two phenomenal
Mar 2 2024,positive,perfection cinematic perfection see it in imax you owe it to yourself thrilling scintillating and altogether breathtaking this is a masterpiece of a movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two is an epic scifi that brings back the importance of cinematography and an intense plot that keeps you engaged the whole 3 hour runtime please see this film in imax its perfect 
Mar 2 2024,positive,did not expect a near three hour movie to have a cliffhanger and not fully resolve cant wait for the third one
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent story line stayed as close to the original story expanded on the characters
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Mar 2 2024,negative,meh  underwhelming  looks great great villains   poor casting of chalamet zendaya and pugh  pour writing that focused on an unwilling messiah unlike the source material  seemed like so many actors were trying to get fired from any future installments by bland and uninspired performances
Mar 2 2024,positive,denis villeneuve is a living legend this adaptation of dune is phenomenal it shows what can be achieved when your objective is to make a fantastic film to bring a vision to life and to entertain people
Mar 2 2024,positive,while i was a fan of the first movie and had big expectations for the second installment i was still blown away by this movie it was a brilliant and true epic movie lets keep the dune universe going
Mar 2 2024,positive,beautiful  brave  epic  an absolute must see
Mar 2 2024,positive,its the edge of your seat action  the cinematography and misenscene are spectacular  i highly recommend going to see dune part 2 if you liked dune you will not be disappointed  cant wait for dune part 3
Mar 2 2024,negative,great costumes and cinematography but the story is slow and the cast has little chemistry  also little character growth with actors given little rangeone note to carry for all of their scenes
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie had everything even better than the first and thats saying something
Mar 2 2024,positive,even better than the first one all the actors carried the movie really well fantastic shots loved it

Mar 2 2024,positive,a movie which you must watch in imax it got me a few minutes to come out of dune after the credits start to show on the screen this is the first time in my entire life im experiencing a cinematic event like this i could watch this movie an infinity times more thanks to each and every person of every department who worked hard to give us a magnificent piece of art dune
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing and immersive  worth the insane ticket prices these days
Mar 2 2024,positive,a long story of epic proportions that gets better with every installment  its a visual treat with superb special effects throughout from the grandness of the beautiful desert to the harshness and contrast of the harkonnen style  the plot covers religious fervor mature romance and intergalactic conquest with a good balance and the cast of actors are great truly bringing the story to life  the musical score intensifies every scene and whilst it could have been paced better what with a slowish start and a seemingly compacted final act i was entertained throughout
Mar 2 2024,positive,didnt expect a cinematic experience to make anyone speechless specially the ones who have read the book series long live cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,fantastic better than the first heres to 3 continuing this pattern and being even better
Mar 2 2024,positive,it aint perfect but its definitely what a sequel should be then again its part 2 of the first book
Mar 2 2024,positive,a dark and riveting opera that should definitely be experienced exclusively in the big screens
Mar 2 2024,positive,its a great continuation to the original the visuals are stunning and the soundtrack really pulls you in the actors do a great job of showing how they all have different goals and are working towards them
Mar 2 2024,positive,timothy is truly gifted he  zendaya shine together it was epic so worth the wait  visually stunning this is a movie ment to be seen on the big screen
Mar 2 2024,positive,cinema at its grandest joining the empire strikes back and return of the king in the pantheon of epic scififantasy movies see it in imax
Mar 2 2024,positive,i loved every second of it i left the theater sad because it was over it really was a one of a lifetime experience will be watching again neext weekend
Mar 2 2024,positive,as a die hard fan of the the great scifi literature i was afraid of the creative liberties denis villeneuve did in the sequel im surprised that it landed well for better and for worse adding layers of personality in a one dimensional characters in the book overall denis delivered a satisfying adaptation of the first book that rivals star wars empire strikes back
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is the kind of movie why you go to cinema masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is epic on many levels  austin butlers feydrautha is one of my new favorite villains  i cannot wait to see it again
Mar 2 2024,positive,awe inducing great scifi great action great characters and surprisingly complex without feeling over complicated sadder than i expected
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a sequel that not only met my expectations but exceeded them i happily await the next movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece brilliant casting amazing acting and a director who isnt afraid to slow things down and show the magnificence of the surroundings    lawrence of arabia meets the empire strikes back
Mar 2 2024,positive,havent seen such an epic movie in years really enjoyed it
Mar 2 2024,neutral,amazing visuals and sound to experience in imax given its star studded cast and potential its squandered through a disappointing script with inconsistent pacing definitely pails in comparison to the first dune 2 is being over hyped for what it really offers as for a modern day scifi epic a movie of this magnitude should leave you feeling like it must be watched again and i dont think i could make it halfway through not a good sign
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part ii closely follows the source material where it is able visually representing herberts story by condensing the book into a digestible film in a truly magnificent way  for those who have read the books it may be disappointing however villeneuve does a good job at catering to an audience who has no context and still creates a mustsee picture film
Mar 2 2024,positive,serious yet comedic hopeful but heartbreaking i just want to punch pauls face for what he did to chani
Mar 2 2024,positive,excellent movie all around highly recommend
Mar 2 2024,negative,the movie plays with the idea of a strong man saving a helpless disorganised people but then doesnt do the work to highlight how problematic the story is the one dimensional characters and toxic rendering of masculinity does not help  the only things saving this movie are the beautiful landscapes and the goose bumps you get when the music plays
Mar 2 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece breath of fresh air in a time with hurried superhero movies and lack of depth this second installment is better than its predecessor much better acting is on point and it will keep you on your toes for 166mins never a dull or boring moment because just as you think its getting a bit slow then it turns into full on action
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part ii maintains if not surpassing its first parts quality regarding the epic cinematic visuals and sound yet there seems to have some flaws in the narrative part which makes some points of the movie too rush and some points unnecessarily too long that can be boring in all dune part ii is a decent movie that is overrated
Mar 2 2024,positive,better than i ever imagined
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was everything
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic immersive beautiful great storytelling
Mar 2 2024,positive,i wondered a few times if it was the best sci fi movie ive seen in theaters since the matrix phenomenal and creative
Mar 2 2024,positive,even better than the first and the first was a masterpiece dune is widely considered to be one of the most difficult science fiction adaptations and villeneuve hit it out of the park
Mar 2 2024,positive,whilst visually stunning and the soundtrack was on point i cannot get over how they changed major details with regards to the final part of the movie and especially the dynamic between paul and chani which is completely different to the source material also the exclusion of alia and thufir hawat did not make senseespecially when they are important to several plot points
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie absolutely the best movie in last years in the final the movie i said just wow all things are good actors screenplay and music visual and other thanks for movie dennis villeneuve
Mar 2 2024,positive,there are some minor flaws and some inevitable changes from the book but the overall movie is absolutely majestic
Mar 2 2024,positive,very impressed interpreted from the novel well  its the best movie in 4 years
Mar 2 2024,positive,watching the first one prior really helped me appreciate part 2 even more it was amazing just go watch it already
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune 2 is perfect it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost 3 hours the camerawork is brutal every scene is a work of art the composers work is incredible the music is a big part of this denis villeneuve is a genius thank you for giving us this
Mar 2 2024,positive,just as good if not a little better than dune part 1 chalamet commands the screen with a dominant mature performance and i loved austin butler as rautha breathtaking visuals and score bravo mr denis villenuve
Mar 2 2024,positive,saw it in 70 mm beautiful
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing movie i might actually read the books because of it all the bad ratings are just coming from people who want to let you know they read the books
Mar 2 2024,positive,needs to be seen to be believed found myself struck speechless by the sheer grandeur of this movie an all time great movie on par with godfather 2 lotr etc it really is that good
Mar 2 2024,positive,im an atheist but god damn that movie is awesome
Mar 2 2024,positive,the acting the visuals and the build up what is one of the best third acts i have seen in a long time dune part two is definitely taking its stamp in scifi movie history
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely epic 2 hours later im still buzzing go see this on a big screen

Mar 2 2024,positive,quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time 
Mar 2 2024,positive,a must watchleaves you with much more to see and explore more of the physical and spiritual worlds around dune
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterpiece dune 2 is insane i cant believe that a work like this is so spectacular timothée is a beast
Mar 2 2024,positive,this sequel is outstanding with a welltold story topnotch production and excellent acting while the script doesnt fully utilize this elite cast the film is a mustsee hans zimmers music adds to the films grandeur dune can be both amazing and a bit boring but its still a great movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,not as good as the first one
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing everything about it was five stars they didnt hold back on excellence
Mar 2 2024,positive,the best scifi movie of the decade doesnt matter if you read the book you will still understand every bit of information it has with its outstanding cinematography masterful fight choreographies unique sound design and incredible cast it all blends together to give you the best experience one could have would definitely recommend watching it on imax
Mar 2 2024,positive,review 
Mar 2 2024,positive,loved the depth of the movie story telling and the extended action added compared to part one
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was amazing definitely in my top 5  i got to see it in imax at the premiere great story line from the book great actors i cant wait for part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinematography  awesome sfx  incredible music  epic storyline  my only gripe and im nitpicking here is that it may be too long its about 3 hrs you could have at least shaved an hour off and it would still be epic overall it was great they were treating paul like he was jesus lol
Mar 2 2024,positive,very well told story superb acting action packed and best delivery of any of the series loved the actors and feel good after the ending
Mar 2 2024,positive,part two was so awesome
Mar 2 2024,negative,dune one  5 stars but dune two despite excellent action and visualsonic impact is miserable frank herbert had a masterful nearly perfect plot that the screenplay completely disregarded solely for the purpose of setting the stage for an action packed sequel all the masterful complexity of the original plot turned to dust all the depth of the characters obliterated and some like alia gone completely
Mar 2 2024,positive,fantastic production better than the first
Mar 2 2024,positive,phenomenal  see it on the biggest screen you can i have never seen a movie multiple times at the theatre until dune will see it a third time in imax next week on the other side of australia since there isnt one in perth   cant recommend enough
Mar 2 2024,negative,visually stunning and thats it     if youve read the books youll be disappointed or you should be if you havent youll probably like this movie a lot more than you should frank herberts dune is a masterpiece for a reason why villeneuve felt it needed to be rewritten is beyond me gone are the subtle complexities of manipulation and intrique  we get one line as a nod to them which literally says plans within plans but we never seeeeee any of those not even the most blatant one where the beast raban is intended to brutalize the population of arrakis so that  feydrautha can replace him as a more benevolent dictator      this is just another example of spectacle over story though done better than most read the book if you want to know how good the movie could have been
Mar 2 2024,positive,intriguing better than the first
Mar 2 2024,positive,better than part 1 and part 1 was already great
Mar 2 2024,positive,nothing wrong with this film whatsoever the script choreography cinematography you name it everything was perfectly set up and dont even get me started with timothée chalamet insane
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the top 10 greatest movies of all time imo its also imo the greatest imax movie ever made the cinematography sound design cast and denis villanueves amazing direction all shines here
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinematic and music is captivating
Mar 2 2024,positive,masterpiece no other words
Mar 2 2024,positive,even better than the first one villeneuve has somehow captured that raw feeling of reading frank heberts dune for the first time on film the effects as well as the character writing particularly for stilgar are spectacular i would recommend 1010 cant wait to see it again
Mar 2 2024,neutral,too much talking needs more action since its almost a 3 hr long movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,incredible directing acting cinematography sound and just sheer scale this is such a refreshing blockbuster the world was due for i agree with other folks that this needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible some of the story felt rushed but they didnt have a choice given the depth of the source material hoping this crushes the box office and we get dune 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,cant wait for dume3
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolute blockbuster the characters and plot lines unravel the complex relationship between fate and freewill against a the breathtaking backdrop of villeneuve cinematography
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing movie expanding the lore of dune with great cinematography  and storytelling
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two is nothing short of a masterpiece i havent known anything about the dune universe going into the first movie then the first one got me hooked this is probably one of the best sequels of all time the action the drama the story and cinematography are all 1010 i have absolutely nothing bad to say about this film i would recommend this to anyone this is absolute scifi perfection this movie made me want to read the book so immediately afterwards i placed a hold on it
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a masterpiece no words explain how amazing it is
Mar 2 2024,positive,the best movie of the year no more to say
Mar 2 2024,positive,ive never watched anything so large in my life a truly visually stunning film i hope there is another few movies to come out of this
Mar 2 2024,positive,there were so many epic scenes in this movie just wow
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is best action movie i have ever seen in a long time every scene was this amazing and beautiful dune part 1 didnt have me like that but this movie dune part 2 best film in 2024 i give it a rating 1010
Mar 2 2024,positive,if you love sifi this movie is great on every level
Mar 2 2024,positive,such a phenomenal and breathtaking movie i actually watched it a second time in theaters
Mar 2 2024,positive,peak scifi absolutely fenomenal
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part ii i missed my imax show time but i got to see it in xd xd was very very good including the sound system not too loud not too soft the cast is 100 solid i was dubious about chani kynes zendaya but the chemistry works with paul timothée chalamet one gets a bit more into the goings of the lifestyle of the fremen which is solid i hope we have an extended version in the works also i am hopeful we can purchase a bluray cd both dune and dune ii are appropriate for modern scifi libraries also there are huge opportunities for swag
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is denis villeneuve at his best this is what modern scifi is meant to be the marriage of the music and cinematography is chefs kiss
Mar 2 2024,positive,i mean there really was nothing bad to say about this one didnt really know what to expect from watching the first dune just last night and this one far exceeded it the only gripe i only had was that it felt like it dragged early but it was made up in the end fantastic film
Mar 2 2024,neutral,visually the movie is beautiful some great performances overall some of the departures from the book were very hard to swallow     spoilers ahead      in the book what was most powerful about the fremen was their unity in tradition and practice the movie takes a major curve ball very early with religious divide among the fremen specifically the water of life ritual was something i was extremely looking forward to the scene of paul witnessing his mother go through the trial the entire seitch watching the sharing of the water instead we got the younger generations open mockery of the practice and it was so jarring i understand the need to push the theme for a movie differently than a book but it came across very heavy handed i think its more powerful to see the religious divide happen after paul has been emperor for many years in messiah the people then realize how their religion had been manipulated duringafter the jihad paul used them for his own purposes and many of them died as a result instead some of them already knew they were getting used then got convinced he was the messiah then are going to be turned again the bene gesserit are displayed as so heavy handed as well and far less skilled than the books all of jessicas dialogue was extremely out of character  we also miss the fact the paul was still undergoing extensive bene gesserit training while they were with the fremen the way they were saying out loud to use the fremen to their advantage while they were all right there was shocking stilgar reduced to comedic relief no harah just the random mean girl who was friends with chani chani not being sayyadina chani overall felt very out of character compared to the book as well the water discipline was slack i know i did not just see steam leaving the coffee pot in the open air no face covers hello are we still on dune with fremen thats the biggest thing i cant remember if this was said exactly in the book but reverend mother saying princes irulan was her brightest student and then propping her up to be that girl but in the book she was the worst player in the court paul created ignoring the spice cycle and just threatening to nuke the spice fields ignoring the commercial aspect of pauls takeover the tone was more our rag tag team of rebel fighters go guns blazing with this new guy we just met and his mom and not our disguised and sophisticated population of millions of military disciplined religious warriors are heavily psychologically conditioned for centuries and manipulated to the whims of a drug fueled ultraneurodivergent human prodigy to take over the entire galaxy  i will say house harkonnen was very well displayed the totalitarian violent and sexual nature of their society was perfectly depicted as were the characters  the majesty of the sandworms and the end battle were very well done  i will agree with the decision to not have a three year old alia kill baron harkonnen as i think it would have ended up like a renesme situation lol  they swept away some of the grandeur and mystic that was so beautiful about the first film and i feel like watching them back to back would feel a bit incongruent again if this was intentionally done to display the themes of the story i think it was overdone and doesnt leave me very excited about the content of any potential sequels
Mar 2 2024,positive,fav movie of all time
Mar 2 2024,positive,truly one of the best picutres ive ever seen visually stunning scored beautifully sound fx shake you to your core moving visceral
Mar 2 2024,positive,unbelievable cinematography and outstanding cast one of the best movies ive seen in a long long time
Mar 2 2024,negative,garbage moviewhat a waste of time and money
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing this is a must see
Mar 2 2024,positive,warning spoilers    the visuals were stunning and the action was great  i didnt like zendayas acting it was weak and she just seemed like an angry teenager instead of an adult  there were parts taken out and it seemed callous  paul takes the hand of the emperors daughter as a gesture and retaining of power but he does explain to her that the marriage is by name only this wasnt clear in the movie and it just sets up chani to be mad at him  just so that the movie can create this side story  paul should have seen this coming after the water of life but this movie he allows it  the ending of the movie seems like it sets up to be another movie as it seems chanis story isnt done yet
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is outstanding from the actors to the story and the visuals are awesome 1010 a must see
Mar 2 2024,positive,so dark yet so beautiful
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a stunning visual masterpiece and will be a legendary trilogy if the third delivers this was elevated after the first film and moved much faster than expected with characters and plot this is beyond oscar worthy between acting makeup  specialeffects expect an action packed film and new characters
Mar 2 2024,positive,what an experience in dolby cant wait for the next one
Mar 2 2024,positive,as a fan of the dune books and a lover of epic fantasy and sci fi i have never felt so in awe coming out of the cinema it was truly transcendent everything i wanted and more and now possibly my favourite film of all time
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing  best movie ive seen in years
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the greatest films ever made 
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic improved upon the original by helping fill in gaps that were unable to be explained ended at perfect point for seamless transition to next part of story
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is a masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,solid movie storyline progression is great not much filler
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best theatre experience i had in a long time make sure you watch this in the biggest screen possible because this movie demands it
Mar 2 2024,positive,if you liked the first movie you will love the 2nd cinematic masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing storyline fantastic action great villains amplified scale flawless special effects this is how movie making is done
Mar 2 2024,positive,as good or better than part 1 excellent plots  exceptional actorsacting and awesome special effects  no one got out of their seat after the movie started
Mar 2 2024,positive,fanfckingtastic movie absolute must see
Mar 2 2024,positive,the definition of a movie that is better in the theaters more of a wow factor than the first one 88100 for me
Mar 2 2024,positive,one of the best movies of my generation  cannot wait to watch it several more times this movie is why you still go to movies
Mar 2 2024,positive,possibly the best movie ive ever seen
Mar 2 2024,positive,was a good viewing experience but im not so into the tragic messiah religious narrative
Mar 2 2024,positive,well worth it only complaint is christopher walken is miscast he plays the emperor as a weak befuddled man no one in that atmosphere of treachery would have that kind of personality
Mar 2 2024,positive,very long acting was ok some of the special effects were an eyesore as a person who has read the book 3 times and watched every adaptation honestly i prefer the miniseries to this one why because the extremely bizarre sound effects and color palette made this movie give off a very sinister vibe whereas the miniseries vibe is more umexotic and exciting i guess    the book definitely has the negative strain but tbh it also has the exciting vibe that isnt really very present here the tone of this movie veers closer to the second book djne messiah which is just so cynical you could vomit    um so yeah the movie could pass the time i dont recommend watching in theaters bc the sound effects are super screwed up but watch it at home if you like also check out the miniseries if you want to see a less sinister version    on a side note i kinda feel like muslim fundamentalists might feel offended at this film
Mar 2 2024,positive,an absolute work of art the acting is powerful from all sides the sound design communicates every emotion the director intended with perfect timing the beautiful cinematography and iconic art direction will cement this films place as a classic and a once in a generation experience
Mar 2 2024,positive,i waited until wednesday to see the first dune so i wouldnt need to wait to see part 2 it was worth it part 1 is a build up and part 2 is the release and is it so good i dont see how some people find it slow there is so much action and things happening in this one i think the pacing and writing is perfect but the cinematography is an 1110 i watched it with the popcorn bucket
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a true gem such an amazing story and visual picture
Mar 2 2024,positive,beautiful cinematography 
Mar 2 2024,positive,astounding masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,positive,what an amazing movie best movie i have seen in the last 10 years 1010
Mar 2 2024,positive,kinda hard to imagine no blood getting thrown everywhere with all the slashing but whadda ya expect with pg13 rating
Mar 2 2024,positive,so good really close to the books and epic as it could get
Mar 2 2024,positive,im not going to say much the first part was better this movie added different plot twists but then cut off entire subplots from the book visually stunning but too fast paced normally a fast paced plot keeps you on edge but in this case everything was developed so quickly that you simply moved on to the next plot point im sure their will be plenty of fans especially those that never read the book but imho it was missing something i would dare say it had no heart the movie just seemed to go through the motions eliminate character a  and give hisher part to character b check add a plot twist does it make sense who cares check
Mar 2 2024,positive,now i see what everyone was raving about this film is absolutely worth seeing in imax or dolby if you prefer i already have another ticket to see it again in 3 days the story the acting the actors the emotion in every scene the mindblowing cinematography i meanwow justwow how long until the next comes out sad face 
Mar 2 2024,positive,part two is far better than part one action sequences and scenes of paul with fremin gives goosebumps it is definitely a visual treat and some scenes make you say wow    there are less dialogues in the movie but the one which are in the movie are meaningfulsome awesome you die like an animal one was cruel one    i didnt understand why paul calls feyd rautha as cousin when he is actually his uncle
Mar 2 2024,positive,1010 great story telling
Mar 2 2024,positive,such an amazing cinematic experience i liked the first movie but this one exceeded all my expectations the camer shots in this movie were intentional and emotionally moving even when there was no dialog im so impressed
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is great lots of action great plot and and ending that will have you thinking about it for days a bit long though
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie the acting was crazy the action was crazy
Mar 2 2024,negative,too long  slow pacing  story line focused too much on benne gesserit and other minor characters  felt like too many scenes were seperate from the story  amazing cinematography
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing cinematography very suspenseful great action and acting one of best films of the year the music and sound
Mar 2 2024,positive,great battles but because it was sooooo long after the first one and didnt have the same sound as the first one it was not better  dont get me wrong it is a good movie but not as good as part one

Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie was visually striking it set up the suspense in multiple ways through an amazing narration  acting experience and musicsound track i was on the edge of my seat the entire time
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a once in a decade scifi film a brilliant adaptation and this deserves all of the oscars as well as other praise this gets if youre just not into scifi or mature story telling then it may not be for you however you can still take away the perfect visuals and technical aspects of this film surpassing its predecessor wonderful story and exciting and satisfying conclusion to the first book yet leaving it open for the next 1010
Mar 2 2024,positive,such a 5 star movie in every way the wait was so worth it it sure didnt feel like almost 3hrs i wanted more at the end the music wasnt as good as the first one but it was still good it was such a wonderful escape this is a must see for any science fiction fan
Mar 2 2024,positive,i wanted to be obsessed with it but i was not obsessed good not great imo they changed too many things from the book you have a sciencefiction masterpiece why would you change things it had amazing cinematography and set design and costumes and it had some great moments but it also squandered a bunch of moments that were supposed to be big then the ending felt anticlimactic and incomplete which is especially lame after given that audiences have been waiting since part one for resolution it felt like they wanted zendaya to be a bigger character than she was and they already stretched how much that character does compared to the book but they stretched it way too far and it was irritating
Mar 2 2024,positive,really just an incredible cinematic experience nothing to really complain about its marvelous captures the same vibes and lives up to the hype of the mcu films during their peak  eager for the third installment once this makes 500m at the box office
Mar 2 2024,positive,wow  perfect  far exceeded my hopes let alone my expectations  truly outstanding as a film and true to the books deep in character plot and human themes of struggle faith and power   very impressive
Mar 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed part 1 which i watched twice but part 2 just blew me away in a phenomenal way the cinematography and musical score was perfect and the story while not a line by line copy of the super dense novel its based on it remains true to the spirit of the source material this is probably the best sci fi space opera movie i have seen in my lifetime so far i hope their will be a dube part 3 that covers the next 2 books of the dune series
Mar 2 2024,positive,its good very much overhyped but good
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinimatogrophy  great acting great characters  wonderful vision  must be seen on big screen big d etc
Mar 2 2024,positive,im not sure where to start this movie offered everything and more that you would expect after the first the music was phenomenal the directing was excellent acting performances and reflected perfected emotional maturity the religious zeal portrayed was moving perhaps the best movie i have ever seen legitimately
Mar 2 2024,positive,at first this movie stared out slow much less like the first one which was action packed from the get go however the buildup and suspense was captivating and however skeptical i was this movie blew it out of the water i didnt think this movie could ever be better than the first one coming from someone who has read the books but it was the ending was filled with action packed scenes that never lost my gaze for a second and ive never been on the edge of my seat before until this movie it is a must see and could be considered one of the greatest of all time a honest 5 star and the theater should have been more packed injustice to the the directors and film writers who put together this absolute masterpiece of a film
Mar 2 2024,positive,if there was a word stronger than perfection it would be the word i use to describe dune 2 rebecca ferguson proves yet again why shes my favorite actress with another dazzling performance the score the whole crew and the cinematography makes this one of the best movies of all time
Mar 2 2024,negative,such slow pacing im sure im in the minority but it felt like a lot of filler compared to the first film and really seemed to want to inflate the timothy hype which i do not get visually it was great but drug on and could have been tightened up imo
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece it is amazing what someone can do when they stick to the source material hollywood take note this is how you make a movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,i wouldnt have noticed if this movie was 24hrs long i want a 24hr version like what am i to do with my life until i see this again

Mar 2 2024,positive,exceptional in every way and be sure to see it in an imax if you want the full effect
Mar 2 2024,positive,good action parts of the story line were difficult to follow
Mar 2 2024,neutral,visually satisfying but despite the length the script has a few jumps in logic story of the messiah being recognized as such by the fremen is predictable characters lack depth and it feels like the movie is just trying to go through the motions of the main points in the novel without getting a life of its own not a bad movie but not something youll want to watch again or that gives you any lasting emotions or impressions as soon as you leave the theater
Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing i want to watch it many more times at the cinema

Mar 2 2024,positive,epic masterpiece must be watched in theaters
Mar 2 2024,positive,lisan algaib    okay so that was well worth the wait im not spoiling anything this movie like the last one hits you like a movie from another universe   probably one of the best scifi movies to come out in a long time theres so much to chew on with this story i love thinking about it and i havent stopped thinking about it since i left the theater     55 am going to see it again     dreams are messages from the deep

Mar 2 2024,positive,amazing movie start to finish see on the biggest screen possible
Mar 2 2024,positive,villeneuves dune is a scifi epic like lawrence of arabia was in another era   his adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece was enthralling in its depiction of the density of the novel  cant wait to see it a second time
Mar 2 2024,positive,this could be the greatest film ive ever seen i spent the whole 2 hours and 46 on the edge of my seat its a movie that submerges you when you come out of the theatre it almost feels as if your stranger to your own world everything the lighting the wardrobe the sound the visuals it makes you feel as if your there along the characters who are also incredibly portrait by an amazing cast    btw this opinion comes from a 16 year old who knows nothing about cinematography and just wanted to say how much she enjoyed the movie
Mar 2 2024,neutral,they ruined the spiritual meaning of this movie they sabotage the romance and turned the hero into a warlord he was supposed to be a spiritual leader too much attention to harkonnen lives and art the whole movie was pretty dark the only think thay saved this movie was the art and the amazing acting zendaya
Mar 2 2024,positive,cinematography was awesome and the story line was good it departed from the book a bit  in a good way i hope they make a part 3 there is much more to cover
Mar 2 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant cinematography  even better than part one the writing and directing were magnificent  the action sequences were very exciting and compelling the computer graphics were flawless i will definitely go see this movie again
Mar 2 2024,positive,as a fanatical lover of the books i have been yearning for this film for about 25 years not only did it monumentally deliver from a dune fans perspective as a pure cinematic experience this was unparalleled to anything i have ever had the privilege of seeing on the big screen a new bar has been set for me as to what i would ever consider to be a cinematic masterpiece every aspect of the film was exceptional from the masterful handling of the complex source material which i already love to the extraordinary score to the faultless acting performances across the entire cast and perhaps the most impressive element of all the truly spectacular cinematography this is without a doubt my new favorite film of all time and i expect may only be rivaled by messiah which i have no doubt will be given the go ahead after this thank you denis and the entire dune team for this astonishing gift this was filmmaking from another planet

Mar 2 2024,positive,just a fantastic film with some minor changes with allya and the ending but great movie in the part one jessica was my least favorite character of the movie by how she as protraded but in this movie she really is a bad ass i thought it was really well paced the action shots looked amazing and the move just felt right the princess in this movie is better rounded out than in the older versions this really good movie has a lot of storytelling and its well paced not just second thought great character development all around and i highly recommend it
Mar 2 2024,positive,thoroughly enjoyable even if you didnt read the books you will like this i know people were kind of bummed that the first movie was kind of slow this makes up for it in spades
Mar 2 2024,positive,visuals sfx acting and a score that are all without a doubt stunning this film truly is a modern marvel in the realm of cinema however unlike in the first film many more liberties were taken with the source material with none of the changes succeeding in improving on what was already written in the pages of the original novel this film is likely to be divisive amongst fans and filmgoers alike who crave well crafted artistic movies with passion but also want to see accurate depictions of their favorite novels on screen 355
Mar 2 2024,positive,best sci fi action adventure since empire strikes back imo about 20 minutes too long and they miscast christopher walken as the emperor still this is an a film  absolutely stunning visuals unexpected but welcomed comedy cool action and more it is very intense especially in the beginning there is no recap so rewatch part 1 before you go
Mar 2 2024,negative,it is essentially a great product of marketing
Mar 2 2024,positive,this film is made to enjoyed in the theater  for sure  visually stunning and impressive and i dont just mean timothee chalamet i like how the story is being told one thing irked me the overdramatized frown on zendayas for almost the entire movie  anyway i liked it and i look forward to part 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic scifi masterpiece of the highest order
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was action pack and it didnt seem like a long movie   i was angry when it was over i wanted more  for those who read the books a few things changed or left out but it didnt hurt the story  i highly recommend seeing this movie  it is entertainment at its best
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was good from the beginning to end the acting was excellent and believable it was better than part 1 and is the best movie ive seen since 2019
Mar 2 2024,positive,a truly cinema experience the story was great some aspects of the story were rushed but overall it was a worthwhile experience one of very few movies of modern times that you should definitely watch in a cinema
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic  amazing im deep in the spice  highly recommend see it in imax or go home
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was everything i hoped it would be and more 
Mar 2 2024,positive,the only thing that i was disappointed in was that it over a 9 month period where the book its over a 5 to 7 year period i wont be a spoiler but the one thing that they left out was at the end where he physically slams his cousin
Mar 2 2024,positive,incredible film a must see in imax
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie offered nothing but visuals and aesthetic none of the character development felt real or understandable there are straight up characters that play convenient story progression devices but is coated up and given screen time to make us believe they play a role so much more than cameos also it took up so many convenient story devices ahem the desert nukes absolutely disappointing considering how well the first movie was set up and thought had so much potential
Mar 2 2024,negative,didnt  follow the story terrible directingsimply sensationalismnot good
Mar 2 2024,positive,what a refreshing movie  this was a joy to watch and will watch again  it was just awesome  no blatant sex scene for no reason no stupid dei  just a great movie with a very diverse cast because that is what the movie called for  it worked i just hope they keep rolling these out for a while
Mar 2 2024,positive,its just breathtaking  sound and picture im just blown away  one of the best sifi and already my number one movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,incredible usually i dont see movies more than once in the theater but i will be seeing dune 2 again 
Mar 2 2024,positive,special effects and lots of vibrational effects dont make u for story inconsistencies and endless lengthto not even resolve ityawn
Mar 2 2024,neutral,love the vfx best ive seen in a long time admittedly im not familiar with the books so with that said this movie is very uneven and kind of boring aside from zendayas formidable presence on screen and the cool overload of the cinematography i left this movie shrugging my shoulders
Mar 2 2024,negative,never been a fan of those types of films we went to see it to give it another chance i know i will never goto another one ever again not for us
Mar 2 2024,positive,epic visually stunning terrific performances by timothy chalamet javier bardem and austin butler in particular denis and hans bring their a game cant wait for dune messiah 
Mar 2 2024,positive,you cant compare this movie with any other one its a film with action but constant action also the score the soundtracks in generall just perfect while the story with the outstanding  acting is just crazy good
Mar 2 2024,positive,big blockbuster  lots of visuals good unpredictable story  futuristic yet classic storyline  great actors both mature and young  very satisfying  movie night
Mar 2 2024,positive,great rendition of herberts book the minor changes work perfectly the music is fantastic hope villeneuve is able to make dune messiah
Mar 2 2024,positive,i cannot believe how good this movie is one of those awe moments you will remember for  many many years to come
Mar 2 2024,positive,even better the second time imax 70mm too
Mar 2 2024,positive,it was awesome and i chose the right movie to see for my first time in imax
Mar 2 2024,positive,an excellent film adaptation of a really complex story
Mar 2 2024,positive,much more entertaining than the first one
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two is amezing epic spectacular you truly have to see it in the cinema with the big screen and speakers a real cinematic experience    even the parts changed from the book are well made like alia the one thing that shocked me is a little different from the book but it can make a big difference for how the third movie will be    timothée is really good best performance that i showed from him in a while    zendaya also an amazing performance one of her best    austin scared me this is a compliment    florence had more screens time that i thought and she gave irulan an intensity and an understanding of her character just will little dialogue thanks to the ameziing performan by florence that make you know was she thinking just with her eyes    rebecca incredible truly what a performance
Mar 2 2024,positive,i throughly enjoyed this movie with that being said i havent read the book so please keep that in mind when reading this review the actors did a fantastic job and the visual effects were absolutely stunning the story was intriguing i liked it a lot more than the first movie the action kept me on the edge of my seat and it was just such a great experience i highly recommend dune part two
Mar 2 2024,positive,if you like epic battle scenes with plenty of sword play and acrobatic sequences youll like this more than i did  i was looking at my watch towards the end the visuals were beautifully done the sound was great and the actors all did a fine job  i found the 1984 dune more entertaining though i understand it wasnt as true to the book  the  ending was unsatisfying so i guess ill watch for dune 3
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinema experience fantastic visuals amazing sound and performances richly detailed costumes inventive digital creations its long but doesnt feel it  i found the story overly complicated but didnt care as it was never dull i also couldnt clearly hear a lot of the mumbled dialog but again it never detracted from the journey as i find a lot of scifi dialog to be rather clichéd and silly   wonderful action sequences   this is a film to see in a cinema or imax if you have one  its first class entertainment
Mar 2 2024,positive,the movie was amazing and very close to the book action throughout the entire movie and kept me at the edge of my seat some of the scenes were better than i had imagined them from reading the book film is a master piece
Mar 2 2024,positive,simply amazing when i left the theaters i knew that this one instantly entered my top 15 best movies ever list its just amazing so you should watch it thats it every character is well written the world is great and the action scenes the action scenes were some of the best ive ever seen its amazing period
Mar 2 2024,positive,dune part two stands as a remarkable cinematic achievement securing a flawless 10 out of 10 rating it seamlessly translates the essence of the source material echoing the intricate narrative of the book while paying a heartfelt homage to the iconic dune rts game the film unfolds with meticulously crafted scenes each contributing to an immersive scifi experience that transcends expectations from the grandeur of the desert landscapes to the nuanced performances dune part two solidifies its place as a masterful continuation captivating audiences with its artful storytelling and visual brilliance
Mar 2 2024,positive,true to part 1 and the book excellent wormride
Mar 2 2024,positive,great cinematography and a very good story that leaves you on the edge of your seat and zoned in at all times
Mar 2 2024,positive,great movie absolutely must have
Mar 2 2024,positive,brilliant nothing more can be said
Mar 2 2024,positive,just brilliant no other words best film ive seen since dune part 1 the score is amazing echoes of dune 1 but continue on to tie the films together and theres no romantic notion of paul by the end of the film hes accepted his fate and embraced it knowing the consequences hoping for dune messiah soon 
Mar 2 2024,positive,magnificent superb well done i was captivated every second throughout the entire movie ibwas on an adrenaline high for 4 hours after the movie highly recommend even if you havent seen part one  
Mar 2 2024,positive,great conclusion to what was setup in part 1 if you enjoyed the part 1 you will enjoy part 2
Mar 2 2024,negative,i loved the dune books and reread them multiple times  they are epic    even though there is way too much content to put into a movie i found the first installation really engaging and told enough of the story well enough to leave me excited for dune 2  knowing the story helped but i didnt find myself lost by the movie  watched it again at home last week and my adult son was hooked within the first 20 minutes  he has never read the books or seen other dune movies    dune 2 was 1 hour of content spread over 3 tedious hours  i appreciated the aesthetic but the palette and intensity that seemed to add to the first movie only served to make the second an unrelentingly exhausting tedious disappointing experience    i wasnt engaged in the characters or the story i just wanted it to end    perhaps if id splurged on the worm popcorn bucket 
Mar 2 2024,positive,this is a good movie but i hate to put that in there i like the ending in the original movie i guess im just prejudiced
Mar 2 2024,positive,an absolutely perfect movie for a follow up nothing hollywood has produced can compare to this epic scifi film very happy to welcome the duneuniverse to fellow nerds not a multiverse   i wonder what yt channel the first the last the nerdom will say about it fln
Mar 2 2024,positive,just blown away impossible to adapt source material done justice liberties taken with the book i felt justified by the medium but didnt take away from the core story sure i wish someone could make a 10 hour movie to give us everything thufir weirding modules etcetera but being a sane person who can get over myself for long enough to not let perfect be the enemy of good just so happy with this movie    if i had a singular gripe i felt the ending trying too hard to segue into the greenlit messiah was clunky the book ends open enough but didnt beg for a sequel i like the sequels but fear that they start only getting harder to adapt  so ending part 2 as it did has me worried that failure to stick the landing with messiah will force the two wonderful movies we have now to be considered in the future only as part of a trilogy that should have stopped at 2 and that would be a shame id love to be proven wrong though and villenueve has really impressed me this far    bravo
Mar 2 2024,positive,such an incredible story and so well done will go watch it again
Mar 2 2024,positive,had some interesting twists but followed the original narrative quite well visually stunning and the use of loud bursts adds to to thrill that was the dune ii production great movie
Mar 2 2024,positive,what can i say that everyone else hasnt it was amazing and i loved it for sure it was long but even with the midmovie pee break it felt like the perfect length for the amount of story condensed into the film it didnt feel rushed or dragged out which was my biggest fear the scope of the film was epic and awe inspiring it makes me both anticipate and fear messiah but ill definitely see it good or bad
Mar 2 2024,positive,best movie ive seen a long time couldnt have done a better adaptation
Mar 2 2024,positive,the star wars or lord of the rings of today spectacular narrative acting and hans zimmers score brings it all together who knew a film could look even more stunning than dune part 1 imax is essential the must see of our time
Mar 2 2024,positive,an epic movie  visualy stunning amazing story not rushed and never boring 1010
Mar 2 2024,positive,there is absolutely no negative review a critic could give to dune 2 that would not be a testament to their selfimportance if they say they didnt like this movie they were only thinking about what they could achieve for themselves by doing so namely a reputation for rebelliousness
Mar 2 2024,positive,i knew i was going to enjoy this film but i did not expect to come away from it feeling it was one of the best sci fi films ever made dune part two is a phenomenal piece of cinematic art pure movie magic a perfect marriage of source material artistic vision and the big budget to realise it this is what happens when producers and executives get the hell out of the way and let true filmmakers do their work dune part two is epic haunting emotional devastating exciting dense bizarre philosophical and artistic this will become a timeless classic  and if they manage to make dune part three it will become a benchmark cinematic trilogy that will be studied and talked about for years to come its the first movie in 20 years that i wanted to walk out and buy another ticket straight away its everything i hoped it would be and more i cant believe it was almost 3 hours long and i wanted it to keep going bravo denis and co bring on part three
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely loved it excellent action and acting an aweinspiring culmination of everything that was set up in part 1
Mar 1 2024,positive,seamlessly picks up where dune left off  like its predecessor this sequel is cinematically beautiful with a nice balance of expository plotlines and well choreographed fight and battle scenes chalamet and zendaya have true a chemistry and connection which carries us emotionally across the sands and fortifies our faith in the good guys of course the tale ends without the closure we yearn for but since we have been promised a part 3 from director villenueve and warner bros it will surely be met with as much anticipation as was the last installment of the star wars trilogy these dune films are as fine an adaptation as they come bravo
Mar 1 2024,positive,definitely the best movie in several years by a long shot
Mar 1 2024,positive,solid worth it in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,i have rated some sequels in my time as awesome the empire strikes back terminator 2 this is as good if not better this is now a top 5 film for me of all times visually it is disgustingly good i felt like i dont ever want to forget what i witnessed if you dont watch this in imax you are missing out i will be watching this again more than once films like this dont come around often watch it and thank me later oh if you arent a dune fan or havent watched the first one i highly recommend you catch up that or dont bother haters will always hate regardless
Mar 1 2024,positive,the scope of this film is immeasurable the establishing shots the cinematography the visuals the world building the sound design and the score are all astounding what holds this movie back is its pacing and inability to hold the weight of its own story
Mar 1 2024,negative,totally confused by this movie it was creepy and boring
Mar 1 2024,positive,beautiful composition stunning cinematography
Mar 1 2024,positive,denis villeneuve delivers a spectacle that transcends and ascends the movie world my expectations were already high and not only did meet them it went beyond this is now my favourite movie of all time im calling i cannot fathom another movie getting best picture in 2025 dune part two is a masterpiece
Mar 1 2024,positive,awesome movie brilliant cinematography
Mar 1 2024,positive,the most epic movie i have ever seen
Mar 1 2024,negative,awful so fragmented i felt like id missed huge parts of the plot inbetween scenes everything was so rushed i felt nothing for any of the characters or their story
Mar 1 2024,positive,the cast and acting are perfect the best scifi movie ive seen since a long time a must see in theatre you wont regret it
Mar 1 2024,positive,the second part completely left the bookthere escape in the aero copter to the south was a complete journey the still suits were left in the copter there weirding way of fighting was never mentioned his drinking of the water of life was done outside in the desert and he was saluted by the worms the fight sequence at the end was wrong also it was hi sister who killed the baron i loved the part where in the book he said to the benageserit mother  that the dark place you are afraid to look there you will find meat fayds death he cracks him in half along with the floor and looks to the sky and makes start raining that is when they all see he is the kwisatz haderach
Mar 1 2024,positive,even better than part 1 and i didnt even think that was possible the cast is incredible and absolutely makes the show the directing creativity is also unique and gripping
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie lives up to the hype a great movie on an epic scale that is executed brilliantly great cinematography was on full display which is expected with dennis villeneuve dune 2 pushes the limits with stunning shots and well thought out action scenes you can truly feel the stakes throughout the movie the cast shines from almost every scene the standouts being chalamet  austin butler butler making an outstanding antagonist i can tell that there is some heath ledger inspiration behind his performance this movie is truly a spectacle that i recommend everyone who enjoys cinema to see on there nearest imax screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,what an amazing epic project scifi at its highest peak
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie has crazy scale and scope full of action and is just like the first but pumped up 1000 notches
Mar 1 2024,positive,star wars without the fun giant worms cannibalism dust clouds tattoos very sharp pointy things a convenient sandstorm terrific soundtrack you can count the number of smiles on one hand best movie with the word dune in the title ive ever seen
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 is just short of perfection the only fault i can find is that its not long enough
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved everything about this denis has proved himself once again to be a master of his craft i could go on and on about how amazing everyone in this film is but all other reviews have put it better than i can timothée and zendaya were just incredible i felt everything paul and chani were feeling along with them 10010     long live cinema
Mar 1 2024,positive,must see in one breath from beginning to end
Mar 1 2024,positive,best sci fi movie in a loooong time
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing see this in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing  not your typical ending but no less thrilling
Mar 1 2024,positive,visually stunning and beautiful overfly story and acting
Mar 1 2024,positive,incredible follow up to part 1 another scifi epic that must be experienced at the theater for full appreciation
Mar 1 2024,positive,what a bad ass movie go see it doesnt matter who you are and what you like 
Mar 1 2024,positive,a beautiful growth form the first much more action   i cant wait till the third film
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 exceeds my expectations and is even better than part 1 it will be the best movie for 2024 im already looking forward to part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,while this second part veers from the book in some crucial ways the characterfocus of the story and the believability of the actors is unmatched denis villenueve does some of his best directing and includes shots that take your breath away and leave you on the edge of your seat austin butler stole the show but everyone down to the most minor characters nailed their roles highly recommend seeing this second installment on the big screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,the whole movie is breathtaking
Mar 1 2024,positive,as a fan of the book i am giving this 110 changes made from the book still fit in perfectly great visuals and direction couldnt have wished for more thank you villeneuve
Mar 1 2024,negative,her face never loses her scoulit dragsthough it goes more in depthits boring the sound is the only thing that keeps it aliveit doesnt impress me muchcould have waited til the hbo releasefrfr
Mar 1 2024,positive,even better than the first beautifully shot and on such a grand scale expect cheers and even laughs  one small piece of overacting keeps it from being a full 5 stars
Mar 1 2024,positive,excellent filmmaking by a master passionate about the book where he goes off book he is staying on the point of the books the messages are not subtle thankfully complex gravitas story with more meaning than good vs evil beautiful cinematography but requires a long attention span to get a great payoff
Mar 1 2024,positive,i was not particularly enamored with part one of dune because i felt it was bland and did not have much purpose to itself and then i saw this  unquestionably the superior of the two parts as it instantly makes part one better  the characters and their motives are better understood the conflicts are greater and more pronounced and the plot is more clear  after dune part one i had little interest going into dune part two after dune part two there needs to be a part three
Mar 1 2024,positive,better than part 1 which is not too common thrilling action scenes great story line its been long since i saw such a great movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,captures dune saga well far too loud though
Mar 1 2024,positive,perfect conclusion to part 1 especially liked the sandworm riding scenes followed the book in most places except the character alia but it seemed more streamlined and fast in the book years have passed but in the movie jessica is still pregnant acceptable from a storytelling point of view the emphasis on the bene gesserit is noticeable and pretty cool especially the conversation between irulan and mohiam about the fall of house atreides
Mar 1 2024,positive,a must see and should be adapted as a tv series a beautifully presented story with great acting visually enthralling scenes and a superb visionary presentation cant wait to watch it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,incredible i cant believe how amazing this was
Mar 1 2024,positive,a perfect film one of the best sequels out there villanueves direction greig frasers cinematography and zimmers score all brings out a spectacular cinematic experience that will be remembered for decades 
Mar 1 2024,positive,really beautiful movie great cinematography i love how cheney and jessica are much stronger characters good editing out of stuff from the book that might be too complicated to depict
Mar 1 2024,positive,did not like the deviation from the original story good action and graphics
Mar 1 2024,positive,what a film this is almost as good as we could have possibly hoped for as a fan of the books this is the film ive waited decades for     there were a few changes from the book but overall it was spectacular if you love sciencefiction go see this film
Mar 1 2024,positive,the best cinematic experience ive ever had dune part 2 is beyond visually stunning  its a work of art the cinematography is supercharged by masterful acting notably from timothee chalamet he truly gave a performance of a lifetime best actor incoming his scenes with the fremen especially in the second half of the film are breathtakingly intense     pauls evolving relationship with the fremen and vice versa is incredible to witness on the screen when i read the book it was hard to wrap my mind around how the fremen actually behaved around paul as he became their messiah in dune part two their religious fervor and devotion is on full beautiful display a major step up from the book in this regard    the plot went a little too fast for my liking but i understand the need to condense the second part of the novel into one movie regardless dune part 2 is a masterpiece that will go down in scifi and general cinematic history as one of the greats
Mar 1 2024,positive,this is where cinema is made for gorgeous worldbuilding amazing story perfect pacing and otherworldly acting if star wars is a sci fi adventure fantasy movie dune is the adult politic war beliefs romance cfi fi movie a must see
Mar 1 2024,positive,if youre not familiar with the story it gives matrix star wars and avatar  if you see it do it in imax  the movie is almost 3 hours long i still left wanting more
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal book readers will be pleased as pt 2 concludes the first book tastefully despite some deviations from the original source material the month of march just started and this will clearly be one of the best films of the year
Mar 1 2024,positive,the film was amazing paul atreides did a exactly acting loved zendaya performance in the film and other characters in the films love the scene where zendaya helping paul atreides and other characters in the flim helping out paul atreides on journey of him becoming a fate of life in his choice the villain  australia butler who played feydrautha did a amazing job love the scene where we see him fighting in the battle and love the scene where he fights paul atreides to see who wether king to live or fate
Mar 1 2024,positive,a masterpiece nearly flawless the performances cinematography special effects scoreamazing will probably sweep 2024 oscars see it on the biggest screen possible and strap in
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing movie  incredible cinematography great script powerful sound worthy of multiple trips to the theater
Mar 1 2024,positive,really epic unfortunately i went in without seeing the first it was my first time experiencing a movie like that so i would advise people to see the first movie for all the context
Mar 1 2024,positive,its as good as everyone says
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic this is a cinema experience movie  and to get the full impact you have to watch this movie on the biggest of screens  the soundtrack by hans zimmer again very much adds to the experience and helps immerse you into these wonderful worlds  a grown ups sci fi movie that definitely packs a punch and comes with added spice
Mar 1 2024,positive,just watched dune 2 in bremengermany in the original english version what are you waiting for  go and watch it
Mar 1 2024,neutral,i wouldnt watch it again if i didnt know what it was about this movie would not really have explained it to me im guessing to the average older viewer that paul timothy seemed like the leader of the cult in guyanasp
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune 2 is a superior movie to dune 1 which was once a wonderful movie thats what a scifi fan expects from a book adaptation in addition to the perfect soundtrack by hans zimmer very well constructed movie with passing the right emotion in the action and cgi scenes
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing continuation of an already amazing movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,incredible from start to finish i love denis adaption and although he changed a few important aspects he really did dune and the dune fans proud the stellar cast shone through all standing out in their own way and doing their characters justice hans zimmers score was quite literally other worldly  of course thank you to everyone else who worked on making the movie what it was i am so glad that i got to see this movie in the cinema on the big screen and i am already excitedly anticipating dune messiah
Mar 1 2024,positive,as long as you did not love the book youll probably enjoy it as a book purist i am extremely disappointed in the choices villanueve made  he changed major aspects of several storylines that left me feeling i watched a similar concept to the book that took place in the same universe but was ultimately not about the book characters i love aside from the massive recharacterization of several main players the pacing was also off with odd jumps and lulls and side stories that didnt expand the narrative for me i absolutely loved dune part one but part two was such a let down
Mar 1 2024,positive,worms good go see the worms
Mar 1 2024,positive,great part 2 and continuation of the first movie
Mar 1 2024,negative,dune 2 was terrible it is mystifying to me why the basic plot should be warped and completely inverted the book has sold millions and millions of copies and the 2nd movies bares only a passing resemblance to herberts classic its like some hollywood director is like im going to remake romeo and juliet but totally change how it turns out ridiculous
Mar 1 2024,negative,after extensive research im convinced someone is paying for good reviews the movies i love score 30 70 and boring movies like dune score 94 theres no one someone watch that and thought this is incredible if so i truly dont understand the humans in this world this movie sucks ive fallen asleep 3 times trying to watch it only movie to put me to sleep more was gravity the first dune was okay this one is boring get excited with 1hr left for more sand and 2 secs of josh brolin
Mar 1 2024,positive,there has to be a part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,i seen the movie last night and it and stellar is an understatement its been a long time that i seen a movie where i was so focused on the story and the visuals if frank herbert was alive i think he would be proud that a movie based off his book came to life the way it did
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing  im still processing  ive been a massive dune fan for a very long time  this is one of the best novel adaptations ive ever seen i really wish villeneuve would do at least the first four books  i know hes thinking about dune messiah but god emperor of dune would be phenomenal in his hands  im ready to go back and watch it again tonight
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie and its cast is destined to be alltimers  denis villeneuve brings the beloved scifi novel to the big screen as truthfully as he should went to see it with the highest of expectations and still it exceeded it long live the fighters
Mar 1 2024,positive,villenewve knocked it ouf the park yes
Mar 1 2024,positive,i read most of the dune books as a young man  i liked the way the movie followed the outline of the story
Mar 1 2024,positive,i had a great time at the movie theater the cast the scenery and the music is fanastic
Mar 1 2024,positive,an epic in every sense of the word  the vlending of stunning visuals and music bring a poetic undertone to the conflict at hand  the performances are uniformly excellent
Mar 1 2024,positive,this is a rare movie in which the build up from the first movie truly pays off there were so many instances in this film where i thought would be the cliffhanger ending not only did the story keep going but it kept getting better and better by the end i found that my jaw had dropped and i had to willfully tell myself to close it as i couldnt believe what i was watching modern cinema at its finest
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing film lived up to what i remember from the book from decades ago another gorgeous film and couldnt believe its been 3 years since the last and now have to wait for messiah to come out ugh    amazing and beautiful film
Mar 1 2024,positive,the benchmark for scifi films moving forward  1010 on almost every level
Mar 1 2024,positive,it really helped to rewatch dune i prior
Mar 1 2024,positive,masterpiece    i cannot say anything else what a second part frank herbert must be smiling right now    villeneuve i love you
Mar 1 2024,positive,outstanding in imax i loved the great scenes timothée chalamet was outstanding hes a great actor i highly recommend watching this movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,this film was adapted well from the novel the changes the director made were a little annoying if you wanted it to follow the novel but the story was still til well  the only issue that was really absurd was the fact the entire timeline takes place in less than nine months
Mar 1 2024,positive,love this movie from beginning to end definitely we go watch again to relive it once more
Mar 1 2024,positive,breathtaking display of 21st century cinema
Mar 1 2024,positive,a somehow even larger more epic portrayal than part one deep intrigue and scheming from the book is given a aaa movie scale and it works the story is slightly altered to make it better for audiences than if told wordforword     we are witnessing the 2020s equivalent of peter jacksons lord of the rings rendition and we should not take that for granted
Mar 1 2024,positive,the most amazing sci fi experience ive ever witnessed
Mar 1 2024,positive,this has felt like a long awaited sequel since the 2021 release of dune part one denis villeneuve  the talented cast  crew behind the scenes have delivered another visually thrilling entry to this universe   dune part two visually stunning thunderous sound design in this massive  impressive sequel that feels alive from all the world building of its predecessor yet it manages to build upon it without being overbearing by giving greater sense of beliefs brutality  power of the great houses  most importantly it dives deeper into the fremen culture  the main themes of blind faith towards religion  the power  corruption when your hand is forced into a holy war  rebecca ferguson great as always zendaya  timothée chalamet both grown with their characters especially chalamet as paul atreides who reluctantly faces his prophecy austin butler is uncomfortable viewing with that convincing deranged look of gratification across his face 
Mar 1 2024,positive,if you liked the first part you should like this one there is a little more world building  a solid movie that seems poised to lead into the next book in the series
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing visualssounds and acting a few changes from the book but they are executed beautifully definitely a movie to see on imax probably gonna see it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,honestly i loved part one but part two steps it up been a long time since i went to the cinema and felt those moments of aw shot brilliantly
Mar 1 2024,positive,really brought the book to life perfection 
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the greatest cinematic events in decades absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking stupendous soundtrack the acting was unbelievable perfect casting
Mar 1 2024,positive,fantastic even the seats vibrated with the sound track
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune was epic and amazing to see both visually and in terms of story what an adventure  the characters are all deep and layered i can only acclaim the performances of timothée chalamet zendaya javier bardem souhelia yacoub austin butler rebecca fergusson and florence pugh they were all amazing left me with chills and a desperate need to see it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,so excited the second lived up to the hype of the first hoping that with the success here we will get another film from the storyline cast was impressive much like before i love zendaya but i feel her performance wasnt as good this go around definitely worth it to see it in imax i loved the feeling the sound
Mar 1 2024,positive,no words to what i just watched like you instant became part of a great moment of cinema history is just a masterpiece 
Mar 1 2024,positive,captivating but experienced moviegoers may experience downgraded immersion    pros brilliant visualssound effects wonderful acting immersive and exciting battle scenes     cons many pieces of exposition felt haphazard and repetitive and certain casting choicesespchristopher walken brought me back down to earthin a bad way the score was often tacky the sound was gradually cranked up to 11 for the epic ending to the point of physical pain some of these things could simply by symptomatic of being familiar with the bookdirecting tools
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolutely epic experience on a monumental scale could not have been happier  surprisingly i mostly enjoyed the changes made from the source material
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was magnificent it picked up exactly where dune left off the scope and breadth of the film is outstanding and if frank herbert was alive today he would hail it as good a depiction of his seminal novel that could be put on the screen the only letdown was the way it ended with chani which diverged from the book in a significant way well have to see what happens in dunemessiah when denis decides to make it timothee chalamet zendaya and javier bardem gave oscar worthy performances rebecca ferguson did a good job as lady jessica stellan skarsgard dave bautista and austin butler are baron harkonnen rabban and feyd rautha im going to have to see it again and give a more indepth review
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolute must see for sci fi fans my goodness
Mar 1 2024,positive,best movie ive ever seen in my 36 years of life long live dv keep making the greatest cinema in history cant wait for part 3 bless the maker and his water
Mar 1 2024,positive,i was nervous but dune part two delivers on so many levels from the visuals to the sound to the storyline all strong performances from the actors involved what a work of art this film was especially if you get to see it in imax 910 for me
Mar 1 2024,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie the fights scenes are great and the scope of the movie is huge if you enjoyed part 1 youll enjoy this sequel
Mar 1 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has truly outdone himself with dune part 2 everything from the visuals the cinematography to the score is absolutely breathtaking the performances from timothée chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson austin butler florence pugh etc are all amazing if you want to see a masterpiece in filmmaking then this is your movie i absolutely loved it 55
Mar 1 2024,positive,as anticipated a thrilling watch    i enjoyed dune though remember thinking it was obviously a complete setup to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor  and thats very much the case dune part two is excellent my interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part as was similarly the case with the first film in truth but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time    all in all its fantastic the acting is top notch the visuals are breathtaking those sandworms tho and the score is outstandingly hefty  you can always rely on the great hans zimmer timothée chalamet stars yet again as do the likes of rebecca ferguson zendaya dave bautista  co the person i actually enjoyed most on screen was javier bardem who is truly brilliant throughout    bring on dune messiah on that note happy to read that director denis villeneuve has noted that he wont be rushing that one out  and rightly so
Mar 1 2024,positive,great movie  will see it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,i had high expectations for this film and villeneuve delivered a visually stunning film with strong storytelling with a listers delivering top performances i will be seeing this film multiple times
Mar 1 2024,positive,movie of the year and maybe even the decade i can think of few films from 2014 to now that deserve your seat at the movies like this does
Mar 1 2024,positive,actors  limited dialogue  pace  scenery  story  450  
Mar 1 2024,positive,wonderful visuals again great adaptation of the book
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing movie of the year
Mar 1 2024,positive,just okay it was too long part one was much better
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved the movie but the sound was wayyyy too loud
Mar 1 2024,positive,simply put this has the chance to overtake lotr as the goat trilogy imho the movie is beautiful from the actors to the production to the music everything is top tier this might go down as the greatest sequelmovie ever created watching it again tonight
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the greatest scifi movies that i have seen since interstellar the scenes are beautifully filmed acting is excellent visual effects are elite  all in all just a great film
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie was visually stunning hans zimmer score only builds on the breathtaking sound of his previous score for part one this film is a scifi masterpiece and should be praised
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part two is effortlessly one of the best films ive ever seen and im so glad i could experience this masterpiece in a fully soldout imax theater with many other dune fans lets start this by talking about the absolutely incredible acting we got from everyone in this film  chalamet zendaya butler ferguson walken pugh brolin bardem all of them fantastic its only two months into the year but i can already see chalamet getting a nomination for best actor at next years academy awards equally as outstanding as the cast the visual effects and cinematography were simply out of this world every single damn shot looks like it was chiseled by hand and polished to perfection you could take so many shots from this film and put them in the best art gallery in the world and they wouldnt look out of place and as if that wasnt enough the soundtrack by the legendary hans zimmer is exceptionally exquisite adding to the story so well that it felt as if the music was a character itself the action sequences were flawless and breathtaking never failing to give me fullbody chills and leaving my jaw on the ground im still dumbfounded by how perfect this film was and you can bet that ill be back in theaters many more times to see this masterpiece of filmmaking
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 was awesome and amazing movie better than dune part 1 i will see it again when comes on startup show
Mar 1 2024,positive,great movie i liked the pacing and the development of the story the action parts were epic well filmed and acted the score is moving and supporting as well all around an excellent film and as true to the book as a good movie could be
Mar 1 2024,positive,part 2 picks up right where part 1 ended and the its wild and emotional ride  i got done the movie and wanted more it was so emotionally draining as you watch the journey of paul atreides and his steps towards ultimate power and the approaching holy war  the writing and cinematography are mind blowing  denis villeneuve is truly one of the greatest directors his scripts and the visuals in the movie are stunning  the plot alone is so deep that you get done and need to watch it again to pick up all the nuances of the story  its a beautiful sight in contrast to the throwaway writing and cgiheavy marveldisney movies these days   this is a mustsee for all the dune fans and anyone who is a moviegoer  truly a spectacle to see on the big theater screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,i have not written a review in quite some time but for this epic of a film i highly recommend going to the theaters this weekend to see dune part 2  specifically in imax or imax 70mm if youre able to from the cinematography to the character arcs to the stellar acting to the captivating landscapes of budapest italy jordan and abu dhabi this movie is a visualaudio masterpiece you are fully immersed into the the dune dimension from the first 15 minutes of the film prepare yourself for a scifi thrill ride like no other this year 1010
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie is perfect 55 and still not enough for what it deserves
Mar 1 2024,positive,this film is a cinematic masterpiece an immersive experience for those who are fans of the original novel this film is like a continuation of the imagination of a cruel world they already know opening up new aspects that they have never experienced before for those watching the film for the first time this can be one of the most captivating cinematic experiences imaginable every frame is a masterpiece alongside a captivating storyline
Mar 1 2024,positive,if you like sand youre going to love this i knew this film was going to be more complex from the first part as i have read the book and i think villeneuve handled this with panache the story moved at a steady tempo and never felt bogged down or muddled zimmer again effortlessly delivers an epic score as i walked home from the cinema the only word i could think to describe this film was biblical i know i differed in my admiration for the movie as a small party sat next to me kept having to confer with each other and admitted to me after they got lost in the middle and one gave up trying to understand so be warned
Mar 1 2024,neutral,visually stunning but far too many liberties taken with the original story  zendayas limitations as an actress are on full display
Mar 1 2024,positive,exceeded expectations and more the character development of paul and jessica is immense and the fight scenes cranked up a notch from the last film my only criticism is that i didnt get to hear the voice in action enough
Mar 1 2024,positive,cinematography is beautiful action sequence was amazing
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of my favorite series ever after part ii   such a beautiful masterpiece with amazing cinematography and action packed scenes i couldnt have asked for a better film
Mar 1 2024,positive,i cannot stop thinking about how visually stunning the movie is plus the action set pieces oh marone
Mar 1 2024,positive,defining film of the decade
Mar 1 2024,positive,closest thing to perfection i have ever had the pleasure of seeing in this genre a childhood dream realised on screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,great visuals but was a bit disappointed with how much of the story was changed for part 2 it really changed the meaning and take aways from the original relationships and makes the next 5 stories sort of awkward not that they plan to actually make those the holy grail has been to make a faithful adaptation of dune  after part one there was belief that denis villeneuve might be the one to deliver but unfortunately the holy grail still has not realized it is a decent movie not as good as the first part and changed to appease a modern sensibilities rather focused than sharing the books wisdom  i think the ending fell flat as an empire divided arguably more realistic but not as inspiring or enjoyable
Mar 1 2024,positive,its better than first movie but thats not really saying much lol  the problem with this director is just too many long drawn out scenes which are in need of major editing and he also need a new lighting guy because some scenes are so dark that you dont see anything  best scene is main character doing his first worm ride but i saw that alredy in sneak peak after first movie reissue show  final knife fight was nothing special when you have movies like john wick that are far more inventive and fresh in the action genre
Mar 1 2024,positive,watching dune part 2 make me believe that this movie was actually shot on another planet it was spectacular i enjoyed it at the nearest amc theater in dolby
Mar 1 2024,positive,lets just say i had to pee but held it for 3 hrs and zendayas final scene crushed me the look on her face before riding sand worm left me in tears
Mar 1 2024,positive,director i luv youz    not read the books and wont  feelings classic film is part two  this cast i luv  kept this movie too goal  we need part 3 today anyway watchd it twice already and i need more understandment of its mentality applying the end
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic dune part two is absolutely incredible a gift to modern cinema goers and probably the best movie ive seen in a while it hits on all accounts from beginning to end 
Mar 1 2024,positive,i love this movie adaptation of the book it keeps constant pace between actions and dialogues throughout the entire runtime while there are deviation from the book these are welcome chances for me
Mar 1 2024,positive,a great remake of a great classic sci fi
Mar 1 2024,positive,i loved dune 1 but many found it slow now that the world building was taken care of there was a lot of action in this   very well done going to go see it again in a couple days  of course some things from the book were missing but nothing that didnt leave anything out from the overall plot  very well done
Mar 1 2024,positive,by far the best scfi movie i have ever seen masterpiece
Mar 1 2024,positive,movie of the decade this masterpiece deserves all the oscars literally so blown away you have to see this in imax this is cinema 1010
Mar 1 2024,positive,just got out of the cinema and wow what an absolute masterpiece and huge setup for the story to continue i am truly amazed was completely on the edge of my seat this is a must watch
Mar 1 2024,positive,a great septical in all senses i enjoyed it very much and plan on seeing it again i wonder if the other books will go to the screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved the movie personally i think the story is very dark but it makes it even better recommend seeing it the cinema was packed when i was in there 
Mar 1 2024,positive,top tier movie with great depth the pace of the movie is amazing and there is something entertaining always happening this was made for the movie theater and i would love to watch it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie screams cinema if you get the chance to experience in one then take it
Mar 1 2024,negative,nice desert shots unwillingly silly boring confusing partially dumb at about half of the film i thought if i see any more guys walking through mist  floating sand with in wind fluttering clothes i gonna scream
Mar 1 2024,positive,a modern day masterpiece cinematography is breathtaking and i believe in deniss vision
Mar 1 2024,positive,i think this movie is a great sequel to the first it will continue with part 3 every scene during this film is breathtaking the soundtrack the visuals even the little humour is well put and not overdone will 100 be watching this a second time loved it
Mar 1 2024,positive,i loved everything dune part two
Mar 1 2024,positive,hello hollywood we need this kind of film
Mar 1 2024,positive,a tragic opera  a beautiful film a warning that resonates strongly today personally so grateful that we have a director like villeneuve who is so uncompromising in his vision such a smart adaptation and a miracle of a blockbuster
Mar 1 2024,negative,sick of these actorsthey are overused there are plenty other young talented actors  
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing this is a movie our kids will ask what it was like to see in theaters the same way i ask mine what is was like seeing the return of the king go see it in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,in the pantheon of science fiction cinema dune part two stands as a colossus redefining the genres boundaries with its blend of epic storytelling and profound thematic depth director denis villeneuve crafts a sequel that not only surpasses its predecessor but also cements itself as a landmark in cinematic history    greig frasers cinematography is a triumph transforming the alien landscapes of arrakis into breathtaking vistas that are as emotionally compelling as they are visually stunning each frame is a meticulously composed work of art contributing to an immersive experience that is rarely achieved in film    hans zimmers score transcends the traditional role of film music becoming an integral character in its own right his compositions elevate the narrative adding layers of emotional resonance that enhance the viewing experience in an indelibly profound way    the ensemble cast delivers performances of staggering depth and complexity timothée chalamets portrayal of paul atreides is a masterclass in nuanced acting capturing the internal struggle of a young man burdened with unprecedented destiny zendaya alongside chalamet adds a riveting dimension to the saga her characters development enriching the films emotional landscape    the meticulous attention to detail in production design and costume brings frank herberts rich universe to life with an authenticity and grandeur that is unmatched villeneuves vision for dune part two is realized with such precision and care that it transcends the confines of its source material becoming a singular cinematic experience    dune part two is not merely a film it is a monumental achievement that challenges and captivates it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport to transform and to transcend a masterful blend of spectacle and substance this film is a mustsee for cinephiles and casual viewers alike deserving of its place among the finest works of science fiction and beyond
Mar 1 2024,positive,is it a heady science fiction film with a lot of deep thoughts to chew on yes its also a massively gorgeous piece of cinema with spectacular action scenes horrifying villains and great acting performances music and writing timothée chalamet as paul atreides and zendaya as chani have the chemistry of one of those couples who make you go aw look at those two but their relationship soon becomes very complicated and weird austin butler as feydrautha is a compelling psychopathic monster who may scare you in a good way denis villenueves directing is absolutely brilliant on many levels he gets the meaning of the story so well that watching this movie feels like the way i felt when i first read the book frank herberts dune was a real pageturner that got me caught up in its messianic spell and this movie has that same spicy flavor i highly recommend this movie go see it in an imax theater so you can get why imax is a great format for cinema
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely incredible
Mar 1 2024,positive,love it really engaging
Mar 1 2024,positive,denis villeneuve delivers with a masterpiece a flawless film itll lauded by the film enthusiasts for ages i recommend watching it only on the big screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,i have read the books and therefore my judgement may be influenced by a cognitive bias this second part covers the latter half of herberts first book and i regard it as one of the finest cinematic adaptations ever made the essence of the novels plot is faithfully preserved without being significantly distorted  i would divide the film into two parts an initially rather slow beginning and a final part that suddenly becomes too fastpaced and cursory leaving gaps in the storyline the film could have easily been split into two separate instalments allowing more time to be devoted to the development of the second half as it stands it leaves us hoping for a future directors cut that might expand the film further  what else is there to say visually its an absolute feast for the eyes the cinematography is exceptional and the soundtrack is extraordinary showcasing a particularly inspired hans zimmer the ending suggests a potential third part in the meantime may thy knife chip  shatter
Mar 1 2024,positive,beautiful movie  the score and cinematography is amazing  the acting is terrific especially austin butler i was blown away  i will definitely see it again in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,hands down the best scifi film ive ever seen and ive seen a lot
Mar 1 2024,positive,overall as a film it was pretty good as an adaptation of dune it went so above and beyond in its ambition that i think it lost the essence of the book several times continuity of the plot was a bit choppy some scenes which were placed out of order from the events of the book seemed there only to drive the immediate next point of the narrative in the film which felt clumsy visually stunning and absolutely worth seeing in dolby atmos because the audio was mindblowing but under close examination some of the luster falls off as a fan of the books i wonder what the greater vision for this film series is because while part 1 was faithful at this point it has diverged a lot from the source material mostly in terms of pacing and some characterization
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely stunning  this is a classic wanting more already
Mar 1 2024,positive,wow an actual epic worthy of the cinema screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,a masterpiece maybe the best scifi movie ever made
Mar 1 2024,positive,frist i admit was story building the second one really pays off we saw the movie at amc dolby digital and with the added effects really takes you into the movie i thought all the acting was great if you like sci fi at all please do yourself a favor and go see this movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,the best imax experience i have ever had by far it looked gorgeous and they did a fantastic job of adapting such iconic source material  something previously thought to be impossible dune messiah absolutely deserves to be adapted next
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute sci fi masterpiece the movie is an excellent short form adaptation of the novel i agree with others that to truly do dune to the standard of the book would require 1215 hours but this is an excellent movie well worth the watch
Mar 1 2024,positive,ive read the book 3 times over the last 20 years the two villeneuve movies combined with dune part 2 being the stronger chapter tell the story of dune even better than frank herberts book was able to yes better than the book
Mar 1 2024,positive,i was in awe at what they were able to bring to the big screen the cinematography the acting the music the sound everything was an immersive masterclass in sci fi film making as a lover of the book there are some changes and streamlining of the narrative that left me wanting more but i think they made sense for enhancing the film cant wait to see it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie is equal to the return of the king
Mar 1 2024,positive,well done fun to watch wonderful soundtrack
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part two absolutely lives up to the hype one of the most visually stunning and emotionally thrilling movies ive experienced in a theater see this on the biggest screen you can but a theater with a great audio system i would say is an even higher priority building on his work in part 1 hans zimmer delivers perhaps the best score of his already legendary career every performance was great but chalemet as paul and austin butler as feyd rautha are the two that are going to stick in my mind permanently
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen
Mar 1 2024,positive,exceeded all expectations
Mar 1 2024,positive,breathtaking phenomenal generational type movie this movie will resonate with me for the rest of my life yes its that good
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece in filmmaking one of if not then greatest movies of all time this will be spoken about for generations to come and rightly so  if you havent seen this yet it is a must watch
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the all time great sci fi films
Mar 1 2024,positive,its good almost a 3 hour movie but kept my interest i wish some of the battle sequences were longer but a solid movie i didnt see it in imax but i will go see it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was so great that made me create a rotten tomato account to rate it 5 stars
Mar 1 2024,positive,i could have watched a six hour cut of this movie nothing has made me feel the way this movie has in a long long while
Mar 1 2024,positive,overall really good loved the futuristic elements and most of the cast did a fantastic job i was never a huge austin butler fan until nowi thought he was incredible as faydrautha the only reason that i did not give a full 5 star was zendaya she made no effort to tailor her role to fit the rest of the freman it sounded like they plucked a cali girl off the streets of la and dropped her into the movie her character was annoying as welli dont know if that was bad writing or just bad acting although the rest of the cast was amazing so im assuming that the latter is responsible if she was a minor character it wouldnt have been a big deal but unfortunately you will have to endure her for the majority of the movie aside from that this movie was great
Mar 1 2024,positive,went to regal rpx with dolby atmos this movie deserves to be seen in theaters fan of the 1984 version and part 1 but this movie is epic in every sense of the word and i was blown away by it
Mar 1 2024,positive,i never went to masterpiece movies as this one was i was like  it was a phenomenallegendary movie timothee chalamet was a pure genius as well as zendaya rebeca ferguson florence pugh austin butler as feydh rautha master of villainy the rest of the cast where from another world as well definetly recommending this movie as a spring season start for this weekend you wont be sorry
Mar 1 2024,positive,butchers the book but after divorcing myself from that point i had a decent time its a little jarring how scene changes happen i thought i was having a seizure when they popped from one point to the next without even a fade
Mar 1 2024,positive,i have read the books within the last year or so and so really really enjoyed the film and was able to follow it easier and know where the plot was heading not sure how easy it would have been to follow the plot  if it would be confusing if not read themthat was my experience with the first film which i still loved hence i read the books to better understand the saga and also watched it several times over this was a 5  film for me and on par with he first if not even more impressive
Mar 1 2024,positive,this film is a fantastic example of what great filmmakers and great stories can create long live the fighters
Mar 1 2024,positive,just caught dune part 2 and i gotta say the hype is real walking out of the cinema im itching to know what happens next shoutout to denis for promising dune messiah adaptation  timothee chalamet zendaya florence pugh and austin butler killed it in this epic movie timothee hollywoods savior really won me over as paul part 2 dives deep into pauls struggles after losing his father and embracing the fremen life the ending spot on  reminiscent of a certain anime character no spoilers admittedly some parts were tricky to grasp but thats dune  complex yet rewarding clocking in at 2 hours and 50 minutes catch it in the biggest cinema for the full impact of the story killer score and mindblowing cinematography 1010 ctto  warner bros pictures dunemovie dunepart2
Mar 1 2024,positive,awesome visuals story and bgm
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely stunning to look at soundtrack is obviously amazing thanks to zimmer i loved the pacing and storytelling of this move definitely a must see

Mar 1 2024,positive,awesome movie except it deviated from book finale  no alia
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was a phenomenal movie definitely worth the watch
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Mar 1 2024,positive,i cant imagine it being possible to adapt the frank herberts 1965 novel into film any better than denis villeneuve has done a monumental achievement in science fiction and the best blockbuster movie of the last decade movies like this should be a wakeup call to hollywood encouraging the industry to take more risk and let the creative geniuses like denis chase their vision without compromise ill be going back to the theatre to watch dune part 2 again asap
Mar 1 2024,positive,whilst being visually stunning it differs so drastically from the books that it becomes a generic scifi movie and loses all the flavour of the the book
Mar 1 2024,positive,while it deviates more from the book than dune part 1 the deviations make sense for the film and lay a solid path for a dune part 3 which would come from unresolved storylines in the film from the original book and move into heretics of dune  this dune film franchise is my favorite scifi book adaption and was as close to honoring and following the source material as could possibly be especially when you consider the hack job thats been done with the works of heinlein and asimov for film and tv adaptions  i absolutely loved part 2 possibly more than part 1 with the exception of pauls missing sister played by anya taylorjoy her only brief appearance is an exciting preview of what will come in part 3 i just wish we got more of her in case part 3 doesnt happen
Mar 1 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece i felt compelled to make a rotten tomatoes profile after seeing this film just to sing its praises i have not stopped thinking about it since i saw it last sunday
Mar 1 2024,positive,ever since dune part 1 was released ive anticipated what denis villeneuve would do in dune part 2 to elevate his adaptation of the scifi epic to the next level im elated to say that he achieved this goal and launched dune part 2 into the upper stratosphere of scifi movie history everything about this movie was amazing the cast and their chemistry with one another the visual effects the musical score by hans zimmer that gives you goosebumps during these intense moments the pacing and storytelling are all major strengths of this movie and why ill likely go see it a second and possibly third time this was certainly a movie to remember cannot wait for the conclusion in dune part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,kinda choppy story telling no intermission for a three hour movie is crazy
Mar 1 2024,positive,so many new plot twists it was worth the wait
Mar 1 2024,positive,just loved it i love the every image and music of the movie mainly it gives a additional boost to the character and totally loved the direction of the movie and each character was well played as per their roles i truly loved itit the the best movie for me in 2024 as i seen till now
Mar 1 2024,positive,cinematic masterpiece saw it leap day 2024 on the imax unforgettable
Mar 1 2024,positive,simply brilliant i actually think its faultless
Mar 1 2024,positive,a mustwatch installment in the dune saga
Mar 1 2024,positive,the best scifi of the century
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely incredible epic film best cinematics experience since lord of the rings and best sequel ive seen since the dark knight acting cinematography musical score effects character development and depth this movie is nearly flawless i can count on one hand the amount of films ive seen multiple times in theaters and this will absolutely be one of them
Mar 1 2024,positive,great direction great acting great story great cinematography and great special effects
Mar 1 2024,positive,jaw dropping visuals incredible sound wonderful acting and a plot that answers all your questions about part 1 and gives us a terrific ending regardless if they make a part 3 or not
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute epic masterpiece denis villenueves dune part 2 immerses you into an eye popping spectacle scifi at its absolute peak timothee chalamet has the performance of his life hans zimmers score  transports us into a world full of deep lure to lose yourself in
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie is true cinema high art
Mar 1 2024,positive,after watching it 3 times and twice in imax this movie has become my favorite period
Mar 1 2024,positive,inventive epic and the scifi we should expect out of our best

Mar 1 2024,positive,there was before i watched dune pt 2  and there is after i watched dune pt 2 those are two totally different people
Mar 1 2024,positive,beautiful in every sense immense cinematography and direction as well as artistic integrity
Mar 1 2024,positive,legitimately couldnt even move after the movie was over everyone was shuffling around leaving the theater and i still felt ecstatic cant even remember the last time a movie hit me this hard
Mar 1 2024,positive,you cant argue that the director here knows how to interpret a novel onto the big screen so epically  yet i was left deflated by the end of the movie  and im not sure if the muted response from others in the theatre after the movie came to an end was one of it just didnt live up to the hype or that it ended so abruptly or maybe it was just me reading too much into what others in the theatre were thinking  but i hated that it ended when things were just starting to escalate  and if there is no part 3 than i think this saga sucked big time  im left with more questions which were never satisfactorily answered  i cant recommend these 2 movies to any of my bros  i guess the only thing left is for me to carry on reading the books  so yes from what ive read so far i have seen where the director has deviated  and to be honest i think it works much better considering the canvas hes working on  but in my opinion it is a masterpiece cut short  much like what cutting the lord of the rings trilogy so we got the first 2 movies only  ill still buy the second movie when it is available for purchase but i wont subject my siblings to sit through it in summary an epic movie that falls short but can be fixed  lets hope there is enough interest and financial success that they go on to add to the two movies theyve made so far  an update to this  theyve confirmed a part three and im ecstatic  ive changed my rating from 12 stars to 45  if denis nails the third movie he will be legendary and the trilogy truly epic  but that is a big ask  personally i think it requires at least another 2 movies if youre going to do it justice but then that is coming from someone who has yet to read dune messiah and to be honest i wont be until such time as the third movie comes out cos movies for me is my thing and i want to experience dune from the point of view of someone who has not read the books  anyhoo in summary  a great movie now that i know the third one is on the way 
Mar 1 2024,negative,acting was good lead by zendaya she was very good especially towards the end    visuals are good but the content was nt     music was a letdown     dragging in many places some scenes were there for no reason and scissors could have helped    dialogues were not up to mark was it a bad voice mixing or was it the native language without subtitle  few scenes it was a question
Mar 1 2024,positive,if you are tired of the recent move disastrous and looking for a good movie  watch dune 2 you will love it prerequisite is dune 1   well written  story great sound great visual effect and beautiful cinematography  see it  it brought me back experience of watching lord of the rings  all over again    best adoption of dune this moving will move you
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece the script is a faithful adaptation that manages to keep the essential and make the necessary changes for an appropiate translation to the screen the acting is enthralling the music is tense and spectacular the effects are a wonder to behold the tension is relentless a true work of art

Mar 1 2024,positive,visually stunning  battle scenes had the good guys and the bad guys sometime indistinguishable the internecine intrigue among the houses and the emperor makes it kind of difficult to follow the story line at times unless maybe you are a dunie  a bit much about the arcane tenets of the religion in the southern zone  clearly teed up a dune 3 with a nonconclusive ending
Mar 1 2024,positive,phenomenal movie must watch for all dune lovers
Mar 1 2024,positive,it fulfills all my expectations im a longtime fan of the dune books and i think denis villeneuve captures the essence of the story i want to go see it again in imax

Mar 1 2024,positive,even though the first one is still better this movie was awesome great build up and story bravo

Mar 1 2024,positive,i couldve sat there for 10 hours and kept watching the cinematography music costumes action this movie is a spectacle
Mar 1 2024,positive,a magnum opus of potent artistic shock a step in to the future of cinema a perfect dune adaptation
Mar 1 2024,positive,what peter jackson cinematically achieved for the fantasy genre with lord of the rings villeneuve has masterfully achieved for scifi in dune part ii  denis villeneuve has crafted to life the cinematic epic of our time  long live cinema    james eversole jr  movie nerd james
Mar 1 2024,positive,power over spice is power over all    walking out of the cinema i was absolutely awestruck    ya hya chouhada muaddib
Mar 1 2024,positive,easily the best film ive seen dune part two will go down as one of the greatest cinematic achievements     epic beautiful heart wrenching tragic a masterpiece not since lotr has a director delivered such a labor of love for the ip zimmer went all in crafting the  soundtrack a true work of art that expresses the weight and tension of pauls journey

Mar 1 2024,positive,best sequel of all time
Mar 1 2024,positive,obviously as a pt 2 pt 1 had to be seen this film is visually staggering the script and screenplay are flawless all the actors give an incredible performance which knits in with the story like a perfect jigsaw all thanks to an incredible director sadly it does end and you now have to wait for the final pt 3  i would easily declare this the best scifi film ever
Mar 1 2024,positive,easily one of the greatest sequels of our time from the amazing acting breathtaking cinematography chilling score compelling story i couldnt ask for a better movie than this it takes everything that made dune part one great and cranks it 10 times better i need dune part three now
Mar 1 2024,positive,visually stunning very good performances but the cinematography and visuals are the real stars
Mar 1 2024,positive,oh my god  what i have just seen in the theater     dune part 2 has set a landmark in the history of scifi movies just like star wars had done in 1977  thoudh star wars is heavily inspired by dune book star wars has never done these types of production because it is quite impossible to translate the noble into a movie due to its large scale if anyone have read the novel heshe will know the very well about that what i am trying to say    but my boy denis villeneuve has done something incredible that no one has one done in the scifi genre arrival blade runner 2049 sicario prisoner enemy now dune part 1 and part 2  all of his movies are great and incredible i was totally speechless at the time of watching the movie    the story character development medium pace screenplay editing cinematography has done on another level  again i was totally hypnotized by the score of the legendary scorer hans zimmer the production design of the movie is astonishingly beautiful and grand in scale     oh almost forget about the acting department  the central character paul atreides remarkably played by timothée chalamet the deep layerof the character has done so precisely that nobody could match him zendeya has acted remarkably well as her and timothées  relationships worked on the point austin butler has done very well of portraying as villainous role josh brolin florence pugh  my sweetheart all of the side  characters has done so well that nobody can detect a single point of error from their acting    above all dune part 2  is a masterpiece and it is quite unimaginable that denis villeneuve can  able to pull off what he has done  in this movie in the next installment or his next movie      love you denis villeneuve
Mar 1 2024,positive,97    ok lets do this    this was the first time i saw a denis movie in theaters he is my favorite director and has consistently blown my mind with every outing my favorite movie is his and it brings me nothing but joy to say that dune part two is one of his best films it is everything i love about his style of filmmaking put together with a story of mysticism tragedy religion loyalty and above all faith faith on a better future    thimotheé chalamet is electrifying here as he dives into pauls journey with bravery and knowledge zendaya is great and rebecca fergusson is amazing  very different from her in the first movie florence pugh and christopher walken are also very good in the little screen time they have josh brolin dave bautista and stellan skarsgård are all great as well javier bardem is hilarious and portrays his extreme faith fervously and finally the most shocking terrifying effervescent and transformative performance here austin butler as feydrautha i didnt know he had this in him he steals every scene hes in and is one of the best villains ive seen in years oscar campaign starts now    the story is incredibly dense but villeneuve is able to condense it in 246hrs and make it one of the most intricate and compelling sciencefiction stories ive ever seen religion and devotion are portrayed here as the different storylines are delicately knitted and built up until the final act the themes of faith destiny conflict power and greed are all adressed here in pauls journey there are scenes where the theater shook and my eyes were fed with some of the most aweinspiring scenes that show the power that these themes carry    i think the film could use another 510 minutes in the final battle but overall the pacing is deliberate and precise like in every other denis film    the cinematography is incredible the use of color and camera placement come together to create some of the best shots in film there were sequences where i had chills and my jaw on the floor the sound design explodes the boom boxes and the production design just elevates the worldbuilding hans zimmer outdoes himself once again now working with 3 main themes for dune the chant the one from the first film and this new melancholic and epic theme    the final 15 minutes were electrifying and unlike the first film that was definitely a prat one this one ends the characters arcs most importantly paul the final 23 minutes of the film set up things that are to come that make me extremely excited for dune messiah i need wb to greenlight it soon and for villeneuve to end the dune trilogy and go on with his career with his name carved into the list of greatest filmmakers    denis said that frank herbert wrote dune messiah because people misinterpreted paul as a heroic figure which he isnt villeneuve makes it clear here that paul isnt a hero through many scenes and one decision he makes just perfectly adapting the book towards the writers original intention and vision    dune part two is something else its a giant in the scifi world that packs a punch in visual and auditory spectacle through one of the most thematically and narratively dense stories from the past few decades its a sight to see and beautiful to behold thank you denis for keeping blowing my mind in relation to what film can be thank you
Mar 1 2024,positive,a must sée  a brilliant epic sf adventure with great characters arc and performances from every actors in it surprises by chalamet and zendaya who give us their best roles zimmer ost is magnificent the action scenes are amazing butler is a terrifying feyd rautha there is good changes of the book villeneuve show that he understand herberts saga
Mar 1 2024,positive,this is a very interesting story lots of things going ona bit of a combo between star wars  lord of the rings  beautifully shot also

Mar 1 2024,positive,immersive the feeling on riding the sandstorm was intense i was surprised to have laughed at certain things intentionally and  got the journey of each character the action is epic come for the worms stay for the action the drama is believable bur not the selling point the experience is
Mar 1 2024,positive,i was genuinely happy watching this masterpiece tears of happiness was in my eyes which happened for the first time for a movie

Mar 1 2024,positive,this film is an absolute masterpiece it is an absolute delight to see the unique cinematographic frames the soundtrack and especially the star cast
Mar 1 2024,positive,a compelling intriguing and captivating narrative mixed with beautiful visuals makes this movie one of the most interesting of the year in all respects it didnt quite earn the last star due to some elements i didnt fully understand for example spoilers ahead when paul embarks on that journey in the desert and chani finds him the scene cuts rather quickly and i didnt quite grasp why we didnt see more of that journey    other than that i wholeheartedly recommend it the length should not be a concern    arthur
Mar 1 2024,positive,best movie of at least the last year by far
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best films of the 21st century at the moment a milestone in visual art
Mar 1 2024,positive,less action than i thought but in a good way the focus is still very much on the story every main actor involved gives an excellent performance you realize that everything has built up for the final act and damn does it not disappoint
Mar 1 2024,positive,perfection missed opportunity to let paul show how powerful he was i believe it is intentional
Mar 1 2024,positive,its phenomenal a true masterpiece of cinema  gorgeous filmmaking great performances and a incredilble sense of scope that ive have not seen before
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie was beyond amazing it surpassed all my expectations i cant wait any amount of time for dune 3 it is the next set of movies that sure going down in history
Mar 1 2024,positive,really enjoyed this  leaving it open for dune 3 was no shock as that is what hollywood does but id prefer an actual ending
Mar 1 2024,positive,scifi action epic better than the first film
Mar 1 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece from denis   he really didnt hold back on the action in this movie already cant wait for the third credit to stilgar  chani killed the roles with paul
Mar 1 2024,positive,flawless masterpiece
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best sci fi films ive ever seen every single detail is outstanding as a book fan i couldnt be more impressed by what denis and his team have done here
Mar 1 2024,positive,honestly i think the best cinema experience ive ever had in my life seeing in imax was definitely the right call still trying to come to grips with the visuals of geidi prime amazing
Mar 1 2024,positive,the soundtrack is amazing on this movie chills down my spine from the performances
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing score visuals plot and acting
Mar 1 2024,negative,i liked the first one but this just doesnt live up to the hype its getting
Mar 1 2024,positive,brilliant adaptation of a scifi classic  perfect mix of action and character development  beautifully shot with marvelous sound
Mar 1 2024,positive,decent   not great    special effects noteworthy   first half of movie dragged on a little and some characters were not used like they could  have been eg walken is great actor but a foot note in movie    dune 1 was better movie imo
Mar 1 2024,positive,masterpiece filmmaking at its finest the massive scope of this movie was made for the big screen the best blockbuster in years a must see in theatres and in imax if you can
Mar 1 2024,positive,ive seen it yesterday i will see it again today the movie is excellent even though the story is somehow adapted and the changes might make the books fans nervous at times the ending is not what i expected and not by the book at all but i understand the need to keep a link with the next movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,simply the greatest scifi movie of all time period i think almost everyone agrees that oppenheimer was the best movie of 2023 perhaps it was lucky that dune 2 got pushed to 2024 i think that says it all
Mar 1 2024,positive, mind blowing what denis did  mesmerizingly beautiful shot and conducted with such a respect and delight for the source material  the wait for the final piece of the puzzle is going to so hard that i dont know how were going to survive   we  denis
Mar 1 2024,positive,saw it 6 times already  see it on the biggest screen you can see
Mar 1 2024,positive,visually impressive perfect soundtrack in my opinion there were some parts missing that i would have liked to see paul taking care of jamiss family chanis character was changed a lot and perhaps thats the thing i appreciated the least however i understand the need to make certain events different and more fluid chalamet simply stunning on to the third part
Mar 1 2024,positive,1010 this movie is probably best of the year the storytelling sound action heart and pacing all standout i would recommend watching this on imax or 4dx the runtime really doesnt make the movie drag on and feels like any other 2 hour movie overall dune part 2 really feels like a one for the ages type film
Mar 1 2024,positive,no need for any comment
Mar 1 2024,positive,great pacing of the story loved the extra romance

Mar 1 2024,positive,9810 its as close to a perfect film as ive ever seen
Mar 1 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie a must watch for scifi fans i can never understand why people get so angry if a director doesnt go exactly by the book 
Mar 1 2024,positive,i went in with high expectations and they were surpassed saw in imax in a new theatre with single laser sound designscore and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way i have never experienced im at a bit of a loss for words other than generational masterpiece theatrical cinematic experience like nothing i have witnessed before loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material what is so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation you experience the story from the mind of the character in the film the dialogue is there to support the film which is primary here the visuals the cinematography the sound the score are all the story and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that it is so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the story    well done still riding the high it will take something truly special to replace this as my new 1    is there a better word than masterpiece
Mar 1 2024,positive,as someone who has not read the books i can confidently say i loved this movie it conveys an epic sci fi universe while also presenting a very character focused story that involves lots of aspects of humanity like love fear greed revenge religion etc it has great visuals and the use of audio  music is absolutely incredible imo     also it has rather good pacing throughout which is crucial for an almost 3 hour film these new dune film adaptations are seeming like a scifi lord of the rings quality trilogy the hype is real
Mar 1 2024,positive,left goosebumps i want to see it again
Mar 1 2024,neutral,its basically a bridge between one and three lazy sceenwriting seems more like a midseason tv show kind of boring mediocre  acting at best huge plot holes
Mar 1 2024,positive,stunning visually mesmerizing and absolutely worth watching its epic
Mar 1 2024,positive,omg the movie is just so good timothée and zendaya they are amazing

Mar 1 2024,positive,incredible film one of my favorites id have to say ive seen in the last 10 years
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies i have ever seen
Mar 1 2024,positive,in all of sci fi this is by far the best film  the first film set the bar very high and the sequel raised it to be the level where both films combined are a perfect film story  great characters and challenges surrounded by epic landscapes and top fx make these two films simply a classic that defines movie making in the future
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolutely mind blowing experience made for the big screen finally bringing to life the books material in the most fulfilling and awesome way possible on top of that this cast and especially chalamet proved their incredible talent
Mar 1 2024,positive,instant classic for me the performances were amazing the love story within the wider story wasnt campy nor did it feel forced and my god the action set piecesoutstanding
Mar 1 2024,positive,mind blowing huge and epic its long and a lot but definitely one of the best scifi films of the last decade its truly a masterpiece and the hype is very real the production design and cinematography are jaw dropping the cast is fantastic austin butler will surprise and impress you the last act is everything you want it to be and is super satisfying chalamet was transformed in the last act and delivered in a way that i wasnt expecting the scenes on giedi prime are justwow a 1010
Mar 1 2024,positive,what an exhilarating movie always keeps on your toes while providing context chefs kiss truly
Mar 1 2024,positive,a bit slow  action was too much and unoriginal from the first part underwhelmed and unsatisfied
Mar 1 2024,positive,the moment that final rousing sounds of hans zimmer echo through the auditorium and with a taunted zendaya chani on the screen only one thought shoots through my mind have i ever had the opportunity to watch such an insane film this film is so breathtaking to watch with some fantastic shots that you imagine yourself on arrakis for almost 3 hours the setting is so perfect that even acting can partially fade into the background the visuals are something like i have never seen on a movie screen sucking you into every shot or seeing yourself standing next to a raging sandworm not to mention the fantastic soundtrack by hans zimmer whose composition is at the hart of lifting you up in your chair     part one had my interest right away with its world building and way of storytelling but the way part two presents itself is even something i could only have dreamed of even after reading every review beforehand about how overwhelming this piece of art is its all true all of it sit back in your seat and let yourself be blown over by a piece of cinematic history     the end of the film sets up a fantastic prelude to a third part although the ending deviates from the books i can very well understand with the thought of a third film why these choices were made a third part which i will eagerly look forward to and yes this upcoming trilogy especially based on the way part two presents itself has the potential to rank among the greatest film trilogies our planet has ever known     long live the fighters
Mar 1 2024,positive,a visual masterpiece some of the images from this film belong in a museum its that amazing the story still lacks for me but part 2 is one that must be seen on the big screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,this shook my whole body and spirit its been hours since my showing and im still buzzing what this cast does is nothing short of astounding and we get to bear witness to chalamets finest acting so far he commands the entire massive screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely breathtaking timothee is the man zendaya slayed per usual and austin oh my lord    rebecca was lowkey scary but like so good i cant wait for dune part three
Mar 1 2024,neutral,meh pretty lame to be honest no creativity lets just copy the bible and change some names around also the enemies are extremely weak not wellwritten at all they come and go the only thing they got right was some cool picture shots lame
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely a well made part two of the story and is definitely worth watching in the theater
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely stunning visually and extremely well paced for its length dennis villeneuve has filmed the unfilmable epic
Mar 1 2024,positive,impressively done the thrill of seeing them ride the worms was fantastic    a tough story to adapt to film and beautifully done overall    my only gripe is the injection of jealousy what a wasteful emotion overall  i dont like its injection into our heroine
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely great movie   the ending is better than in frank herberts book  i liked the cast i liked the sound and visual effects  much better than in avatar 2  music  outstanding thanks to hans zimmer  the only thing i didnt like is that they make stilgar too comic and fanatical   i was pleasantly surprised by austin butlers feydrautha wish there were more time for his character
Mar 1 2024,positive,easily one of the best films i have ever seen absolutely stunning
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best scifi films of all time 
Mar 1 2024,positive,pure movie perfection visually arresting audibly astounding and perfectly acted this is the greatest sci fi epic ever put on film
Mar 1 2024,positive,truly impeccable work from everyone involved a movie that demands being watched more than one time epic to say the least
Mar 1 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece and every new science fiction movie should be held to this standard that canadian director denis villeneuve sets for this genre  and just cinema in general especially the third act is the most brilliant executed climax ive ever witnessed in theaters and you could tell when no one even dared to eat popcorn due to the fact that it was possible to miss just a second of the climax timothée chalamet is an absolute standout in a talented ensemble  you can feel the walls closing in on him and the options becoming increasingly limited for the socalled protagonist  more importantly as a book reader and fan of frank herberts books it absolutely lived up to everything ive dreamed about denis villeneuve and everyone else from hans zimmer jon spaihts joe walker etc made this movie possible  they did the impossible of adapting such a rich book and do it justice
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute epic masterpiece quite possibly the best film i have ever seen i loved part one and the books but this is something special that will be admired for decades
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie can walk straight up to the greatest of all time list and join the league with the same confidence of paul atreides asking the emperor to kneel
Mar 1 2024,positive,movie of the year candidate but not without some gripes the undertones of the book are spoon fed to the audience several changes are made to some key characters while other characters are more independent thinking than they were in the book the movie sorts out some of the complexities the book did not entirely explain overall its in my top 10 movies of all time will watch it again next week for sure
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the greatest sciif movies of all time right now  definitely in my top 5
Mar 1 2024,positive,yes there are issues with this film especially the pacing at the end it felt too easy although epic part one felt like it was a tighter plot line while this was a string of vignettes either way i really really enjoyed this film there is something about denis directing gregs cinematography hans score and the talent that make these films feel so real and so impactful ive rarely left the theater feeling so much enjoyment its a must see in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing movie the action and visual effects are great i was surprised how different it is from the original movie definitely recommend seeing in theatre
Mar 1 2024,positive,breathtaking powerful aw inspiring one of hans zimmers best work our materialism is angelic
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely incredible and faithful to the books
Mar 1 2024,positive,really enjoyed it visually impressive should win tons of awards timothy chardonnay is great javier bardiem is pitch perfect elvis is scar and weird flo pugh is well used and believable zendaya is lackluster the only weak link in the entire chain so much fun to watch
Mar 1 2024,positive,has feel of the book
Mar 1 2024,positive,long live the fighters    can a sequel surpass the original yes it can    dune part two delivers in so many ways making this one of the greatest science fiction films ever with a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes you can easily see that not a single second was wasted sound design was a key factor as it produced such an immersive experience feeling every single bit of bass in the seats visually this film was spectacular thanks to some stunning cinematography the cast was phenomenal providing some of their best performances to date and can easily see some oscar nominations incoming especially when it comes to austin butler stealing the show taking on the role of feydrautha one of the best villain performances in awhile to top that all off hans zimmer continues to prove he is one of the greatest composers of all time with such a powerful and emotional score    dune part two is an easy reminder as to why i love films so much and denis villeneuve blessed us with such a beautiful and powerful cinematic experience
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing movie and great acting
Mar 1 2024,positive,glorious sequel to dune bravo to everyone involved in bringing frank herberts vision to life been years since i read the books and spoiler alert  i hated the way paul and chanis relationship was impacted at the end other than that really enjoyed the entire film wow just wow
Mar 1 2024,positive,you are not watching a movie you are watching an art
Mar 1 2024,negative,a waste of time and money they deviate so much from the novel its basically something else altogether  they had a huge budget and they used it to dig a latrine
Mar 1 2024,positive,exceptional flim the acting throughout was superb each actor brought so much emotion to their role and brought their character to life the story was beautifully executed and kept great to novels which is lovely great film i cant wait to see it again

Mar 1 2024,positive,incredible must see movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,1st half is slow but descent but 2nd half is pure euphoria joyride  loved it on imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,simply super denis somehow manages to surpass part one and deliver a masterpiece you can tell it has been a lifelong dream and project for him long time readers and newer fans rejoice our messiah has finally arrived
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic and powerfull  magic acting large plan soundtrack all the movies is amazing
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a nearperfect adaptation checks all of the boxes of a top tier blockbuster as well as dips into some arthouse sensibilities for some aweinspiring visual storytelling part 2 definitely felt like a stronger upgraded film in all aspects of filmmaking than the first even so i cant help but feel that it is a bit rushed by the end of the film the script left a bit more to be desired as far as tying up characters as well as expanding on others liberties that denis took to changeimprove the film adaptation seem a bit risky but i trust that he has a solid plan for messiah and mostly agree with those changes i strongly feel that if deleted scenes are added in the futurewhich seems unlikely after villeneuve himself has constantly shot down suggestions it would benefit the overall adaptation itch that hardcore fans need scratched the world denis and his team have collaborated on is so interesting and alive that the fans simply want more with a runtime of 2hr 46min i feel like this film as well as part 1 could have benefitted greatly from an extra 10 to 15 minutes that being said i had a blast at the imax and am definitely considering repeat visits
Mar 1 2024,neutral,i was really disappointed with this part i loved the part one but here there were so many inconsistencies and changes of the pace so the all magic of herberts novel disappeared this may be the worst dvs made and that makes me sad my impression is with amount of material this should be 2x 35hrs great movies now the second part is just a mere shadow of the first one something like brian herberts writings to his fathers talent also i was very dissatisfied with c walker performance or again that was the dv vision of the emperor
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie is an old fashion hollywood epic one we thought they forgot how to make on the lines of cleopatra 10 commandments benhur saw it in imax and the visuals are amazing acting next level austin butler a new star set and costumes amazing sound and music score perfection as a book reader i am fine with the changes to fit the visual format  actually prefer this chani over the books  go see this movie it was amazing
Mar 1 2024,positive,375  enjoyed this a little more than the first one im not a huge dune fan to begin with but even i can tell that this was wellmade and that the director has respect for the source material clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes it is hefty i feel similar to how i felt about the first movie its gorgeous the score is great and the action was choreographed very well but im also not fully enamored with it and i still dont feel a strong level of emotional connection with any of the characters they all felt distant to some extent so there wasnt a strong attachment to them austin butler was the standout for me as far as acting and the weakest was zendayas fierce face or scowls  she is not convincing to me at all when she plays that type of emotion she does a better job at portraying fearconcernworry as with dune part one i have little doubt that fans will enjoy this immensely video review 
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part two has no equal  and frankly were all collectively as a species unworthy of a feat of this magnitude the significance of this story will be lost on many  the irony certainly is    to all who gave life to this epic  thank you  i have to go now  id like to watch dune part two again      sobering  to think life may best be observed while eating popcorn
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely exceptional dune is nearly impossible to get right in under 6 hours but part 2 did a phenomenal job of bringing pauls first story to a close acting directing cinematography and sound were all sheer perfection     my only wish is that they had more time to dig deeper into the lore before they dig into messiah but in order to do that dune would have needed at least 3 films and they likely wouldve lost a lot of the audience with the deeper concepts
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece and masterclass in adaptation 1110
Mar 1 2024,positive,a visually spectacular movie with some great acting on show but felt very much like the middle movie of a trilogy it wasnt bogged down with scene setting or lore building but also doesnt have a satisfying conclusion
Mar 1 2024,positive,awesome movie and fresh adaptation to the dune novel the casting was solid timothy was amazing the music was spectacular the effects and the views sublime

Mar 1 2024,positive,one word can sum up the moviemasterful  what denis villeneuve did in bringing the book to the big screen is incredible every actoractress was on their a game with performances its early in the year but denis has to be an early favorite for an oscar nomination and i would not be surprised if it wins in many of the technical categories like sound editing score costume design and various others if you can see it in imax it is definitely worth the extra money for the ticket
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie was phenomenal one of my new favorite movies the cinematography was insane and all the actors did such an incredible job it was captivating and entertaining definitely recommend

Mar 1 2024,positive,the only films epic enough to compare to this cinematic masterpiece are the empire strikes back return of the king and avengers endgame
Mar 1 2024,positive,friendly advice go to the toilet before the movie because you will be glued to your seat for the entirety of this movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,groundbreaking scifi sequel everything the first was and so much more

Mar 1 2024,positive,movie was so good the story visuals and music were all so captivating highly recommend
Mar 1 2024,positive,imaxs bass sounds were unnecessarily loud the celling was shaking and my wife had to go to take a break
Mar 1 2024,positive,an amazing sequel this movie was excellent definitely earned its spot in the best movie sequel club
Mar 1 2024,positive,legendary escalation into the dune series they knocked it out of the park
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing cinema amazing soundtrack all of this topped with an amazing story that fulfills on all of the world building from part one and goes beyond that to ensure a satisfying conclusion to an epic tale 1110
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic i was memorized from the first minute until the last one  spice is power   a must see in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,great cinematography score and acting looking forward to the next
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece of cinema heavy themes are handled with grace in a way never seen before in a blockbuster the word epic was invented for this film we have a two towers on our hands
Mar 1 2024,positive,enjoyed it thoroughly  the scenes are shot so beautifully the story is such a great one and they have done a very nice job bringing it to life on the screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,i have left very little reviews on this site despite my love affairs with movies i have rated only a handful of movies in my life as 5 stars i had to leave a review for this one this movie was amazing everything from the story the music the visuals it was all fantastic the acting from everyone was spot on easily the best movie ive seen in years im so excited for part 3 do yourself a favor and spend the money to see this in theaters
Mar 1 2024,positive,great movie intense storytelling cast of giants
Mar 1 2024,positive,unbelievable movie brilliant acting story and visuals chalamet shines
Mar 1 2024,positive,the good stuff    bigger and badder this movie cranks things up a notch compared to the first one expect crazier action sequences more giant sandworms and epic battles  deeper into the world you get to explore more of the fascinating planet arrakis with its desert landscapes fremen culture and mindbending spice  character development paul atreides aka timothee chalamet swoon continues to grow into his destiny facing even tougher choices and cooler abilities plus chani played by zendaya ofc gets more badass screentime    heads up    its intense theres more violence and dark themes compared to the first film so be prepared for some intense scenes maybe grab a friend for emotional support or popcorn sharing  not for newbies if you havent seen the first movie you might be lost its like jumping into the middle of a complex video game without knowing the controls  still complex the story can be mindbending at times with lots of characters and lore be prepared to pay attention and maybe do some quick online research if things get confusing    overall    dune part 2 is a visually stunning and actionpacked continuation of the epic scifi saga if you loved the first movie and are ready for a deeper dive into this crazy world then grab your friends some snacks and get ready for a wild ride just remember its not your typical popcorn flick so be prepared for some headscratching moments and intense battles
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies to come out in the last 15 years modern movie makers could learn a thing or two serious well acted great visuals had funny moments but nothing that took away from the seriousness of certain scenes that last point being something that plague modern big budget films part one was good but part two was phenomenal this movie requires you to pay attention but man is it worth it 910
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic sci fi  probably more powerful than part one
Mar 1 2024,positive,a rare sequel that tops the original in every way unsurprising since its literally part 2 less burdened than part 1 and with a grand finish to complete it goes down as one of the best scifi movies in decades even if we never get another dune movie this one alone earns the series place in movie history
Mar 1 2024,positive,now the novel science fictions supreme masterpiece has a film to match though it strays from the book in a few unexpected ways it redeems itself in so many others its an incredible feat in cinematic excellence and i cant recommend it highly enough
Mar 1 2024,positive,okay with every movie im hyped to see i always need at least 2 showings for me to get a proper solid feeling on it so for the last week ive left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how i feel about this movie after my first showing i loved it but i came out with a feeling i wasnt satisfied and its probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today i have no doubt in my head of how i feel this movie is perfect    theres genuinely so much i love about this that if i wanted i could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is firstly with the movie itself the pacing is just godly how on earth is that an almost 3 hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind secondly the sound editing unbelievable the visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from vfx to camera work to cinematography    but finally the acting is where this movie shines every actor is honestly carrying this movie and thats what you expect with a stacked cast like this timothy is the definition of paul atreides he was born for this role and i pray its his legacy because he gave it his all and more the scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes ive ever seen his acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominated    zendaya does wonders for chani especially for me as a huge dune series fan chani is a good character but she doesnt at all stand out in the books but when she was announced to be played by zendaya i knew this would be a twist and man im happy with the way denis took her arc shes probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how shes not even top 10 in the books its crazy how much facial expressions does and zendaya plays that perfectly the love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end i cannot wait to see how denis uses her in messiah especially with how shes on a complete different path now    the final actor that really stood out for me is austin butler doesnt have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and i knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle he plays this role in such a way it made me care for feydrautha even though hes a little no villain with little character outside of that i could go on about every actor because they all do something that makes this movie special but yeah overall just a brilliant cast and a perfect movie    the final thing i have to say is that score that plays from the moment the emperor kisses the ducal signet till the end of the movie and the score during the credits godly level of work from zimmer he was the best choice for this movie and he delivered beyond perfection for both parts
Mar 1 2024,positive,in an era full of disappointing remakes and the old bones of dead franchises dune part two only has one thing to say lisan al gaib
Mar 1 2024,positive,long but good movie left a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up
Mar 1 2024,positive,top notch movie the absolute best top tierim boycotting the oscars if this doesnt win one
Mar 1 2024,negative,if youre a general scifi fan youll likely enjoy the movie as a fan of the book there were way too many alterations for me to enjoy this 
Mar 1 2024,positive,everything and more that i expected it to be so beautiful so amazing the soundtrack  the actors were just amazing this deserves a 5 star loved it i was on the edge of my seat worth it
Mar 1 2024,positive,very good continuation of the story enjoyed it from start to finish
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 is one of the most riveting stunning amazingly detailed films ive ever seen the visuals were incredible oscar worthy performances by timothee chalamet and austin butler and you are absolutely encaptured by the visionary director cgi was one of the best ive been and the movie transports you into the world of dune 1010 i will see this more than once in theaters
Mar 1 2024,positive,doesnt disappoint minor quips with pacing but overall very very good sequel 
Mar 1 2024,positive,pure cinema this is what movie theaters are for the only downside is having to wait for denis to film the third
Mar 1 2024,positive,the first half was all over the place all it had to do was carry itself on the magic the first movie had but for whatever the reason the story moved so fast and felt so cheap and for a moment i thought villanueva had lost his touch but the film came roaring back for the last half of the movie unfortunately for me dune 2 doesnt come even close to the wonder mystery and the fine production dune 1 carried all throughout its film
Mar 1 2024,positive,have been reading and watching dune adaptions since dune 1984 and could not be happier with these two films there are subtle differences from the book but the story is streamlined right into your veins with stunning visuals and incredible acting from the entire cast villeneuve harvests all the spice in the third act mind blowing ive seen it twice and would heavily skew to seeing it in imax as the best possible way to view a film that demands to be seen on the big screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,that fuckin ruuuuuuuled
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was amazing denis hit the mark on frank herbert world and message you would need to 12 to 15 hours to fully do dune but for 2 hours and 46 minutes it was dead on
Mar 1 2024,positive,there isnt an actor in this that isnt giving 110 and an incredible performance this may be the movie event of the year
Mar 1 2024,positive,this was probably the fastest 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life i can see where all the hype is coming from this movie is absolutely amazing the visuals were beautiful the music was great and the acting was amazing just like in the first film except better storywise they did make some changes from the book some of those changes i actually liked and others i thought were a little odd they also cut out a lot of scenes plot lines and entire characters that were present in the book but wow this movie is a masterpiece if this doesnt end up being the best movie of 2024 then weve had a really good year for movies
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was phenomenal on my edge of the seat throughout the movie i was in complete awe 
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie proves that lucas films is ran by idiots dune 2 is a cinematic spectacle
Mar 1 2024,positive,this is a fantasy epic the likes of which are extremely rare and is a reminder of why we go to the movies    its grandiosity is paled only by its entertainment value and i truly hope everyone who sees it feels the same way spectacular
Mar 1 2024,negative,this sequel does not do justice to the material and is nowhere near the brilliance of part 1
Mar 1 2024,positive,masterpiece of scifi
Mar 1 2024,positive,great visuals and grand settings characters very well done especially fade really happy with most of the story and plot
Mar 1 2024,positive,part 2 is just as powerful as the first and mist bexseen on the big screen with big sound cant wait for part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,never in my life i thought id see something like this perfection in every sense of the word
Mar 1 2024,positive,the scope scale story and visual effects is like no other movie before perfection
Mar 1 2024,neutral,one time watch excellent background score
Mar 1 2024,positive,phenomenal part two simply epic compelling story amazing editing world class sound this movie rocked
Mar 1 2024,positive,as someone who couldnt watch the 1st one through this was entertaining enough austin butler stole the show for the 40 minutes he was in it
Mar 1 2024,positive,a must see preferably in imax it is an instant classic and will be a goto scifi movie alongside the greats reminds me of other great sequels like the the two towers and empire strikes back amazing sound and musical score beautiful visuals sets makeup and clothes and great looking cgi slightly different from the book and some minor pacing issues
Mar 1 2024,positive,the perfect sequel  well acted and does justice to the original work  cant wait for the next installment
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie absolutely blew me away wow
Mar 1 2024,positive,considering how good it could have been i guess it was adequate they should have just let jodorowsky make it the era of these kinds of big budget movies will soon end
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic is an understatement everyone in this film was on their a game this was better than part 1
Mar 1 2024,positive,i dont know how this book could be adapted to the big screen any better than this  well done by everyone involved i cant wait to watch the 3rd movie  i am going to see this again next week
Mar 1 2024,positive,a superb cinematic experience and a worthy adaptation of heberts material
Mar 1 2024,positive,a bit disappointed after part 1 the movie seemed to move from scene to unrelated scene with no joining context if you know the book you can follow it but i didnt feel that villeneuve was telling a story context of things such as the spice why it was the most valued product in the universe and how that leveraged the power play with other entities such as the bene gesserit chaom the spacing guild all of whom had to satiated by the emperor maintaining the flow to keep their support was not really explored     the changing of the waters was written out which underplayed jessicas role and the immensity of pauls act in drinking the water of life nor was the day to day use to extend life and give the fremen their buzz and cement fellowship at the spice ritual    jessicas dynamic with chani  well there was none the key points being chani understanding what paul had done in drinking the water of life and his mother not having that same understanding of her son was missed and of course dumped at the end when the tag for a sequel overrode the books ending     i also felt that especially towards the end that too many liberties were taken with rewriting the plot i understand that the need to be able to encompass the plot into a movie but timeline changes were poorly done as were things such as pauls ascension as duke over the fremen the pace was not varied enough for me it needed a few more scenes where the plot dynamics were discussed to give the importance of thing their proper context    clearly plotted for another movie with irulan who had far more screen time than the book would have credited her with looking to have a central role    i really like villeneuves work the job he did with blade runner 2049 was masterful i just came away thinking i hope theres a directors cut     as a ps the critics really fall down on this with on the one side some idiot suggesting that like avatar this is another metaphor for stripping mineral assets from an indigenous people the book was written in 1965 and the fremen were not indigenous to arrakis  on the other hand the loud bangs big screen action and special effects were enough for most of the others to go overboard with no actual critique how do you give that any credence studio stuffing the vote
Mar 1 2024,positive,story moves at very fast pace plenty of action and high praise to the acting ensemble outstanding score and cinematography saw in dolby well worth the couple extra dollars u felt as if u were getting on the worm
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part two is more than a movie it is an auditory and visual explosion of sensory stimuli designed to challenge your perceptions of what might be and your imagination as to what could be to fully appreciate all that will become your audio and visual transitions to the towering and majestic world that only exists in the vast and unknown reaches of our universe one must first become familiar with those who will guide your journey through the epic battles yet to be imagined and appreciated the central theme will be the battle for the lucrative mining rights for the mineral spice on the planet arrakas a rack us the battle for control of the planet and the rights to the spice mining contracts will be fought between the house of harkonen  the bad guys  and the house of atreides a trade ees  the good guys a magnificent and dynamic audio crescendo will ultimately transport you to what will become a final resolution and reconning an ending first suggested with frank herberts 1964 publishing of dune a book that would evolve to become 7dune franchise publications  recognize also that your journey will take 2 hours and 46 minutes of screen time for you to arrive at your final destination in space the problem being that the mind can only absorb as much as the posterior can withstand the intent of the program appears to deliver the maximum capabilities of cgi and audio electronic wizardry almost at the expense of a condensed story line the acting is good the electronic delivery systems are better if you enjoy an action movie whose core lies in the powers of both the occult and the mystical powers of the yet to come  strong kidneys will be required to carry you through to the sign on the screen indicating the end  rating a  t  e  a technical extravaganza
Mar 1 2024,positive,best movie ive ever seen from the cinematography to the performances from the cast this will be the best movie of 2024
Mar 1 2024,positive,enjoyable film strayed a bit too much from the book  didnt love what theyre doing with alia and lady jessica  although casting anya taylor joy as alia for the next installment is a excellent decision  cinematography and vibe was worth the price of admission  characters lacked emotional attachment and the harkonens are just weird
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part two initial reaction     score 100     quick thoughts     if you were lukewarm on the first part youll love this one    this is generational filmmaking and storytelling at its finest    denis villeneuve and company bring on dune messiah    full review

Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part two raises the stakes and doesnt waste a single moment of screen time every sight and sound is a spectacle to behold
Mar 1 2024,positive,overall this was a very enjoyable film  visually magnificent with excellent acting performances by pretty much everybody  pacing is a little slow at times and the story bogs down a bit with the harkonnens  my biggest disappointment was in the epic final battle which was over in all of three minutes  storywise the movie stayed fairly close to the books though not as well as the sci fi channel version  the role of spice in space travel was criminally neglected and the guild does not even make an appearance in the movie  nor does thufir hawat whose fate is a complete mystery  also disappointed not to see aliyah as a child  all that said it was definitely worth seeing in a movie theater
Mar 1 2024,positive,everything i dreamed it would be and then some

Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive ever seen keeps you entertained the whole way through and always keeps you guessing fantastic acting script writing and sfx an absolute masterpiece
Mar 1 2024,negative,the first half dragged stunning visuals no real danger cool moments that dragged on until i was sucked out of it entirely when the protagonist yells i laugh i also dont know how but they managed to make every antagonist seem silly and for that i felt no real danger forgettable isnt the right word more so predictable beautifully linear devoid of subliminal very in your face on whats to come the obvious was well made though meh
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece never in my life did i expect a film adaptation to be better than my favourite book and yet here it is visually stunning extremely well paced and the story  how did they manage to convey more nuance with less dialogue the plotlines that are changed feel more impactful more pronounced all the emotion is there but here you actually feel the slippery slope of dune messiah the heavy burden and the impending destruction    when i was a teen i hoped someone would adapt dune and do it justice this is so much more than i ever dared to wish for
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie was awesome  the acting is phenomenal by everyone especially zendaya and austin butler who put on one hell of a performance  the cinematography and some of the action scenes are superb  i enjoyed the score of the first movie a lot better and was a little underwhelmed by mr zimmer this go around but still love the old themes  i enjoyed the first movie a little more 95100 but this movie was right on par with the first one which is a feet in itself  i felt a couple of scenes dragged on a bit so i personally felt it couldve been a touch shorter but i l still oved it  overall gave it a 948100 go see for yourself
Mar 1 2024,positive,villeneuve does not disappoint   with a third rightly so being in the making in the foreseeable future we might have a generational trilogy in the making  everything about this movie lives up to all the hype and im proud that villeneuve gets to display his vision its time to put him with the praise that nolan and so many others deservedly get
Mar 1 2024,positive,sensational  a work of art
Mar 1 2024,positive,epic adventure that you must see action thriller suspense drama even subtle romance
Mar 1 2024,negative,to much time focusing on the visual not enough telling the story is not 100 in line with the books also paid for the action seats not worth it at all

Mar 1 2024,positive,the fantastic worldbuilding continues in dune 2 with phenomenal acting everywhere you turn the strength of this movie just like the first is in its patience the film never feels rushed yet keeps you engaged theres vast complexity but even if you miss a few beats the story remains entertaining and fulfilling until the end it appears well be in for a treat for years to come with this proper adaptation of the epic book series 
Mar 1 2024,positive,timothee chalamet was incredible the visuals were beautiful the big scenes were perfect

Mar 1 2024,positive,glorious thats my word for this movie i was never at one moment bored it held my attention they did make some changes to the story there were no changes that i thought were bad but just a different way of telling the story absolutely loved every performance in it timothée chalamet gives the finest performance of his young career it was absolutely beautiful and epic i honestly did not see a bad performance special effects were on point the score was beautiful it was so good to times at the movie felt too short because you wanted more as someone whos read the books and seen 1984 movie the scifi miniseries this handsdown is my favorite adaptation of dune

Mar 1 2024,positive,i give it two thumbs up and hope they make a part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,visually stunning continuation lots of action and interesting characters
Mar 1 2024,negative,dune 2 feels like its missing a script fails in character development skipped postproduction let a 12 year old manage the editing room and did it all on half the budget of dune 1 seriously i lost count of the number of times i fell asleep without missing anything in all the ways dune 1 delights dune 2 fails spectacularly
Mar 1 2024,positive,the most beautiful thing ive ever watch in the cinema denis is such an epic director of the decade worship
Mar 1 2024,positive,movie is fantastic anyone who says otherwise is lying
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was a good movie there was some changes from the original movie but it was still good make sure lee in your mind that might be a part three but it was good
Mar 1 2024,positive,just amazing every part of it
Mar 1 2024,positive,one of the best sci fi films ive seen in a long time
Mar 1 2024,positive,overall good but would benefit from following novel more closely lost some key elements in the process
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 is the sci fi movie of this decade   its the reason youre going to see great movies today but a mirror to what sci fi fans actually gravitate towards i still continue to think about this movie and wonder if through witchcraft  has heresy always been a foot in the genre of modern sci fi movies and tv shows is this why some of the loyalist and fandome have been weird over the years though their fandom backlash and gatekeeping is it a cult of personality or cult of spirituallity  prepare to be wow as this is another one of the greatest sequels of the history of film making
Mar 1 2024,negative,dbox seats didnt work
Mar 1 2024,positive,it was pretty damn good short of lord of the rings but not much else some changes from the books but they worked loved it
Mar 1 2024,positive,best movie of the year so far simply incredible   was huge fan of the first dune but part 2 is simply perfection  love the adaption and the decision denis villeneuve took with the book for this second part  everything is on point the pacing the acting the action   cant wait to rewatch it tomorrow again
Mar 1 2024,positive,this is the best scifi movie ever made disney star wars is a pile of dog turds in comparison actually sw shouldnt me mentioned in the same page as this dune is a masterpiece
Mar 1 2024,positive,had very high expectations upon viewing it blew those expectations out of the water and then some truly the best weve seen out of dennis villeneuve surpassing all prior films best director working today by a country mile this film must be seen in theaters remarkably stunning and beautiful 
Mar 1 2024,positive,this may be the best so fi epic ive ever seen
Mar 1 2024,positive,excellent movie you have to watch it in imax
Mar 1 2024,positive,i really loved this movie it was bigger splashier with a ton more action much faster paced than the first movie which necessarily was slower perhaps setting things up i love that villanueve finally plunged into the desert with full force giving us a rich palette of burning orange washed out sunbleached beige and deepblue night on the dunes the acting was uniformly excellent    and while i know that villanueve had to make alterations to herberts sprawling complex book i must say the ending took me aback and im at all sure i liked it it blew everything up in that subplot literally  literally literally  diametrically opposed to herberts final page    perhaps fingers crossed this suggests that the team is aiming for a dune messiah children of dune or perhaps beyond everything after children seems to me rather desultory compared to the first three especially dune but to have audiences who are not familiar with the story left with the clear implication yes some doubt but come on it did is actually kind of mean    but i loved the movie from the get go if you are a dune fan see it
Mar 1 2024,positive,what a space opera must be seen restrained acting intense action restrained pace the love for the work on which it is based is palpable florence pugh is a spectacular addition to the work
Mar 1 2024,positive,great story and great development of major characters cant wait for part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing they really pulled it off  i cant wait for dune messiah and i sure hope villeneuve reconsider ending it there because we need children of dune god emperor of dune etc
Mar 1 2024,positive,by far the best movie ive seen in a while  cant wait for part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely incredible a 1010
Mar 1 2024,positive,just insane a visual masterpiece just go and watch it
Mar 1 2024,positive,the best movie i have seen absolutely the best acting buy the best director a must see master piece
Mar 1 2024,positive,excellent even better than the first 
Mar 1 2024,positive,all i can say is that when the movie ends im torn between wanting to watch it all over again or needing a sequel thats the quality of movie we want to see and what production companies need to deliver the movie is beautiful and hits all the points it sets out to its been a while since a movie left me breathless congratulations and we want more i dont need to say anything else its a 1010 movie for me
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal film adaptations often have to take risks and dune 2 took the right ones ill be seeing it again this weekend
Mar 1 2024,positive,why zoom into their shoulders during fight scenes other than that 9910
Mar 1 2024,positive,totally transportive movie i was on arrakis for 2 hours and 38 minutes
Mar 1 2024,positive,for the person who likes to think this movie is for you the movie is dumbed down from the book but the compromises in the movie i felt were necessary to make the movie comprehensible otherwise the movie would need to be in several parts leading to a fan revolt the movie for me makes the book come alive it was just how i envisioned the book   be forewarned if you like simplistic movies you will hate this movie go watch star wars instead
Mar 1 2024,positive,i loved it ima watch it again imax is a must in the movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,is awesome the best movie of 2024
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a solid movie with a few surprises and man this movie makes you want to ride a sandworm  not sure who the bigger sadist is in this movie  austin butler or timothy chalamet
Mar 1 2024,positive,brilliant adaptation of the source material for the big screen more of a focus on pauls story than the 1984 movie scenes are well designed well shot and dont look like cgi actors do a great job bringing their characters into the story    for the length there are not many unnecessary scenes or shots but there are parts of the story that are overlooked to keep the story much more concise than the book
Mar 1 2024,positive,simply one of the greatest films ever denis villeneuve has cemented himself amongst the pantheon of great directors it is long but i still left yearning for more its just that good
Mar 1 2024,positive,superb everything that makes cinema great is in this movie the acting special effects and score are incredible
Mar 1 2024,positive,phenomenal one of the best movies ive ever seen and it might be my favorite movie of all time couldve sat there another 3 hours through another viewing as soon it ended
Mar 1 2024,negative,read dune for the first time in the early 70s as a kid dune part 1 took me back to then the visuals the plot everything basically perfect this one only loosely follows the book and in doing so loses all of the subtlety and intelligence of the book and part 1 really really disappointing the specials effects were great a confection with no real substance or message  i am surprised and disappointed but apparently everyone else loves it so it has that going for it
Mar 1 2024,negative,horrible interpretation of the novel
Mar 1 2024,negative,slow terribly slow it looks to me like it was made only to set up a third movie timothee chalet was a whiner crying about being a leader zendaya went from loving paul atredes to hating him the fight scenes were unimpressive firing nukes at a target close enough to immediately attack was totally unrealistic and the least said about the final fight scene the better 
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved the part one this one was even better best movie ive seen in a long time
Mar 1 2024,positive,great modernization of the source material and stellar performances
Mar 1 2024,positive,awesome job by the director i was worried he would follow too closely to the book like he did in dune part one i still like the first movie but this movie solves the weaker parts of the book especially the whole climax
Mar 1 2024,positive,saw this movie on opening night it starts right where part one left off and throws you right into things the acting was simply amazing by everyone once again there is a somewhat faster pace to this movie thanks to the increased action scenes the music and several scenes were so good i forgot i was sitting in a theater with hundreds of other people
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved it cant wait for the next installment
Mar 1 2024,positive,this is cinema
Mar 1 2024,positive,it finishes the dune story it was great ill be seeing it at least twice in theaters
Mar 1 2024,positive,the movie was very entertaining and throughly enjoyed it

Mar 1 2024,positive,i dont have words to express this masterpiece one of the best movies i ever seen
Mar 1 2024,positive,oh my goodness denis has done it my dad and i saw it and it was like a religious experience we watched part 1 five times in the theater and we will watch this as many times as a book reader the changes they made fit the movie so well i wasnt even mad go see this its gonna change your life 1010
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing best movie ive ever seen the thrilling action stunning visuals and incredible story will definitely make you like this movie especially if you liked the first one    the story was really well written and managed to show all the important plot points from the books the pacing is also a strong point it manages to keep you on your toes without overwhelming you with constant action    the visual effects are also incredibly well done they were an incredible storytelling device that managed to make the scenes from the books come to life they were made with an attention to detail that seems to be lacking in many movies made these days    all in all this is an amazing masterpiece that managed to perfectly portray the greatness of frank herberts works definitely a must watch for every science fiction fan that love movies with lots of action and a great story
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely amazing such a strongpowerful storyline
Mar 1 2024,positive,as a movie it was fine but as a fan of the books i dont feel it captured the central themes
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant everyone killed it going again tomorrow haha

Mar 1 2024,positive,so much more than a movie   it was more akin to a religious experience i am still shaking an hour later
Mar 1 2024,positive,ive been reading dune almost yearly for 30 years after 2001 dune ive been patiently waiting to see the pages come to life although there are some deviations this movie delivers in a most complete way the audience was clapping at the end cant wait to see it again
Mar 1 2024,positive,some wonderful scenes and great special effects and art direction but at least 30 minutes too long
Mar 1 2024,positive,such a great movie to watch and some super good sound tracks too
Mar 1 2024,positive,this movie is honestly amazing the cinematography is great the action is great the acting is great i was honestly shocked with how much i enjoyed this movie more than the first one you need to see this on the biggest screen possible i think the only issue i have with this movie is that the final battle felt short and couldve been slightly longer
Mar 1 2024,positive,the best adaptation in getting the core themes of dune across in cinematic format also an epic experience never before seen in scifi on screen
Mar 1 2024,positive,we peaked too early
Mar 1 2024,positive,once again im blown away this is a masterpiece and a must see incredible

Mar 1 2024,positive,think of the empire strikes back but better it will win best picture
Mar 1 2024,positive,an epic masterpiece that improves on the original in every way
Mar 1 2024,positive,even more epic than the first great continued character development and intense action watch on the biggest screen possible
Mar 1 2024,positive,a little underwhelming felt like the first hour and half were dragged quite a bit no insane background score like in part 1 but still ok the last 3045 mins felt rushed but was epic
Mar 1 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie amazing story love the action the world was incredible a
Mar 1 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in long time imax was worth it  ive read the dune and dune messiah novels and having the knowledge of the way the story goes in those books only makes the movie better in my opinion the casting is perfect the acting is great javier bardem even made my whole theater laugh a couple times in a good way of course what else can i say the story is fantastic a must see hopefully an award winning film scifi world building action drama cinematography all great 1010
Mar 1 2024,positive,an epic spectacle to behold on the largest screen possible a visual stunner anchored by great performances timothee chalamet is wonderful i liked part two even more than part one
Mar 1 2024,positive,just left the theatre really the only cons i think think of for this movie are sometimes the pacing can be a bit off and understanding what the characters are referring to can sometimes be confusing may take a second viewing to fully grasp everything other than that its truly a great movie the score my god how amazing hans zimmer does it again no surprise acting is top tier cinematography is an easy grade a this is a must see in imax dont hesitate go see it
Mar 1 2024,positive,outstanding love letter to the book a monster of a movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,i have been waiting for 35 years for such a visually stunning and captivating depiction of this amazing story im speechless and sending this review from my car before i even leave the theater chalomet really embodies the terrible choice of leadership the muad dib must make and the queue up for a third movie is obvious dune part iii which im sure will be based on messiah is as good as certain ill be seeing this in the theater more than once the sound its incredible the entire thing was incredible
Mar 1 2024,positive,i didnt think it was possible but it was even better than the first movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,immediately rocketed to one of my favorite movies of all time takes everything amazing about the first one and turns it up to ten i hope and pray they green light part 3 dennis youre a beast man everyone go see this movie

Mar 1 2024,positive,excellent  masterpiece  cant wait for part 3  9510
Mar 1 2024,positive,i loved watching this movie captivating and such a great perspective continuation after part 1 is seamless and a great story line i want part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,hands down the best movie since infinity war  might just be the best movie ever  it kinds great to not having watched 1000 youtube videos about it like a did with star wars to go in fresh with not really understanding the first movie all that much    the 4 main cast members deserve oscars timothy zendaya havier and rebecca  gosh rebecca fergason was great    and i love the surprise when he drinks the water of life and sees anna taylor joy
Mar 1 2024,positive,builds on everything great from the first movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic epic and nearly perfect film cannot wait for part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,i am still thinking about this film hours later a true epic of modern scifi film making from a master director at the peak of his ability amazing cinematography with such a resonant soundtrack yet also delivering the plot in a concise manner that breaks everything down from the complexities of the novel it certainly is a part two starting from where the last ended but the performances and character moments are delivered with more gravitas more chilling emphasis and more power overall across this film that i am astounded with how balanced everything was two and a half hours plus just flew by before i realised
Mar 1 2024,positive,highly recommended and rest assured that despite what you see on the screen no worms were harmed during filming
Mar 1 2024,positive,book fan the director kept the feel of dune even with the changes and i look forward to seeing part 3 the dune universe did feel like it came to life i would complain more about the run time vs amount of story line accomplished but i really enjoy the whole artistic style of the crew from lighting to costumes and especially the set building the crew deserves a couple oscars the acting was extremely good and feyd was top notch and deserves an oscar nod i take one star away because i dont understand the changes to cheyenne storyline and aliyahs storyline so i hoping movie 3 ties it in anna taylor joy is for me a really good casting decision for her character so i will forgive missing creepy aliyah i hope movie 3 doesnt waste more than the first act in cheyenne reconciliation and i am very curious how they adjust for annas age without somehow combining book 34 which could work if he picked up his pace as a huge fan of the 84 movie and the scifi mini series and books 14 still working on the rest i appreciate someone representing not necessarily whats on page but still carries the emotional journey of the books i would compare this for fantasy fans not familiar with dune to lord of the rings with the many changes for book lovers but the movies still captures the world and story they fell in love with i think the biggest complement i can give the people who made this movie is my 13 year old never looked at her phone once and kept asking if they are making a third movie
Mar 1 2024,positive,i was confused for most of movie might need to see again to see if it makes more sense if i hasnt seen the 1984 movie i would have no clue what happened 
Mar 1 2024,positive,incredible film making at its finest from top to bottom this is a cinematic experience youll want to be a part of many will say there are points where its slow but if youve seen the part 1 then its nothing youre not ready for go experience this on as big a screen as you can
Mar 1 2024,positive,just wonderful a culmination of what this franchise is one of the best films ive ever seen the story the action the visuals and my goodness the performances had me at the edge of my seat the entire time 
Mar 1 2024,negative,great special effects and visuals however changed main storyline end point is almost the same but the thrill of the story of the book was lost destroyed chani and who she represents instead of a powerful ending of unity like the book a garbled message of dysfunction
Mar 1 2024,positive,the most wonderful film i have ever watched in the cinema it worth a imax ticket for sure
Mar 1 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece movies like this are few and far between the strong plot the great music and astounding visuals make this a must see denis villeneuve is the spielberg of today young aspiring directors take note this is how it is done
Mar 1 2024,positive,awesome really beautiful cinematography  a superb cast made this a standout from all of the recent films of blah timothee chalamet is a bright talent i hope they do the next 2 movies
Mar 1 2024,positive,saw it for the second time and noted additional small herbertisms best sci fi movie since original blade runner with harrison ford            deep earthy and relivant to 2024
Mar 1 2024,positive,the visuals and music couldnt be better this is totally worth it other movie directors should be ashamed for not having this level of quality
Mar 1 2024,positive,makes part one even better love how it all connects and brings you deeper into this world highly recommend seeing with a great crowd or group of friends amazing theater experience
Mar 1 2024,positive,i liked the movie and the story
Mar 1 2024,positive,a great cast story and action an outstanding sequel 
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved it very entertaining and great character buildup
Mar 1 2024,positive,chills down my spine straight down to my legs wow
Mar 1 2024,positive,i took my son to the matinee as soon as he got out of school this will be his star wars we both loved it now he is asking me about the whole dune universe all six books
Mar 1 2024,positive,just got back from the first imax showing and wow was i impressed this was what the big screen was made for i thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end
Mar 1 2024,positive,as someone whos long loved the book and didnt quite see a literal adaptation on the screen working villeneuve really delivered something timeless gone are the long trips and more psychedelic aspects paul has visions but all of the mysticism seems grounded in a reality of sorts one of the more fanciful aspects of the book is his sister alia and i really struggled to understand how they would adapt this in part 2 no spoilers but she is paid homage in a meaningful but not overly fantastical way    herbert doesnt go into the gory details in the retaking of arrakis and villeneuve absolutely knocks the movie portrayal out of the park also book lovers will notice this movie is not all tied up in a bow the way the book is and almost feels like a cliff hanger theres no reason to think at this point we arent getting part 3 which presumably tells the story of the jihad and the second book messiah    go see the movie see it twice see it on the biggest screen you can see it on this is an empire strikes back level event
Mar 1 2024,positive,better than part 1 but first hour could have been more engaging
Mar 1 2024,positive,easily the best movie ive seen in the past 6 years   i cant think of one bad performance in the entire movie  my faith is not fully restored in hollywood but this is a great start 
Mar 1 2024,positive,best cinematic experience ever at a theatre definitely forgot to breathe in the final third of the movie still thinking about it 5 days later
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune 2 is long   very very long
Mar 1 2024,positive,the scale of this movie surpasses everything feel like a war behind the screen we witness pauls growth to become the promised messiah and as he does the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chilling  feydrautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense he is unpredictable and sadistic truly relishing it and austin butler portrays him magnificently but paul played by timothée chalamet feels like oppression itself of a much more powerful and sinister evil but his more human side is not overlooked as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders all interpretations are truly magnificent  hans zimmer provides a sense of epicness without neglecting the mystique the visuals are incomparable the effects are polished to the smallest detail making you believe in dune in arrakis and in the entire world built by frank herbert and shown through denis villeneuves vision this great director continues to improve with this film he brings his sensitivity to tell the most epic story of his career perhaps his greatest challenge and he has succeeded  i truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters and i hope that just like the book did this movie becomes a benchmark for propelling the future of scifi
Mar 1 2024,positive,everything you should expect plus more
Mar 1 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic a cinematic marvel unlike anything ive ever watched before   it really seems unbelievable to me that we actually get to watch something like this

Mar 1 2024,positive,its awesome spectacular
Mar 1 2024,negative,the movie itself is beautiful and any fan of dune who hasnt read the book will love the movie with that said any fan who loves the book will not enjoy the movie the basics are there to complete the story but the changes that were made ruin the story a character rewrite characters missing and story changes does not make up for the beauty of the film

Mar 1 2024,positive,a masterpiece and revolutionary
Mar 1 2024,positive,grand film perfect for imax  as with the first movie the plot has been tinkered with in some ways that are not majorly significant but minor enough to change the tone the ending was not what i was expecting and so obviously sets us up for dune part 3
Mar 1 2024,positive,dune is shaping up to be the best science fiction movie series of all time tantalizing visuals brilliant acting and masterfully written story telling this is a movie everyone must see
Mar 1 2024,positive,saw the feb 25 early showing in imax  incredible to watch on big screen  zendaya was a great  much of dune ii was grand brutal epic and extreme  chani remained grounded recognizable intimate and sympathetic   easy to think back on her journey and with it the larger story a fine continuation of dune part i

Feb 29 2024,positive,the cinematography and score were amazing the acting from everyone was great especially timothee who was a commanding lead
Feb 29 2024,positive,one of the best cinematic experience i ever had in my entire life mind blown  
Feb 29 2024,positive,i wasnt a huge fan of the first movie ill just put that out there first with this in mind i went into the cinema with low expectations for this movie yet hopeful that it would surprise me this movie blew my expectations out of the water or should i say out of the sand without going into detail the pacing was better than the first movie and made me appreciate that this story wasnt crammed into one movie walking out of this movie made me feel like watching the first again and also taking a look at the novel
Feb 29 2024,positive,one of the best movie worthy of the part i
Feb 29 2024,positive,awesome visually stunning and a welcome use of creative license everyone nails their role i was iffy about zendaya even after dune 1 but now im team chani cant wait to see it again and again and again and
Feb 29 2024,positive,i just came out of the imax screening what can i say it was awesome the story the visuals the music the actors everything is magnified with incredible attention to detail and makes this experience mindblowing everyone is left speechless at the end of the screening not a word it takes a few minutes to recover from it    je sors de la séance en imax que dire à part grandiose  lhistoire les images la musique les acteurs  tout est magnifié avec un soin incroyable et rend cette expérience sidérante  tout le monde reste sidéré à la fin de la séance pas un mot il faut quelques minutes pour sen remettre 
Feb 29 2024,positive,immersive and compelling
Feb 29 2024,positive,best movie i have ever seen  im going to see it again for the second time and i think for a third one  this movie left a big hole in me and i now will be comparing every thing that i see to dune part two 
Feb 29 2024,positive,was well shot special effects were done very well  followed the book stories fairly well
Feb 29 2024,positive,according  to my first impressions dune 2 is the best work of denis villeneuve at the moment
Feb 29 2024,positive,i have to put a review for this masterpiece so here it is  the music the scenery the combat the actors the story the special effect every single field of this film has been polished to perfections with this second title of the trilogy  you will shake when the fights happens you will laugh every fiber of your being because of stilgar you will fear feydrautha   i cannot emphasis enough on how this movie makes you feel things i v never felt before going to the cinema  and extra plus  watch it on imax equipped theatres to get the effect of the voice its an experience out of this world
Feb 29 2024,positive,i worship at the feet of this small desert mouse truly a masterpiece of filmmaking
Feb 29 2024,positive,unbelievable film like game of thrones x star wars havent been this in love with a story  world since lotr
Feb 29 2024,positive,the best movie ive ever seen the buildup from dune part one was absolutely amazing if you didnt like part one you are most likely to enjoy part two a lot more
Feb 29 2024,positive,could be the best science fiction movie i ever watched everything was great the storytelling the pace the scenery the music what a masterpiece
Feb 29 2024,negative,pretty to look at but the story is just boring to me
Feb 29 2024,positive,best adaptation to screen since the lord of the rings trilogy precise balance between an epic storytelling and uptodate issues
Feb 29 2024,positive,while the plot may deviate a little from the books or other retellings its not to the detriment of story this movie is a visual and auditory spectacle so do yourself a favour and see it on the big screen you wont regret it
Feb 29 2024,positive,dune 2  an electrifying sequel that digs deeper into the sands of intrigue and adventure with a plot as intricate as a sand dunes pattern and action that hits harder than a sandstorm this film will keep you hooked from start to finish just dont forget your sunscreen this is the type of movie cinemas were made for 910 sandworms not included
Feb 29 2024,positive,incredible movie much much better than the first part stunning in storytelling audio and visuals it captivates you at every turn in my opinion it is the next big franchise to come out of hollywood
Feb 29 2024,negative,trash movie they completly butchered the storyline of the emperor of mankind
Feb 29 2024,negative,it isnt dune bad pacing terrible score horribly miscast i am puzzled by the overthetop praise
Feb 29 2024,positive,what denis villeneuve does is historic this incredible conclusion with the brilliance of the cast is very captivating simply perfect
Feb 29 2024,positive,a really good second part incredible pictures with a good story
Feb 29 2024,positive,it was fine but you really need to see the first again before watching part 2    the music is nice  cinematicwise its good    the film feels shallow in its portrayal of the different sides harkonnen are basically visualized as nazis why nazis cant people be portrayed as evil without being nazis  we dont get to see much of the emperors side  that makes the emperor feel as a side note in the story even though the emperor plays a major part in the universe the sardaukar are fearsome foes in battle more so than harkonnen and this was not shown in the movie at all  the harkonnen forces were also defeated like it was nothing  and the fremen of course just cant do anything wrong    i didnt get the feeling that anyone was at the planets mercy  thats a huge part of the dune universe and was better portrayed in the first movie    i loved the original games and movies of course that was a different time
Feb 29 2024,positive,the sheer scale of this movie coupled with villeneuves strive to perfect deliver the most exhilarating theatre experience its a once in a few years blockbuster timothee and rebecca were the mvps with everybody doing great jobs you feel the beauty of arrakis through greig frasers eyes and its so elevating when zimmer comes in to lift your soul with his earthshattering tunes   this movie is the magnum opus a legendary sequel in line with tdk ttt and esb
Feb 29 2024,positive,absolute masterpiecegripping storystunning visualsgreat sound and amazing acting didnt notice how almost 3 hours went by
Feb 29 2024,positive,i loved the first part and the second part is even better although without oscar isaac it is for sure one of the highlights in cinema this year  the visuals are stunning personally i think the arena scene is a little to over the top how big ist it   too big  you have to experience this movie in a cinema with great big  screen and even better sound it is fantastic i wish they would give some characters a little bit more depth although it is already a good level sadly i still think timothée chamalet was a bad casting decision zendaya wouldnt be my first choice either but she does a solid job i am really looking forward for the next chapter josh brolin and rebecca ferguson are the most perfect choices for this production if u havent seen it yet go to the cinema now
Feb 29 2024,positive,an absolute gem and one of the best films ive seen in a long time a cinematic masterpiece this movie is incredibly wellcrafted with beautiful scenes stunning settings and a mesmerizing soundtrack im truly impressed  wow is all i can say the adaptation from the book is exceptionally well done making it a mustwatch for both book enthusiasts and movie lovers alike

Feb 29 2024,positive,phenomenal the world building in this movie is done so extremely well the storyline had me biting my nails throughout the whole movie the fight scenes were shown in the best way possible 1010
Feb 29 2024,positive,1010  acting and directing  movie of the year the action short but great 
Feb 29 2024,positive,such a special scifi adaptation grab some popcorn and get ready to watch
Feb 29 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever seen and excuse me saying that it was unexpected a truly remarkable job by both actors and director  book readers always feel dissatisfied and disappointed when their books turn into films but with this one i can say they wont be
Feb 29 2024,positive,this might be the best sci fi ever produced in my opinion was captivated from start to finish the depth of character and story paired with the stunning visuals is what makes this the best movie in years
Feb 29 2024,positive,visually fantastic and action packed with innovative world building and efficient wellpaced storytelling  well acted well directed well done  worth ensuring its seen on the big screen while playing  and not to soon to declare it among the all time greats of the scifi genre
Feb 29 2024,positive,perfect visuals and scenery the whole movie great job telling the story without rushing the development of most characters going to see for the second time this week tomorrow
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is so beautiful and epic i highly recommend it
Feb 29 2024,positive,movie is absolutely great for people who likes to see true cinema stunning and elegant
Feb 29 2024,positive,dune part two is a perfection     i could see this movie will get oscar nomination in many category next year     best director  best cinematography  best sound  best visual effect  best costume design  best actor  best supporting actor    denis villeneuve now is your time to get oscar because dune part 2 is so epic and beautiful every scene is so well conposed and we got to see fremen and harkonnen world in details plus more of bene gesserit story  paul atreides transformation from a hero to a villain is succesfully execute by timothée chalamet and the way javier bardem portrays as stilgar who represent fanaticism in the movis is excellent
Feb 29 2024,positive,absolutely unreal movie one of the best movies i have ever seen and a massive step up from an already amazing dune part 1 this is a must see movie
Feb 29 2024,positive,the best sci fi film of the last 10 years picks up where dune 1 ended then goes on a adrenaline ride that will amaze and thrill every viewer the battle scenes are amazing and awe inspiringfirst must see movie since oppenheimer
Feb 29 2024,positive,one of the best scifi films of our time
Feb 29 2024,positive,this film is a visual masterpiece i admire greig frasers work here he is brilliantly capable of creating authenticity and visual greatness in an unseen way   fantastic what director dop crew and cast have achieved here
Feb 29 2024,positive,villeneuve vision for the adaptation of the first arguably best novels of dune is to condense the story into its essential elements and sand down the rough patches that resulted from writing sequels to the original dune  dune the novel was never intended to go beyond the first  villeneuve has done an outstanding job which is demonstrated by the failed attempts from other writers and directors of the subject  whereas part one follows the book closely part two drops characters events and the sense of finality that the book had  this isnt a bad thing but fans of the book should be prepared  there is a downside to his achievement is that differs slightly in tone  for all of that  this is quite an accomplishment  the film adds humor shows the dangerous influence of religious fanaticism and the machiavellian maneuvering of selfserving politicians in a spectacle not seen in recent hollywood films
Feb 29 2024,negative,this was a satisfactory sequel albeit slightly disappointing good but not great prob sums it up weird to not have alia around and weird to have chani speak in a crisp american accent not enough explorationexplanation of the bene gesserit ambitions their abilities etc few surprises
Feb 29 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece a true epic filmmaking at its perfection
Feb 29 2024,positive,if i had to summarize the whole thing into two words id say overly dramatic   obviously the special effect unit did the best job of the entire crew the sound was so damn loud and dramatic all the time i had the feeling im riding a massive whalesized speaker this kid thimotee or whatever his name is is not up to the task of being the scifi muhammed of the dunes lacks charisma acting skills and age the guy looks like a teen give him high school films to act in  i almost fell a sleep 2 times in the cinema and it was a 1pm showing so i wasnt tired or anything  there were some unexplained obvious plot holes which slapped my face directly and just left me dumbfounded   im a scifi fan so i was entertained enough but i wouldnt give this thing a second watch its very superficial
Feb 29 2024,positive,little spoiler alert    if you didnt like the first one this one also wont be for you that being said its a nearly perfect second part to what hopefully will end up as a triology the only real critic point is the lack of time awareness since the real change from the book is the much compressed timeline around 6 months instead of 3 years     the performances of all actors are outstanding the sounddesign much more refined than in the first movie and the pictures ever so great 1010 cant wait to see it again on an imax screen
Feb 29 2024,positive,i just watched dune part two denis villeneuve has done such an impressive job that honestly speaking this film in my opinion will be as historic in its genre as interstellar the actors have performed at the highest level no one else could have looked better than timothée  talent thats talent the music the vastness of the world the scope as well as the fighting art  unique elements of the film that must be enjoyed in an imax theater i was surprised when i watched the first part and that surprise continues my body and eyes are still in shock from what they experienced i recommend it
Feb 29 2024,positive,despite some major differences from the book i found it a marvellous movie
Feb 29 2024,positive,dont  get full stars only for the small changes made
Feb 29 2024,positive,villeneuve is the messiah herbert warned us about seriously for 60 years the whole fandom believed this story to be impossible to film for a good reason this dude he just comes and shows us all so wrong the thumpers i still hear them
Feb 29 2024,positive,it is close to a masterpiece if they didnt make it into a part one or a part two but i get it
Feb 29 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece dune 2 is spectacular in every way from the world building to the character development everything was perfect just as i had imagined it when i read the books every actor brought their agame and although i wasnt overly fond of timothee as paul in dune 1 he did an amazing job this time long live the fighters
Feb 29 2024,positive,the movie was great long story short great actors great story and great time in the cinema the first one was good the second part of dune even better
Feb 29 2024,positive,a masterpiece in cinematography the likes of which i havent seen since mad max fury road it also manages to do justice to the storyline while changing or omitting enough elements to make it suitable for the format
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is the best of all the time no word can describe for itjust watch those who want to watch this movie
Feb 29 2024,positive,dune part two is one of the best produced films i have ever seen the cinematography casting direction and special effects are all phenomenal the filmmakers have paid intricate attention to detail and it shows throughout the movie    the film follows two strongwilled lovers who are among the many fighters on the planet arrakis paul wants to destroy the people who killed his family but foresees a dangerous future that same force is messing with his mind and may ruin his plan to save their people    some of your favorite actors are in dune part two the main characters are paul or uzul timothée chalamet chani zendaya jessica rebecca ferguson stilgar javier bardem feydrautha austin butler beast rabban dave bautista and emperor christopher walken the casting is fantastic each actor compliments their characters beautifully and believably i felt many emotions while watching it because of the great acting when chani is hurt by uzuls sudden change of mind the air feels tense and her anger is shown also uzuls mom jessica is mysterious and changes her personality when she drinks the poison this film is so wellproduced i am beyond amazed by the quality of the production the camerawork captures the scenes so well especially when they are in the desert the special effects are mindblowing like when uzul and chani blow up multiple helicopters the machine they are running from looks incredibly realistic and threatening when uzul has visions the special effects are welldisplayed we learn that by consuming spice the people on arrakis can see the future you know when they are seeing the future because their eyes turn blue this film exceeds all my expectations and explores science fiction beautifully the pacing is perhaps a bit off but you might expect some slow parts since it is nearly three hours long a lot of hard work went into creating this film i highly recommend watching dune part one to understand the concepts the characters and their backstories dune part 2 picks up right where dune part one left off these two films really bring the dune books to life i applaud the director denis villeneuve for creating such admirable work my favorite part of the film is when paul or uzul learns to ride a huge sandworm the special effects are remarkable because you feel as if you are on the sandworm with him  the wind rushes the sand flies everywhere and the motion of the sandworm is smooth it looks incredibly realistic and it shows how far cgi has come    the films message is to have hope and to always believe it can happen pauls hope carries him throughout his fights and he constantly encourages the others to believe that they can do it he also tells his mother to not give them false hope over a prophecy be aware that this film has mature concepts a lot of violence profanity and bloody scenes    i give dune part two 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults dune part two releases in theaters march 1 2024 by sydney s kids first
Feb 29 2024,positive,this is the greatest movie of all time i am still in shock
Feb 29 2024,positive,absolutely greatest of all time guaranteed oscars for every category
Feb 29 2024,positive,it is really good 
Feb 29 2024,positive,visually stunning but the pacing is erratic and for book purests too much is changed about the characters and too many important plot details are ignored to gloss over a tv series delving into herberts incredible world building seems better suited than movie format    i enjoyed this movie for what it was a spectacle ill leave the substance for the books
Feb 29 2024,positive,blown away by the visuals denis villeneuve have once again proved himself by giving us another masterpiece  i was soo connected with the movie thank you 
Feb 29 2024,positive,if you adore scifi movies this movie is made for you the cinematography is beautiful hans zimmers score is great there is absolutely more action sequences than the first one lady jessica the mother of paul atreides she is horrifying timothée chalemet acting performance is unexpected good austin butler as feydrautha is menacing go see the movie if you have the chance
Feb 29 2024,positive,my heart was racing throughout the film so much so i almost had a heart attack during the second half im literally being so serious greatest cinematic experience of my life
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is incredible absolutely the best have the fuck dennis do that again everything in this movie is very good i love it
Feb 29 2024,negative,that was a paper thin exposition of a deep and moving story pretty to look at but written as if someone had been given a synopsis of what happens in the books and was reciting it from memory forgetting very important points   unforgivable sins kicking alia down the timeline teasing her as if to whet the appetite for messiah but not dealing at all with the horror of being preborn moving the barons death to paul instead of her may have seemed a way out of messy exposition but it just looked lazy                                  compressing the timeline into approximately 8 months alia does not appear to be born yet at the end making the entire movie only months long somehow all the harkonnen story fit into that timeline and the emperor received a message then assembled the entire court and sardukar and got to arrakis before jessica gestated                                  making chani a surly angry cuckold i get it the dutiful wife arc would not look good in todays environment but her deep love for paul her loss of their first child her grounding of the legend and her stoic acceptance of destiny is what shapes paul into the man who can shoulder the terrible burden he sees in the future instead this is all compressed into shell get over it  ive seen it    i wont finish the list but it is long was it a good movie paced well and visually stunning the pacing was off but not as badly as the first movie the visuals and the feel were unparalleled ill give it one star for that and go back to reading the books
Feb 29 2024,positive,i did not wait for nothing this film this saga goes directly into my list of masterpieces to review again and again this second part returned me amazed me made me feel emotions from the beginning until the very fine thank you mr villeneuve
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is absolutely fornominal one of my new favourites so jam packed such good direction and story telling
Feb 29 2024,positive,just like the previous movie dune 2 is a masterpiece in all aspects of movie production from sound effects to cgi franks unique world of dune has been perfectly delivered to us viewers although there are a few changes from the original novel it does no harm to the original storyline and setting of the characters in fact those changes has made the movie so unique that i myself who has read the novel was amused by them timothée again has proved himself as the best fit for playing paul atreides cant wait for the release of the third movie 55
Feb 29 2024,positive,finally a good movie
Feb 29 2024,positive,go and watch dune part two now this movie is a piece of art and a god this is a absolutely mustwatch movie of 2024 and maybe it is the best movie of 2024

Feb 29 2024,positive,one of the finest pieces of scifi movie making since 2001 a space oddyssey    every cut every frame feels thoughtout and cared for dune is a must see on the big screen the bigger the screen the better
Feb 29 2024,positive,the first one was something new thats why i think dune was better but the second movie had no boring scenes in it and was absolutely worth the time
Feb 29 2024,positive,saw it last night and am still basking in the afterglow from seeing this spectacle of a movie on the big screen a truly epic fiction with gripping action sequences throughout the entire length in the first movie i thought the worms were pretty cool but didnt really get the whole hype around them after seeing the second movie now all i can say is   i get it now
Feb 29 2024,positive,the greatest cinema experimente you can imagine    a great cast with a great director    a worthy sequal  and a absolut 1010
Feb 29 2024,positive,ive witnessed the best scifi ever made
Feb 29 2024,positive,the movie was a great successor to the first one the visuals and sound made for a top notch immersion and both the actors and storytelling were great like the first movie the 2 12 hours playtime felt like an hour  because it was that good there should be more movies like this its really hard to find something to complain about 455
Feb 29 2024,positive,despite some of the scenes that were quite monotonous contemplative and plodding the rich storyline displayed an enormous cinematic experience of special effects with some intense duels and warfare scenes
Feb 29 2024,positive,epic on many levels a big step up from the first movie
Feb 29 2024,positive,masterpiece a film for the ages
Feb 29 2024,positive,enjoyable but doesnt achieve the hype speeds through parts and then slows to crawl through others i found the story way too drawn out and overall for the amount of story given it couldve been shorter however once again the sound design and cinematography are masterful
Feb 29 2024,positive,holy freaking sht that was the most cinema experience for me its the most cinema cinema the sound the visuals the drama the cast i love this movie so much

Feb 29 2024,positive,the best movie of my life so far
Feb 29 2024,positive,awesome after having read the books i was sceptical that it would be well represented in a film such as the bene gesserit voices but really well done
Feb 29 2024,positive,the best movie ive seen in the last two years
Feb 29 2024,positive,saw the film at the first screening last night and left shocked there were real got moments the director is able to pick up the individual threads of the conflict between the personalities and pour them into a cinematic concept with independent characters in the second part of the film all the characters take another step forward in their development and the film ends with the knowledge that paul check it out 
Feb 29 2024,positive,dune part two is a masterpiece give denis villeneuve and timothee chalamet their oscars now
Feb 29 2024,positive,absolute masterpiece i had i hopes for the second part of dune because the first one was already awesome it was no disappointment the dune part 2 is even better than dune 1 from 2021 the movie is around 3h long but it feels no minute too long besides the epic battles which are perfect for the big screen there is so much depth and meaning in the character development of paul chani etc   watch is movie in the theatre you need to experience this on the big screen with atmos
Feb 29 2024,negative,compared to this poor extension the first part now looks like a masterpiece nothing left from the frank herbert novel nor the earlier screenings of this story if writing the scenarios is considered the destruction of genuine ideas and changing content for some other totally noninspiring one and acting is plain posing and murmuring yourself in a chin then underestimating the unfortunate audience really went too far even according to the todays measures this kind of film can only be seen as an example of how they should not be recorded in my case at least i know that i will no longer look from this director any future achievement    its best to try to forget this experience as soon as possible i dont know how to help it rereading the original novels is a process too long but maybe its the only way it is obvious that none of the participants in this nonwork found it necessary to spend time to read the mentioned    as for christopher walken its always nice to see him on the screen but maybe its time for him to at least at the end of his career starts choosing roles in this company he really has nothing to seek
Feb 29 2024,positive,best sequel seen plot faithful to the book and magnificent visual experiences that offer total immersion in the film a must see in the best screen and audio service simply amazing
Feb 29 2024,positive,amazing to see the possibility of advanced storytelling i love every single picture
Feb 29 2024,positive,a cinematic masterpiece like history was actually made this movie left me speechless i couldnt even stand and i was crying because of how breathtaking this movie is i dont even think i have the words to describe it its an experience like even if you dont like cinema this movie is so beautiful and captivating you want to know what will happen omg it is so much better than the first one i didnt see the time pass and i want so much more slapped in the face and ill never be the same anymore
Feb 29 2024,positive,23723  when the credits rolled on oppenheimer i found myself in an ironic melancholy as the thought settled  i may not see something as great as this for years to come     well denis villeneuve said lmao bet cuz mark my words  in the near future dune 2 will be not only be helmed as an exceptional sequel but also one of the greatest films of all time     dune 2 is the epitome of epic a convergence of the best minds in the industry crafting a timeless masterpiece    while commendations will rightfully pour in for the compelling narrative stellar acting captivating cinematography and flawless cgi i wanna shed some limelight on the soundscape of the film  its unsung hero    hans zimmer a maestro in scoring legendary fillms for north of five decades delivers what may be his magnum opus this film will fall flat without the grandeur of its score which heightens each scene to orgasmic proportions the amount of artistry that went bend this production is unfathomable an achievement in cinema     every penny invested in this experience is worthwhile films of such caliber emerge once in a decade so do yourself a favour and make your purse a bit thinner to experience it in imax  not for the sake of extravagance but because denis villeneuve envisioned this cinematic marvel to be savored in that format this isnt a film to be casually torrented and watched at home
Feb 29 2024,negative,i watched it and it was ok i found the acting of some of the characters a bit odd and off putting the chani and glossu characters were so transparent and poor acted chani felt like i was watching a teen romcom at times the cinematography was amazing as were the special effects i just cant get past the fact that i felt bored almost like i was watching something that had no point and no real climax sad since i have loved the books and the original movie so much
Feb 29 2024,negative,it felt like a ripoff starwars bad guy breathing weird spoiler hello cousin    what the actual fuck
Feb 29 2024,positive,longlivethe fighters     we all needed thisthe theaters some would say most of alllest they disappear for good  all 
Feb 29 2024,positive,i had a great time and it made me want more of the story
Feb 29 2024,positive,wow exceeded my expectations no spoilers ill only say this movie covers a lot of good stuff incredible acting and very gripping there was a couple times i caught myself squeezing my wifes hand lol go see the movie and enjoy
Feb 29 2024,negative,there is no doubt this is a visual cinematic masterpiece the problem is if the skript is flawed the pictures can not safe a bad movie   every character depth is lost and in the end you walk out of a movie ending up hating everybody our thinking they are complete idiots in the book the characters are not less horrible but definitely less stupid but there is a deep reason for the individual behavior this is completely lost due to squeezing two movies into one   i get that things like foresight are hard to visualize but i had hope after the first movie which i loved lets just say they changed the approach slightly and by doing this completely missed a key element of the story
Feb 29 2024,positive,an incredible adaption that changes so many details from the book but captures the essence of dune long time fans and non book readers can both get a lot out of this
Feb 29 2024,positive,i saw the film during fan preview night in los angeles the film moves right along i wish it did drag on at certain moments but i loved it i cant wait to see it again this weekend a must see for scifi fans
Feb 29 2024,positive,an absolute masterpiece this is a 2001 a space odyssey of our times
Feb 29 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen my whole lifed
Feb 29 2024,positive,the only thing i can say against this movie is that it felt rushed only because i have read the book so many times  other than that its a masterpiece
Feb 29 2024,negative,this film unfortunately fell extremely short in anything but runtime ruined by excessive length and disjointed storytelling prolonged scenes and abrupt shifts in focus along with the introduction of numerous characters left much to be desired resulting in a disappointing cinematic experience    a half star is being generous
Feb 29 2024,positive,it is both very satisfying and somewhat underwhelming yes there is the uprising the battles revenge and contest for the throne and there is a compelling depiction on how fanaticism can take over best part of the film is pauls transformation into a prophetsavior of fremen  how his unwillingness only brings about the inevitable but finale disappoints deaths of key antagonists become a mere technicality and so does the romantic storyline yet the big story is far from over the loose ends can only be tied by a sequel which is already in the works it seems
Feb 29 2024,positive,the cinematography is incredible  the acting is very good and the musical score is as epic as the story  butas a life long fan of the original book and the entire grand epic that followed i was disappointed  huge chunks of the plot were cut out ignored or inexplicably changed  the time frame of the book was 45 years but jessica still hasnt given birth to alia when the movie ends  apparently the rulers of the universe can be overthrown in a weekend and with about the same preparation as a fourth of july barbecue
Feb 29 2024,negative,yeahnahat least i could enjoy a morning rest at movies3 hours     butit was a gigglecheesyblockbustersci fifrom opening sound effect of an alien lol     the old tale of good vs evilof course only won by war violenceand biggess dickessho hum    got good reviewsbut the world loves an end of the world blockbuster blow em up drama    the lead bloke timotheeee  chalamet was cuteat leastand some of the desert people
Feb 29 2024,negative,one star is way too generous slow and extremely boring
Feb 29 2024,positive,great cinematography but thats pretty much all certain characters are designed as for a sequel
Feb 29 2024,positive,masterpiece a true work of art made by denis once again but this might top them all
Feb 29 2024,positive,i watched dune 2 this morning and it was honestly one of the most incredible films ive ever witnessed incredible directing audio cinematography lighting and storytelling so much show dont tell action incredible fx drama and world building that really is nothing that has been done before was much nicer having the storyline have some level of closure compared to the first film ending as the journey had begun
Feb 29 2024,positive,immersive world building and very complex themes carried with very great actors performances and a director who understands the world of dune
Feb 29 2024,positive,this movie is the best movie of the decade
Feb 29 2024,positive,best grreatt movie in 2024
Feb 29 2024,positive,power over spice is power over all    see this masterpiece on the biggest screen possible it was amazingly good
Feb 29 2024,positive,its cool but i saw a lot of stuff that reminded me of star wars or even watchmen its a good movie though
Feb 29 2024,positive,phenomenal havent experienced anything like this in a cinema especially when you view it on imax and it isnt all spectacle theres substance and actual depth to the world and stories woven by villeneuve cant wait for part 3
Feb 29 2024,negative,talk about snooze fest when i saw the first one i will not be wasting my money on this sequel 
Feb 29 2024,positive,best movies for this year
Feb 29 2024,positive,unlike anything i have ever seen before even dune part 1 which was excellent this movie is a true cinemativ experience a beautiful journey towards something grand epic emotional creepy and dramatic    it brings up alot of questions and got alot nuances and depth to the story and overall theme with new characters location and a more in depth look at the fremen culture the world feels much more alive  on a technical standpoint it is also a masterpiece with everything from beautiful visuals to sounds and music which really makes you feel it     all of the actors did their role well especially timotheé chalamet which acting career mirrors pauls character growth when he really steps into his big acting shoes from a lost young boy in part 1 to charismatic and creepy messiah in part 2
Feb 29 2024,positive,i was fortunate to catch it during feb 25th fan first premiere at imax here in ontario canada while the part two had to carry a lot of the story from the book denis villenueve did a great job adapting it for the screen which meaning changing the timeline but the decisions were spot on overall visually stunning as one would expect you truly feel like you have been transported to a different world which still feels grounded and a place you can relate to unlike something likw pandora in avatar it is a masterclass in scifi movie making watch it in the biggest screen possible
Feb 29 2024,positive,incredible cinema a reason to go to the theater from amazing sound editing to awesome visuals this is a reason to see a film in large format add to that a phenomenal ensemble cast justwow
Feb 28 2024,positive,fr the best movie of the year so far a lot happened but the pacing was perfect we didnt move too fast nor too slow i loved watching it without seeing the trailers fully because i didnt know anything about the plot i got surprised and shocked many times by how well the plot moved and how i liked pretty much everything that i saw on the screen i had heard a lot of praise for the movie so i had some expectations for it but it was so much more than i thought i left the theatre in awe of the art and beauty that i had just experienced
Feb 28 2024,positive,wonderful moving experience the performance of all actors is breathtaking the plot and dialogs are sensational all the relationships symbols and references to the world of power we live in trully it was a spiritual metaphysical experience
Feb 28 2024,positive,wow this second part is absolutely full speed epicness all the way through it is setting dune up to be one of the best triologies ever made  must see in cinema its worth the experience
Feb 28 2024,positive,endgame mixed with the original star wars masterpiece
Feb 28 2024,positive,it was a good movie but it had too much religious fanaticism for me
Feb 28 2024,positive,transformational and transcendental movie one of a kind
Feb 28 2024,positive,one of the best movies of 2024 so far it was thoroughly enjoyable and the screenplay was so magnificent i was so engrossed in the movie that i just didnt want it to end the acting and directing was so fabulous absolutely loved it
Feb 28 2024,positive,absolutely epic i have been waiting decades for an adaptation worthy ofnthr name dune and dv has given it to us  the cast is spot on cinematography breathtaking and the story stays true to the source material while also having a few surprises
Feb 28 2024,positive,i just saw this movie and wow the images are just astonishing the sound design is amazing and the story is breathtaking absolutely a must see
Feb 28 2024,positive,the film is fantastic it is an audiovisual masterpiece and a very good book adaptation im a little dissatisfied with some of the changes to the book but thats complaining at a high level part 1 was closer to the book and thats why i liked it a little better still a 45 im looking forward to part 3
Feb 28 2024,positive,well i didnt think they made movies like this anymore smart stunning and treats the audience with respect all but perfect
Feb 28 2024,positive,this is one of the best cinematic experiences of the 21st century 7th art at its best
Feb 28 2024,positive,1010 the two towers analogy is well deserved
Feb 28 2024,negative,great visuals and sound but the editing is so worse onethird of the movie is like you have to accept how it is now no explanation just cuts to a scene moments days weeks month later and you have to accept that everything is the way it is now i was extremely annoyed by this editing 195 minutes long and so many senseless scenes instead of scenes showing what happened in the meantime i was really looking forward for that movie but im badly disappointed
Feb 28 2024,positive,just fanfuckingtastic  loved everything about it
Feb 28 2024,positive,dennis villeneuve puts his usual outstanding visual art at the service of a perfectly crafted epic an adaptation that builds on its source material with respect but serving the story and the characters above mere fidelity to the original work leaves the taste of great cinema and great craftsmanship what an experience
Feb 28 2024,positive,its big its epic timothy chalamet is one of hollywoods biggest stars to be if he isnt a megastar already  javier bardem is great as the sort of morpheus to chalamets neo in this flick austin butler is almost unrecognizable as a villain covered in make up but outside of a weird gravelly voice hes outstanding as well i advise that if you see this film in a theater go ahead and pay the extra couple bucks to see it in imax itll be worth every penny   loved it it was 2 hours and 45 minutes and i still wanted more  go see it i implore you
Feb 28 2024,positive,a modern masterpiece as the first one the cinematic transposition of the book probably im going to watch it a second time in teathers
Feb 28 2024,positive,dune part 2 picks up right where dune part 1 leaves off but unlike dp1 dp2 find itself unapologetically delivering on all that science fiction epic should hope to deliver an altogether different altogether immersive experience that should be seen as not just a completion but an evolution of storytelling from dp1 as an adjunct professor of film studies i could not see a single flaw in the production the sound design or in the performance of the actors under the direction of a master director this for me will go down as one of if not my favorite sciencefiction film of all time
Feb 28 2024,positive,everyone left in silence
Feb 28 2024,positive,just finished watching it in magdeburg germany i believe i am on of the early birds to watch this magnificent cinema i loved how director took us to the outworldly journey on another height absolutely mind blowing
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie has lots of dramatic moments  directors work is incredible  music action mystic everything are all wellbalanced
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic see it in imax  great sequel
Feb 28 2024,positive,a perfect sequel with original taste     if you like or loved the first dune this is a must watch amazing sound and visuals with an even greater story
Feb 28 2024,positive,this is a movie perfect cast perfect direction amazing sound visuals and good script
Feb 28 2024,positive,absolutely phenomenal dune part 2 was incredibly faithful to the book whilst having some very welcome additions that enhanced the story and themes present in the novel and in doing so helps lead even better into the story of dune messiah i watched part 1 and 2 back to back in cinemas and it was honestly the best cinema experience ive ever had for fans of the book you should definitely be happy with this film and for the more casual fans who enjoyed the first one everything great about the first is here plus more action drama and intensity the performances were outstanding  any doubts about characters portrayals are completely gone timothee chalamet commands the screen when he needs to especially towards the end of the film and rebecca ferguson really solidified this portrayal of jessica as the best version weve seen so far in adaptation 1010
Feb 28 2024,positive,absolutely breathtaking left me speecheless breathless made me cry and want to scream it was not a movie it was something from another world i have never experienced anything like it in my life to call it a masterpiece is an understatement
Feb 28 2024,positive,my top 1 movie from now 100100
Feb 28 2024,positive,if you enjoyed the first movie you should love this second part it is an epic and emotional adventure
Feb 28 2024,positive,easily the best movie theater experience ive ever had i was too young for lotr and the dark knight so i cant compare those the changes from the book were a little tough to swallow at points but in hindsight theyre all pretty fair its so refreshing to have a movie of this scale treat you like an adult makes most of the blockbusters ive seen in the last 10 years look pretty silly in comparison
Feb 28 2024,positive,a huge film a true epic ambitious and delivers on every metric the soundscape the rumbling worms the musicless fights the acting the casting  so so good    one of the best films ive ever seen    my only minor gripe would be the ending 1015 mins seemed a little rushed and wrapped up too neatly
Feb 28 2024,positive,watched the fan first premiere in imax and it did not disappoint must see in imax
Feb 28 2024,positive,so whoa oh my goodness i mean like wow let me just say austin scared me i couldnt look him in the eye when i saw him and his voice was very creepy but captivated and his voice sounded like video game kinda of i love this movie it was amazing so much wonderful work for denis you need to run not walk to watch dune 2 in march yes go see part 2 in theaters march 1st austin performance captivating outstanding menacing creepy and will having you want to see his performance even more also austin was scarier and more menacing and twisted then when he was tex waston and more i feel like both are kind of equal but austin in dune was insane and i would love to watch it over again i am so proud of how far he has came he is so brilliant in what he does he is so good with how he portrays his characters i cant wait to see more things he does and accomplish but wow way to go austin congratulations
Feb 28 2024,positive,mind blowing cinema suspense humor yes horror and spectacular scenes ferguson and butler shine must see on the big screen imax preferred book purists will whine a bit but this will stand as best film adaptation of herberts opus thank you denis villeneuve
Feb 28 2024,positive,better than dune part 1 in virtually every way
Feb 28 2024,positive,we saw this in a double feature with the first film and that was absolutely the right choice part 2 was everything it needed to be and exactly what i was hoping for as a fan of the books i particularly like the way alias character was handled which i always felt was rather clumsily executed in the book
Feb 28 2024,positive,its simply the best sf film ever made it surpasses every other franchises and villeneuve vision is what sf films need to be
Feb 28 2024,negative,is the movie good in some ways yes is it one of the best films made definitely not tbh i was expecting much more many things make zero sense and have no coherent reason for occuring the ending with feydrautha saved the entire movie from being a snooze fest
Feb 28 2024,positive,this felt much better than the first part paul is much more stronger and became a commanding leader the visuals and some of the large set pieces are stunning cant say this is the best in scifi genre ever but it will be listed really high in the charts for sure waiting for the full fledged war in part 3 now
Feb 28 2024,positive,one of the greatest movies in cinemas history the scifi lord of the rings of course better than dune 1984 and star wars prequels denis villeneuve is the best director of our generation
Feb 28 2024,positive,denis villeneuve has accomplished a great task of bringing dune to the big screen the second part of the adaptation has only improved on the world building from the first i found the visuals to be at the forefront of the story with a great display of acting from the cast the story is rich and fast paced while not devolving into a convoluted and confusing mess a few standouts of the story besides the obvious timothee chalamet and zendaya were javier bardem and rebecca ferguson the movie left we wanting for more even after its almost 3 hour runtime i would recommend taking the time to see it in imax and possibly a second viewing which i will also be doing looking forward to the next part of this beautiful and cinematic story already
Feb 28 2024,positive,it was truly amazing even better than part 1 the cgi was so good and the acting was phenomenal 1010
Feb 28 2024,positive,this is probably the best movie that i have ever seen absolutely beyond fantastic
Feb 28 2024,positive,astonishing hard to really process what youve seen right after but you will eventually
Feb 28 2024,positive,this could have been one movie and it shows character and plot developments fall victim to visualization and world building scenery shots yes everything looks beautiful and cool yes the music is awesome yes the actors are great but no i do not remain interested if you dont delve into the actual plot and characters more than you do world building i dont care in the end how it looks if i dont get a proper character arc   you know dialogue scenes that build on previous scenes of actors talking and develop the characters it is a good story and should have been told with more emphasis on dramatic storytelling not on dramatic shot making but cinematography geeks will love it
Feb 28 2024,positive,ive seen this movie twice now and both times i was riveted to my seat the scope and scale is better somehow they part one the score sings all hail hans zimmer all of the actors give such great performances some you may want a bit more of i adored javier bardem in this film rebecca ferguson is chefs kiss timothy and zendayawhat can i say they give such strong performances and i think this is timothys best work to date hands downaustin butler as nabaron feydrauthais scary in a good way he completely committed to the deranged harkonnen greig frasers cinematography brings it yet again this film is gorgeous and this is denis villeneuves greatest film please give him the best director oscar for 2024 already go see this in the biggest loudest theater that you can im seeing again opening night and that sunday lol
Feb 28 2024,negative,boring some good parts but at times dead wait to rent
Feb 28 2024,positive,i love both of the movies its really good movie timothy charmain and austin butler all actors were great i would see it again
Feb 28 2024,positive,dune part 2 clearly begins the story immediately after the end of the first part while watching i discovered the most important difference from the first part the amount of action was increased by 3 times
Feb 28 2024,positive,an excellent sequel that picks up where we were left in part one and builds tension from there the immersion is astonishing as the world of dune grabs your attention
Feb 28 2024,positive,best movie of the year top acting great visuals and the soundtrack makes it worthy of going to the cinema again
Feb 28 2024,positive,i loved the movie and i was so lucky to act in it and become the first omani actor in a hollywood movie   epic is not enough to describe its greatness  denis villeneuve did it again for the 9th time in a row he gave us a cinematic movie
Feb 28 2024,positive,an incredible movie from start to finish its really well balanced with story and action sequences nothing felt overdone loved that they took the time to really develop every aspect of the story the writing and acting were perfect and my god the music and sound fx are so impressive i just felt happy that there will be a part three
Feb 28 2024,positive,very elegant and clever moves to avenge what happened in the previous film i liked the character development of the antagonist but all the actors and actresses played their roles very well the music composed by hans is beyond doubt good work for denis and everyone extraordinary
Feb 28 2024,positive,denis villeneuves dune part two is a stellar improvement over its predecessor the slow pacing issues are resolved making it a scifi masterpiece the film crashes onto the screen with intense visuals exploring themes of fascism and imperialism a true cinematic triumph that elevates the dune saga to new heights
Feb 28 2024,positive,an unexpectedly dark and extremely important movie lotr level on this one
Feb 28 2024,positive,awesome in every way cinematic experience of the year not the best movie of 2024 so far  but a massive experience
Feb 28 2024,positive,a little bit less than 3h of length full of action the way the story was told its just incredibile its super easy to understand and it keeps you awake all the time  fantastic
Feb 28 2024,positive,holy moly   what an absolute masterpiece which has to be watched in the cinema btw   and it is also true to the book with its deviations making sense    part 1 is essentially just setupbuildup to this magnum opus  the soundtrack and sound design are both immaculate
Feb 28 2024,positive,i consider the movie to be an excellent continuation of the first part and a wonder in itself the possibility of a triology as magnificent as lotr is truly enthralling and i hope that villeneuve will be able to create a likewise experience the visuals are undoubtedly stunning and beyond anything ive ever seen in modern cinema
Feb 28 2024,positive,i was one of those who watched the movie at the preview this is one of those films in which the 2nd film is better than the first i am sure that the film will collect more than a billion and will become the best film of 2023 and 2024
Feb 28 2024,positive,masterpiece just an incredible cinematic experience visuals script acting sound design and hans zimmers score everything firing at all cylinders highly recommended cant wait to see it again and cant wait to see a 3rd movie if villeneuve will be allowed to do one
Feb 28 2024,positive,it was amazing visual effect scenario cast book adaptation everything was perfect
Feb 28 2024,positive,dune part two was the most incredible moviegoing experience of my life what a cinematic achievement a new bar has been set for all other scifi movies to come for decades long live the fighters
Feb 28 2024,positive,this isnt a movie at all its an epic people dont rate mozarts music this movie is not harry potter not lord of the rings but like war and peace made in the soviet union   this is a world where dreams should not come true you must strengthen your spirit and heart and listen to this song odysseus is not the only one who lost his time returning from troy many heroes died there
Feb 28 2024,positive,it was very cool en fun to watch beautyfull scenes
Feb 28 2024,positive,a true masterpiece probably the greatest sifi sequel of all times timothy chalamet was absolutely brilliant and the rest of the cast was also incredible greatest depiction of a messiah and how terrifying it really can be 1010 must see
Feb 28 2024,positive,really really amazing movie
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie was awesome and was way better than the 1st part
Feb 28 2024,positive,action packed unforced humor integrated the viewer to another level so effortlessly anyone who finds something to complain about in this movie probably would complain about winning the lotto   wouldve stayed for 3 more hours if it kept going
Feb 28 2024,positive,ok foremost its a dazzling visual feast but so much more though  like its not just good it enters the pantheon of great scifi films of all time  but calling this a mere scifi movie does it an injustice it transcends genres  the skill with which it shows and not tells many of the deep ideas within frank herberts book almost defies what one can expect from a film  and yet also it is its own thing very much from  the here and now  so relevant to today and yet steeped in the shared myths of so many different peoples
Feb 28 2024,positive,not only the greatest science fiction movie of all time but one of the greatest films ever created in cinematic history
Feb 28 2024,positive,the first dune movie by denis villeneuve was fantastic and finally gave me the feeling of the book the second movie which finishes the first book is just beyond fantastic
Feb 28 2024,positive,phenomenal loved every second of the movie kept me engaged throughout and the characters were wonderfully written excellent world building and hoping that a third movie is to come
Feb 28 2024,positive,dune part ii transcends the boundaries of the scifi genre denis villeneuve has masterfully delivered a spectacle thats as epic as it is emotionally resonant this film is a testament to the dedication and craftsmanship of the filmmakers even though hes only 28 timothée chalamet has cemented his place among the greatest actors to ever live i hate to compare but hes the next daniel day lewis he plays paul atreides with such visceral intensity and versatility you cant help but be in awe of this kids talent 1010
Feb 28 2024,positive,totally breathtaking amazingly performed and gorgeously shot dune part two is a scifi epic and sequel that captivates from the start due to its emotionally fulfilling and astoundingly structured narrative that carefully and effectively builds its interesting characters and stunning world while also achieving a level of depth and reflection that few movies of this size does nowadays fantastic score as well denis villeneuve has once again showed why he is one of the most talented directors of our time
Feb 28 2024,positive,great watch with more story depth and sand 
Feb 28 2024,positive,i said in my dune review that denis villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen part 2 was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor seeing it in imax helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer    greig fraser is a master cinematographer the camera work coupled with the special effects have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism     the stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and   tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be believable choreography  acting to boot    a starstudded cast that never outshines their characters  only once i kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery the story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging    a fantastic experience with a crowd  another cinematic achievement to add to denis filmography that will surely bring him more awards    minor spoiler alert    ps javier bardem was having a time with his role  austin butler showed off his range as an actor also loved the surprise cameo from furiosa    clear early 2025 oscar candidate for   best visual effects   best sound design   best editing   best picture   best director   best cinematography   best production design   best costume design   best score  potential in acting categories as well
Feb 28 2024,positive,its the most beautiful movie ive ever watched in every aspect as simple as that   direction photography score sound screenplay performances costumes   i cried a little in awe must see on the big screen
Feb 27 2024,positive,best movie of all time  thats it thats the review
Feb 27 2024,positive,i used to love watching movies in the latter half of the 2010s the emerging commercialization pretty much killed my love for cinema to the point where there can go an entire year without me watching a single movie  this movie reminded me of what it was like watching something truly great it feels like a lightning in a bottle type deal so it hasnt revived my faith in hollywood but it was great to have that feeling of awe ignited again
Feb 27 2024,negative,the tickets were refunded without my asking and when i showed up at the theater i was told the movie was not being shown i drove 2 hrs total waste of time and money
Feb 27 2024,positive,nothing to say its a masterpiece

Feb 27 2024,positive,dune part two is a slow burn that pays off    denis villeneuves dune part two is a cinematic masterpiece that is truly breathtaking it is an incredible combination of stunning visuals and an engaging storyline which you should experience on the largest screen possible as the second part of this epic saga it builds on the groundwork laid by the previous installment it takes it to new heights delivering an unforgettable experience that leaves audiences in awe for those who crave immersive cinematic experiences dune part two is a feast for the senses i regret not having watched it in imax to fully immerse myself in its breathtaking visuals but even on a standard screen the films grandeur is undeniable every frame is meticulously crafted to transport viewers to arrakiss rich and expansive world    the films heart features one of the most captivating character arcs ever seen on screen    timothée chalamets portrayal of paul atreides is filled with layers and nuance as he undergoes a transformational journey that is destined to become legendary in the scifi genre the films emotional core is formed by atreidess struggle to balance love duty and destiny taking audiences on a tumultuous ride through his world of twists and turns although some viewers may find the pacing of dune part two slow at times its a deliberate choice it serves the narrative well allowing for a deeper exploration of paul atreidess character arc chalamet delivers his finest performance to date capturing the complexity of his character with raw emotion and vulnerability zendaya also delivers a standout performance as chani she brings life and strength to a character imbued with a palpable sense of longing and determination    it is an engrossing and immersive experience that keeps you engaged from beginning to end    the stunning visual effects are truly spectacular bringing the fantastical elements of frank herberts universe to life with breathtaking realism hans zimmers score further enhances the movies epic scope heightening the tension and emotion of each scene while some cast members such as christopher walken and florence pugh may feel underutilized the newcomers like austin butler give standout performances that leave a lasting impression butlers portrayal of a conflicted and disturbed character is particularly remarkable leaving the audience eager to see what hell do next    i give dune part two 4 out of 5 stars it is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that exceeds its forerunner in scale and ambition the movie boasts mesmerizing visuals captivating storytelling and outstanding performances making it a mustsee for fans of grandiose cinema as the credits roll it becomes abundantly clear that the adventure is far from over and the excitement for the next chapter is tangible

Feb 27 2024,negative,a master class in bad science fiction and poor movie making in general the director wastes great actors by giving them little to nothing to do avoids world building doesnt bother with the most basic of plot revelations and rushes an ending that makes zero sense
Feb 27 2024,positive,it was amazing humor in the beggining stillgard was such a funny devotional southern fanatic the scene of worm riding was jaw dropping and intense battles were beatiful what a movie 1010

Feb 27 2024,positive,what denise and his team have done with the source material is nothing short of groundbreaking they said it couldnt be done but they did it the greatest scifi film of the century
Feb 27 2024,positive,on par with the empire strikes back in terms of significance outstanding in every way
Feb 27 2024,positive,this rating is based on the imax viewing experience a lot of this movie is larger than life and as such really need to be seen on the largest screen possible for the ultimate viewing experience you may never get a chance to have the experience of dune or dune part 2 again if you wait until it is no longer playing in theaters to see it that would be a badly missed opportunity     but beyond the visuals and sound which are both wonderful the story keeps up a good pace at all times handling pauls journey with the fremen between where we left him and the final confrontation extremely well we see new sides of characters mostly the fremen characters who are able to be fleshed out in a way they couldnt be in the first part of dune the final confrontation was handled about as well as it possibly could have especially considering how quickly it passes in the source material in this case i believe it was an upgrade to the books depiction and i dont say that lightly     of course some things have to be adapted for film but some changes did leave me scratching my head i like how they foreshadowed jessica and alias future roles seeing paul come into his own was a welcome sight and the lead up was well executed     very happy with this adaptation and is a must see on the big screen to fully appreciate
Feb 27 2024,positive,wow spectacular breathtaking amazing masterpiece those are just the few words that come to mind after having just seen dune part two in imax this is mastermovie making at its absolute finest i cant wait to see it again and again and again

Feb 27 2024,positive,having been disappointed by dune part i my expectations going in were quite low so when i say part 2 was spectacular youll know im not fanboying here one of the more beautiful movies ive seen that didnt rely solely on its spectacle to impress the story was solid characters were better defined in comparison to part 1 making their tension and stakes feel far greater and acting was impressive thoroughly enjoyable film
Feb 27 2024,positive,dude like ive never had a movie that has made my heart beat so much it was everything you could ask for although i saw it in a early imax screening just everything was so perfect

Feb 27 2024,positive,like the modern day lord of the rings dune is one of greatest book adaptations of our generation while predating star wars fans will find themselves delighted by similar themes in a much more mature and gritty universe five out of five sandworms
Feb 27 2024,positive,this is the best adaptation of dune by far  loved it
Feb 27 2024,positive,its the best thing ive ever seen in a movie theater and im old enough to have seen brians song in the theaters     you absolutely must see it in imax awe inspiring i am a huge dune fan since reading thr books in 9th grade 41 years ago but thr soundvfxmusic was a giant step beyond anything ive seen plus just the visuals dv cooked upamazing im good with some small story changes nothing major and pretty much all the actors nailed it especially butler zendaya and bardem even though his stilgar is a little too fanatical for canon but it works to set up the jihad tc also very strong performance     really still kind of awestruck 24 hrs later
Feb 27 2024,positive,epic scifi movie that reminds you of why you go to the theatre  great casting cinematography score sounds visuals  1010
Feb 27 2024,positive,the best movie of the 2020s the visuals and sound  are breathtaking a must see in imax  fight scenes were amazing   biggest nitpick is the timeline of the story was shortened from 3 years to 6 months causing some critical events to not occur
Feb 27 2024,positive,excellent movieeeee love itttttttt
Feb 27 2024,positive,the sequel to dune part 1 is just visually fantastic as a dune book fanatic im finally pleased that a filmmaker took the time to properly do justice to the overall universe this story highlights
Feb 27 2024,positive,absolutely fantastic i read the book and although there are some slight changes which are almost necessary for the movie it makes total sense it is a visually astounding movie as well as the acting from the all star cast also contributing to the overall workload it is something that deserves to bee seen in imax
Feb 27 2024,positive,the best movie ive ever watchedhad goosebumps throughout the whole movie
Feb 27 2024,positive,amazing huge dune fan ive been reading the books for the last 30 years and even with the changes from the original text you can tell denis is a huge fan as well the first part was a perfect visual accompaniment to the book but the second part along with its stunning visuals and wellpaced storytelling bring frank herberts vision to life in a way i did not imagine i would love but do
Feb 27 2024,positive,one of the most captivating films ive seen in years its a large step above the first movie and truly epic in scope
Feb 26 2024,positive,i saw an early screening of dune part ii on feb 25 in a packed imax theater i can not wait to see this movie again because i thought it was epic  in my opinion this is the best scifi and best sequel film i have seen in my 40 years of watching movies it was a long movie but i couldnt get enough of it and i was deeply involved in the story unfolding on screen i havent read the books but did see the original dune movie in 1984 and this has been a much better adaptation   denis villeneuve has quickly become one of my favorite directors and hope he stays on if they greenlight a dune part 3 and i cant imagine the studio not doing it  another great musical score from hans zimmer the cgi was amazing and i highly recommend you watch the imax version   enjoy
Feb 26 2024,positive,by far the best movie i have seen in a long time the space epic brings the beloved dune universe to its highest of levels great performances from the cast and denis has created an all timer with this film it is a must see i fully recommend you seeing it on the big screen
Feb 26 2024,positive,wow what a movie wow wow wow i think i need to go and watch it at least twice more on first consideration this is easily a 910 this movie is a cinematic masterpiece that is both sonically and visually stunning there is a lot of love that went into the creation of this movie and it shows everything from the cinematography to the makeup to the costume design is so gorgeous from start to finish the movie was engaging and exhilarating if anything i wish it had a few more quiet scenes to let the great immensity of everything breathe i dont say this often of movies but i genuinely believe that this movie needs an extended edition if anything the film felt a touch short which is odd considering its near three hours of runtime for those that are fans of the book this movie may irritate you as it does play more liberally with the book than its predecessor did as a fan of the book i will admit that these changes did irk me some but at the same time i am not convinced that they were bad changes and in fact enhanced the story telling and made the movie more cohesive go and see it on the biggest screen possible
Feb 26 2024,positive,as it was written dune part 2 is beyond epic a thrilling journey of revenge fueled by scifi wonder and religious zealotry butler is psychotic zendaya is the heart and soul but chalamet delivers his most complex work yet one of the best theatrical experiences of my life
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part 2 is an achievement and is like hollywood remember they can produced epic stories that tv still cant match
Feb 26 2024,positive,masterful adaptation  long time dune series fans will be pleased to see how villeneuve threads the needle perfectly with the central conundrum associated with pauls character we see each choice  what drives him forward because the book jumps over pauls maturation the movie fills this in nicely  our heart is with both paul and chani who is superbly developed  jessicas role is crystal clear as well of course its a stunning visual masterpiece and javier bardem provides just the right palette to see the effect of muaddib on the fremen i also appreciate how we see pauls sister develop  finally austin butler is astonishingly effective as feyd    the dune saga has been deftly woven in part 2
Feb 26 2024,positive,stunning visuals and brilliant acting from the moment the movie opens prewb visuals the movie hits the ground running and does not let up until the end credits roll a movie adaptation to be proud of
Feb 26 2024,positive,now this is a performance austin butler should win an oscar for  this was everything i wanted and more
Feb 26 2024,positive,movie was phenomenal 1010  loud and action packed   heart breaking end for chani but holy wars is going to be another hit
Feb 26 2024,positive,a film which is a term i do not use lightly of incredibly vast magnitude one that far exceeded my expectations with acting that while not perfect still does its job with spectacular effectiveness scale so fast that it just must be experienced in theaters and a classic plot based on a classic novel the cinematography is breathtaking and the world building is far beyond even the highs of the first you would be hard pressed to find anymore than a minor problem with it
Feb 26 2024,positive,what a brilliant and beautiful movie thank you to denis villanueva cast and crew for bringing an iconic work of fiction to the screen in a way that is even more moving than the first only a fan could have accomplished such a feat of imagination
Feb 26 2024,positive,1010 would worm again
Feb 26 2024,positive,it was phenomenal i am so happy that i was lucky enough to see this in imax the feeling throughout the entire movie was just euphoric amazing movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,improving upon the already epic first installment of villeneuves imagination of herberts timeless source material dune part two improves on all levels and sets a new standard for scifi movies and is probably the best one were getting this decade
Feb 26 2024,positive,excellent followup finally to the first dune book for those hoping for more action there is 90 more action than the first film
Feb 26 2024,positive,saw it last night at imax for the fan premiere  my initial reaction was just wow  the scale of the film along with part 1 was simply epic  i already bought another set of tickets for the release on thursday   great adaption from the book though there are a couple of missing subplots and other details that were a bit altered for the sake of flow  all an all a must see
Feb 26 2024,positive,visually stunning amazing score and sound editing supreme character development  especially with paul  his mom  and fantastic action just when i thought ok thats probably the big finale another epic moment comes along to top the last and then again     cannot recommend enough perhaps one of the highest compliments i can give it is that it was the two towerslikewhich means we should all be on the edge of our seats for dune 3 which could return of the king the cinema world
Feb 26 2024,positive,denis villeneuves adaptation and direction exceeded my very high expectations staying faithful to the novel brilliant choices are made to make the unfilmable seem real much more character depth than normal in an action melodrama a true masterpiece of science fiction
Feb 26 2024,positive,as someone who has already watched the premiere in toronto i can safely say that dune ii is definitely an unprecedented epic masterpiece i dare not say it is comparable to the lord of the rings series but it is definitely one of the most awesome science fiction epics in recent years regardless of the soundtrack graphics plot and special effects are all better than the first one in short just go watch it
Feb 26 2024,positive,the movie was a massive pace shift from the first one where it piggybacked off of the setup in the first movie to go quickly from event to event great visuals great music good acting and the occasional funny moments all come together to make this a movie that you dont want to stop
Feb 26 2024,positive,saw it sunday night still thinking about it the next day its visually stunningyes but i was most shocked how much i loved the love story only thing that could been better was an hour longer to flush out some more storylines and more scenes for some characters with small roles yet massive presence the third act was epic beyond epic cant wait for the third installment
Feb 26 2024,negative,the two stars are for the unbelievable visuals and score from hans zimmer otherwise it wouldve been 0 stars i genuinely enjoyed part 1 as a nonbook reader but felt completely baffled by the second half of this movie no clue what any character wants or why they make the decisions they make so much alist talent given absolutely nothing to do emotionally wanted to love this going into the theaterbut really wanted to leave once i was there
Feb 26 2024,positive,this movie is so spectacular even if you never read the books i didnt or saw the first movie although that is highly recommended go see this one its dazzling  with stunning imagery a complex yet clear story compelling characters perfectly cast and a layered richness and depth that keeps you enthralled a must for the big screen  ive never seen anything like this we saw it during an early showing on sunday but i want go back again this weekend to further soak it all in im not a scifi person but this movie transcends the genre
Feb 26 2024,positive,saw the fan first premier on imax easily 55 stars
Feb 26 2024,positive,saw this in imax and was absolutely blown away incredible visuals earth shattering sound effects and enormous scale action scenes not being familiar with the source material the storyline was difficult to follow but still an amazing film
Feb 26 2024,positive,stunning use of actual effects and cg a memorable follow up to the first film
Feb 26 2024,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Feb 26 2024,positive,amazing in scope and scale true to the source material simple perfection
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part 2 continues the epic saga with stunning visuals strong performances and a captivating story its a mustsee its incredible and you wont be bored its full of action and powerful scenes
Feb 26 2024,positive,the one regret i have about the dune franchise so far is that i didnt get a chance to experience part one on an imax screen in theaters due to the pandemic that being said dune part two is an epic visual masterpiece and manages to surpass the first one in terms of intrigue and furthering the story this is definitely the highlight of 2024 so far and a must see watching this on a giant imax screen with the booming score from hans zimmer is a thrill to behold that score combined with denis villeneuves directing brings the dune world to life so well while part one introduced us to the main players and their stories part two has much more world building and far more moving pieces to the overall storyline you definitely need to have seen part one to appreciate and fully enjoy the dune experience with everything set up in the first part theyre free to hit the ground running with this one and its a nonstop thrill ride     ive never really been a huge timothée chalamet fan but after seeing his performance in this and how he handles his character arc im coming around unlike part one theres much more zendaya in here and she more than holds her own opposite chalamet those two are definitely the leads but the supporting cast does just as well some even with very little screen time also leave their mark however austin butler was a nice standout playing a ruthless menacing and truly memorable villain he comes into the story late in the runtime but once he shows up his psychotic presence is made known with some great action sequences much better pacing and well written storytelling dune part two is one of the best scifi films of recent years most definitely check this out in imax or dolby if available the third act battle is one of my favorite since avengers endgame cannot wait to watch this again and im more than ready for a third dune film which they set up perfectly while bringing a satisfactory ending to this portion of the story feels too early to say it but possibly best film of the year
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two is a generational science fiction masterpiece     i was not born in time to see the lawrence of arabia apocalypse now or space odyssey in their moment so i feel especially lucky that denis villeneuve has proven the hollywood epic is not simply a lost art form     the best movie ive seen since fellowship of the ring my favorite movie    see it in theaters friends imax if you can 
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two was a literal masterpiece that i need to see again asap     loved so much about the film and it had really incredible performances from chalamet zendaya bardem butler ferguson yacoub etc
Feb 26 2024,positive,this movie ruined other movies for me i got the audiobook ages ago and ill be wiping off the virtual dust to listen to it to fill the movielovershaped hole in my soul from this evil amazing movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two a moral between love and war in the middle of the desert
Feb 26 2024,positive,as someone who read the books and a massive scifi fan in general this movie is near perfect denis sets a new standard for science fiction on the big screen something i didnt know was possible an actionpacked emotional journey this movie answers all of the complaints critics and fans had with the first film the atmosphere created by denis and the cast is breathtaking it feels as though youve been dropped right into frank herberts writing the entire cast was spectacular with austin butler stellan skarsgård and javier bardem standing out in particular overall i believe this movie already rests as one of the best sequels of all time and very well could be called the best science fiction adaptation to date
Feb 26 2024,positive,sci fi masterpiece that leaves me wanting more
Feb 26 2024,positive,this film is the type of movie where you will be so happy to see such a great cinematic masterpiece the cinematography is so cool to watch on screen the music is amazing im shocked the best movie of all time for sure
Feb 26 2024,positive,tremendous visually narratively and sonically dune 2 is a spectacle that is worth a special journey to the most ideal audiovisual theater set up that you can find improvement in every single possible way over the first film
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is why cinemas exist it is an epic beautifully told richly detailed scifi film it is a symphony made by artists who are at the top of their game
Feb 26 2024,positive,they pack a whole lot into just under 3 hours the visuals action sequences and characterizations are amazing definitely going to see it a second time
Feb 26 2024,positive,an amazing feat of storytelling that does the source material justice while intelligently altering where needed    with well executed and thoughtful story arcs and visual world building like few others
Feb 26 2024,positive,villeneuve delivers what may be the best twoparter film of all time everything that was setup in part one gets a paid off in spades in part two its an imaginative retelling of the story delivered through an astonishing cinematic spectacle    chalamet proves himself a true leading man zendaya brings heart to the story and rebecca ferguson is at the top of her game austin butler steels the show and becomes the star of the movie all through a long sequence on giedi prime he is hypnotizing as feyd rautha a villain like no other every actor in this film brings their a game and everyone gets their moment in the arakis sun    this adaptation is on par with the best of them reminding me of what peter jackson did with lord of the rings its really that good  villeneuve cements himself as one of the best filmmakers working today well be riding the sandworm for years and years to come
Feb 26 2024,positive,this movie has everything you need and been waiting for since part 1 ends its picks up where left off and takes off to another height this movie dare i say perfect this two part movie proves if you can be patient with world building and character building then the pay off of action and drama will be so much sweeter please give us more of this world
Feb 26 2024,positive,one of the best films to ever grace the silver screen please go see this in imax
Feb 26 2024,positive,goodness the sound of this film was incredible i could feel it in my ribs its so good there were some issues in regards to religion that kinda seemed like a joke in some type of way i wish i could explain it better but thats the best i can do it has a very interesting twist that i didnt see coming but i actually understood it i know it will make some people mad it irritated me too but i understood it art is subjective and i know a lot of people are saying this movie will win best picture at next years oscars while i understand that notion i kinda disagree with that this is a good movie but not a great movie in my opinion this year is still early and there are so many other films coming out overall this movie has fun action good character building from the previous film and sets up a possible third film which i think has been announced i give dune part 2 4 disco ball deathstars out of 5
Feb 26 2024,positive,cinema denis villeneuve is the lisan al gaib of scifi    the visual spectacle of dune part two on an imax screen is truly exhilarating electrifying this is a pinnacle of cinematic immersion in a theatre a production of such caliber epitomizes the essence of why we as cinema enthusiasts are drawn to the magic of the silver screen the cinematography meticulously crafted exudes an unparalleled beauty that captivates the senses    the masterful orchestration of hans zimmers musical score imbues the narrative with an immersive ambiance that envelops the audience transporting them into the very heart of the story timothée chalamets portrayal undergoes a remarkable evolution infusing his character with a depth and fortitude that at times blur the boundaries between actor and character making one momentarily forget that he is not in fact paul atreides himself    the palpable onscreen chemistry between chalamet and zendaya lends an authenticity to their portrayal of paul and chani perfectly capturing the essence of their complex relationship and intense love for one another it is a pairing that is both seamless and complementary echoing the nuanced dynamics of their characters connection    experience this epic saga on the grandest scale possible as it stands as a testament to the peak of the science fiction genre in cinematic history
Feb 26 2024,positive,i thought it was incredible truly epic visuals acting writing story score all superb took a half star off for a couple very minor gripes i had but nothing worth detailing
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is a phenomenal movie i was fortunate and got to see an advanced screening in february here are some thoughts   purists will be a little disappointed a few of the characters in the books were removed and some of the critical plot lines were reduced   pacing the second half of the film happens quite quickly they combined parts 23 from the book into one 3 hour movie its enjoyable but condensed   the score is phenomenal   the fighting choreography is excellent   the acting is wonderful youre never removed from the moment by an odd line   incredible setscostumes   they turned stilgard into the comic relief which worked out great   theres some great tension between paul and others as he evolves into his new world    over all loved the film it will probably be my favorite for 2024 i wish the pacing was slower in the second half and a two of the characters from the past movie continued their roles as they did in the books    final note though this is movie gaining higher praise than dune part 1 i actually think that is the superior film
Feb 26 2024,positive,how was this man wonka    but really timothee not only embodies paul as a tragic hero but adds gravity in every scene hes in timothees supporting cast also does an amazing job at adding to the films overall intensity which furthers the dune series depth greig frasers cinematography continues to be a landmark and inspiration to me and when paired with hans zimmers score both beautifully translate the tense emotion on screen    while there are some changes to the book everything still works and deni villenueves work further cements the dune series as my favorite    alright im going to go reread the books now 
Feb 26 2024,positive,understand goimg in this is the second half of one movie not a sequel to the first movie this is a gorgeous film both visually and audibly that is the best adaptation of herberts masterpiece bar none villenueve has created a world that is frighteningly familiar and uncomfortably alien and it works perfectly great performances from entire cast but special shout out to auston butlers feyd rautha who almost steals the movie from timothée chamlamets muad dib
Feb 26 2024,positive,exactly what i was hoping for and then some outstanding visuals and audio the pace and flow felt spot on a fantastic cinematic experience
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two emerges as a cinematic tour de force masterfully blending the bleak tragic essence of frank herberts universe with a renewed emotional depth and thematic complexity director denis villeneuves sequel expands on its predecessors world building with a deft balance of grand spectacle and nuanced storytelling while it boldly steps into blockbuster territory it retains a sense of elegance elevating its narrative with intricate character development and a mesmerizing visual language this sequel not only deepens the lore but also engages with realworld themes making it a thoughtprovoking and visually stunning experience that resonates with both scifi enthusiasts and general audiences alike
Feb 26 2024,positive,great film if like part one you will like part 2
Feb 26 2024,positive,epic bombastic and immersive  this movie will knock your freaking socks off
Feb 26 2024,positive,absolutely brilliant movie as close to a perfect movie ive seen there are minor departures from the book but overall its true to the story and is the most enjoyable experience ive ever had at a movie acting cgi storytelling pacing everything is on point the movie is a bit long just under 3 hours but every minute is filled with intrigue and excitement     worth watching then watching again and then a third time
Feb 26 2024,positive,nearly flawless direction  cinematography set design costume design sound design score editing  acting yes austin butler is very much the real deal 12 star deducted because the runtime could  and arguably should  have been15 mins longer its a lot see dune part one first
Feb 26 2024,positive,theres just nothing bad to say about this movie all of it works perfectly its brilliant
Feb 26 2024,positive,visually and audibly stunning there were a couple parts that honestly needed more fleshing out and ill admit that the direction things took was fairly unexpected overall though its a fantastic movie more than worth the hour drive to watch fan first premier
Feb 26 2024,positive,movie was absolute spectacle and a pleasure to witness the movie expands on the immersive dune universe by adding new characters without making the ensemble feel cluttered breathtaking cinematography captures this story telling incredibly well only critiques i have are nitpicks nitpicks not worth putting in a review i absolutely adore this film and will need to watch a 2 more times to fully grasp what i witness last night
Feb 26 2024,positive,the movie exceeded my expectations which were high already surpasses the first one and keeps building and expanding frank herberts universe character development is great cinematography is stunning truly a masterpiece
Feb 26 2024,positive,movie was amazing probably the best sequel and movie period i have seen in the last couple years not a remake thank you for something new cant wait for dune 3
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two show us what is real insane movie
Feb 26 2024,positive,this movie blew me away it is unbelievable how engaging and beautiful this film is shot the dialogue cinematography and storyline are all a this may very well be one of the best scifi sequels to date the dessert and freemen come to life in this movie you get to see everything leto was referring to about the freemen in the first film i am looking forward to the 3rd film and possible series
Feb 26 2024,positive,meant to be seen on imax 1010
Feb 26 2024,positive,i loved dune 2 so so much to break down here but they managed the story very well its a complex book and they stayed true to that even if at points it would have been easier to go more traditional paths for general audiences visually beyond words a few gripes here and there but nothing that makes me not dig the film amazing
Feb 26 2024,positive,a masterpiece by director denis villeneuve beautiful cinematography accompanied by bone chilling action the onscreen chemistry of zendaya and chalamet is obvious but the real strength of the lies with the supporting cast of butler brolin and ferguson a perfectly paced film will have viewers thirsty for a trilogy
Feb 26 2024,positive,closest interpretation of the books of the tv series and movies so far beautifully done
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part 2 is a masterpiece it takes every element of the first movie and heightens it to the next level its definitely not going to be for everyone as there are some fairly strange scenes however every shot and film making decision had a clear purpose and accomplished a clear goal for the viewer none of the more disturbing or repulsion moments feel unnecessary or gratuitous    finally one of the best things about the movie was how thoughtfully and intelligently it handled the subject matter or religion and control
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is lord of the rings level epicness so excellent
Feb 26 2024,positive,we saw the movie last night 225 on a mini imax screen      frank herbert was a visionary genius but he wasnt a great novelist  im a book fan but i understand that translating this thing to the screen was a big job  villaneuves script is excellent  yes he cut some details  yes the end is somewhat different than the book  yes he needs another movie or 2 to make the central point about the danger of messianic leaders   great movie  highly recommended    look for an uncredited cameo by anna taylorjoy as st alia of the knife appearing to paul in a vision
Feb 26 2024,positive,this film is a triumph denis truly understands what is at the heart of frank herberts story and in the difficult task of adapting it to screen managed to make enhancements across the board his ability to reflect the core themes through the necessary additions to flesh out a vague act three in the original book is astounding and its adaptation to a modern audience makes those themes resonate all the stronger cant wait to see what he does with messiah
Feb 26 2024,positive,the critics arent wrong on this one this movie gets everything right from the intimate moments to the jaw dropping epic moments villeneuve continues to show how big of a mastermind he is there are changes from the book but changes that make sense in a film adaptation changes i absolutely loved i cant wait to see this film again and again
Feb 26 2024,positive,find the biggest imax screen near you and go see it in theaters a truly exhilarating cinema experience the cinematography vfx and editing are outstanding and the scale of the action is unbelievably impressive the score acting and terrific visuals all warrant goosebumps several times throughout the film the story and main characters remain complex and everevolving so rewatch part one if you havent already this is an absolute mustsee
Feb 26 2024,positive,i had been waiting for a long time  saw the first one 20 times and ill probably see this one at least 35 timeswhat an awesome movie that captivated the whole audience
Feb 26 2024,positive,mr villeneuve knocks it out of the park astounding filmmaking on a different level spectacular production values the future is clearly practical fx and onlocation shooting the difference between this and shows using the volumeblue screen cgi is stark
Feb 26 2024,positive,just incredible i felt as if i were watching something of biblical proportions take place
Feb 26 2024,positive,amazing experience for imax on to the mark in the criteria of the story outstanding productioncinematographyvfxdirection you name it hans zimmer major contributor in giving goosebumps throughout the movie austin butler nailed it a more in depth buildup of his character would have been appreciated as well as development of paul from an outsider to being followed by fremen was too sudden overall outstanding movie should watch in imax  worth every penny
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is a must see in a theater type of movie circa 1977 simultaneously the viewing experience is both exhausting yet exhilarating leaving the viewer little time to process happiness or sorrow a feast for the senses yes but also a thorough investigation into the dangers of fanaticism  cult of personality the acting carries this project to new heights  as it now seems unfathomable to imagine anyone else portraying the tragic heroes  villans of frank herberts 1965 masterpiece
Feb 26 2024,positive,an absolute groundbreaking achievement in cinema this is a wonderful adaptation of herberts work  must see on the biggest screen possible
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is the reason imax exists every frame of this movie is perfect
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune  part two in some way is a film made of compromises to bring to the big screen a book considered impossible to adapt but perhaps simply not translatable in its original form as indeed all literary works are however there is an element in this transposition that causes me quite a few perplexities and that is the management of time whereas the first part was very dilated and meditative suitable for the story of a crisis of confusion of ritual death and rebirth of paul  this second one is excessively compressed so much so as to break the rhythm of the rite however the story becomes less solemn because it does not have time to develop into a wideranging narrative which would have needed not more minutes but perhaps a clearer sequence of events more time within the narrative instead unlike the novel which develops the events of the second and third parts over several years in villeneuves film we do not perceive the passage of time and pauls narrative arc or rather the narrative arcs because he is an extremely structured that contains several of them they simply happen without the narrative having given the right weight to these changes despite timothée chalamet putting a lot of effort into transforming his characters initial confusion into authority dune  part two confirms itself as exceptional on a visual and formal level reproposing the aesthetic grandeur that struck me in the first chapter also through chromatic solutions that prove to be particularly effective contrasting the intense orange of the desert with a photograph of completely desaturated by greig fraser on a narrative level the first part which was more airy and solemn perhaps convinced me more
Feb 26 2024,positive,stunning epic radical filmmaking
Feb 26 2024,positive,the scififantasy epic of our generation    had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away  as a big fan of the game of thrones franchise its been a long time since ive encountered this level of worldbuilding and epicness would highly recommend to rewatch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better though its not completely necessary since the movie is pretty selfcontained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well    denis villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time and if it was up to me i would keep him in these highbudget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does    in my personal opinion the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect hans zimmers score is masterful just as youd expect and one step up from the oscar winner and grammy nominated score of pt 1 technical aspects such as vfx production design sound editing etc are all top notch and awardsworthy the action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine denis direction is impeccable and the story is absolutely fascinating continuing to develop characters from pt 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters  the movie serves as a great wrapup to the story introduced in pt 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better setup to a possible masterpiece in dune messiah which i really hope will get greenlit soon    i believe and surely hope this movie will be a major player in the next award season belowtheline wins are pretty much guaranteed right now but i hope it will get some love in abovetheline categories such as direction and even best picture perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this fantasyscifi genre in recent years at the academy as a big fan of the genre unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period perhaps its time for a movie like this to triumph once again    dont miss the opportunity to catch this movie on imax since i believe its an historic piece of epicfantasyscifi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre  extremely recommended
Feb 26 2024,positive,epic in every sense among the best scifi and war films ever made with a heartfelt love story at its core an incredibly timely film that does justice to the complex themes in frank herbert classic 1965 novel denis villeneuve has delivered another cinematic masterpiece one that needs to be experienced in an imax theater
Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two is one of the best sequels ever made delivering on every potential of retribution for what was a sometimes slowpaced setup in the first film the movie does  everything it can to account for the casual fan but takes off very quickly and never stops dancing through the world herbert created for nearly three hours
Feb 26 2024,positive,this is the best movie i have ever seen in theaters still in shock wow

Feb 26 2024,positive,faithful adaptation to the book and maybe the most visually captivating movie ever made powerful performances given by multiple members of the cast only regret youll have is not seeing it in theaters
Feb 26 2024,positive,i swear to the lord in heaven i do not write reviews on things but listen to me since the dawn of marvel movies i feel sifi adventure stories have been kind of forgotten about or pushed to the side i am a huge marvel fan so hear me when i say this ive seen every single marvel movie in theater since iron man 2008 i come to you today to tell you one thing you must go watch this movie the story the fights the fremen the prophecy the music paul the action  everything everything about this film was so refreshing to see since marvels glory days just purely amazing story telling and great quality colors cast and a refreshing break from superhero movies i am so thankful i was able to go see it as at a fan first sneak peek premier it took my breath away a few times and made me remember why i love going to the movies so much for the love of story telling this is a must see

Feb 26 2024,positive,in all it was very good the beginning had some light jokes that made the audience be able to relax but this was a trap as the movie ended up being a very serious and intense film but this false state of security really allowed me to settle into the movie then in pivotal moments it really had me going there were times i was joyful anxious sad and even worried throughout the whole film then it was also very good at not being obvious what would happen kept me on my toes curious as to what would happen next and never being able to predict it as a stand alone movie it is very confusing but it isnt a stand alone movie part one set up the foundation part two sets it in motion and opens the world up exponentially i can only imagine how part three will go
Feb 26 2024,positive,awesome movie 910 for people that have read the book already i imagine its only a 710 for people that havent read the book

Feb 26 2024,positive,if youve never read the book i can imagine this being an incredible experience holding the book very dear i had a mixed experience script choices left me in varying states of scratching my head and rolling my eyes i understand some choices needed to be made to adapt the book unfortunately at nearly every turn in the second half of dune the wrong choice was made visually and aurally stunning but lacking in the script department

Feb 26 2024,positive,dune part two is easily one of the most breathtaking movie experiences i have ever had while i feel its a bit stretched out in the first act after a certain part in the movie it quickly finds its footing the sense of immersion that is brought to the screen by both director denis villenueve and dp greig fraser is impecable the actors do an amazing job charging the story with emotionality that i feel was missing a bit in the first one the vfx and sound design are top tier and many times had my jaw on the ground see it on the biggest screen possible

Feb 26 2024,positive,this movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out absolutely mesmerizing experience i loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it but denis villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising scifi director of this age i find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle dune part two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the characters choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from the cinematography by greig fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the scifi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them you understand the harkonnen the emperor the fremen the bene gesserit and the remnants of house atreides in one look at the way they are shown the score is once again sublime hans zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer his ability to craft largerthanlife scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances which are also incredible form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields rebecca ferguson timothée chalamet javier bardem austin butler and zendaya give wonderful performances with the first three being standouts overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didnt even enjoy the first installment of the series
Feb 26 2024,positive,an enormous epic film the last hour impacted me profoundly aided by hans zimmers amazing score
Feb 26 2024,positive,i have seen thousands of movies over my 21 years alive  this is the greatest movie of all time

Feb 26 2024,positive,saw in imax has to be the way to see it hans zimmermans bassheavy score vibrates through you and the visuals the best ive seen in a movie ever i think zandaya and chalamet knock it out the park so does rebecca ferguson javier bardem out there having a great time loved it
