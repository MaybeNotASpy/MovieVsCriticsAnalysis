Apr 14 2024,negative,the thing thats definitely true of madame web is that it was absolutely butchered just hacked apart by a screaming maniac with a cleaver in postproduction
Apr 8 2024,negative, sonys spiderman universe a webslinging franchise already tainted by misfires has hopefully hit rock bottom with its timejumping thriller madame web you can see the yucky studio fingerprints all over this overproduced origin story from choppyashell pacing to the insistence on hitting certain formulaic mcutype beats initial trailers tease eerie premonition horrors à la final destination that are barely in the final product which has more in common with the first dr strange not even the spooky multiverse of madness sequel if madame web were final destination superhero edition this would probably be a much more enthusiastic review  but its not madame web is instead a flatashell found family remix and awful bad superhero introduction thatll test your ssu patience in record time dakota johnson projects ambivalence and boredom as cassandra cassie webb who we meet as an emotionless thirtysomething loner working as a paramedic in new york city we already know shes the daughter of deceased researcher constance webb kerry bishé betrayed by her expedition partner in perus amazonian rainforest while researching spiders cassie isnt aware of the powers bestowed upon her during birth by a lifesaving arachnid bite nor that bruce wayne wannabe ezekiel sims tahar rahim left her mother with a fatal gunshot wound cassie just wants to avoid death and watch american idol like the average american during the early 2000s not visualize the brutal killing of innocent girls who she then has to babysit thanks to the emergence of time web abilities that have her mind in a paradoxical blender at its core madame web is a comic book adaptation that fights against being a superhero movie its written into cassies personality  she doesnt ask for the burden of playing foster parent to her eventual minions cassie is a complicated protagonist written to conceal any excitement or ownership of her superpowers which lands like a thud throughout johnsons performance shes as cardboardflavored as the refrigerator drawing cassie heartlessly declines from a grateful child its hard to blame an actress when the material is so humdrum and uninspired but still what johnson translates to the screen is like administered anesthesia cassie webb is forgettably played in monotone whether fighting evil spiderman learning las arañas lore or floating through timewebspace like johnson is trying to locate a reality before she signed on to madame web enter cassies someday spiderwomen trio  who we only see as spiderwomen for like a collective two minutes if even sydney sweeney as goodgirlinglasses julia cornwall isabela merced as the fiery independent anya corazon and celeste oconnor as richkid rebel mattie franklin they are your prototype found family who dance on new jersey diner tables to impress boys and make illadvised choices because if not ezekiel cant locate his future murderers its a numbing cycle of cassie giving clear instructions for survival mattie disregarding the rules and ezekiel finding their location that falls into the same recycled staleness cemented by cassies anchoring presence or lack thereof at least johnsons young castmates are allowed a tad more personality which the film desperately needs oconnors brattiness as a skateboarding spiderpunk in training or merceds stern insistence to obey orders allows for real character development  sweeny less so more of an american girl doll for oconnors troublemaker to corrupt the films avalanche of problems ripples from here heralded morbius writers matt sazama and burk sharpless claimed scripting duties after kerem sanga took a crack claire parker also notches a screenplay credit as does director s j clarkson so we can assume revision rounds took place  to highlight how many hands were in the cookie jar four talents trying to homogenize their styles into one voice youre right to assume the blending process is a failure madame web feels like a frankenstein of spare spiderparts dissected and rebuilt by the studio machine no role represents this sentiment more than antagonist ezekiel sims who might be one of the worst supervillains in any comic book adaptation ssu mcu dcu the lot tahar rahims performance is a blank stare and inconsistent accents a millionaire  billionaire  who goes from shooting constance webb point blank and stealing her magic spider for personal use to living in new york citys finest penthouse thirty years later complete with his own nsastolen surveillance technology and tech wiz sidekick amaria zosia mamet deserves better sims isnt the lead or focus of madame web thats cassie webb but the screenplay so ineptly builds his nonexistent mythology no further than bad guy in dark spiderman suit not to mention his adr work in particular is egregiously noticeable and quite horrendous for a hollywood film with substantial budgeting and resources sims is a mad libs evildoer with an important arc about not obsessing over your future lest you doom your present but producers clearly dont care about the final cut version of sims which makes it hard for us to care in return madame web plays as insincere forces characters through obvious motions and commits the ultimate sin for any superhero origin  is always looking toward future installments i havent mentioned director s j clarkson all that much because the film lacks identity and i hope thats a byproduct of wretched studio tampering sonys inability to reconcile with the ssus past and not let the future weigh down its present anxieties is in parallel with cassies arc  and they cant even tell that substory right madame web is essentially promotional material for identities and superheroes you were sold this time around with no real guarantee that any of these spiderwomen will appear down the road given the current ssus disastrous status
Apr 4 2024,negative, late last year may december sparked a spirited online debate about the definition of stylistic camp while susan sontag purists were quick to insist that the outrageous tone of the film is to be strictly defined as comedy many others were happy to shrug off this traditional definition and evolve the scope of camp into something weaponizable and then we have madame web  one of the worst films in recent memory which doesnt spin its camp with any sense of understanding or autonomy its an outrageous sometimes entertaining mess that will hopefully supply audiences with enough disastrous creative choices and laughable nonsense to make its twohour runtime somewhat ironically enjoyable in madame web a young new york city paramedic named cassandra web played by a halfawake dakota johnson has her dormant clairvoyant and precognitive mutant abilities ignited after an almostfatal accident now able to see glimpses into the near future cassandra discovers that she can make drastic changes to help and ultimately save those around her this gift was passed on to her from her longdead mother who had been studying spiders in the amazon right before she died when another mutant tahar rahim hunts down three seemingly average teenage girls on the subway cassandra uses her newfound abilities to save their lives and the four young women find themselves on the run from a deadly ruthless foe  the story is impossibly bloated with a meaningless plot  a fate foreshadowed by the amazon spider dialogue made viral by the films outrageous campy trailer none of it makes sense and the characters often look at each other like they are unsure of whose line is coming next or which pingpong ball they need to be running from its all just one long and ongoing disaster thats occasionally fun to watch but has too much filler to avoid a painfully boring third act  part of what confused me most about this confounding cinematic experience was the quality of its performances dakota johnson has been on a tear lately with her press tour for the film from eating up journalists who clumsily pestered her about the memeification of the films trailer to a comedic earthquake survival johnson is always a fun personality to witness in realtime her nonchalant eccentricity even translates onto the screen here  but instead of laughing with the movie her performance seems to be constantly selfaware of the mess surrounding her i cant speak to her internal monologue but i couldnt help but feel like johnson as cassie was in as much awe of the films spectacular ongoing failure as the rest of us then we have the unfortunate misuse of the films young leads rising superstars sydney sweeney celeste oconnor and isabela merced play three teenage girls who will one day become mutant heroes but currently require protection from cassandra with these three performances the film goes into truly unforgivable territory we get short visions of what their future superhero alteregos look like and its fairly glorious but these are clearly promises of a cinematic tomorrow we will undoubtedly never see as the quality of madame web is so wretched that any continuation feels all but dead on arrival the wasted potential of a film led by these spiderwomen instead of a cardboard cutout of madame web was a grotesque tease  while there are more than a handful of moments so terrible that they were an ironic joy to witness the film is so long and confusing that its ironic value is slaughtered by its third act campy yes  but also terrible
Mar 21 2024,negative,madame web is a frustrating example of a film that could work if they took better care of the story and didnt try and judo it straight into franchise fuel
Mar 18 2024,negative, the gist the peruvian amazon 1973 madame webs mom kerry bishe finally finally finds the spider shes been searching for  a spider that has some truly amazing peptides the type of venomderived peptides that the script tells us can supercharge cellular structure lets hear it for peptides that supercharge cellular structure hooray for the peptides shes also pregnant but that doesnt stop ezekiel sims tahar rahim from shooting her and stealing the spider and leaving her for dead so some peruvian spiderpeople known as las aranas can rescue her and take her to a magic cave for a magic bath so she can be bitten by one of the special spiders in the hopes that those peptides can save her it doesnt work and she dies but the baby doesnt dont you hate it when that happens now we jump to 2003 where we meet that baby of destiny all growed up cassandra webb johnson surely voted best bangs on an nyc emt several years running shes a lonely sort with a cat and to show us that shes a lonely sort she talks to the cat a lot and sadly thumbs through old photos of her mom her best budslashambulance partner is a guy named  hold onto yer hats true believers  ben parker adam scott which has implications my friends major effing implications one day as she attends  put your hats back on so you can hold onto them again  mary parkers emma roberts baby shower  who could possibly be in her tumtum  and drinks an icecold can of pepsicola she and ben are summoned to a rescue scene that goes sideways and nearly ends her while shes dead for a few minutes she finds herself in an ugly and shitty special effect and after ben resuscitates her she immediately says i just wanna go home and watch idol because its 2003 yo  the ugly shitty special effect wasnt nothing of course cassie starts seeing glimpses into the future via confusing flashforwards this doesnt happen all the time only when very important things are going to happen so yes that means it happens precisely when the plot needs it at this point the plot reintroduces us to ezekiel as he beds a pretty lady has a nightmare and engages in the worst pillow talk ever its not a dream im gonna be murdered one day he says his visions are clear three spiderwomen will take him out so he goes about trying to find those women and take them out first using computer composites and advanced surveillance tech thats so complex and impossible the movie doesnt explain it because itd be way too difficult to do so convincingly so we just move on who are those spiderwomen you ask well theyre not spiderwomen yet just average teenagers julia cornwall sydney sweeney anya corazon isabela merced and mattie franklin celeste oconnor one day all three of these young women who dont know each other end up on the same train as cassie who envisumalizes whats about to happen somehow convinces them that her envisumalization isnt the ravings of a lunatic and saves them from an attack by ezekiel who wears a black spidermannish costume destiny it seems is really stinking afoot here and destiny will lead our heroines to a thoroughly inscrutable finish at an itchy and scratchy fireworks factory topped by a giant pepsicola sign as it damn well should since being a shameless advertisement is the only thing this movie successfully achieves  what movies will it remind you of deep breath youve got green lantern elektra fantastic four 2015 fantastic four 2005 suicide squad 2016 time hasnt vindicated any of these losers time to add a new one to this hallofshame list  performance worth watching johnsons really itsaliving her way through this thing shes been through it before in the 50 shadeses so by now she should be a pro at gutting it out as an unapologetic dk fanboy i just want to send her flowers and a nice card after this one i cant help but contemplate critic gene siskels famous criteria for judging a film is the movie more interesting than the same actors having lunch in this case id specifically amend that to put johnson and sweeney across from each other in a cozy diner booth having a sadeyes staring contest over a slice of pie  first one to cry loses that would be way more watchable than madame web  memorable dialogue my fave doozy in a script full of em theres not enough frictional force in the bare human foot to overcome gravity and keep him stuck to the wall much less the ceiling says anya corazon like anyone would breathlessly blurt as theyre trying to escape being killed by a spidermadman our take a few sudden bursts of unintentional hilarity dont save madame web from being unwatchable  unwatchable like a fox the screenplay is a series of exponentially escalating incomprehensible storytelling decisions resulting in a bonafide nonsense fugue theres a scene in which cassie tells her teenage proteges dont do anything dumb immediately followed by a reiteration seriously dont do dumb things has she read this screenplay it consists entirely of dumb things they have no choice one wonders if johnson read it either before hopefully being paid very well for this note she surely did read it in a recent interview she essentially said this was one of those movies that looked like one thing when she signed on and became something entirely different after she knew it was a disaster she knew the discourse was coming heres another fistful of daisies dakota our call i wanted to like this movie scratch that  i wanted to like disliking this movie just back the ftd delivery truck into dakotas driveway and skip it
Mar 18 2024,neutral,theres something almost cosmically funny about the fact that every illconceived boardroom mandate and desperate spidermilking mistake backfires in the most spectacular way imaginable 
Mar 15 2024,negative, early on in madame web  the latest superhero film to be based on a spidermanadjacent comic series  dakota johnsons cassie web rejects a thankyou gift from the child of a woman whose life she just saved from this you can probably surmise that firstly shes awkward around kids and secondly she will eventually end up having to protect some kids like many heavily telegraphed moments in this film you wont need psychic powers to figure that one out  even if cassie herself does in fact shortly develop such powers but if you did have psychic powers you might have wanted to use them to gently warn the cast away from this film which manages to be both overwritten and underwritten at the same time most of the actors here are wonderfully talented but theres only so much they can do with the material a prophets tahar rahim so often a blistering presence is left to thankless grumpy villain duties here adam scott fresh off his unimprovable turn in severance takes on a curious incarnation of spideys uncle ben sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor as spiderwomen have very little to do here there is perhaps a bit less digital mulch sloshing around in madame web than in some recent superhero films this is the result of a smaller and more selfcontained story involving the kind of nifty timeloop dilemmas familiar from smallscreen scifi but where the dialogue needed wit and spark it has the kind of willthisdo oneliners hope the spiders were worth it mom and tired backstories you get when the characters are too flat to flesh out with rounded personalities some unconvincing adr smacks of a lastminute attempt to fix things in the edit like the last remnants of a lost civilisation poking through the wreckage of a postapocalyptic wasteland hints of classical storytelling survive the fateful legacy of a birthright inherited from a dead parent gives cassies arc a freudian motif while the villain attempting to wipe out the next generation due to a premonition that they will cause his own downfall is a more interesting and personal motivation  at least on the page  than another bad guy wanting to destroy the universe and instead of chekhovs gun we get a new twist on an old favourite in the form of chekhovs cpr its not enough to offset the creeping sense that when it comes to the franchise sometimes known as the sony pictures universe of marvel characters spumc the word marvel is synonymous less with a sense of awe than with a shrug
Mar 15 2024,negative, were starting off 2024 really weak or really strong depending on your perspective this week its madame web and all the lunacy it provided lets talk about why it flopped who is to blame and pepsi of course
Mar 11 2024,negative, geraldine viswanathan as marian and margaret qualley as jamie in a scene from driveaway dolls photo credit wilson webb  working title  focus features as film bros and joe moviegoer alike await the release of dune part two with bated breath they have largely given the cold shoulder to a spattering of other movies trying in vain to find audiences in the first two months of 2024 they run the gamut from acclaimed oscar rejects ava duvernays gripping origin to costly debacles plagued by bad press and a cloud of letsnotevenhatewatch contempt more on that below the jason stathamfronted thriller the beekeeper better than it looks and bob marley one love a new biopic about the reggae icon unseen by me as of this writing stand out as rare profitable exceptions in what is otherwise a concerning nomansland two february releases tell genredriven tales that put women in the drivers seat of narratives all too often spearheaded by male protagonists one is a buddy road movie with two lesbian friends seizing the spotlight the other is the latest attempt by sony to kickstart its own coterie of marvel  away from the greedy mouse an origin story with shades of bryan singers xmen movies did either of them deserve their grim box office fate lets find out driveaway dolls jamie and marian need a change so they hit the road naughty raunchy and kooky shenanigans ensue that in a nutshell sums up the story of two sapphic besties dealing with the violent patriarchy cops and criminals alike horny athletes an abrasive exgirlfriend and a crooked politician with a hilarious secret but it doesnt reflect the easygoing retro vibe that makes this liveaction cartoon go down like honey our protagonists living in philly circa 1999 are polar opposites that somehow complement each other jamie margaret qualley lets her libido make her decisions and her latest conquest is too much for her girlfriend sukie beanie feldstein a police officer with a chip on her shoulder to take straitlaced tightly wound marian blockers geraldine viswanathan is tired of her annoying straight male coworkers at her office job and dissatisfied with life in general so she decides to rent a car

camp has given them the boxy dodge aries meant for a couple of goons joey slotnick and cj wilson tasked with transporting a briefcase filled with unspecified contraband also to floridas capital its a case of mistaken identities that plays more like screwball comedy fodder than bloodsoaked mayhem through theres some of that too  jamie her confident swagger bolstered by a heavy texas drawl favors frequent detours to explore lesbian bar culture along the way against the wishes of marian whod much rather curl up with a henry james novel than socialize once they realize theyre carrying stolen goods the two team up to deal with their ballooning underworld dilemma as a suave gangster played by current oscar nominee colman domingo deals with the incompetence of his jawdroppingly stoopid henchmen driveaway dolls mixes two popular nineties subgenres that used to move bmovies off video store shelves the downanddirty crime thriller and the exuberant queer indie its in this dual playpen that writerdirector ethan coen and coscreenwriter tricia cooke his partner in art and in life jump in with gusto wielding a budget and even a handful of alisters that the movies that inspired them could only dream of cooke who identifies as queer infuses her more grounded and yes very queer sensibility into coens goofy occasionally gruesome sense of humor like the mismatched duo piloting this wild ride the blend should not work yet somehow does the results suggest what the wachowskis bound would have been like as a farce geraldine viswanathan as marian and margaret qualley as jamie in a scene from driveaway dolls photo credit wilson webb  working title  focus features coen directing his first feature without filmmaking partner and sibling joel is not afraid to dip his toe in overthetop gore that recalls sam raimi in the eighties and to a lesser extent the coens own debut feature blood simple but theres a distinct laidback appeal here its in the films playful gleefully racy sex scenes with undeniable shades of russ meyer its in the lavalamp imagery of the segueways between some scenes and its in the twinkle in the eye of a front desk employee at a tallahassee hotel who appears to have walked in from an early alexander payne movie they indicate this isnt your typical bmovie homage amidst the broad oddcouple hijinks a tender depiction of jamie and marians friendship blooms when it comes to the young womens personal lives they begin to stealthily influence each others behavior navigating their deepening bond with a nuance and sensitivity that anchors the clever genrehopping and even injects a political subtext without interrupting the bawdy fun the fact that coen and cooke milk considerable mileage from linda ronstadts blue bayou cover should tell you all you need to know well that and the films original title which had another word for dolls thats either pejorative or empowering depending on who you ask yes its exactly the d word youre thinking of and no the contents of that mysterious briefcase are decidedly not what youre thinking of driveaway dolls wallows in the muck yet always feels wholesome despite its hard r trappings matt damon and pedro pascal pop in and while its fun to see the stars in lighthearted cameos the movie doesnt need their wattage coen and cooke elevate the scuzzy appeal of their disreputable building blocks while still paying tribute to grindhouse fare of past generations clocking in at just 84 minutes theyve made a romp thats tough on the outside but squishy in the middle this is primo trash and proud of it not only great fun but a great hangout flick and a winning buddy picture it promises a rowdy time and delivers the goods before it slams on the brakes madame web do you know what movie was in dire need of some of driveaway dolls lively energy and generosity of spirit this somnanbulant excuse for a comic book adventure should i rip the bandaid im going to rip off the bandaid the story of how a sullen disenchanted new york city paramedic discovers she can foresee future events is a washout a nonstarter aggressively boring when its not being conspicuously awful the social media dust storm that this misbegotten dumpster fire kicked up has begun to settle but i fear its ripple effects will be felt for a long time to come at the center of this funnel cloud of good intentions and poor execution is a phonedin performance by dakota johnson playing the aforementioned first responder cassandra webb see studying greek mythology was good for something after all cassies mother was researching spiders in the peruvian amazon before she was doublecrossed by her handsome powerhungry research partner ezekiel sims a prophets tahar rahim picking up a paycheck circa 1973 mommie dearest kicks the bucket moments after childbirth in a scene that feels ripped off from avatar flash forward 30 years and cassie has a neardeath experience of her own while responding to a crash she gradually realizes that she can see things before they happen a neat concept and if someone with the panache of say sam raimi was the filmmaker calling the shots wed have a real humdinger that would keep audiences on their toes sadly we have to settle for sj clarkson in the directors chair and the tv vet gives cassies visions the most earthbound treatment imaginable leeching the thrill of disorientation that would have given these scenes their kick isabela merced as anya corazon dakota johnson as cassandra webb sydney sweeney as julia cornwall and celeste oconnor as mattie franklin in a scene from madame web photo courtesy of marvel  sony pictures cassie discovers shes fated to cross paths with and protect three teenage girls shy and awkward julia cornwall the radiant sydney

rather hunky and yet the sex appeal still yields a charisma void hes convinced the indigenous people of the amazon cursed him with knowledge of how hes going to die at the hands of this teen trio with abandonment issues at some unspecified future date it goes without saying that sweeney merced and oconnor are all in their twenties and as convincing as youd expect playing teens which is not very but revealing this information early in the game saps the life force out of madame web the rest of the movie unfolds as one narrow escape after another with perfunctory action scenes that fail to quicken the pulse schintzy cgi and automated dialogue replacement or adr so poorly synchronized youd swear these actors have all been dubbed by other people only composer johan söderqvist appears to have understood the assignment using herrmannesque strings to generate an aura of a falsely accused person on the run from baddies and the law think north by northwest but with bad visual effects and dialogue in the place of actual tension if the storyline gives you déjà vu thats because madame web was released a few months after the marvels which brings together three superheroes from the marvel cinematic universe captain marvel brie larson ms marvel iman vellani and monica rambeau teyonah parris web actually plays like a morose mirror image of the marvels but even though both productions were plagued with reported behindthescenes drama marvels director nia dacosta imbued her adventure with fleetfooted pacing a colorful palette and a refreshingly featherweight tone by contrast clarkson has crafted the movie that the marvels and while were at it the underappreciated wonder woman 1984 were accused of being celeste oconnor as mattie franklin dakota johnson as cassandra webb isabela merced as anya corazon and sydney sweeney as julia cornwall in a scene from madame web photo courtesy of marvel  sony pictures madame web lumbers from setpiece to setpiece with a perpetually irritated johnson acting as shed rather be anywhere but here shes an undefatigable guardian who approaches deathdefying situations with the energy of a janitor tasked with cleaning up a big mess really another spill to mop up in the face of danger you get the feeling shes about to ask for the manager but keeps getting interrupted this underachiever should have been titled super karen johnson the daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson has gotten a bad rap due to the fifty shades trilogy i was underwhelmed by the first one but rather enjoyed parts 2 and 3 shhh dont tell anyone it needs to be pointed out that shes been good in a number of films including luca guadagninos a bigger splash and suspiria as well as the indie sleeper the peanut butter falcon here alas shes checked out from the getgo and even though clarkson keeps madame web just under the twohour mark you feel like youve been robbed of more time than that much like its vexed vortex of a protagonist you come away feeling like youve had to pay to babysit a bunch of ungrateful and unruly brats this sorry spidey offshoot has already pegged as an expensive flop and you cant blame the mall crowds for staying away it drives you up the

Mar 8 2024,neutral,  the first act of driveaway dolls ethan coens prey2k lesbian screwball comedy is pure cringe its 1999 and two friends marian geraldine viswanathan and jamie margaret qualley are driving a rented sedan from philadelphia to tallahasseeand acting more like caricatures than characters marian is a bookish romantic jamie just wants to get laid dude the film is so dependent on stock characterizations that ethan initially seems to be flailing without his filmmaker brother joel like joels gorgeously austere the tragedy of macbeth driveaway dolls is a coen brother movie singular yet when marian and jamie get ensnared in a scheme involving a seething senator matt damon and a murdered dildo collector pedro pascal driveaway dolls emerges as a cleverly comedic and romantic provocation despite being set after bill clinton signed the defense of marriage act the film imagines the 90s as an age when bigoted politicians were more ridiculous than dangerous and even florida church ladies could be prevailed upon to support gay marriage kinky lovemaking abounds but the evolution of marian and jamies bondfrom friendship to far morecarries a whiff of jane austen with qualley playing a boisterous elizabeth bennet to viswanathans disdainful mr darcy is it any wonder that coen wrote this jubilant lark of a movie with his wife the film editor tricia cooke the couple that

solempfeifer cinema 21  both lyrical and essayistic the latest film by ava duvernay is firstly a feat of adaptation here the selma director interprets the 2020 nonfiction bestseller caste the origins of our discontents which explores pancultural patterns of dehumanization throughout history yet origin also foregrounds the research and writing of that book by pulitzer prize winner isabel wilkerson aunjanue ellistaylor turning this story into the cultural study meets memoir it never was on the page its a bold choice with duvernay drenching the writers pursuit in historical flashbacks as wilkerson searches for the thesis of caste across germany india and the deep south where audra mcdonald playing interview subject miss hale delivers an astounding onescene performance with kris bowers orchestral score pulling the audience across borders and centuries ellistaylor embodies the quiet obsession of a writer who lives mostly in her head but is desperate to crack the code of mans inhumanity to man sociologists and historians could rightly argue that wilkersons premisethat racism is the result of deliberately constructed caste systems not inherent biasesis flawed because capitalism colonialism and genocide are expressed differently through american slavery the holocaust and the subjugation of indias dalits but that doesnt matter when origin is stretched to its full

girls including sydney sweeney hunted by the nefarious ezekiel tahir rahim it becomes clear that director sj clarksons film is mostly just another dull attempt by sony to spotlight spideys side characters johnson and adam scott as the tellingly named ben parker breathe a bit of life into the tale as do a few clever set pieces a subway sequence comes off best but the clunky dialogue lumbering

Mar 6 2024,negative, cinematic disasters shouldnt be this boring directed by sj clarkson madame web is a collection of misfires and missteps awkward dialogue weightless action shoehornedin referencesall told without any sense of urgency at all the idea of a villain relentlessly pursuing his prey seems like it should be a pressing matter but the film takes a week off to get lost in a glut of expository dialogue the whole movies default dialogue mode the actors do their best but the script is leaden and theres no real visual splendor to beholdnot even in the ironic look how awkwardcheapphony this is way that viewers can get from good bad movies there are funny lines here and there both intentionally comedic and not but while audiences may want to find themselves tangled up in the story theyll be left adrift without anything reeling them in cassie webb dakota johnson is a misanthropic awkward emt working in nyc in 2003 one day while saving someone she drowns and temporarily dies before being revived by her partner ben parker adam scott now cassie gets glimpses of the possible future and is learning to navigate those visions when she happens upon a trio of teenagers sydney sweeney isabela merced celeste oconnor who have become the target of ezekiel sims tahar rahim a man with incredible spider superpowers connected to cassies mom who died in the peruvian forest in the 70s searching for a very special spider now cassie has to figure out what is going on and help protect the three women from this menace the cinematographer for madame web is mauro fiore who previously was dp for avatar the island and training day amongst many others while the film is competently shot there is no visual style to anything except rotating the camera occasionally to match sims spidery moves on ceilings which is surprising given fiores pedigree but the usual engrossing imagery is absent here washed out like so much of madame web there are jokes but they mostly land flat there are charismatic actors but they arent given much to do or substantive characters to inhabit johnson fares the best out of anyone in this cast except maybe scott as she is allowed to be a sarcastic aloof and overwhelmed person in a sea of crazinessbut that interesting characterization is drained away as time rolls on eventually leaving a stilted husk of a person offering empty line readings there are a couple of scenes where the three teens are allowed to just play off each other but those are cut short and even then they arent particularly successful at being clever or that entertaining but still they had promise director clarkson has worked in the superhero genre before on marvels netflix shows jessica jones and the defenders so should be wellversed in creating some dynamic scenes between interesting characters or at least some sort of engaging action unfortunately none of the fight scenes land with any sort of impact its not because most of them are part of cassies precognitive visions and therefore dont happenits because they are lifelessly executed and poorly edited without any sort of appealing nature to them in general fight scenes dont have to be revolutionary to be interesting they just have to have some visual flair or at least involve characters that we the audience are invested in but seeing as how theres no one in this film that feels like a real person or at least captivating enough to care about all the action sequences and grandiose stunt set pieces fall horribly flat madame web is incredibly awkward as well it belabors the point of foreshadowing that bens sisterinlaw may parker emma roberts is pregnant with someone massive wink but to what end what is the point of tying it into peter parker without ever saying that name so much thats not a fun easter egg but a pathetic attempt at making the events of the movie somehow interesting by proxy its not just that shoehorning in of everyones favorite wallcrawler that is awkward sims is dubbed pretty terribly possibly by rahim but certainly in a lot of adr to the point of sounding like a 90s dtv action villain which should be funif it were a stylistic choice and not just something clunky sims assistant zosia mamet is given an inordinate amount of screentime and terrible cliched hacker lingo that never really pays off in any way and the dialogue is just constantly full of awkward exposition or some other weird phrasing that tries to sell themes of power and spiders in offputting ways that make it all feel wrong comic book movies reinvigorated the postcredits scene thered be a little tease into the future usually with something that seems awkward if thought about too long but could be enticing enough to see whats to come those scenes are rarely visually interesting often peppered with some attempts at humor and rely on audiences caring about what happened so as to be invested in what happens next madame web doesnt have any credits scenes because it is a postcredits scene writ large and when ballooned up from three minutes to two hours the strain is noticeable hollow jokes ring false dialogue buckles underneath the burden of carrying that much plot and explanation and theres no arresting imagery to engross viewers madame web isnt the worst but its lack of immediacy and heart make it a disastrous slog you can

Mar 6 2024,negative,the storytelling is somewhere between pathetic and perfunctory largely perfunctory  
Mar 5 2024,negative, we all know studios have some kind of say in the films that they distribute and release why wouldnt they after all they are ploughing hundreds of millions of dollars into productions and feel that gives them a seat at the table behind the camera when studios have as much of a say as sony clearly did with madame web it almost makes a review impossible because this is a true mess of a film narratively madame web is rudimentary but feels almost monolithic compared to the screenplay but the horrifyingly bad editing and tonal shifts smack firmly of a film that was completed before being butchered by execs wanting to ride the wave of the superhero genre  and in doing so have created the banalest most generic and pointless release the genre has seen in many many years the positives are few and far between sadly as the action and production design do nothing to lift the film from its basement and the performanceswell sigh dakota johnson must have a large cellular bill as she is phoning this in from the getgo especially when having to participate in anything superherorelated that said i find johnson to be gleefully watchable even in films such as this her press tour performance was worth all the money however sydney sweeney who i think is a very strong actress is abysmal alongside oconnor and i dont recall merced really doing anything but special praise must go to tahir rahim who was handed a terrible role and simply had no idea what to do with it superhero film villains are often derided as weak and onedimensional and nothing in madame web proves this to be wrong i had hoped that madame web would at least be entertaining even if it was bad but the film takes itself so seriously that even finding moments of levity feels like a bridge too far  though maybe the hamfisted references to peter parker count as comedy whatever the case from the beginning to its wholly unearned ending madame web struggles against a studio that is desperate to create its own universe but seemingly has no concept of how to do so making good films is a start and sony with their liveaction spidey universe is failing badly at that
Mar 5 2024,neutral,a necessary back story but to what avail
Mar 4 2024,negative,this is abysmal on every conceivable level its badly cast and the screenplay is atrocious in that this feels like a terrible first draft that somebody rushed out in the first week

Mar 2 2024,negative, that might explain why madame web  the inauspicious directorial debut of sj clarkson  offers up a sophomoric overwritten screenplay that constantly resummarizes the plot and comments on the obvious madame web began in 1980 as an unusual supporting superhero in marvels spiderman comic books blind and elderly she exercised clairvoyant powers while being connected to a lifesupport system resembling a spiderweb in this standalone origin story cassandra webb johnson works as a new york paramedic alongside her bland buddy ben adam scott she begins to inexplicably experience violent visions of the immediate near future she does not know what we know having seen how her researcherexplorer mother died in 1973 peru while looking for a rare spider rumored to possess great healing powers her killer a duplicitous guide and dull onenote villain named ezekiel sims tahar rahim uses the spider venom to transform into a wealthy evil ninja with spiderman powers he vows to find and kill three superherocostumed females he foresees will assassinate him meanwhile cassie spots three familiarlooking teens in the subway softspoken julia cornwall sydney sweeney street savvy mattie franklin celeste oconnor and undocumented illegal immigrant anya corazon isabela merced cassie sees sims kill the girls in a futuristic vision she quickly  and too easily  persuades them to follow her off the train five writers received credit for this marvel mess and its collection of braindead bromides such as no matter what happens we need to work together and sometimes you must sacrifice yourself to save someone you love with his constantly roving cameras capturing incredible compositions oscarwinning cinematographer and palatine high school graduate mauro fiore  assisted by the keen editing of leigh fast  furious folsom  elevates madame web to a watchable status
Mar 1 2024,neutral, even before it was released last week the buzz was as negative as any movie in recent memory with most of it aimed squarely at the films star dakota johnson the negativity continued after the films dismal performance at the box office on opening weekend with some declaring it one of the worst films of all time thats why in one sense madame web proved to be a slightly pleasant surprise its nowhere near as bad as the buzz might suggest hello have you seen lisa frankenstein thats not to say its good either madame web is basically just a film that is there  its a passable way to kill two hours while watching something that is pretty average madame web serves as an origin story with johnson playing cassie a new york paramedic whose mother constance kerry bishé died shortly after cassies birth while searching for a mysterious spider in the jungles of peru following a neardeath experience cassie starts to have visions and the capability to see into the future this leads her to cross paths with three young women sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconner who are unknowingly the target of constances former assistant ezekiel tahir rahim his wrath is driven by visions that the three girls will eventually become superheroes and will be responsible for his death madame web is an origin story with a lot of origin  way more exposition and set up for the future of these characters than perhaps any film in this genre and there lies one of the biggest problems with the film  its hard to get invested in a superhero movie that is practically void of superheroes firsttime feature film director sj clarkson does try to spice things up by playing with the time loop element and staging a couple of action sequences but it all feels like its been taken from a film cliche assembly line and pieced together to create something resembling a comic book movie the cast is going through the motions too although johnson continues to develop a lowkey screen presence that makes her interesting to watch even when it appears shes bored with the material as well the result is madame web isnt really the disaster some have labeled it its basically just a forgettable misfire that will be a cinematic afterthought within a few weeks
Mar 1 2024,negative, spiderman is easily one of the most popular superheroes in existence among the many things that fans love about the revered webslinger is the amazing array of characters who fill out his world allies villains nonsuperpowered side characters  the list is long and diverse over the years many have found their ways onto the big screen and one thing has become abundantly clear some characters have fared considerably better than others when it comes to spidey movies adding to the list of those who havent fared well is madame web a supporting character in the spidey comics who now gets her own movie in sonys spiderman cinematic universe unfortunately what we get is an exercise in futility that stretches the spiderman brand beyond its limits directed by sj clarkson and somehow written by a team of four screenwriters madame web is a hodgepodge of fair to downright terrible ideas thrown together to form one of the more excruciating superhero movies to endure opening in 1973 deep in the amazonian jungles of peru ezekiel sims tahar rahim provides security for a science and research expedition led by constance webb kerry bishé there they discover a new species of spider with healing properties capable of curing all kinds of diseases in true villain form ezekiel turns on constance and their team claiming the discovery for himself and leaving constance for dead a mysterious local tribe attempt to save constance and her unborn baby using some kind of magical spider venom but constance dies while delivering her daughter cassie from there we jump ahead to 2003 as what happened in the thirty years between is mostly left unanswered cassie dakota johnson is a new york city paramedic working alongside ben parker adam scott when an emergency call ends with cassie having a neardeath experience she begins having strange and unexplainable visions she first tries to dismiss them as simple déjà vu but over time she realizes her visions are actually glimpses into the future meanwhile ezekiel who has premonition and physical powers all his own has set his sights on three unconnected teenagers julia cornwall sydney sweeney anya carazon isabela merced mattie franklin celeste oconnor ezekiel has been haunted by visions of the future where these girls somehow gain their own spiderpowers and use them to kill him determined to prevent his death ezekiel sets out to kill the girls first but when cassies newfound powers reveals ezekiels plans shes compelled to save and protect the girls all while trying to understand her strange abilities as vague and poorly defined as it is there are hints of an original and potentially interesting premise but clarkson and the team of writers never get beyond teasing those ideas instead their movie meanders to the point of tedium the characters are dull and uninspired as is the action which is hampered by poor staging choppy editing and mediocretobad cgi the dreadful script doesnt help things its full of gaping holes narrative shortcuts and some astonishingly bad dialogue the glaring oversights and there are many of them are especially funny take cassie being wanted by police for kidnapping the girls she actually saved yet she drives all over new york city in a stolen cab walks around in broad daylight gets flights in and out of the country without the cops every getting wind its as if the movie completely forgets the whole police angle madame web is capped off with an unimaginative and utterly preposterous finale that leaves you scratching your head at how poorly its pieces come together theres no real stakes and as a result theres no real suspense add to it our general lack of investment and you have a doomed ending with no real chance of offering up a satisfying conclusion its best quality is that it mercifully ends what is a flailing mess of a movie  one that seems perfectly content with riding spidermans coattails rather than trying for something smart original and coherent madame web is in theaters now keith i had a premonition that this would be garbage  i do not like dakota johnsons acting ability  too bad a superhero movie got wasted  did you notice in the pic above the calvin klein product placement keith im both a big marvel and dakota johnson fan i found this awful just awful couple of scenes with dialogue that sounds like ai wrote it marketing folks were more than devious when it came to the trailer  thought the girls were going to suit up and be way more active in the movie looks like it was produced and directed in the time period it is set in and maybe somehow the producers were actually reaching for a retro feel and as for our stardakota is much better suited to cha cha real smooth and peanut butter falcontype roles a superheroinenope oh the whole thing with the girls in their superhero suits certainly teased something that was never delivered i swear i sat there wondering how something like that got made  exactly it is so hard for me to believe there were any highlevel executives of the studio in the screening room for the unspooling of the final product i dreaded this as im sure this was a painful experience  i feel bad for the people involved as sony just doesnt know how to create superhero films without getting in their own way  ive only seen venom in its entirely of these films and that was alright but i dont have interest in anything else  id like avoid morbius as long as i live great review yes i skipped this one in theaters for multiple reasons ive long lost faith in marvel and stopped watching their films many years ago the last marvel movie that i actually enjoyed in theaters was endgame about six years ago ive never cared for any of dakota johnsons work and the trailer for this gave me little hope i might watch it on streaming some day if theres nothing else on but no plans to see it at all i hate to be this blunt but its astonishingly bad even when taking a surfacelevel approach to it you cant miss the many big holes and shortcuts

Feb 26 2024,negative, theyre just trolling us now hollywood the entertainmentindustrial complex we gave them our geeky all our money our attention our time from 80s genx kids raises hand who leaned hard into mega franchises  star wars back to the future and beyond  to the early zoomers who came of cinematic age with the beginning of the mcu in the post 911 era some of us even molded our entire personalities around the wonderfully engaging smartly fantastical stories they told us that was always going to be a bad idea and now that bad idea is slapping all of us in the face we gave them our hearts and now theyre giving us garbage because they think they can get away with it because they took us for granted look superhero fatigue might not have been a thing with audiences if the movies had just you know kept up not been junk yes making movies is hard but its not that hard because cinemaniacs are always able to forgive a lack of resources but a lack of authenticity a lack of genuine enthusiasm not so much these movies didnt need to get bloated  bigger ahem isnt always better  and they didnt need to require homework like watching all the ancillary streaming series this isnt how it had to be they could have just given us good honest stories madame web its almost impossible to see this travesty as a goodnatured mistake this is a movie sprouted solely from the depths of corporate cynicism from sony attempting to glom onto the success for another studio of the mcu even though the company owned nothing of marvel comics except spiderman and so in recent years weve gotten spidermanadjacent flicks from sony including morbius and two venom flicks and now madame web theyve all been nothing but popculture jokes and sony doesnt seem to grasp why the movies cassie webb dakota johnson bless bad times at the el royale fifty shades freed is a paramedic in new york city in 2003 why 2003 is it to capitalize on the very solemn very serious hangover from 911 in which the city was of course still wallowing a mere two years later especially for a paramedic whom we might expect would have seen some traumatic shit that day lol not at all as far as i can determine its so the movie can insert itself into the tom hollandasspiderman timeline as established by the mcu because cassies ems partner is called ben parker adam scott the best thing here the disaster artist fun mom dinner whose sister mary emma roberts palo alto were the millers is hugely pregnant and about to pop with a baby boy whose name she has not yet settled on ill spell out the tease for those who dont get it though im not sure why youd have any interest in reading a review of madame web if you didnt the blatant implication is that mary is about to give birth to peter parker who will become spiderman a decade and a half later while he is being raised by his uncle ben and aunt martha may theres no martha may here but ben does ominously drop the news that hes just met someone groan eta martha why did i say that name why did i say that name the desperation to ride the spiderman coattails is pathetic enough but what are the odds that ben parker would happen to have two different unrelated people in his life who have acquired superpowers through a spider bite cassies spider wasnt radioactive just a naturally exotic denizen of the amazonian rain forest  see her mom kerry bishé the fitzgerald family christmas argo was researching these spiders while hugely pregnant and was bitten just before giving birth and dying and then when cassie bizarrely steps out of the 2003 action to take a side trip to peru to investigate she meets the local tribesman josé maría yazpik who helped her mom and knows all about the spider bite and gravely intones when you take on the responsibility great power will come its like what peter parker learns about great power and great responsibility but flipped or something honestly its exhausting trying to find ways to boil down all the convoluted coincidenceladen nonsense of this movie in a way that doesnt make me sound incoherent watching it all unfurl onscreen is kinda gobsmacking yet also way duller than youd imagine  its not even so bad its fun and ive barely scratched the surface never mind uncle ben being kneedeep in spiderpeople  after the events of this movie when peter parkers spiderman comes along later the people of new york shoulda been like what more weirdoes in spider spandex cuz like cassie ends up mentoring three teenage girls sydney sweeney isabela merced dora and the lost city of gold and celeste oconnor to become spiderthemed crime fighters and their origin story  which is also what this movie is about  involves battling wealthy businessman ezekiel sims tahar rahim mary magdalene grand central shamefully wasted who also has spider powers and spider spandex the movie has no idea why sims is evil or what he does in his spider spandex when hes not trying to kill these girls the movie doesnt even know what sort of business hes in its all a bafflingly lazy stew of comicbook clichés one of the girls mentions totally randomly her uncle jonah the only purpose of which is to make you think of j jonah jameson the newspaper editor who will later employ peter parker as a photographer we can blame screenwriters matt sazama and burk sharpless who together wrote gods of egypt and dracula untold claire parker kerem sanga and sj clarkson clarkson also directs her feature debut after a long career as a tv director this movie often has the small cheap look of a 1990s cable show but they will have had little control over much of what we are subjected to here its plain that sony actually had little trust in fan interest in the madame web character as she is depicted in the comics she is an elderly woman disabled because of an autoimmune and neuromuscular disorder with multiple psychic superpowers none of this the result of a spider bite she could have been onscreen another charles xavier xmens professor x but that would have required casting a much older woman in a very different sort of story the beginning of where this all went so disastrously wrong is right there sony didnt really want to make an authentic madame web movie it just wanted to wring whatever it could out of its sliver of marvel comics kerry bishé gives one of the best tv performances of all time in halt and catch fire especially as the show leans into its final season i really really wish she was getting better work venom ive never cared for personally but is definitely the most popular spiderman villain who was introduced since spideys classic era and has carried several solo miniseries and ongoing series it wasnt crazy to think he might carry a movie or two even morbius has had a long tradition of existence to marvel comics as well as the community at large he too has been a headliner at times albeit a blister at best not the craziest idea for a solo film among the spidercharacters sony has available though maybe 1015 years late to ride the twilight wave of vampire protagonists madame web has had something like 50 appearances over 40some years all as a supporting character and unsurprisingly for an elderly paralyzed woman in an actiondominated genre never a fan favorite the only thing that makes any sense to me is that they wanted to do a birds of prey knockoff with three minor spiderladies and madame web as the woman in the chair supporting them not too bad an idea actually but why they thought audiences would be excited about a nonviable prequel to the viable concept i dont understand i guess it makes sense as the same sort of hubris that led to universals dark universe and other attempts to artificially engineer the success of the mcu but youd think sony would have gotten the message about such attempts by now if i was in their shoes id just make a spiderwoman movie using whichever one of the halfdozen or more examples strike their fancy youre right about nyc having a plethora of spiderpeople spidergwenghost spider seems like a nobrainer to me as shes popular including with kids and has a great visual look that doesnt seem like a total copy of peter parkers suit im a completionist i tend to start series at the beginning rather than when it got good board game kickstarter absolutely saw me coming with its exclusive addons left alone id probably have got enthusiastically into the mcu in spite of not being much of a superhero fan but the more they said and you have to watch this side series and read that comic and the more i tried to do that and saw those side seriess interesting ideas being sunk under the weight of generic superhero stuff done on a tv series budget the less interested i became even in the core films a reference can be a neat line that makes sense in context which also gives a little dopamine hit to someone who knows where it came from or it can be something which brings the film to a halt while your attention is forced onto it so that you know you are missing out by not having watched more superheroes angsting and occasionally hitting things season 5 go home and stream it now whats funny to me is that at least in my perception the most recent batch of mcu movies and tv shows have actually been much less interconnected with the marvels for instance i think audiences will totally get kamala khans deal whether they saw ms marvel or not though it should encourage them to go back and watch it and you might logically think secret invasion would be required reading for the marvels but its completely not to the point that if you watched both youd be confused at how the show isnt acknowledged in any way whatsoever and i dont think you need to know much more than you know who the hulk is right from the avengers  works with captain america  jens his cousin to fully enjoy shehulk
Feb 25 2024,negative, but for an editorial swerve madame web could have been hamlet by which i mean cursed with a line that has the audience on such tenterhooks waiting for it they almost miss the rest in the end we dont actually get to hear the muchmocked quote from the trailer  ezekiel sims he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died  though we do get to see mom with him in the amazon while researching spiders right before she died  cassie webbs mum does then die in the amazon in 1973 after being bitten by a massive spider and then immediately giving birth to a baby oops i mean being bitten by a spider and then giving birth to a massive baby 30 years later cassie has grown into a grumpy paramedic with only one jacket though this is 2003 before fast fashion really hits she has a pet cat which is even bigger than she was as a baby a sweet apartment no one more junior than a plastic surgeon could now afford and excellent driving skills which also seem to have fallen by the wayside in the intervening 20 years  an unexpected dip in the river in a crashed car leaves her dead for several minutes and once reanimated blessedcursed with seeing the future though her immediate superpower seems to be the ability to pop balloons remotely while eating a sausage on a stick and well its not very cinematic but she could have made a fortune at kids birthday parties if shed just stuck to that  yes shark exorcist you retain your crown as worst film i have ever seen demonic nuns and all madame web is however bookended by scenes of such dreadful ridiculousness and such appalling acting that if you fell asleep into your popcorn in the middle you might indeed think it was a bona fide stinker even the middle bit while not terrible never reaches any great heights actually the whole film feels like a two hour pilot for a superhero series aimed at smallish children not much happens and what does happen we tend to see twice as a good chunk is cassie seeing the future then living through it in an attempt to stop it in greek mythology cassandra was cursed by apollo to see the future but for no one to believe her taking some time out to recover from the weird stuff that starts happening to her cassie starts having premonitions on a train soon realising they involve three disparate teenage girls she then has to save from the clutches of a scuttlesome ezekiel sims tahar rahim  the dialogue is often awful and the movie moves forward in fits starts and jerks like they suddenly realised they need to explain something or get us somewhere cassies trip to peru to reconnect with her dead mum is embarrassing like a wellness therapy minibreak sold to wealthy guardian readers though its not as embarrassing as ezekiel sims a villain who makes greta thunberg look like thanos crawling along ceilings and down walls he reminded me of those tiny sticky rubber figures  so beloved of british mums when tasked with filling 30 party bags for under a quid each  that walk head over heels down the window still while dakota johnson is miscast her style of acting just doesnt work when you have to believe in an alternate universe which generally seem more sincere than our own i came to quite enjoy her deadpan delivery of cassies general indifference to the world whether doing entirely normal things or literally saving someones life  the three young women shes trying to save from ezekiels blackspidersuited baddie  julia cornwall sydney sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced  all have an existing connection to cassie and are like the best teenagers both perfectly nice and also extremely annoying in this case mainly because they order a massive meal in a diner putting themselves in huge danger then dont bother to eat the food literally every woman i know could be dining on a sinking titanic in 1912 or picnicking on the sides of vesuvius in 79ad and would resolutely gobble up every last crumb before leaving so even in the weird world of superheroes thats jumping the shark exorcist 
Feb 25 2024,negative,imagine if you will a thriller without thrills a sisterhood movie without any chemistry between the vulnerable girls a comic book movie without laughs a superhero movie without heroes
Feb 24 2024,negative, sony and marvels latest entry in their shared spiderman cinematic universe has no better comparison than that of a rickety wooden coaster youd find at a familyowned amusement park brutal on the body and precariously constructed directed by sj clarkson and cowritten by claire parker and screenwriting duo matt sazama and burk sharpless madame web could only synthesize into its final state from the particular alchemy of sleepwalking producers drastic script rewrites and an obvious disinterest from the cast audiences are starting to feel belabored by the diminishing returns of superhero interconnected universes after a recent string of misfires and flops alas the machine must stay fed and sony executives seem eager to bleed their properties despite clear creative fatigue and mismanagement set in 2003 the film follows cassandra cassie webb dakota johnson an aloof manhattan paramedic who develops clairvoyant powers after a neardeath experience cassie seems to awaken to these visions and pulses of the future and learns she can connect to a sort of dimensional interconnected spiderworld thirty years earlier cassies pregnant mother gets betrayed and left for dead on an amazonian expedition by her bodyguard ezekiel sims tahar rahim who claims a fabled spider with healing properties for his own  simss physical capabilities are enhanced by the spider venom but hes perpetually haunted by visions of three spiderwomen who are fated to kill him in the future he orders his hacker and research assistant played by zosia mamet to track them down now as teenagers usually with his back turned to the camera and a hefty helping of adr soon teenagers mattie franklin celeste oconnor julia cornwall sydney sweeney and anya corazon isabela merced team up with a reluctant cassie in a bid to protect themselves and uncover what truly connects them despite sony going out of their way to establish the film as a suspense thriller in promotional pushes the only suspense madame web can muster between scenes is the tepid anticipation to see how the film will squeeze in yet another conspicuous pepsi advert it doesnt help that the cast is checked out beyond belief sweeney merced and oconnor are entirely unconvincing as a unit with lame jokes and putupon vulnerability suffocating the pleasure in the absurdity of the film its clear johnson would rather be anywhere else judging from the blase performance she turns in here  madame webs ludicrous logistical leaps dodgy visual effects and aloof performances are oftentimes primetime sobaditsgood junk food though it can be hard to have fun when every hit of ironic dopamine is sandwiched between uninteresting scenes of prolonged nothing pg13 116 min
Feb 24 2024,negative,ultimately everything just fell flat
Feb 23 2024,negative, unlike some many i havent grown weary of superhero films as a genre what i have grown exhausted by are specifically sonymade spiderverse movies that try to walk the line between standalone works while also incorporating just enough spiermanadjacent references to frustrate and infuriate viewers i wish the makers of madame web had simply stayed away from all things spiderman which is virtually impossible once you understand the full breadth of the story instead they drop in what they think are sly nods and easter eggs that are neither subtle nor clever much like the rest of the screenplay it took four people to write this the references are hamfisted and allaround sloppy and leave us with the promise of a better sequel that i can almost guaranteed you will never be made let me give an example the film is set very specifically in 2003 and theres a character named mary parker emma roberts who is probably eight months pregnant please feel free to do the math on who her baby is shes married to a man whom we never see whose brother is ben parker adam scott and who is really looking forward to being an uncle to this newbornall the fun none of the responsibility thats what he thinks and no i dont consider any of this spoiler territory because the character names are right there on imdb and scott is prominently featured in the trailers all of this nonsense is a tease that never pays off at one point theres a baby shower for mary during which the women in attendance have to guess the babys name the game is interrupted before the inevitable name drop so im thinking that reveal is coming at the end of the film which it probably was at one point but no there arent even any mid or postcredits scenes in madame web to tuck away such a choice nugget of webslinging joy but of course anything involving the parkers is shoehorned into the mostly unrelated story of cassandra webb dakota johnson whose mother kerry bishé was killed in the rainforests of peru while searching for a rare breed of spider whose venom might be the key to curing any number of diseases she is also very pregnant and in the company of security specialist ezekiel sims french actor tahar rahim most recently seen in napoleon who betrays her when she finds the spider and accidentally shoots her before absconding with the specimen but a tribe of locals with mysterious spiderlike powers and outfits that look a lot like spidermans duds if they were made on gilligans island show up to try and save her by injecting her with the aforementioned spider venom the mom dies but baby cassandra lives and is sent home to live out her years in new yorks foster care system cassandra grows up to become a paramedic alongside partner ben parker and after a neardeath experience in which she almost drowns she starts having visions of things that will happen in the immediate future things she can change if she does something different or gets someone else to change their behavior she sees herself and other people die and so she does all that she can to save everyone in her visions we also find out that ezekiel is a little more adept at seeing the future than using the spider venom repeatedly and he envisions three young women in various spiderthemed costumes and powers defeating him in a fight so he hires a computer expert zosia mamet to track them down so he can kill them ezekiel actually functions as a costumed individual who leaps and crawls and has the general acrobatic skills of a certain spiderman who wont actually exist for a couple of decades during the course of her daytoday happenings cassandra just happens to run into all three of these young women minus their powers around the city including a rich kid whose parents are never around julia cornwall sydney sweeney complete with schoolgirl outfit anya corazon isabela merced who has been living with her immigrant grandfather illegally in cassandras building and skater punk and general troublemaker mattie franklin celeste oconnor cassandara saves their lives when ezekiel attacks them on a train and they are basically stuck together for the rest of the film although the police seem to think cassandra has kidnapped them like many aspects of madame web its a running gag that never pays off as mentioned most of the film is about the potential for something cool that we never get the only time we see the three young women in their admittedly cool superhero costumes are in visions of the future were not even given their future superhero names for the record two of them are different incarnations of spiderwoman in the comic books while corazon goes by the name araña probably because they dont want to make fans mad that these are in any way spiderman related in broader terms firsttime feature director sj clarkson wants us seeing the madame web identity as someone who uses her powers to see the connections between people before the world makes them happen as the film goes on cassandra is able to see further into the future and make more sweeping changes and adjustments to the worldtocome that makes her immensely powerful and able to lead the team of young women to fight crime down the road presumably enhancing them with venom from this rare spider who the hell knows placing the parkers in close proximity to cassandra seems to serve no purpose at least not in this story but the implication is that somewhere down the line this powerful spider might be the reason that this universes peter gets his powers and not some radioactive arachnid again its all about teasing the potential without actually seeing it to any kind of satisfying conclusion and it makes the entirely of madame web frustrating in its best moments and downright infuriating in its worst i also realized while watching this movie is that while dakota johnson is fully capable of turning in great performances when given great material shes not quite capable of elevating mediocre material shes as bored and uninvested in her character and this movie as we are and it clearly shows madame web feels like it was chopped up and reassembled from another probably equally poor film and the

Feb 23 2024,neutral,this movie isnt bad it held my attention throughout but it is mediocre it lacks the kind of compelling action humor and drama of the better marvel movies
Feb 22 2024,negative,despite its amazing cast lineup from tonal confusion to a near laughable script there was not one single redeeming quality this film had to offer
Feb 22 2024,negative,  written by five writers including matt sazama and burk sharpless of the aforementioned morbius madame web operates in a similar vein in all the wrong ways its not part of the marvel cinematic universe instead merely being a cog in sonys live action spiderman without spidermanverse a halfhearted corporate character rightsbased attempt to expand the world of the webslinging spiderman  without him being around  by focusing on characters adjacent to him this time its cassandra webb gamely played by dakota johnson who is living in new york city in 2003 she works as a paramedic with the superhero genres most memorable modern uncle ben parker because of course she does while largely keeping to herself and her cat briefly played by a wasted adam scott before he vanishes almost entirely from the movie this movies uncle ben is the first of many bizarre and painfully hamfisted references to other better superhero stories and all of them land with dull thud after dull thud   the more selfcontained main narrative of madame web begins with cassandras mother who died giving birth to her after going out into the peruvian amazon in 1973 to research spiders believed to have healing properties the awkward line explaining this  which was in the trailer and endlessly skewered because of the stilted way it sounds  is merely the beginning of the movies unending and woefully poorly written dialogue much of this clunky verbiage is given to the otherwise solid actor tahar rahim who plays the films sad excuse for a villain ezekiel sims he delivers said lines while he tries to search out three teenagers that he believes will kill him in the future it then falls to cassandra to save them following an accident at work where she drowns and comes back to life  only to suddenly be able to see through time   while not the most imaginative of premises this sounds like it could be almost schlocky superhero fun on paper instead its a slog as the film goes through the same motions over and over again with no spark to any of it when cassandra begins to discover her power the way this is dragged out is more tiresome than thrilling though quite straightforward the film explains her powers to us multiple times demonstrating a severe lack of trust in its audience when cassandra then properly meets the three youths julia spokanes own sydney sweeney anya isabela merced and mattie celeste oconnor they feel like cardboard cutout characters with no chemistry this becomes increasingly perplexing as they get ditched multiple times making it feel like even the film doesnt know what to do with them the action they do get up to all feels empty  either brief or scattered cgi nonsense even a clumsy post911 surveillance angle feels wildly undercooked for all that it is supposedly gesturing toward   if there is one small saving grace it is johnson she has been great in films like the surprisingly stellar suspiria remake and the regrettably buried am i ok though this film doesnt even let her have fun with its powers one early scene at a baby shower sees her getting a laugh on delivery alone but that is soon forgotten in the mess to come even if you overlook some of the technical distractions  like entire lines of dialogue that have clearly been rerecorded and are not actually being spoken by the characters  paying attention does the experience no favors either while much has been made of the looming death of the superhero subgenre madame web is the film that truly feels like it may put the genre in its grave for a bit but like the films protagonist it will likely be resurrected again one just hopes it has more life than this 
Feb 22 2024,negative, the year is 2004 and you are 16 its the end of july so to escape the sweltering heat you and your friends see a movie at the mall the movie is catwoman starring halle berry but it could be anything all you want is to be in a place with air conditioning that isnt your house you and your friends spend so much on chips and salsa at the mall mexican joint and cheap jewelry at claires that you barely have enough wadded up cash from your summer job to cover the ticket in years to come youll have fond memories of those friends the virgin strawberry daiquiri you ordered and even the cheap jewelry you will remember nothing about the movie except that it was bad the year is 2024 and youre 35 its february and to avoid staring at the dead grass outside your window you go to the theater with friends the movie is madame web starring dakota johnson even though it should be something anything else maybe it was the only movie that worked with everyones schedules but like come on youre an adult you dont want to see poor things or american fiction  you and your friends have fulltime jobs so you can get drinks beforehand and even spring for popcorn at the theater as the film starts youre hit with a wave of nostalgia and it is decidedly mixed the movies effects are terrible the performances are flat the character motivations barely existent  and yet as you watch the flavors of restaurant salsa and syrupy mocktails flood your senses the phantom weight of a tigers eye energy bracelet rubs against your wrist  while the earlyadolescent memories madame web inspires are good the movie itself is undeniably a mess of the catwoman variety that the film is set in 2003 almost reads like an injoke because its whole vibe radiates the how do we make a superhero moviewhy are we even bothering ethos that defined comic book adaptations from 20002005  if youre looking for a nostalgic afternoon spent hooting at an incompetently made movie with your friends while you slam clearly canadians and cartons of hot tamales in the back row youre in for a treat in all other cases youre better off spending your time and money elsewhere madame web follows cassandra webb dakota johnson an emt in new york who grew up an orphan after her mom died while studying spiders in the amazon after a neardeath experience cassie gets visions that allow her to see a few moments into the future these visions bring her in contact with a trio of teens sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor who are each being targeted by a creep in a suit tahar rahim trying and failing to force an american accent it turns out rahims baddie ezekiel sims is the guy who killed cassies mom and made her an orphan hes after the girls because in the distant future theyll be superheroes with powers they currently dont possess but whatever and kill him the plot threads binding these story beats together are as delicate as an actual spiders web albeit woven by a drunk spider this is the kind of movie that repeats lines three different ways so that you cant miss the implications of what people are saying only to jump to a scene where a character drops a piece of exposition that makes no sense  characters behave in ways no normal human would at one point cassie decides she needs to go to peru to find herself and justgets there seconds later by now shes wanted for presumably kidnapping the teens in her care so how she managed to hop an international flight last minute during a historically heavy crackdown in airport security is beyond me you see where this is going madame web is bad movie podcast bad its makeyourownmst3k bad its also bored teenager with spending money bad which can be kind of fun if youre a a bored teenager or b a bored adult looking to replicate that experience but with all of the things you couldnt treat yourself to when you were a bored teenager 
Feb 21 2024,negative, theyll be laughing at this one for decades awkward sloppy staggeringly incoherent there is little evidence to suggest that anyone involved in madame web knew what they were doing the catastrophe extends all the way to the top of the queue dakota johnson struggling to hide her disinterest from the outset takes an inherently awful screenplay and somehow makes it worse sydney sweeney wears the look of a performer who forgot to learn her lines meanwhile tahar rahim the charismafree villain of this cackhanded superhero tale is forced to compete with some hideous postproduction interference the screen is fine the projector isnt broken and the speakers are correctly fixed  its just bad overdubbing like really really bad sony did not arrange an advance press show for critics  i can see why what you may ask is madame web comic enthusiasts will tell you shes a mutant clairvoyant a beloved staple of the marvel cannon and a helpful chum to your friendly neighbourhood spiderman for the uninitiated the cinematic version exists in some farflung corner of sonys socalled spiderman universe  which is to say that this bafflingly disorganised feature has nothing to do with the tom holland spidey pictures but it might be a distant cousin to the decrepit venom franchise or something it matters as much to me as it does to anyone else in this baggy bewildering film squint your eyes and  if youre lucky  you will just about make out the plot a preposterous epilogue introduces constance webb kerry bishé a poorly sketched scientist researching spiders in the peruvian amazon the year is 1973 and a pregnant constance is obsessed with rare arachnids and their alleged healing powers why exactly were not entirely sure  but everything goes sideways after constances moustachioed explorer pal ezekiel sims rahim shoots her in the chest steals her magic spider jar and leaves her for dead luckily for constance the magical amazon spider people show up stop giggling down the back to save the baby fastforward 30 years and cassie webb johnson is all grownup our moody protagonist knows very little about her mum and why she died chasing spiders in the jungle cassie isnt really a people person but hey shes a new york paramedic  a reallife superhero without the stupid costume her one and only friend at work adam scotts ben parker thinks theres more to cassie than meets the eye and he might be right across town meanwhile the slippery mr sims appears to have used his magical spider power to acquire a vast fortune alas our grumpy baddie is haunted by nightly visions of his own death sims it appears will die at the hands of three spiderwomen and so he makes it his mission to find them before they find him what he doesnt count on however is a stranger messing with his plan and following a neardeath experience on the job cassie acquires powers of her own she can see into the future which means she knows exactly whats going to happen to the aforementioned spiderwomen sydney sweeney celeste oconnor and isabela merced id love to tell you more but i might die of boredom some marvel fans might appreciate the ben parker subplot mr scott is essentially playing a younger sexier uncle ben from the spiderman flicks however the inclusion of a story in which ben and cassie attend a baby shower for the unborn peter parker ranks among the stupidest moves in comic book film history spare a thought for sj clarkson the british filmmaker tasked with managing this sorry pitiful exercise in blockbuster entertainment her film boasts no less than five screenwriter credits always a troubling sign and occasionally looks and sounds as if it is being edited in front of us the relentless product placement is hilarious three cheers for pepsi the films fizziest costar the action sequences are useless the dialogue is all over the place and the grainy special effects appear unfinished its an ugly toneless film a superhero feature without charm without humour without spectacle it seems unfair to point the finger at its leading woman  but johnson is genuinely appalling she looks fed up here and guess what i know the feeling a film so bad it would almost put you off going to the cinema
Feb 21 2024,negative, madame web is the third entry into a spidermanless cinematic universe made up entirely of spiderman characters and the returns keep diminishing for all of the goodwill that tom hardys inspired performance as venom created morbius poisoned sonys efforts irreparably when the madame web trailer debuted the mood around the film soured to mockery you know the line when julia sydney sweeney asks cassie dakota johnson about a man in a polaroid cassie replies he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died fortunately madame web isnt the train wreck that morbius was but it is not an improvement either exposition replaces dialogue franchiseseeding takes precedence over making characters authentic and the action is underwhelming part of that may be by design a lower budget means less spectacle and less spectacle helps madame web feel different from every other marvel release that works in the films favour as the stakes are relatively low after a decade where every superhero climax means the end of the world the survival of three women feels refreshingly lowkeyeven if those three women are future superheroes paramedic cassie webb survives an accident that leaves her with newfound powers the ability to see forward in time cassie wastes no time in exploring her time loop gift and establishing a quick formula fail hilariously quip and try again for that reason the time loop subgenre is popular to revisit whether the loops are about bill murray trying to be nice groundhog day andy samberg and cristin milioti surviving a wedding palm springs or tom cruise trying to survive at all edge of tomorrow the results are usually a hit with viewers madame web risks threatening that streak the plot thin as it is doesnt hold up to scrutiny cassie abandons her job with fellow emt ben adam scott using the time she has to unite sweeneys spiderwoman isabela merceds arana and celeste oconnor as another spiderwoman the only problem they arent those heroes yet and they dont see cassie as anything more than an overworked ambulance driver as cassie fights to keep these future spider heroes alive antagonist ezekiel sims a criminally wasted tahar rahim hunts them down hoping to prevent a timeline where they kill him but with duelling timeloopers wouldnt they fight each other for eternity such is the problem with the sudden influx of multiverses and timetraveling heroes superhero fatigue is in high gear but thats not why films like morbius and madame web do poorly if a story succeeds on its own merits the status of a shared cinematic universe is irrelevant even with the dceus problems people went to see the batman in droves rushed stories cash a quick buck on marvels popularity but word spreads fast when people dunk on the movie all weekend on social media the with great power quote that we all know is tweaked to something clumsier in the studiomandated way of giving people the same thing but slightly warmed over with a new ingredient no one wanted the line drew a laugh from the audience however i dont want readers to walk away thinking nothing in madame web works the practical suits are a nice touch though its hard to ignore that the women wearing them are likely the reason behind the choice sydney sweeney of euphoria fame is a gifted performer watch reality but none of that is why shes featured on a onesheet in skintight spandex its a lazy ploy but one that will sell tickets  as endearing cast as the cast is they can only do so much with the material the film relies on the vibes of johnson sweeney and adam scott yet theyre constantly bogged down with ridiculous exposition and running away from garish cgi then theres the impractical camera work sudden zooms work in succession because they reveal a tic or reaction from characters as developments inform a scene it acts as visual whiplash during most of madame web tearing attention away from dialogue that already sets your mind to wander the characters arent defined particularly well not even johnsons protagonist cassie is our in for the story but theres nothing special that binds you to her plight scenes of the four women hanging out are satisfying but only because they derive from the kinship of the actresses charisma watching the group sing karaoke along to britney spears toxic is a highlight but again not because of anything the script brings sj clarkson who directed episodes of several notable tv shows handles the reins making the most of the limited budget but the script by morbius writers matt sazama and burk sharpless is lifeless sonys universallybeloved animated spiderverse is one of the best things going on in movies tom hollands run as the mcus spiderman is equally popular so why is the liveaction villain universe in such disarray the venom franchise succeeds because tom hardy leans into its bmovie sensibilities whenever possible madame web has no direction and without direction all you can expect is flailing in a year where dc and marvel have two film releases pending sony is putting out three comic book films sony should stop diluting their shared spiderman universe but with kraven the hunter coming in august and venom 3 in november the corporate churn continues partially because sony releases these films to keep ownership of the spiderman film rights from going back to marvel all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not my mother a hole in the ground and men in this unboxing video jason gorber checks out the joni mitchell archives volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release
Feb 21 2024,negative, by  charles pulliammoore a reporter focusing on film tv and pop culture before the verge he wrote about comic books labor race and more at io9 and gizmodo for almost five years the funny thing about watching audiences cool off from bigbudget comic book adaptations in recent years is how if you lived through the very early aughts it almost feels like things are going back to the way they used to be after years of marvel tentpoles dominating the box office its been easy to forget how unabashedly unserious these kinds of projects usually were outside of the handful that put the genre on the map  but before the rise of the mcu bad comic book movies  projects that didnt take themselves or their source material all that seriously  were generally the rule rather than the exception and while they might not have been great they were the sort of films audiences knew how to have fun with its only since multiverses became the hot new thing in hollywood that studios have gotten comfortable even acknowledging and capitalizing on peoples nostalgia for those halcyon days when spidermans webbing was organic but unlike some of sonys other recent spiderman features which have been more focused on bringing specific characters and actors back from past franchises director s j clarksons madame web is far more interested in revisiting a specific moment in comic book movie history  one defined by iffy costumes perplexing plots and a palpable sense of onscreen embarrassment set in a curious pocket of sonys larger spiderverse of films where its still 2003 and spiderman himself doesnt exist madame web tells the tale of cassandra webb dakota johnson an acerbic paramedic whose life takes a series of strange turns one day when she briefly dies while saving a mans life as an adult orphan whose mother died in the amazon while researching spiders cassandra has a hard time connecting emotionally with anyone who isnt her colleague ben parker adam scott or the stray cat that regularly wanders into her new york city walkup  but after a routine emergency rescue leads to cassie plummeting to her death she awakens to find herself imbued with an illdefined set of precognitive powers and while she has no idea what to make of her alarming visions it soon becomes clear that theyre all guiding her toward a trio of young girls disorienting exposition dumps in a films opening act are almost always a warning sign but the way madame web clunkily juxtaposes a flashback to cassandras past with glimpses into her charges futures almost makes it feel as if the filmmakers are trying to keep you from understanding whats going on though his motivations are unclear its simple enough to grasp in madame webs first few minutes that perpetually barefoot explorer ezekiel sims tahar rahim is eager to kill three masked women wearing spiderthemed superhero costumes its clear madame web wants you to wonder who sims targets are and why they dont just use their powers to stop him in his tracks  but instead of teasing their identities out the movie just dumps julia cornwall sydney sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced into cassandras lap about half an hour in at a point when there are already too many other things going on  sonys plan to build out an entire cinematic universe on just the spiderman ip alone has always felt a bit dubious but in madame webs younger leads you can almost see how the plan could work similar to cassandra the girls have all been orphaned at least emotionally and they need someone to guide them through the madness of being teenagers  you can also see how the girls thinly fleshedout personality quirks might one day make them an interesting team of spiderwomen and how madame webs really a story about cassandra stepping into her role as a mentor to a quippy new generation of heroes but as present as that narrative intention is the film doesnt really set its characters up to feel like real players in a cohesive story and the girls wind up being pushed into the background  first as theyre introduced as outoffocus extras in the periphery of cassandras story and later as she takes the girls under her wing to protect them from sims by ditching them in the woods between its frantic set pieces in which the camera lens can never seem to decide where it wants to focus and the way madame webs script briskly bounces between scenes its obvious that the filmmakers are trying to make you feel some of the deep discombobulation cassandra herself is experiencing even though the execution is more than a little off its a clever idea and to the movies credit cassandras visions of being murdered by a knockoff spiderman are pointedly disturbing but as much time as madame web spends telling you that cassandras terrified for her and the girls lives youd be hard pressed to get that impression from johnsons deadpan performance and the way she portrays her character as someone who approaches most situations with a pronounced sense of apathy when you look at madame web as a modern comic book movie  one crafted with the knowledge of how much money these things can make  its hard to understand a lot of the choices that were made but the film makes a hell of a lot more sense when you think of it not just as a movie set in 2003 but one thats trying to evoke the vibes of comic book movies from that era the signs are there pretty much from the jump but it isnt until misteeqs scandalous is dropped in during an action sequence that it becomes shockingly obvious how much madame web has in common with the 2004 catwoman starring halle berry in terms of both films feeling like doomed misfires from the very beginning rather than any of sonys previous spiderman spinoff films the confusing way madame web reworks julia mattie and anyas origins makes the movie play much more like something out of the era that gave us the first daredevil movie and fantastic four rise of the silver surfer people like to look back on that point in superhero movie history fondly now because enough time has passed for those films to shift into cult classic territory but the simple truth is that for quite a while big budget cape projects missed as often as they hit and with madame web technically being a followup to morbius and a precursor to kraven the hunter its fair to say that sonys definitely returned to that time
Feb 21 2024,positive, one of the skewed ironies of the 2010s superhero movie era is that sonys spiderman spinoffs were greenlit out of a mercenary desire by sony to craft their own cinematic universe and yet exist as among the most explicitly standalone cape flicks of their time sj clarksons madame web is a period piece set in 2003 that was supposed to be more closely tied to the andrew garfield or tom holland spiderman franchise until someone realized the math didnt math rather than go the texas chainsaw 3d route of hoping nobody notices or cares about timeline discrepancies the film hides its broader continuity connections to an almost comical degree it also has no illusions of pretension operating as a wantonly silly and openly comic fantasy closer to the dead zone meets the terminator than a conventional fourcolor actioner its also okay its not good but itd be an enjoyable romp if tickets still cost 5 on a saturday afternoon  id never considered the connection between americas obsession with nationalglobal security post911 and its connection to superhero fandomsomething to ponder despite the negative reviews im still excited to see this one 
Feb 21 2024,negative, by walter chaw sj clarksons madame web is a rare and specific variety of disaster which is interesting because its largely centred around a rare and specific variety of spider that is to say not interesting so much as unintentionally ironic or something rain on your wedding day 10000 spoons when all you need is a knife you know the massappealing notesdriven for dummies notentirelyaccurate popcultural definition of a literary conceit this reminds me of the swoony heartthrob moment where ethan hawke defines irony perfectly in reality bites i dont actually remember what he says though because i havent seen that movie since its 1994 releaseabout ten years before the events of madame web the screen debut of marvel mutant cassandra webb dakota johnson whos named after the greek archetype who can see the future but no one listens to her and marc webb director of the andrew garfield spiderman movies just kidding shes named webb because spiders spin them with an extra b to throw you off the trail but not so violently that you dont know its fucking with you madame web one b because the picture is more invested in making sure you know its related to the lucrative spiderman franchise than in being such a tedious asshole opens in 1973 with cassandras superpregnant mom constance kerry bishé tromping around the south american rainforest like sean connery in medicine man in search of a superspider whenokay thats enough of that anyway 30 years later cassandra is a paramedic who can sometimes see the future but nobody believes her you might have deduced that by her name is all im saying madame web is on one level a powerpuff girls hangout flick on another level its that party where you met a girl who was so much sharper than you that you could never entirely figure out when and how she was castrating you although it was constant and brutal and you learned maybe you were into the humiliation thing but she got bored and now youre writing about her 30 years later every dakota johnson linereading in this film is a ballsshrivelling memeinthemaking fusillade of icecold patronizing derision she is a human wrecking ball of unusual precision theres a scene at the midway point of madame web where cassandra reads her dead mothers journal peptides more peptides ah here it is spiderpeople las araňas then to her cat she says have you ever heard of los araňas me neither she pronounces las araňas like that one remote anchor on your local news broadcast doeslike you might if you were being a relentless sonofabitch working something out of your front teeth as you carefully savoured each syllable for maximum im pronouncing this eleventhgrade honoursspanish correctly whats your problem she reads on to discover that they can move around like spiders these las araňas and her deep blue eyes registering the shock she is not shocked of understanding she already understands she looks offscreen left and stagewhispers like ceiling guy shes referring to the villain of madame web ezekiel sims frenchalgerian actor tahar rahim who appears to her in visions walking on the ceiling the way she says it makes my scrotum retract all the way up into my body cavity ive been spoken to that way before and those bits dont grow back my friends dakota johnson knows this scene is ridiculous she knows it is housed in a ridiculous film she is smarter than her own character of course but she is also smarter than anyone who worked on madame web and most of the people watching it including me comprising the movies macguffin are three young women sydney sweeney isabela merced celeste oconnor cassandra must protect from ezekiel she does this by catching glimpses of them being brutally murdered in a changeable future then changing the future better might have been her sitting in a recliner opposite ezekiel in a nice conversation nook and ripping his selfesteem out of his nose like a pharaohs mortician armed with a bent wire made of archedbrow cremaster and silkengarrote condescension later sweeneys julia cornwall looks at a picture of cassandras mom and says shes really pretty and johnson offers the kind of thinlipped smile that shuts down bars ive experienced performances like this before generally by people like joan crawford or bette davis in the last few steps of their career when they were cast as psychobiddies in poverty productions performances that are not performances performances that are measured in the recoil of every other celestial body in the vicinity from the gravity tides produced by the massive egodensity of artists who have accumulated so much inertial confidence throughout their lives and careers that they are more impenetrable than black holes dakota johnson is as different from you as you are from a starfish there is nothing the same about how you were raised and thus how you understand and experience the world i want to be a satellite in her orbit just to observe her and occasionally squeal oh no she didnt when she cuts someone off at the knees with the effort a sociopathic child exerts ripping wings off a fly i want to be the carl sagan to her cosmos
Feb 21 2024,negative, madame web is about a paramedic cassie webb dakota johnson who receives semipsychic powers which are sometimey and not under her control the scenes having to do with cassies visions are confusing to say the very least since they barge into the narrative with no preparation or context theyre also edited as incoherently as every other action scene is here the gist of the story is that cassie whose dead mom was trying to find a special spider in peru must protect three teenage girls sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor who are in danger from the movies big bad tahar rahim who has his own future visions in which he sees the girls in superhero costumes killing him thus does the movie spoil its own ending about twenty minutes in  enjoy that glimpse of the girls in their spiderwoman costumes  for that is their destiny to be spiderwomen as this film is spidermanadjacent  in that early vision and right at the end because thats all you get in this supposed superhero movie most of it is a matter of cassie and the girls running from the big bad except for when cassie pointlessly goes to peru to find out her mom who died while giving birth to her was looking for that special spider so she could cure the disease she knew cassie would be born with the sequence seems about as useless as the scenes having to do with ben parker adam scott a fellow paramedic and his pregnant sister mary emma roberts who will give birth the movie hints to peter parker aka the spiderman most of us know this movie isnt really for a viewer who has never seen a spiderman film before but neither is it for those who have seen every spiderman film or even one the screen is loaded with actors visibly wishing they were anywhere else most certainly including the dullaffect dakota johnson who narrowly loses the calgon take me away contest to zosia mamet as the big bads hacker boredlooking mamet sits at her monitor watching for the girls and delivering pearls like i think i got them the saddestfunniest aspect of the whole ordeal though is that it seems convinced its the first of many adventures with this quartet  the three superpowered girls commandedprotected by cassie there will be no such sequels we will never see these characters again there will be no great future stories with madame web or cassie webb or jack webb for that matter so the ending is one of those the end nay  the beginning conclusions meant to make us thirst for more when what were craving at that point is simple fresh air or something stronger madame web was directed by sj clarkson who also gets official screenwriting blame along with three others and i suppose weve reached the point where women can make superhero movies as empty and unsatisfying as men can clarkson has been a prolific tv director and i hope this film whose problems are probably most accurately pinned on an insecure studios meddling doesnt squash her career tahar rahim too is a better actor than this movie which destroys his performance with that poor dubbing would indicate nobody comes out of madame web looking good except maybe kerry bishé who as cassies illstarred mother at least gets in and out fast everyone else has to pull on hipwaders and slosh through this sewage until the finish 
Feb 21 2024,negative, this week kevin kicks things off with a look at the box office and offers his thoughts on the gina carano lawsuit against disney then he looks at new trailers for deadpool 3 and wicked later he reviews madame web the oscarnominated short films the watcher in the woods and a special valentines day tribute finally he wraps things up with a fresh look at the marvels for the homecinema roundup
Feb 21 2024,positive, there are also some really unique genre pictures like the book of clarence some very sound family fare like orion and the dark and a movie where jason statham plays an action hero called a beekeeper trying to turn madame web into the next laughaminute disaster midnight movie was bound to happen we live in a postmeme society one where any film thats distinctly flawed but still showing signs of real personality gets shoved into a joke box that labels it this weeks worst movie of all time its an exhaustive discourse as the morbin time effect that doomed madame web before it really had a chance its a shame really because despite its clear faults the dakota johnsonled spinoff is really one of the more fascinating marvel movies in some time morbius was truly awful this is not that cut from a very particular cloth of risky 2000s comic book movies that likely fell victim to studio meddling madame web feels haphazard and melodramatic in an oddly refreshing way its not really a superhero origin story as much as it is a bgrade scifi thriller and its efforts to canonize its setting into some sort of marvel future feel so delightfully lifeless and unwilling like someone dragging their resistant 8yearold to a piano lesson the film on purpose or on accident shows you how contrived the continuous shared universe mentality is and it has some perhaps unintended but still present and effective fun with that in a very nonmeta way dont necessarily mistake its mistakes for mistakes well argue kevin feige built the mcu to absolutely avoid movies like this ones that can fly off the rail at any given moment because of strange decisions and potentially offputting weirdness due to the unholy blend of unwieldy creative vision careless studio interference and michael bayapproved obviousness of product placement this movie is his worst marvel nightmare bizarre springs eternal with madame web and thats kind of nice to have something so baffling in execution and lacking in uniformity sport the marvel logo its not entirely successful but theres not much else like it besides the venom movies its also got a surprisingly wry sense of humor as johnson and sj clarkson mine the corniness of the plot and the very relatable annoyed millennial unsuccessfully trying to relate to sarcastic gen z kids dynamics in 2003 sure but it still hits johnson is really quite impressive here as shes wholly aware of what kind of movie shes in and how ridiculous some of it is like a pro she still powers through it by selling the drama in some really shaky dialogue and nailing the punch lines even when theyre not necessarily there some of this movie is dinged from the delivery process but its actually decently intact if anything this is really better than most of the recent mcu movies madame web might be really messy and occasionally encourage the wrong kind of audience participation but if you go in willing to meet it on its wavelength you might be surprised by how nice it is to watch one of these movies not necessarily know where its going or why its doing what it is thats the joy of risks they dont always pay off but they rarely fail without genuine entertainment value people will say plenty about this movie but they cannot call it boring the first half is pretty excellent even if it starts to get a little lost in the sauce with the metanarrativehowever the animation is splendid and most of the script and voice cast are very wellconsidered its uppertier dreamworks but it doesnt quite have the conceptual cohesion of something like inside out as great as kaufman working in this space is this is exactly what it should be a rare example of the schlocky bgrade action movie that strives to be more than a temporary meme soon lost to time david ayer cuts down the unnecessary plotting and keeps this humming along at an enjoyable clip and jason statham understands the proper frequency here as well as any actor could its wildly fun in stretches and being rough around the edges in a good expendables movie way is more than forgivable id watch more beekeepers josh hutcherson is a great jerk this is the kind of movie that would do great business on home video and develop a very loyal cult following and in like 10 years would be regarded as a very savvy genre picture that the youths of the time understood more than the folks who didnt really get on its level alas thats not the world were in anymore but i sure hope this one finds a second life on streaming because it really is a shame we get a proper successor to the 80s90s movies like heathers the lost boys the 1990s addams family movies and edward scissorhands that doesnt immediately find its audience its a movie made by someone who clearly loves the irreverence and aesthetics of tim burton the oblong austerity of barry sonnenfeld the wacky studio comedy vibes of penelope spheeris and the buoyant campiness of joel schumacher plenty of joe dante the burbs vibes in there too maybe this will take off on netflix or peacock or something its a good movie and deserved more than what it got being dumped in february with little fanfare kathryn newton liza soberano and cole sprouse are all aces jeymes samuel walks a tight rope here between satire and earnest heart and he does so marvelously hes such a confident artist radiant and grand in the way he envisions his stories and very deft to the touch with the emotions hes got an old soul for the old hollywood scope and booming score that sweeps you off your feet there is a real dedication present to genre homage while twisting it around to meet his forwardthinking vision its pretty marvelous what he pulls off here maybe not quite as tight as the harder they fall but just as impressive giddy and resonant samuel is a special filmmaker and this is a very good film that deserved so much more than badfaith readings and to be dumped in january on a crowded weekend its a definite step down from the insane heights of the first film but its still so much fun and so much more engaging than most of the superhero films made these days its a shame this will be it for the dceu if only because youd rather have unwieldy variance with real risk hello madame web involved instead of more sameness james wan really did everything he could here to craft a rollicking adventure out of production issues that show the seams in the edit this really reminded me of a less polished version of black panther wakanda forever lacking the gravitas but making up for it in pure chummy enjoyment that has to count for something right im sad to see jason momoas time as aquaman end he was just perfect for the part but im glad he got one last chance to flex his joy in playing the role even if the vehicle is a bit more dinged up than before also the sunken ship underworld is yet another huge example of why wan needs to do a star war no director right now would be a better fit id bet 5 the pitch for this movie was vacation  but with ducks on migration  but also finding nemo  on the quality level of the secret life of pets and the entire room stood in applause its okay illumination is incapable of making anything but the same perfectly fine riskaverse family film over and over and over again which means you always leave reasonably satisfied but wholly static they clearly just want to be blue sky with minions instead of scrat and more power to them theyll probably never make a great movie but theyll make plenty decent enough ones 34star movies for days this was weirdly the secondbest animated film released in december 2023 about talking birds who must escape evil humans who want to cook them and serve them to consumers its also got the secondbest mike white movie script involving the word orange go figure
Feb 20 2024,negative, just like a bug infestation superhero movies cant be stamped out madame web is the latest attempt by a major studio to assure us that this genre is alive and well surely there are still a few good movies left to be culled from the endless cosmology of comic books this one has some lively directing and sensible casting entrapped in the webbing of an oddly stripped script director sj clarkson is making her feature debut and genuinely tries to focus on a psychological angle while trying to deliver what sony wants namely a costumed action fest linked to the spiderman franchise the final result feels like a stretched out prologue with dakota johnson putting in effort to prove she wants to be in it many reviewers tend to compare a movie like this to 90s superhero duds but here is another example of how that style carries on it opens in a steamy jungle where researcher constance kerry bishé is bitten by a mysterious spider and encounters slinging people known as the araña spanish for spider constance dies but it turns out she was pregnant in 2003 her grown daughter cassandra cassie webb johnson now works as a new york city paramedic shes been an orphan who likes the idea of staying single and not having children she is also starting to get plagued by sudden visions into the near and distant future meanwhile on the other side of town the very rich ezekiel sims tahar rahim beds society women he meets at the opera but is rattled by nightmares of three girls in spider costumes who kill him he soon tracks them down to the same subway train they are julia cornwall sydney sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced luckily cassie happens to cross paths with them in time to help them fend off ezekiel it is a chaotic time in film when it comes to length mcu movies are famously stretched out yet madame web at 1 hour and 57 minutes feels like a lot of answers or essential plot points were cut out how are ezekiels three targets all conveniently on the same train why do they need to cross paths with cassie randomly before she uses clairvoyance to find them anyway why does ezekiel have a master hacker amaria zosia mamet who disappears halfway through the movie factory products of this sort are hard to blame on one sole person the screenplay by matt sazama and burk sharpless who also penned 2022s infamously bad morbius is another take on a spiderverse character reportedly this was meant to be a 90s nostalgia trip but for some reason was pushed into the early aughts which accounts for the cranberries needle drops combined with shots of billboards for beyoncés dangerously in love album  but there are some intriguing efforts present from the director sj clarkson tries to avoid depending too much on big cgi effects or overcooked action scenes i was engaged by the idea of clairvoyance and how cinematically that can be seen clarkson recently told entertainment voice i was captivated by the idea of someone who uses their mind that felt like an opportunity to do something different and lean into psychological storytelling these stories tend to be about people overcoming something some of the better scenes are the ones where cassie attends a friends baby shower and is rudely interrupted by visions into the future or moments where she nearly avoids a car wreck thanks to her gift as the movie continues the inventiveness of the premise fights with the gimmick becoming a kind of inner trailer for what we assume is a sequel for example a lot of ads have shown julia mattie and anya in spider hero costumes forming a new team but thats not part of this movie its just cassies vision into what these girls will turn into in the future meaning the future movie were expected to anticipate then there is dakota johnson already outshining the movie with her recent media appearances discussing the project with open irony shes a gifted actor who has brought sincerity to schlock before as in fifty shades of grey her approach to madame web is to bask in the absurdity and look very committed when discussing how her mom was bitten by a magic spider in the amazon or looking annoyed when babysitting her rowdy high schooler companions she looks as if shes in on the joke with us when she appears in the final scenes decked in a wheelchair and dark shades fully transformed into the title character her final grin seems to say im a famous actor hired to play a marvel character why not everyone else is on autopilot including sydney sweeney who gets turned into a shy nerdy schoolgirl twin of her euphoria character tahar rahim is beyond generic as the villain who looks like those business majors who spend every evening or crack of dawn at the gym speeding off in a sports car to change into a costume similar to spidermans except hes evil his grand finale is appropriately bland it really just takes a falling neon sign to take out this kind of jerk its easy to see in madame web potential in a director who can do strong thrillers or noirs moving forward and johnson for a later shot at true costumed popcorn glory this is not a wreck on the scale of something like cats or morbius instead its a movie that just doesnt know what to do with the story if sony and marvel simply focus on making a good film as opposed to obsessively setting up new franchise chains then we can have fun escapism that at least makes sense madame web tries to stay grounded while being absurd showcasing actors doing the best they can with a genre that is quickly gathering cobwebs and needs some decent sweeping before starting again
Feb 20 2024,negative, the proper metaphor to describe a film such as sonys latest liveaction spiderverse installment madame web is a building with excessive permit issues that got approved anyway coming off the rather lukewarm reception to 2022s morbius the studio has elected to press on with an assortment of standalone spiderman adjacent character films that is building to something superhero films are in a state of figuring out their identity and their place in a box office that is asking more of them  theres no use belaboring that point if theres a primary failure in speaking about madame web it feels like a film meant for another genre formatted to fit this universe that needs characters to power its machine 2019s joker used martin scorseses 1976 taxi driver and 1982 the king of comedy as obvious templates in which it anchors its world it just so happened that joaquin phoenixs performance and just the right amount of comic book lore were able to push it into something interesting in essence madame web is primarily a smalllevel slasher film that happens to have spider people in it with one person in particular trying to figure out their power set the peter parker of it all feels like a forbidden word evident to the audience and something the film tries to play coy with it reverses the aforementioned with great power comes great responsibility line the characters themselves fit a specific archetype other than exhibiting something outside of that and most of the narrative is spent running away from a relentless villain with an absurd power set before even discussing the plot itself you can see there are way too many masters including a lot of product placement being served in lieu of trying to do something different set in 2003 cassandra cassie webb dakota johnson works as a paramedic in new york and is a bit of a loner outside of a friendship with her fellow emt ben parker adam scott much of cassandras adverseness to the family has an origin that happened years prior in 1973 her mother constance kerry bishé had traveled to the peruvian amazon to search for a rare spider species containing healing qualities protected by an indigenous tribe called the las arañas there is only one issue and it lies in her thengreedy partner ezekiel sims tahar rahim who wants all the power for himself a scuffle ensues and he accidentally shoots constance while shes pregnant with cassie before constances death theres a ceremony in which cassie is birthed and bitten by the special arachnid one day on the job cassie gets into an accident and nearly dies with this she vaguely discovers that she can see into the future it takes much of the film for this power to develop fully and even then its a bit hazy ezekiel also has the same ability as others that you would deduce from spiderman lore super strength crawling on walls and apparent neurotoxin along with immense wealth a hacker named aramia zosia mamet has nsa surveillance tools ezekiel has one mission in mind hes plagued with these visions of three spiderwomen that may kill him one day thus he has to t1000 it up to stop that from happening director s j clarkson and cowriters matt sazama burk sharpless and claire parker set the stage for a plot that wants to be put into anything else but this spiderverse any overtures to costumes and possible actions that would nail ezekiels fears in reality must be believed while madame web looks to convey that hes this unstoppable killing machine the extremely noticeable differences with rahims adr make his character more laughable more often than not with cassandra somewhat getting a handle on her foresight she sees that she has to assist three teenagers the nerdy and awkward julia sydney sweeney the intelligent anya isabela merced and the iwontdowhatyoutellme flip off an ambulance mattie celeste oconnor the teens behave the way youd expect them to  because films like these dont expect a group of young people to think rationally cassie gets tired of playing the caretaker role quickly as punctuated by johnsons nosell performance sweeney merced and oconnor cling tightly to what their given personality is supposed to be and rarely if at all move away from that in the end the four bond over being directionless  coming from backgrounds where their parents are either deceased nonexistent or taken away by other circumstances in that regard a little piece of camaraderie peaks over many fragmented set pieces linked together by the repeated use of vehicles as weapons sony has presented a superhero that can see into the future inside a film that feels like a prequel and assumed its earned the trust of its audience to bet on another story without earning it

fans our version the dynamic duel no prize is a digital award we post on instagram for the person that we feel gave the best answer to our question of the week 0410last weeks question we asked what has been your favorite deadpool joke out of all of deadpool media and that was coming off of the deadpool and wolverine trailer that we got during the super bowl we got four answers so well break down this weeks honorable mentions before revealing the no prize winner our first honorable mention goes to clayton demato who said hey there guys my name is clayton demato long time listener as someone who enjoys to have his balls fondled 0538cornelius robinson who said hey guys this is cornelius robinson and my favorite joke from the deadpool media is through the movies when he mentioned that nickassan and teenage warhead and clauses were in a big house living together all alone and it was funny how it was almost the studio didnt have any more money for new xmen members which was a meta joke and was returned in the sequel 0607and it cracked me up yeah that was a little bit of selfdeprecating humor on behalf of the studio great joke with deadpool referencing how only negasonic teenage warhead and colossus seem to be at the xmen mansion all the time i really did love the followup in deadpool 2 when we saw the cast of xmen dark phoenix in one of the classrooms like basically hiding from deadpool so good it did make me wonder where in the timeline the second deadpool movie fit but yeah it was a great gag 0635it was a meta joke it doesnt necessarily have to be scrutinized in the larger continuity sure sure i get that but great answer cornelius our final honorable mention goes to travis herndon who said hey guys travis here so my favorite joke would have to be from the deadpool 2 teaser where hes changing into his superhero costume mostly just from the realism from it like we all think wed be these badass superheroes and stuff though but lets be honest with me 0702would take that long just to get into our superhero costume and possibly get the same outcome like in the teaser so thats my favorite joke just from the realism for me as well as just the superman theme too yeah im not sure how many people remember the teaser trailer to deadpool 2 it was played in front of the logan movie it was essentially 0722wade wilson walking down and seeing an old man getting mugged in an alley and he runs into a phone booth to change into his deadpool costume and it just takes entirely way too long thats the joke it takes him like two minutes just to change into his deadpool costume and in the meantime before he can even get out of the phone booth we hear the old man get shot great gag a hilarious way to kick off the marketing for deadpool 2 i had almost completely forgot about this teaser until travis brought it up again 0818spiderman is trying to warn deadpool of taskmasters booby traps and deadpool goes ha ha traps because im expecting him to say to be laughing at boobies but its simple and catches me off guard yeah and another classic deadpool style joke where again it mixes the juvenile with the clever in the ultimate spiderman cartoon spiderman 0843and deadpool teamed up against taskmaster and it was a nice bit of subversion where you think that deadpool upon hearing the phrase booby traps is going to laugh at booby but of course he laughs at traps hes like you said traps it was a great gag i never saw the ultimate spiderman cartoon i didnt even know deadpool was in that he seems like a risky character for a cartoon but yeah solid joke well the nice thing about deadpool is that you can make him as pg or rated r as you want to and it just kind of works as long as hes quirky and funny itll still feel like him 0912do you have a favorite deadpool joke i really like the dig at dc that he did in deadpool 2 where hes like so dark are you sure youre not from the dc universe that was quality this is fucking worst joke no but like i would say mine is in sort of the same scene hes introduced to black tom cassidy and he was like hi white wade wilson and then later on he was just like you killed black tom cassidy you racist i was cracking up yeah 0942i also really liked the juggernaut song though like that one stick with me for a while holy shit balls yeah that was great yeah deadpools humor is actually really solid and it makes me really excited to see deadpool and wolverine coming out the summer so congrats again to sean curtis for winning this weeks no prize if you the listener want a shot at winning your own no prize stay tuned to later on this episode when well be asking another question of the week and now that thats done on to the news 1042get that news from the studio itself its shaping up to be a great cast really cant wait to see them as marvels first family and out of all the cast that the fantastic four franchise has had so far in live action this one actually seems the most interesting to me yeah it is interesting i think its a great cast the logo is what i found most interesting like it almost makes me wonder if the fantastic four is gonna be a period piece ive heard rumors that that was gonna be the case and i think that this midcentury logo proves that 1112i think theyre really gonna set up the fantastic four as like marvels first superhero family chronologically within the marvel universe and have them like maybe time travel into the present day by the end of the film and why not i mean that could work it worked with captain marvel so right yeah exactly but besides the cast and potentially the setting of the movie we also got a release date change for the film it was originally going to kick off the summer season in 2025 1142coming out may 2nd but fantastic four has been pushed back to july 25th which is the date when the thunderbolts movie was going to come out but that film has been moved up to may 2nd so basically they just swapped dates so now thunderbolts is kicking off the summer movie season which i think is good news i think it shows that marvel has faith in the thunderbolts movie to have such a valuable release date have they started filming thunderbolts not yet no man that seems like a quick turnaround 1211but i imagine it has fewer special effects than fantastic four would need maybe who knows a few months prior to that in february were going to get captain america brave new world which has already started filming and i think is close to wrapping up here i think this is all great news it gives the studio more time to work on fantastic four which you know is a flagship franchise that needs to be done right in its third iteration and nothing got pushed back its just dates that are swapping so we can still expect 1239something marvel to come out on those original dates yeah next year again im really just hoping for this year to fly by i know its gonna be a crazy year with like the election and everything just bring on 2025 after the joker of course cause i really want to see that but yeah 2025 is gonna be better than 2024 im pretty sure now i dont want to skip over deadpool and wolverine so we could get to that movie and then once it comes out then yeah im ready for 2025 already all right well just skip to deadpool and wolverine then skip to the joker 1309and then skip to 2025 no skip to christmas because you cant skip christmas man thats true thats fair what are we talking about i dont know but lets go to move on to the next bit of news here which is that the official trailer for the xmen 97 cartoon has been released it was released under a new banner 1329called marvel animation which is pretty exciting to see because i think it signifies that marvel is going to be producing a lot more animated projects yeah maybe what if will fall under that banner now thats spiderman series the prequel series that theyre coming up with i forget the name of it yeah that was originally called spiderman freshman year but theyve since changed the title to friendly neighborhood spiderman im surprised theres not a home in there somewhere but thats probably marvel animation i imagine as well marvel zombies is also going to be animated 1359when that comes out so lots of projects for marvel animation cannot wait these type of stories do really well i think in animation and marvel hasnt really invested too much in that lately their previous animated films werent very good but these series hopefully will be just like the xmen cartoon was back in the 90s the trailer starts off showing us clips from the series from nali back when that ended and picks up right where it left off its cool that the camera goes into the analog screen and basically takes us right back into that world 1428the animation is a little bit different in style but you can tell heavily inspired by the 90s cartoon at the very least especially in terms of character design especially in terms of voice yeah it sounds like the voice cast is returning which i think i had already known that but it was a nice kind of surprise to hear as well yeah if its not the original voice cast they are remarkable impressionists its nice to see cyclops as the leader of the team again 1456and really take center stage hopefully he proves to a whole new generation of fans that he is the de facto leader of the xmen because the movies kind of gave him the shaft the most standout moment for me in the trailer is when wolverine is charging toward the camera gambit jumps on his back and charges his claws up with kinetic energy i thought that was really dope yeah it was a nice combo move kind of like a fastball special you know if colossus isnt around or anything like that yeah 1521i like there was a scene with storm and she has her new haircut its like the ponytail kind of thing and theres just lightning crackling all around her im like oh shit the animation is a lot better than in the 90s yeah the ponytail hair here is kind of like a nice compromise between you know her long flowing hair from the 90s cartoon and also her mohawk style i really like the way it looks here yeah same we see jean grey in this trailer who appears to be pregnant 1548which is a surprise because that never happened in the comic books scott knocked up madeline pryor who was a clone of jean grey so either this version of jean grey is actually a clone or theyre just going to make jean grey the mother of cable which is what i assume theyre going with here i think thats cable in the womb unless wolverines the father oh shit scandals i doubt that they would do that but if theyre making jean grey 1616cables mother im totally fine with that because she basically raised him in the comic books anyway when she and scott were sent to the future to take care of him i dont really like the character of madeline pryor or like the goblin queen or any of that stuff so i wont miss her if shes gone it looks like magneto has taken over the whole school which is kind of cool yeah that is from the comics magneto took over the school around the time of the new mutants and he kind of turned over a new leaf for a while before you know going back to being the villain 1646the trailer got me pumped up with loads of nostalgia i remember loving this series as a kid especially the first two seasons the show kind of fell off after that but the show was always known for seriously tackling the issues of prejudice and things like that and hopefully this new cartoon really runs with those themes keeps it as straight as possible doesnt make it too goofy or anything like that because thats what made the original 90s xmen cartoon so great i cant wait for it the show is actually going to debut pretty soon here in about a month on march 20th 1726what was your favorite character from the xmen 90s cartoon besides wolverine and why i mean everyones gonna say wolverine so yeah thats probably a good caveat record

think that does it for all the news for this episode so lets go ahead and get into our main event where we review the latest sony spiderman universe movie madam web 1833directed by sj clarkson and stars dakota johnson sidney sweeney isabella merced celeste oconnor and tahar rahim the movie is based on an obscure spiderman ally from the comic books a mysterious psychic woman who can peer into the web of life and destiny and has helped spidey in several of his adventures madam web is a project that literally no one asked for centered around a character that isnt even bottom of the barrel 1900shes so under and below the barrel that you have to dig to find her i wasnt anticipating this film i only moderately enjoyed it and i wont be recommending it i dont think a lot of people are going to be seeing this movie i dont think its necessary to see so as i give our obligatory spoiler warning for this review i do so with great ambivalence if you dont want to be spoiled on madame webbs plot give us a pause and i wish you the best in seeing this movie 1931if it sounds like im actively discouraging people from seeing the film you may be partially correct its gotten to the point now where the obviousness of sonys disregard for the source material and the audience is beyond the pale for those who may not know prior to the existence of marvel studios the film rights for many marvel characters were sold to outside studios with spiderman going to sony it made sense at the time because marvel was a publishing company they made comics they didnt know how to make movies 2001but since the mid2000s sony has cranked out a lot of subpar live action films especially when compared to marvel studios who has obviously had the best handle on their own intellectual property spiderman has fared much better at marvel than he ever did at sony but technically the spiderman home trilogy films were a marvel production of a sony franchise because to this day sony still has the rights to spiderman and they will continue to have them as long as they keep making spidermanrelated films and dont lapse on their contract 2031the only reason average films like the amazing spiderman venom morbius and now madame web were made was to keep the character from reverting to marvel in sonys eyes its better to make a mediocre movie now that no one wants to see in order to retain the potential of making money later and as a marvel fan and as a movie fan that sucks and if we have to show the studio that message with our wallets then thats what we should probably do 2101dont go through any great efforts to see this movie if you already werent planning on doing so yeah its definitely not worth your time i would say yeah i mean its not terrible but youre right yeah its not worth probably the money that you would spend i would probably say if youre gonna see it wait until its out of theaters on streaming that being said im not gonna bash this movie for the sake of it i will remain as impartial as i can as a critic there are some people out there saying that this is the worst superhero movie ever made 2130but i think theyre forgetting that 2015s fantastic four exists or batman and robin which was worse than that or the shaquille oneal steel movie which was worse than that so madame webbe i would say is around the same quality as morbius although i personally liked morbius a little bit more madame webbe is a film that is more divisive than outright horrible and ill say that i liked it a little bit more than i thought i would but in the end i could take it or leave it again its a film no one asked for yeah i mean 2200i also liked it surprisingly a little bit more than i thought i would because i was expecting the worst movie thats ever been made honestly with the way film critics were talking about it but i honestly liked it more than morbius id say i liked it more than electra there are worse marvel movies than this in my opinion yeah go see howard the duck right exactly yeah but yeah i mean its really hard to watch non mcu marvel movies because its obvious that they dont have a roadmap 2229you know how does this connect in any way to morbius or the upcoming craven film or venom i have no idea i honestly dont care yeah i really dont care where this whole thing is going and i kind of get the impression that the filmmakers didnt really care about this project at all either and even the writers it seems like none of them had really read the comics well i mean its not like theres a huge amount of maddenweb comics to go off of you know this is largely an original origin story for the character 2259yeah to be honest i dont know much about the character all i know from her is what i learned from the animated series in the 90s yeah that was also my introduction to the character she had quite a sizable role within that animated series much larger than she ever did in the comic books interesting the movie isnt a total dumpster fire i think what keeps the film from being so is the director sj clarkson 2321this lady has been a part of every single television show youve ever loved in the last 15 or so years having directed quintessential episodes of heroes house dexter bates motel orange is the new black jessica jones game of thrones succession need i go on you know sj clarkson is incredibly acclaimed and talented and i also think that she set up some incredible shots in this movie especially in the first act when cassie is discovering her powers its clear 2350that the director had an incredible knack for visual storytelling the problem is that the story has to be good and madame webbs story is not good a lot of the characters are shallow the second act is a drag with very little momentum and i dont care how good of a director you are theres no way to direct most of the dialogue in this film some of the worst dialogue ive ever heard in any film and whats really tragic is that sj clarkson actually has a screenplay credit here 2419so its not clear where things went wrong but given the directors track record i can almost guarantee it was studio interference interesting i didnt realize she wrote this as well thats a shame if it was studio interference because they really threw her under the bus letting her put her name all over it yeah it seems to me when it comes to sony and the sony spiderman universe films its like a bunch of noncreative business people making creative decisions that muddle the overall vision 2517probably would have preferred to this one is the superhero movie that we were promised in the marketing like was this even a superhero movie maybe in the sense that there were people with powers and a struggle between good and evil but the costumes were pretty much nonexistent it wasnt like this it was a spiderwoman teamup film where we got to see these ladies kick ass right yeah i dont even know like how the girls got their spider powers like what the hell yeah the characters were like pretty much a baitandswitch i think which was not cool 2546the film felt so small because the stakes were so minuscule while the film implies that these teenage girls will grow up to become superheroes doesnt show anything to the effect of them you know saving the world in the future or even stopping a crime or doing anything worthwhile besides striking some cool poses i mean technically they all kind of saved peter parkers life but its not even clear in this universe whether or not 2611peter parker will become spiderman if he does hes not a very original character considering theres a shit ton of other spiderpeople in this universe and thats one of the worst things about this movie right the implications that it has on the larger sony spiderman universe where everybody gets spiderpowers you get spiderpowers you get spiderpowers theres a whole race of indigenous spiderpeople in peru apparently and you know 2636there is some of that in the comics theres the whole spider society which i think was one of the worst ideas ever like j michael straczynski really started this all when he insinuated that spiderman was part of the spider totem and that all of his animal themed bad guys were also representatives of their animal totems its kind of a neat idea and concept but people ran with that shit for years and years and then it just outstated its welcome like you had the sisterhood of the wasps 2703and the spider society and all this random shit and it got really lame really fast im just gonna say it now theres too many spidermen like way too many i agree with you for sure at least within the 616 proper universe i dont care how many spidermen there are across the multiverse and i think that actually works especially when you look at a film across the spiderverse but when you have 50 million spidermen and spiderwomen in the same playground it gets a little crowded 2731which is a shame i feel like for anyone who liked the spiderverse films like if they go into this movie expecting like more of that kind of awesomeness theyre going to be sorely disappointed oh for the most part i really wish that this movie like those spiderverse films was made for the fans because honestly i dont think this one was i think this was trying to capture a new demographic for superhero films that really isnt 2757as interested in them as comic book readers i 100 agree it was like it was trying to tap into like the teenage thriller genre like the people that went and saw final destination but i think theyll be disappointed when they see this film of course the fans will be disappointed so its hard to know exactly who is going to love this movie if anybody but speaking of the characters lets go ahead and get into our character breakdown starting with madame webb aka cassandra webb who was played by dakota johnson 2826i actually liked dakota johnson here more than i wanted to i havent seen her in too much stuff only in suspiria but i was never too impressed with her acting ability in this movie though i actually thought she did well enough with most of the material not just in conveying her burgeoning psychic powers but also her emotional scenes as well yeah this was also the first time i saw her i agree i didnt think she did that terrible she probably had the best performance in the film next to like adam scott yeah 2855she has this kind of deadpan style to her that i think was really able to tap into the scripts humor i think she sold the comedy actually really well what little comedy there was in the script and surprisingly i believed in the idea of her as a superhero toward the end of the movie more than i believed in her as a cynical paramedic in the beginning of the film i wouldnt mind seeing more of her as a superhero character if and when she turns up again down the line 2922i praise her performance however with the caveat that she completely dropped the ball in her final scene with the wheelchair and the strange eyeglasses that was just a really bad delivery absolutely im still really confused by that whole thing like obviously she was blinded by some kind of debris but when did she become paralyzed how did she afford this like badass wheelchair and why was she like all smiley at the end like the future has been really good i guess i dont know 2951i remember reading a quote from james marsden over 20 years ago when he was doing an interview for the first xmen movie saying that it was really hard to act through his cyclops visor and i think maybe dakota johnson just had the same struggles here yeah its gotta be a challenge and its a shame that final seem was what the audience was left with because i think the rest of her performance was pretty decent good even 3013especially as she goes through her arc you know cassie starts the film as a cynical paramedic detached from others due to her life as a seemingly unloved foster child i think she resented her mother for being more invested in her research in the amazon and then dying instead of caring and being there for her and whats actually great about this aspect of the movie is that i thought the same thing about her mom like i remember thinking in the beginning like lady you are pregnant do not fight over the spider with the gun toting psycho 3043but in cassie getting her powers and exploring their ties to her mothers past she learns that her mom did care about her that her whole reason for seeking out the spider was for the improved quality of life for her child and i dont know if its because im a parent now but that revelation hit me like a punch in the gut and cassie carried that forward protecting and then seemingly raising these neglected teens as the mother figure herself coming full circle 3137character of madame webb actually has in the comic books its called myasthenia gravis and in the books madame webb was born with it she was born blind and a paraplegic and she developed these psychic powers this ability to peer into the web of life and destiny which is a construct of fate and in this movie that is the disease that cassies mom was trying to prevent yeah so you could say its ironic then that her daughter ended up blind and in a wheelchair anyway at the end 3205yeah like it was faded or something the web of life and destiny is actually the source of spidermans spideysense and all the spider characters who have spideysense are able to tap into that just a little bit in the comics madame web worked as a psychic medium who was once visited by peter parker whom she knew off the bat was spiderman surprising him and she would go on to help him in several of his adventures she not only had telepathy but she also had clairvoyance she could predict the future and she could also astral project 3234this movie had an interesting take on the astral projection though in that she could send out multiple copies of herself who could also interact physically with the environment that was a little weird yeah pretty unique though i thought that was actually kind of cool yeah its an interesting way to not limit her so much if the character is ever used again in future films lets go ahead and move on to julia cornwall who is played by sydney sweeney this is actually my first time seeing sydney sweeney in anything i never watched euphoria or white lotus or anything 3330i think she played an insecure teenager fairly well stop thinking with your dick she was not great in this movie i dont think i am honestly i think she did the best out of the three teenage actresses or playing teenagers i think isabella merced did the best and thats good news for you considering that shes going to be hawke girl in next years superman legacy movie but lets talk about anya corazon played by isabella merced none of the characters were written well again the dialogue was so incredibly awful 3400but at least i think anya had the most believable delivery sydney sweeney had to play this shy teenager which she totally didnt come across as celeste oconnor who played maddie franklin tried to portray herself as this rebellious teen which i also didnt think she sold but isabella merced as anya really just had to play smart she was the smart one she had the easiest acting job and therefore i think she pulled it off better 3425yeah i mean she did fine i dont know if i agree that she did better than the sidney sweeney but yeah she definitely did better than celeste oconnor yeah celeste oconnor played maddie franklin this is my first time seeing celeste in anything and if i never see her again in another film i think i would be just fine her acting was so bad in this movie she brought down the entire film like she didnt deliver a single line believably i thought and it was probably one of the 3451worst performances out of any superhero movie in the last few decades but not only that like her character sucked like maddie was so unlikable and rude and impulsive and when she tried rescuing cassie while skateboarding on a piece of debris i wanted to fucking puke if we gave away brothers awards for the worst moment that would win it because that was just ridiculous what did you think about her backstory are i guess any of these three girls backstories i thought they were good backstories i agree i thought 3520that made the characters more interesting what im really curious about is how they got their powers in the movie yeah they never address that they just leave it openended i assume for maybe a sequel where theyll get their powers or something like that but in the comics cassie just kind of developed her powers shes not a mutant but she just became a psychic i think largely because her condition left her with a clairvoyant mind but julia cornwall who would later become julia carpenter she got her powers through genetic experiments 3617it didnt give her spider abilities but it did give her strength speed agility reflexes but she later got the additional abilities of madame webbs granddaughter who had been turned into a spiderhuman hybrid by doctor octopus hence the giant spider legs from her back that allow her to wall crawl and then anya who is known as aranya in the books or spider girl sometimes her powers were given to her by a sorcerer of the secret spider society who was trying to save her life 3646and she did get the powers of a spider in addition to the ability to summon this exoskeleton armor and she also carries these spider bola devices that she created that allow her to grapple ledges and snare opponents and can also be thrown as projectiles so we saw that in the movie too man thats a lot to get through in a sequel if they ever do yeah i assume that if they ever get to those superhero origins theyll probably all get their powers in the same way yeah from the spiders in peru i guess 3715speaking of that lets move on to ezekiel sims who is played by tahar rahim i dont even know where to start tahar rahim is an actor ive never heard of playing horribly a role that is unrecognizable compared to the comic book ezekiel a character who in itself is a big ol sack of mediocrity never ever have i cared less about a comic book movie villain he had no arc beyond his desire to just continue existing 3745beyond that there were no goals you know hes a guy who wanted the spider venom to give himself power and i guess he did that you know he amassed this power and wealth but like who the fuck is this guy like why did he want power what did he plan on doing with it what was he doing all this time as cassie was growing up like fucking investing in stocks and jacking off or some shit he was not a good villain he was barely even a character you know he mentioned something in 3813the amazon about his family starving or something like that and i guess he built an empire after that but i have no sense of how loaded this guy is apparently only has like one employee who works in his apartment its like they couldnt find another location for him they couldnt like show him walking through office space or anything like that its like holy crap what is going on here like he wasnt evil enough he wasnt interesting enough he wasnt anything worthwhile enough and also his acting was not great 3842not only did i not believe any of tahar rahims line deliveries i dont even think he delivered them because his voice never matched his mouth it was like most of his lines were 80 yard in postproduction yes i actually wondered if that was his actual voice in the movie or if they got another actor to do his lines because i dont know maybe he had a really heavy accent that was difficult to understand i could definitely see in a lot of the shadowy scenes and just in the poor editing that he wasnt really actually saying 3911the lines we are hearing yeah that may be due to rewrites might be due to an accent or something hes a french actor and maybe he couldnt pull off a convincing latin american accent which i think the character was supposed to be yeah who knows but in the books ezekiel is not peruvian although he did get his powers through a mystic ritual in a peruvian spider temple which is probably why the movie started off in peru but like ezekiel never wore a black spiderman suit in the comics 3940where did that come from like i want to know the reasoning behind that the film never addresses why he looks like spiderman it makes no sense especially when you consider the implications for spiderman and his costume which he developed and created and conceived of all on his own it implies that maybe there was some external influence in peter parkers costume creation and that doesnt make sense maybe from the peruvian spider people not sure oh that was dumb too 4009it was interesting i kind of feel like when they were trying to explain the character of ezekiel theyre like hes kind of like spiderman so theyre like oh so he wears a suit lets just make him look like evil spiderman ugh yeah that was some studio executives idea for sure theyre like we got to make it marketable we got to make it seem like spidermans in this movie 100 the final characters i want to talk about are benjamin parker played by adam scott and mary parker played by emma roberts i dont have too much to say about them because their roles were so small 4039theyre both likable actors who i think were entirely wasted in their roles in this movie i dont know about wasted i think they almost kind of added credibility to the film that it would have normally had i liked seeing them in those roles i think theyre bigger actors than you know what those roles called for they could have gotten away with actors of a lesser caliber but no i like seeing them in the roles 4101yeah it makes you wonder if theyre planning to use them again down the line which is why they wanted to get these bigger name actors i keep making allusions to a sequel to this movie but i think its pretty clear that thats not going to happen if madame web ever shows up again its probably going to be in some kind of like team up film like sinister six type movie or something like that that i think sony is working toward but probably not a madame web too just taking the box office into consideration yeah i didnt even get number one and this is a spiderman movie thats crazy 4143in 1973 medical researcher constance webb discovers a rare species of spider in the peruvian jungle whose venom has healing and strengthening properties though she is pregnant her security escort ezekiel sims shoots her and steals the spider an indigenous tribe tries to save constances life using the spider venom but she dies shortly after giving birth to her daughter cassandra now writing out that scene kind of sounds pretty interesting and cool in theory 4211but seeing it done in practice i thought was kind of ridiculous especially when you see the indigenous tribe crawling through the trees looking like spiderman its like what the fuck is going on here the cg is pretty bad seeing them leap through the trees but i honestly didnt hate the designs of them like if youre going to do an indigenous amazon tribe spiderman thats how you do it i didnt like the black webbing that they covered their bodies in it was like 4239black twigs or something yeah or netting something like that some kind of it was like trying too hard to make it look like spidermans costume probably probably thats fair i thought it was just kind of an interesting design at the very least now when they were talking about the legend of the aranya people i forget what they called them they mentioned a poison touch that ezekiel sims of course later on gets what did you think of that 4303i think thats a cool idea ezekiel does not have that power in the comics but i think it was a way to make him seem more villainous and more threatening back to the story 30 years later in 2003 queens new york cassie works as a paramedic alongside her partner ben parker after helping rescue a man from a car about to fall off a bridge she falls into the water and has a neardeath experience that awakens her psychic potential to see into the web of life and destiny 4330i thought that was a pretty cool scene when she first started seeing the web in the water it was hella confusing honestly i did like how the shattered glass looked like a web actually theres a ton of shattered glass in this movie thats very weblike its kind of like a recurring visual motif yeah i thought that was pretty neat especially when it also correlates to what feels like her mind fracturing as her powers start developing right yeah exactly i do have a question 4357were cassandra and ben fucking no ok he stuck in the tip once it didnt count he put in a ball all i know is that didnt really mean anything ben tells her that like you know hes met someone but he never says may i was just wondering because they had like a weird chemistry between each other no i think she was too detached for any sort of relationship oh cassie began suffering from visions that turn out to come true such as the death of her coworker oneil 4427meanwhile its revealed that since his time in peru ezekiel used the spider venom to grant himself enhanced physicality wall crawling ability a poisonous touch and precognitive dreams ezekiel seduces and kills an nsa agent to get access to a person tracking system to find three girls that his visions have convinced him will kill him in the future i do think you cant really say precognitive dreams considering the fact that his dreams were lying to him 4454yeah its hard to say because you know according to this movie the future can be changed so im wondering if thats what would have happened to him if madame webb never came to be or something who knows i have no idea what happened there yeah kind of dumb meanwhile cassie has a vision on the subway of ezekiel murdering the three girls julia cornwall maddie franklin and anya corazon she convinces the girls to get off the train and they flee ezekiel pursues them 4521but his attention is diverted long enough by local police trying to stop him for cassie and the girls to escape in a taxi cassie drives them to a nearby forest where they discuss the man who moves like a spider cassie tells them to wait there as she leaves to revisit her mothers spider research back home i thought it was a little convenient how easily they were able to ditch ezekiel 4542really he was too distracted by taking out police officers why not just wait for them to be away from the police considering no one was looking up at the ceiling apparently to see him well the police were shooting at him he had to take him out they would have kept shooting at him as he was trying to get at the girls but they were only shooting at him because he started attacking them right well and also because hes a fucking dude crawling on the ceiling i think you know anybody would shoot at that thats where i would 4611back in the forest the girls get restless and walk to a nearby diner cassie learns from her mothers journal about the rare peruvian spider the mysterious indigenous tribe and ezekiels identity as her mothers former security escort at the diner the girls draw attention to themselves prompting a local to report the location of their missing whereabouts leading to ezekiel finding them cassie gets visions of ezekiel killing them in the diner prompting her to crash her car into the restaurant to ram him 4640teenage girls man you cant leave them alone for a second before theyre dancing on a tabletop so impress some boys i dont know what kind of kid youre raising but she needs to shape up i was just saying it was like bad writing like really bad it was cassie hides the girls at a hotel where she learns more about ezekiels motives and abilities after communicating with him through a dream she teaches the girls how to perform cpr then leaves them to hide out at bens while she travels to peru 4708there cassie discovers a member of the indigenous tribe who tells her how her mother died and guides her through the web of life and destiny revealing that her pregnant mom sought out the spider in peru to cure her daughters myasthenia gravis i do wonder why the guy wasnt dressed up like rainforest spiderman anymore he was like wearing regular clothes like does the tribe sometimes paint themselves red and cover themselves in black twigs and then sometimes wear regular clothes 4735or i had something happen to that guy in the last 30 years where he was like you know what im going to move out of the rainforest yeah i wondered the same thing i think that was a mistake i think they should have kept with the tribal look yeah i agree because you know they felt very mysterious and mystical almost back in queens bens sisterinlaw mary goes into labor on the way to the hospital bens car is caught on camera with the girls and ezekiel pursues them cassie 4801now back in new york has a vision of them being attacked and steals an ambulance to help the girls escape and divert ezekiel away from ben and mary she takes the girls to a condemned fireworks factory where they set up traps for ezekiel and call for a helicopter medical evac now im pretty sure that freaking fireworks factory burned down earlier in the movie right right yeah like how are all those fireworks still there after a fire like that that doesnt make any sense 4826also i didnt realize that bottle rockets could shoot holes through brick walls i got to be more careful with those things i know right those fireworks were so ridiculously overpowered i think it was a front for like a mafia artillery cache or something like that because like literally one of those fireworks took down a whole fucking helicopter like exploded it its so crazy and like ripping holes through the roof and like it pretty much toppled the whole building down 4854its like where can i buy these fireworks not where we live you and i have had some fireworks mishaps on our own you know like accidentally having them explode the cardboard tube that theyre in and like sending sparks everywhere but i dont remember that being powerful enough to like rip a hole in someones house its sad guys are on fire but didnt destroy a house when ezekiel arrives the fireworks distract him as the girls make their way to the roof for the evac ezekiel follows and the helicopter gets destroyed putting each of the girls in danger 4948ambulances and fireworks and signs i think that maybe his spidey sense kind of manifests as those dreams visions that he gets sucks to be him then yeah cassie also falls off the building into the river below where shes blinded by a firework shes saved from drowning by julia and maddie and anya perform cpr cassie awakens in a hospital now paralyzed and blind and learns that mary gave birth to her son peter 5016back at her apartment in a wheelchair cassie decides to mentor the girls in their future roles as spiderheroes and has a vision of them in costume no they never named the baby peter no and you know fans will obviously get the reference i dont know if general audiences will know that thats actually spiderman and uncle ben and spidermans mom yeah no one in my family did i saw it with my wife and daughters and i had to explain to them who those characters were and why they were important 5045seems like they dropped the ball on that front yeah you know considering that at the baby shower they played a game where they tried to guess the babys first name they could have at least followed through with that by having a scene where cassie visits mary and is like so what did that name end up being and shes like peter you know and then the audience is like oh my god you know that would have been better right right and the baby would have been played by toby mcguire right exactly i didnt see this would have flipped out 5113yeah superimposed toby mcguires face on little babys head the costumes we saw at the end were not great i feel like that was the best look we got at them and i did not love madame webbs it looked really cheap i dont know if it was just like the lipstick or the glasses or i dont know just i didnt like it i dont like any of them as much as i thought i would 5137i liked the costumes i did not like the headgear on any of them especially madame webs which looked like a plastic sleeping eye mask yes the costume looked fine though i didnt like julia cornwalls mask that was weird oh like the chin strap yeah very strange but that was the end of the movie there was no end credit scene or mid credit scene i think i was half expecting jared leto to show up and say its morbentime or something like that but im kind of glad that there wasnt overall 5206the movie did have some emotional moments and was competently directed but i think a beautiful arc regarding motherhood cant save the film from its clunky dialogue the lack of superhero action subpar performances and forgettable characters i rate this film 25 stars out of 5 a rotten rating on rotten tomatoes yeah that sounds about right i forget what we gave morbius we gave morbius 3 stars yeesh 5234but i actually think morbius had a stronger story and a better villain i actually think madame web was about the same quality as the echo television series that we just reviewed which we also gave two and a half stars yeah maybe youre right when it comes down to the villain this absolutely was one of the worst villains in superhero cinema history hands down so yeah around 25 seems right to me im not expecting much better in terms of quality for the next sony spiderman universe film thats coming out later this year 5303which will be craven the hunter yeah no the whole radioactive lion blood just still freaking kills me these sony film writers need to read the comics they would have made something we actually maybe would have wanted to see like a miles

Feb 20 2024,positive, lets be honest here most people had made up their minds on this film before ever going to see it hadnt they its okay to admit it best being honest with these things in fact any film that falls under the sonys spiderman universe franchise  with the exception of the venom films tom hardy is bulletproof  is likely to find itself fired upon by the web shooters of well the world wide web but for those brave few who dared venture into the cinema is this the worst comic book movie ever or one of the most ramshackle films ever released  madame web adapted from the marvel comics spiderverse character sees new york city paramedic cassandra webb dakota johnson undergo a near fatal experience that seems to unlock abilities within her that she never realised she had abilities gifted to her at birth abilities that allow her to see fragments of the future and when she sees three teenage girls attacked by a brutal masked man she must act to save them not realising just how connected all these people really are to her including this vicious attacker somadame web is in so many numerous ways a bit of a tangled messy web indeed certain lines of dialogue the odd wooden performance some logical leaps and thus will do nothing to dispel all the talk of superhero fatigue and the genres nosedive in quality perceptions but call it the prerelease overblown antihype that twitter sorry x sigh have relished basking in but this writer ended up really enjoying the experience  sj clarksons film just had something about it that won us over and is nowhere near the blight on comic book cinema it is being made out to be be it the wellworn so to speak costumed superhero stuff taking more of a backseat to a rather rollicking slasherinspired final destinationesque horror thriller with some campy detours or some entertaining characters that you are quite happy to spend time with the whole mad little experience is endearing rather than tiring  madame web is a bonkers movie that is as imperfect as it gets from its tangled lore down to its wacky creative and filming decisions but it is also infinitely more interesting than other assembly line super capers for this very reason and is largely its own thing rather than a tick box venture in universe building all in all it is a good night out with a pigeonsaving peopleavoiding new kind of hero and a finale that plays out like highlanders final set piece had it been sponsored by pepsi chalk madame web up as one of those so called disasters that a select few raises hand will gladly go back to and enjoy every time jonah hex spawn howard the duck rather than an empty husk of a movie that you forget about as soon as you leave the cinema antman and the wasp quantumania or truly a title deserving of worst comic book film ever fant4stic  maybe we are going slightly mad it finally happened but we can foresee a certain crowd embracing this fun flick down the line this madame caught us in her web clearly
Feb 20 2024,negative, madame web 2024 exists in one of those weird places where it is so silly so ridiculous and so outrageously inane that its almost worth seeing for the sheer calamity of it all some may see that as a positive if theres one criticism that has remained constant for superhero films particularly the marveldisney ones its that they have increasingly felt factory produced more and more they lack personality you cant really say the same about this as a sony production it does contain tons of identifiable traits  but not in the way it was possibly intended this is not a good movie in fact it might be one of the worst comic book blockbusters of recent memory but hey its better to be remembered than forgotten right in style tone and execution this feels like a relic of the past back before cgi and special effects made anything possible superhero films had to work around obstacles to make us believe that people could fly leap tall buildings or shoot laser beams out of their eyes sure sometimes youll get a legitimate hit like superman 1978 other times youll end up with something campy like captain america 1990 something tells me that deep down madame web wanted to be the latter director sj clarkson who also cowrites with matt sazama burk sharpless and claire parker inject little hints  whether it be a line of dialogue camera move or edit  that makes me wonder if this was meant to be more tongueincheek at least thats what im hoping if this was always supposed to be a straightforward origin story then it fails on all counts visually clarksons direction in coordination with mauro fiores cinematography incorporates dramatic camera moves that are reminiscent of music videos the frame spins and twirls in exaggerated angles sometimes going completely upside down flashing lights and hyperactive cutting swing us back and forth in time and place for a story that heavily features a shifting timeline this approach makes sense but when it comes to the action the disorienting style takes away from the cohesiveness we cant really tell what is going on its all a barrage of images hurtling at us with little sense of rhythm the biggest victim in all of this might be the pacing because the narrative barrels forward without ever letting us catch our bearings it feels like it is stuck in the first act there is a notion that everything we see is a set up for something else but theres no payoff to satisfy our suspicions the writing does little to help things along the character work is flat and uninteresting and in some cases completely absent we learn that cassandra webb dakota johnson is a nyc paramedic who lost her mother in childbirth what she doesnt realize is that her mother was studying a special breed of spiders in peru at the time why a ninemonth pregnant woman would be deep in the amazon to begin with is anyones guess as fate would have it one of these spiders bit cassandras mother thus endowing the yettobeborn cassandra with the power of clairvoyance she can see into the future and can visualize the results and consequences of choices made in the present this gift unfortunately comes with a set a problems ezekiel sims tahar rahim  who worked with cassandras mother back then  has also been granted this ability for reasons i will not describe ezekiel has become fixated on killing three young women  julia sydney sweeney mattie celeste oconnor and anya isabela merced  and wont let anything stand in his way including cassandra whew thats a lot of ground to cover isnt it essentially the plot takes on a similar structure as the terminator 1984 in which cassandra must protect three lives  all of whom play an important role in the future  from a near unstoppable force and thats about it i wish i could say there was more to it than that but the film operates strictly on the surface we dont learn much of anyone beyond basic attributes in some instances their actions defy logic altogether when cassandra tells the three women to lay low and not draw attention to themselves they respond by going to a diner meeting a group of boys and dancing on a table to britney spears toxic i understand this is supposed to be set in the early 2000s but was there no other way of showing that if you were trying to get away from a killer would your first inclination be to dance on a table for everyone to see  god bless dakota johnson she is a talented actor who  in the right project  can deliver a performance of warmth and authenticity see her work in the peanut butter falcon the lost daughter and cha cha real smooth as prime examples as cassandra webb she adds a dash of sarcastic wit that makes the character more interesting than it should be there has been lots of rumors and speculation over johnsons involvement with the film the fact that she as of this writing has not seen it yet and her curious interviews in the promotional campaign leading up to its release its almost as if she can see the writing on the wall and instead of taking things seriously is out there having as much fun as she can we see it in her performance as well even though the movie has a lot of speed bumps johnson at least appears to be enjoying the chaos madame web might appeal to those with a morbid sense of curiosity  just to see what all the hubbub is about if youre one of those people then by all means watch it and enjoy but for those looking for a superhero movie with good action well developed characters and an engaging story then you are in the wrong place im a firm believer that to know what a good movie is one needs to know what a bad one is as well i think we all know where this one lands
Feb 20 2024,negative,this movie was not good enough for theaters streaming or your directtodvd bargain bin it made morbius look like citizen kane it dangles spiderman references at us like keys in front of a cat
Feb 20 2024,negative, the sony universe of spiderman adjacent movies continue with madame web yet another baffling and nonsensical adventure of absolutely nothing while the movie is absolutely not as terrible as most are making it seem its still a story that goes nowhere until its seemingly even more disappointing end game the lesserknown marvel comics character in her own movie along with some much more interesting characters we dont actually get to spend time with read on for my madame web review  madame web is a spiderman character made popular by the 90s animated spiderman series the comic character is one of the heros lesserknown villains but apparently was the right choice for sony to make another spiderman villain into a kind of antihero the story of madame web tries to make the character into an actual hero but it does so in very strange and odd ways the movie is about cassandra web dakota johnson a paramedic in new york who begins to experience visions of the future after a brush with death  despite being a movie about a spiderman character that cannot ever mention spiderman madame web gets dangerously close and i cant understand why theres a whole side story about peter parker himself cassies partner on the job is ben parker adam scott a young uncle of peter parker throughout the movie ben is seen taking care of his sisterinlaw mary parker as she is pregnant with a son part of the third act climax is also about how mary and ben are caught up in this adventure of cassies  madame web also teams up with cassie with three young women who are other spiderverse characters from the comics the three women played by isabel merced sydney sweeney and celeste oconnor are characters who will eventually get powers and become various spiderwoman characters from the comics these three characters and the chemistry between their actresses make them so much more interesting than the main lead more interesting than anything johnson does in the movie  and while i dont want to spoil anything in this madame web review lets just say that the girls history and their story dont get much importance in the movie which is one of the more disappointing elements of madame web a movie that had the framework and potential to be pretty great but gets lost in its convoluted mess there are hilarious moments and some pretty funny backandforth between the 3 girls the ultimate climax feels more like a setup than any kind of resolution to the story audiences just saw all in all a disappointing entry into more spiderman movies without spiderman that continues to make us wonder why
Feb 20 2024,negative, it seems a little cruel to dogpile on a movie that has been bashed even before it was released but for the life of me im having a really hard time coming up with anything kind to say about madame web all those seemingly infinite resources and this is what the filmmakers come up with perhaps this is the beginning of the end of the unshakeable hold that superhero movies have had on the box office for the past decade and a half now to clear up a little confusion about where this movie fits in the superhero genre yes it is a spiderman spinoff and spiderman is a marvel character but no madame web is not part of disneys marvel universe sony holds the licensing to spiderman and all its spidey offshoots when spiderman does cavort with thor iron man the hulk etc its with the express permission of sony executives you dont get the feeling anyone involved with the film tried very hard dakota johnson sleepwalks her way through the portrayal of cassie a misanthropic paramedic whose mother died giving birth to her in a jungle where she was researching exotic spiders with curative powers granted johnson was given a ridiculous clicheridden script but had she inserted a little emotion perhaps a whiff of irony here and there her performance might have been more memorable cassie inadvertently finds herself in a position to protect three teenage girls who have caught the lethal attention of one ezekiel sims who coincidentally had a nefarious connection with cassies mom back in the jungle played by tahar rahim napoleon the mauritanian he is one of the most lackluster forgettable villains to stumble across the big screen should he rain down hellfire on the girls who he dreams are destined to kill him or should he buff his nails does anyone really care the entire film seems like one long tiresome setup for a sequel a goal that is sadly but perhaps fortunately for viewers out of its reach products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation
Feb 20 2024,neutral, reviewed by dennis schwartzthe female british filmmaker sj clarkson toastbanshee with a number of tv credits directs this dreadful clairvoyant superhero movie that has trouble getting off the ground clarkson cowrites it with scriptwriters matt sazama burk sharpless and claire parker they base it on the story by sazama sharpless  kerem sangaits a spiderman spinoff that tells the absurd enigmatic marvel publishings standalone origin story of its superhero heroine who first appeared in the comics in the 1980s as a secondary character the role is played by dakota johnson as an aloof heroine seemingly not concerned her dialogue would be a joke if it was funny or that her talent is wasted in such an empty rolein 2003 cassie webb dakota johnson is a nyc paramedic who has a neardeath experience and a sad back story one day she attains the mental superpower to see into the future and change it her first use of these powers is to save three teenagersjulia cornwall sydney sweeney anya corazon isabela merced and mattie franklin celeste oconnorfrom being targeted by the dangerous madman ezekiel sims tahar rahim who possesses spiderlike powers we learn he was in the amazon with her pregnant mom who was researching spiders before she died through his powers which tie in with cassies sims had a strong feeling his powers would one day lead to his deatheverything seems amiss in this dud from the bland story the poor editing and directing and that an action pic could possibly have so little actionif i could show off my limited clairvoyant abilities even i could predict this stinker will flop at the boxoffice and with the critics
Feb 19 2024,negative, one of two things are going to happen  this movie will fade away very quickly or stories will be written about it for years to come i have to believe this is not the film turned in by the director editor sound team and others who had a hand in making it i have to believe this is studio wrangling at its most brazen and embarrassing lets start by acknowledging that making movies is hard really hard i was reminded of this when a tiktok reviewer kit lazer a really great follow by the way posted a video about this very fact i think as critics and film reviewers we sometimes lose sight of this  though we shouldnt as anyone can attest working in a creative space in an effort to create and entertain or simply to make art for others to view consider and consume is something we as a society easily take for grantedin full disclosure i acknowledge that the first draft of this madame web review was full of vitriol i rarely have been so lost frustrated and eventually left with slackjawed disbelief when watching a major studios film in all ways this is a bad movie in some ways so bad you can have fun with it and perhaps this will attain some showgirlslike level of infamy in the months and years to come i dunno i think madame web is more likely going to become a punchline to a joke about how you botch a superhero movie i hope they dont madame web this one or its like when you sit down to watch movie and you get madame web instead something like thatanyway madame web is a movie clearly ripped out of the hands of director sj clarkson who after directing 22 years of television episodes and series is making her cinematic debut i have to believe i want to believe that editor leigh folsom boyd would attest if put on a witness stand that a different cut of madame web existed under her watchful eyes a talented editor with a resume that includes the last two tom hollandled spiderman films folsom boyd could not have turned in this cut i imagine someone in the sound department sat aghast realizing that nearly all of actor tahar rahims lines were badly embarrassingly overdubbed in postproduction so much so that we see shots of him simply not talking his mouth not synced with the words hes saying or random shots of him from behind or the side where we cant see his mouth while talking plus he sounds like hes in a booth reading lines into a microphone this sound mix and blame whoever signed off on it is one of the worst in recent memory i want to believe madame web is not the work of these talented creators because if sony pictures brass didnt wrestle control of this film away from people and this is what was turned in  i find myself going back to writing the kind of review i truly want to avoid as presented though madame web is an abomination it makes no sense the film has no tone the gaffes are mighty the performers either miscast checked out or acting in a completely different film there are at least a couple of instances where lines are repeated which as has been surmised online may be an actor giving two line readings and then instead of picking the correct one both were left in i mean i could go on and onbasically this is an origin story introducing cassandra webb dakota johnson cassie as she is known was born in a remote peruvian jungle in 1973 when her mother an anthropologist gave birth to her in distress after being betrayed and shot by colleague ezekiel sims rahim in appearance voice still tbd ezekiel steals a spider long sought after among those who seek such things and by the year 2003 he has nefarious goals spiderman like abilities and the vision to see into the futureezekiel also has not aged a day it seems in 30 years but we move oncassie meanwhile is a paramedic her best friend and work partner is ben parker adam scott not quite an uncle as his sister mary emma roberts is close to having her first child we learn she is having a boy whose name is obscured by popping balloons and a sudden callout to an emergency peter the boys name is peter in case anyone is wondering  lets start by acknowledging that making movies is hard really hard i was reminded of this when a

Feb 19 2024,negative, the build up to the latest spiderman spinoff hasnt filled movie fans with excitement if theyre even aware of it at all the posters for madame web give little away other than the faces of the impressive cast while star dakota johnson gave a dubious description of the film while hosting saturday night live kind of like if ai generated your boyfriends perfect movie that may have been a joke but given hollywood has suffered a couple of highprofile boxoffice bombs already in 2024 producers may be hoping not to be the next punchline to put it very basically sony pictures own the spiderman movie rights but not disneys main marvel cinematic universe both studios share the character for main mcu films but sony also have their own spinoff movies like venom morbius and now madame web johnson stars as cassie a paramedic who develops clairvoyant abilities through these new powers the socially awkward cassie must save three teenage girls from ezekiel sims tahar rahim a hunter with a connection to her past  another year another pointless superhero entry yes there have been some hits after 2019s high point avengers endgame both in the main mcu timeline and sonys spider verse however madame web is another example of the barrel being scraped in the hopes that audiences will buy into anything with superpowers the script is painful at times preferring bland exposition instead of trusting audiences to understand whats going on  there is a glimmer of hope in cassies characterisation as a recluse who views her powers as a nuisance but that quickly fades once she inevitably has to take the plot seriously well someone should on the whole its an empty catandmouse thriller that might have had something to say had it been released twenty years ago when the film is set but now feels like an awkward apology for a franchise starter  johnsons sardonic demeanour may work for some but its clear the fifty shades actor would much rather be somewhere else equally rahim best known for award winners a prophet and the mauritanian is turning up for the blockbuster pay day in a forgettable bad guy role the three teens  isabela merced celeste oconnor and euphoria star sydney sweeney  all fight against bland material thats happy to put them in teen pigeonholes  perhaps the films greatest sin is the lack of connection between the female leads basing a superhero movie around sisterhood or found family would have been a fresh way to approach this kind of film something that the mcu almost achieved with the marvels instead these women are bunched together for arbitrary reasons that never get built on  madame web feels like the depressing nadir act of corporate movie franchises  thrashing around for nearly two hours looking for a reason to exist bereft of ideas and invention its a prime example of the laziness that has seen superhero movies descend into their seemingly terminal downward spiral 
Feb 19 2024,neutral, eight reviews this week from erik childress and steve prokopy run the gamut from good documentaries to surprisinglynotsobad to shockingly awful where do all of these films fit in how do you feel about an action film from the director of underwater with this name land of bad or the rookie secret service agent trying to save the president with this one air force one down ewan mcgregor takes a road trip with his addicted daughter bleeding love and lily sullivan stumbles upon an alien conspiracy monolith those documentaries include a scary one about christian nationalism god  country and a more inspiring one about the history of black astronauts the space race finally in theaters this weekend comes another musical biopic bob marley one love and another sony spiderman adjacent comic book tale madame web that have their own set of problems
Feb 19 2024,negative, decades into the comicbookmovie experience filmmakers are still experimenting with the form madame web the latest in sonys vaguely intertwined series of films connected to the wider world of spiderman is about a woman named cassie webb played by dakota johnson who discovers that she has clairvoyant powers more noticeably its about an ostensible superhero who approaches perilous danger and supervillain skirmishes with the laconic standoffish energy one might associate with the ingenue of a luca guadagnino movie not the umpteenth marvel joint its certainly different to give the superherogoing audience a protagonist who seems uninterested in and indeed actively exhausted by the idea of doing good but that kind of radical passivity can only go so far madame web is allegedly here to offer spills and thrills while weaving together new strands of a cinematic universe that includes other somewhat deranged spidey movies such as venom and morbiusa misshapen side series sprouting out of the success of the broader marvel movies instead it gives us johnson reading dialogue about studying spiders in the amazon with a tone reeking of contractual obligation as with the venom films and morbius i could never quite decide whether madame webs ineptitude sparked the kind of giggly enjoyment one derives from watching a camp classic was the surreal lack of energy from all the actors a wry choice or was i just watching the sleepiest superhero movie ever made supporting actors such as sydney sweeney and the delightful adam scott normally have a lot of charm but here they favor drawling understated line deliveries as such its hard to ever feel the stakes being raised even as cassie who begins the film as a humble paramedic starts to explore her dizzying powers of prediction what does this have to do with spiderman or webs in general not too much even to a comicbook reader such as myself madame web is something of an obscure character a sort of humanarachnid seer who pops in and out of the action from time to time in this film inexplicably set in 2003 shes just another 30something bumming around new york living alone with a cat cassie is an orphan born to a spider researcher in the amazon who died in childbirth but her only superpowers are her killer bangs red leather jacket and disarmingly awkward personal style that is until she has a neardeath encounter while rescuing someone on the job giving her bizarre visions of her immediate future this steers her toward three young womenjulia cornwall sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced who all seem destined to become future heroes but only if they manage to avoid a creepy superstrong clairvoyant named ezekiel sims tahar rahim but what will make them heroes or why ezekiel is plagued with visions of them attacking him is left rather vague watching the film doesnt bring a lot of further clarity setting the movie in the past seems to be a choice geared around the hypothetical potential of this cinematic universelike madame web is getting a glimpse into intellectual property yet to come in her present though the action is almost embarrassingly lowkey cassie is not a skilled handtohand combatant and shes honestly a mediocre ambulance driver most of the movie consists of her rushing her teenage charges away from danger as a villain ezekiel is not particularly weighty rahim growls every bit of expository dialogue he can but his motivations are hard to grasp beyond a fear of whatever future heroines these girls will become for most of the movie hes not even really aware of cassie or her powers i almost admire the sheer lack of effort on display in the acting storytelling and set pieces to say that johnson in particular phoned this performance in would be an insult to alexander graham bell it doesnt help that every other performance has a strange stilted energy even when everyones in the same room together too many line readings feel like theyre being delivered with a zoom delay and to be pedantic for a moment plenty of contemporary spiderman movies and spinoffs have been released in the years since 2003 when this film is set and none mentions the good madame or her coterie of female sidekicks so how can the filmmakers pretend that all of this adds up to something audiences might care about if it wasnt already clear that superheroic cinematic universes are no longer an exciting idea johnsons involvement feels like a halfhearted wave goodbye
Feb 19 2024,neutral, superhero fans are a hypercritical bunch especially when it comes to movie trailers they dissect every frame and the trailer of sonys spiderman spinoff madame web didnt impress them judged to be clunky with too much exposition and risible dialogue it brought out the memewriters at their most scornful the hope was that the film would carry on the winning streak established by wonder woman in 2017 when it defied the odds by proving that a superhero movie with a female lead could be a boxoffice hit captain marvel confirmed the good news by grossing more than a billion us dollars worldwide and black widow did pretty well too then last year there was a resounding hiccup when warner brothers shelved dcs batgirl without even releasing it to a streaming service so theres a lot riding on this one in marvels comic books madame web is anything but an action hero a striking figure of mature years shes blind and tethered to a life support system a thronelike chair at the centre of what looks like a giant spiders web her power lies only in her ability to forecast the future not surprisingly shes had a radical makeover here played by dakota johnson cassie webb is in her thirties and has all her faculties although she hasnt yet become clairvoyant shes a paramedic in new york city when her life takes an irrevocable turn to the supernatural with her discovery shes now psychic the rest of the narrative is a barely comprehensible mashup of spiderman themes involving the venom of an amazonian spider that has potent but unreliable properties a spider bite is indirectly responsible for cassies clairvoyance but the movies villain ezekiel sims tahar rahim another supporting character from the comics has acquired extra benefits from his entomological connections he can crawl across ceilings and generally carry on like spidermans evil uncle and his main mission is to murder three women who are fated to kill him in 10 years time at present however theyre airheaded adolescents and cassie finds to her disgust only she is capable of protecting them so its a story about bumbling into greatness and it has to be said the bumbling bits are mildly funny director sj clarkson has helmed episodes of succession which makes sense at their most entitled the three teens give off faint echoes of the roy offspring but as soon as theyre revealed to be just a group of misunderstood kids with neglectful parents the cliches multiply at a dispiriting rate things also take a turn to the portentous which does not sit well with the shamelessly ludicrous nature of the plot the fact that the writers of sonys 2022 flop morbius had a hand in this storyline didnt augur well and so its turned out the film plays like another desperate attempt to keep the franchise flag flying
Feb 19 2024,positive, almost as long as there have been comic books there have been movies made about comic book characters  however over fifteen years ago marvel studios upped the ante with the release of iron man setting off several phases and numerous movies in the marvel cinematic universe or mcu  over time these films have dwindled in popularity due in part to their ridiculous plots as well as oversaturation  from asgardian gods to wakandian kings and everything in between it seems we have seen it allor so we thought  this month sony pictures released their fourth movie in the spiderman universe about a lesserknown character called madame web cassandra webb dakota johnson bad times at the el royale never knew her mother or father all she had was her mothers research trying to locate an elusive spider that supposedly has healing powers  years later working as a paramedic she suddenly finds herself in situations where she thinks she is experiencing deja vu  however she soon discovers her visions are premonitions of things to come and that she can change the outcomes if she acts fast enough  meeting three young women whose deaths she sees before they occur cassandra learns their lives are intertwined and has to do with her deceased mothers research sending her to south america to try and find some answers  madame web first appeared in no 210 of the amazing spiderman comic series published in november 1980  she is clairvoyant and a precognitive mutant who can see events before they happen  she is typically a supporting character in the comic books assisting spiderman with missing persons cases  she is a woman with myasthenia graves and is connected to a life support system resembling a spiderweb  in the comics she is generally seen as an elderly woman while in the film she is probably considered to be in her midthirties  since director sj clarkson the defenders chose to cast a younger actor in the role of cassandra web johnson was a strong choice had she decided to choose a more mature lead dame helen mirren might have been an excellent option  johnson manages to portray web as strong and confident on the outside while hiding wounds and scars inside  webs disciples are played by sydney sweeney anyone but you isabela merced transformers the last night as isabela moner and celeste oconnor freaky  all three actors are upandcoming talents in hollywood and the combination of them with johnson is electric they all have great chemistry and come across as a cohesive team the script is decent with a few cheesy lines here or there but nothing that would make the viewer groan in disgust  the special effects are done very well which is a nice change from some of the other recent superhero movies  ezekiel sims tahar rahim the mauritanian crawling on the ceiling in a spiderlike costume seems plausible in this case as the cgi work is very well done while we wont know why madame web is a step up from the other marvel movies of late one could speculate it is because the film was produced by sony  if that is the case maybe they want to try and give sony a go at a few of the other upcoming films in the mcu since madame web got some things correct allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Feb 19 2024,negative, im not sure where to start by now youve likely heard about sonys newest spiderverse entry madame web youve probably heard critics from early screenings talk about how bad it is watched tiktoks about how its the worst movie ever made seen a rotten tomatoes score that looks more like your cars interest rate than a film rating maybe youve even heard jokes about how it makes morbius look like the godfather yet what many of these reviews commentaries and videos fail to really understand about madame web is just how much work has been put into this project how much energy and time and effort it takes to create a film that fails on so many levels because make no mistake madame web is terrible its a burning dumpster thats been dropped from an ac130 into an inactive volcano filled with moldy fish its not just bad  its amazingly bad its the kind of bad thats so allencompassing that it cant possibly be an accident  its either the product of conscious decisionmaking or its a cosmic joke where the punchline is a shovel to the head things that failed the acting the acting is the kind of miserable lethargic exercise in dullness that you havent seen since the phantom menace its the kind of acting  and this goes for everyone  where you wonder if after every take director sj clarkson toast a game of thrones prequel that died in the womb would say cut ok lets try it again but with less effort the dialogue the dialogue  well the script in general  is so rote and clichéridden that it actually feels like parody every actor is wasted on the absolutely wretched lines theyre forced to deliver and there are great actors here sydney sweeney has a good bit of talent isabella merced too damn it adam scott is here playing  i shit you not  ben parker yes that ben parker does he say the famous line no he does not that line is instead delivered by a peruvian tribesman who lives in a tree i did not make that up finally well not finally but im running out of energy the gratuitous product placement its astonishing its almost admirable in its naked blatancy every can of pepsi practically glows every bottle of budweiser glistens with dew put it this way  the product placement is so overt and shameless that the villain is killed by a pepsi sign i did not make that up either nothing nothing worked this movie is a detestable altar of sacrifice to the gods of ignorance and greed a worthless strip of celluloid that should be buried under a landfill its a thing that should not be i am less for having seen it save yourselves
Feb 19 2024,negative, madame web is an 80m 63m film with the quality of an unlicensed superhero painted on the side of a carnival ride its desperate and seems embarrassed of itself the pained shrug of a creative team ordered by sony executives to keep the wheels turning in their spidermanadjacent universe all while the actual spiderman is out on loan to disneys marvel cinematic universe although its never clarified madame web is presumably meant to exist in the world of morbius and venom  where its heavily implied a spiderman exists possibly tom hollands but everyone is legally barred from mentioning it the film is set in 2003 there is an uncle ben adam scott whose sister emma roberts is about to give birth to a boy whose name she knows but physically cannot utter as if cursed by an ancient witch ben is coworkers with a paramedic named cassie webb dakota johnson whose mother was shot dead in the amazon while pregnant with her theres the line when you take on the responsibility great power will come  a garbled take on spidermans famous catchphrase made now to sound like a translation app gone awry the films script was partially cowritten by morbiuss matt sazama and burk sharpless who hit copy and paste on their superhero colonising their powers from the jungles of the americas cassies mother was on the trail of a rare peruvian spider whose venom can supercharge their cellular structure her security guard ezekiel tahar rahim shoots her dead and steals it to harness its powers leading him to nightly visions of his future demise at the hands of three spiderwomen  later a trio of unsupervised teenagers julia cornwall sydney sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced who hes determined to track down and kill after a neardeath experience cassie starts to experience premonitions that eventually land her as the disgruntled caretaker of the girls in the comic books madame web is an elderly woman and clairvoyant aid to spiderman the film has absolutely no idea what to do visually with that kind of power set so cassie can either yell at people to move out of the way or hit them with a car she spends the film switching between both options the film is obstinate in its internal logic cassies first port of call after witnessing the future is to visit her optometrist when she rescues these teen girls she promptly dumps them in the middle of the woods and drives off all because she wants to doublecheck something back at her apartment madame web makes time for cassie to conduct a cpr demonstration for her new wards but doesnt bother to explain how ezekiel got his hands on an evil spiderman suit more than a decade before spiderman existed the infamous bit of dialogue from the trailer that promptly went viral  he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died  doesnt actually feature in the finished product but theres plenty of opportunity for johnson who delivers every line like shes trying to catch ellen degeneres in a lie to say equally bizarre things i hope the spiders were worth it mom she says at one point obviously it was bad she died she sighs during another director sj clarkson who makes her transition here from television has a tendency to zoom in dramatically on actors faces during dialogue scenes its a trick usually deployed in reality tv to spice up banal conversations but madame web is fiction and has seemingly passed on the opportunity to make itself exciting  instead offering a twohour prelude to a 30second trailer for a sequel that will never happen ah well on to the next sony project augusts heavily delayed aaron taylorjohnson vehicle kraven the hunter lets see if that one can make a lick of sense
Feb 18 2024,negative, madame web with dakota johnson sydney sweeney isabella merced celeste oconnor tahir rahim screenplay by matt sazama burk sharpless claire parker and sj clarkson directed by sj clarkson rated pg13 for violenceaction and language 117 minutes in theaters dakota johnson is a wonderful actress who appears incapable of feigning enthusiasm as most of the job of a professional movie star involves answering the same stupid questions over and over while pretending to be excited about idiotic shit her listless vaguely dismissive junket interviews can feel like a blessed respite from the phony hollywood hype train johnson brings that same energy or lack thereof to madame web another calamitous comic book movie appearing at what finally feels like the sputteredout end of the genres cultural domination like venom and morbius before it and kraven the hunter coming later this year its one of sonys marveladjacent projects my understanding is that the studio retains the rights to make liveaction films featuring characters from the spiderman comics but not spidey himself which is why were seeing entire movies devoted to thirdtier villains this is the kind of idea only an executive could love flooding the market with bootleg knockoffs of a product people were already getting pretty sick of everyone in madame web looks like theyre in crummy mood the movie unfurls with all the verve of a contractual obligation while johnson works her trademark id rather be anywhere else vibe like we havent seen since she went viral for making ellen miserable theres almost a level of performance art to her portrayal of new york paramedic cassandra webb who after a neardeath experience begins to manifest psychic powers reminiscent of that old snl sketch spoofing the dead zone in which christopher walken could only see a minute or two into the future johnson was the only person involved in the fifty shades movies who played them as comedies about a woman learning to put up with a rich weirdo boyfriend who gets her off and she seems to be undermining madame web in an even more cheerfully destructive manner every time cassandra see what they did there is handed a soda as part of the movies obnoxiously omnipresent product placement johnson awkwardly rubs and fiddles with the can like shes never held one before in her life appearing either unwilling or unable to simply open and drink from it on camera its such a bizarre insanely distracting bit of business  she even inexplicably carries an unopened pepsi from one scene into the next like shes cradling a kitten  one can only assume the actress must be amusing herself at the expense of the film at least somebodys having fun for reasons too inane to recount here she winds up the clairvoyant protector and den mother to three teenage girls isabella merced celeste oconnor and cartoonishly voluptuous it girl of the moment sydney sweeney who are being hunted by a freakish billionaire with wallcrawling superpowers and a black spiderman costume even though spiderman hasnt been born yet more on that in a minute this villain is played by tahir rahim the marvelous actor from jacques audiards a prophet and hulus the looming tower miniseries who for some reason has had about 80 of his dialogue poorly redubbed and played over shots of the back of his head as if theyd hastily tried to rewrite the film in the editing room ive seen reality shows with more convincing adr sweeneys surprise sleeper hit from this past christmas anyone but you is still playing down the multiplex hall a testament to how much shoddy filmmaking audiences  myself included  are willing to overlook for the simple pleasures of watching attractive charismatic stars fall for one another in exotic locations i hope hollywood takes heed of the much ado about nothing riffs continued success and greenlights more shakespeare adaptations starring girls with giant gazongas sweeney isnt given much to do in madame web besides bicker with the other two teenagers they all have the same bratty personality and once in awhile noncommittedly throw food at each other while were teased with flashforwards of all three growing up to be the various incarnations of spiderwoman this is one of those wannabe franchise movies thats a prequel to itself so none of that actually happens in this installment they dont even get to wear the cool costumes from the comics instead sweeney spends the movie in a catholic schoolgirl outfit and cinematographer mario fiores inability to get a single flattering angle of her in it suggests he might be better suited for a job selling pencils johnsons dorky ambulance partner is played by adam scott he doesnt really have anything to do with the story but his name is ben parker and his sister is about to have a baby you can probably guess what the kids gonna be named but every time they try to tell you the movie cuts away presumably for legal reasons i guess its for the sake of this continuity quirk that madame web makes such a big deal out of being set in 2003 lingering on a massive billboard for beyonces dangerously in love album and a radio dj introducing britney spears toxic as a new track thats about to burn up the charts yet at the same time the rest of the music cues are all early 1990s hits by the likes of 4 non blondes and the cranberries i found this almost as perplexing as the soda can stuff despite taking place in new york city madame web was filmed in boston during the summer of 2022 which explains why queens looks so much like downtown crossing and why spidermans uncle lives around the corner from the south street diner you may remember that sweeney threw out the first pitch on the night that the red sox lost 285 to the toronto blue jays after seeing her on instagram housing a fenway frank i can understand why our boys in the bullpen might have been a little distracted over the past 25 years sean burns reviews interviews and essays have appeared in wburs the artery philadelphia weekly the improper bostonian metro the village voice nashville scene and rogerebertcom he stashes them all at spliced personality
Feb 18 2024,negative, for the past couple of years sony pictures has tried to build its comicbook series of films with their spiderman universe they want to compete against the other companies as well as complement what is being built in the mcu potentially connecting the two worlds into one giant amalgamation of blockbuster success the sony spiderman universe abbreviated as the ssu is meant to expand the sandbox of the friendly neighborhood superhero from queens by creating pictures about some of the supporting characters in the comics most of which center around villains hence the arrival of venom and venom let there be carnage and morbius into our local cinema it has to be said that these projects have been bankable for what they are worth  while critically panned audiences have managed to go out of their way to see these pictures no matter the disdain from the critics money tells the whole story fans of the source material or the superhero film craze have made their impact on ticket sales because of such plans for future sidecharacter action flicks are in play kraven the hunter which releases later this year and venom 3 coming next these films are in such a flux that it is hard to pinpoint exactly where they are headed in the grand scheme is there going to be a connective tissue to these films an avengers endgamelike picture that ties them so far theres no hint in sight they are working as separate pictures that mention the spiderpeople only by name without an appearance the webbing is quite messy the latest one to arrive is madame web helmed by television director sj clarkson shes known for her work in marvels the defenders jessica jones and anatomy of a scandal she has already had some experience in this world of superheroes via the aforementioned netflix shows clarkson only directed two episodes in each one of those series but that counts as background and experience to work with however with how the screenplay has been toyed with and manipulated i believe nobody was ever going to make madame web function as a proper film to begin with  with a disorganized premise and no vision in sight the latest installment in the ssu once again falls flat this time without an entertainment factor or social media gag to tie it with from the getgo there are a few issues theres a change to the madame web character in this film instead of having cassandra web be a blind paralyzed old woman hooked to a weblooking support system like in the comics she is a young paramedic named cassie whose psychic powers emerged during a workrelated accident the change comes with the casting of dakota johnson in the titular role shes a talented actress who has worked with many fantastic filmmakers from luca guadagnino with whom she has had her best work to maggie gyllenhaal  looking at it from another side no matter what version of the character she played johnson couldnt nail the nature of it all she didnt fit in that elevated superhero realm and that is for the better as she could do better in more exciting and rich projects than this one nevertheless the film begins with an expedition in the peruvian amazon we see a pregnant arachnologist kerry bishé and her travel partner tahar rahim searching for a rare spider whose venom is rumored to cure all diseases everything seems to be going as planned until they find the spider the expected act occurs and gives us the first impression of how plodding the rest of the film will be  a bite and a betrayal come into play which leaves the baby an orphan with powers she will handle in the future the concept of cassies powers is intriguing on paper somewhat leaning towards a terminatorlike territory the idea of having a person see and change the future as she pleases is not original per se yet the introduction at least the basics has some potential you can turn that into a worthwhile narrative now the problems arise when discussing the concepts execution this whole idea is an inexplicable mess that neither the writing team nor the characters can adequately explain the film then fast forwards to 2003 where we see cassie work as an emt  during one of her shifts she has an accident that almost costs cassie her life in that neardeath experience she awakens her psychic abilities of seeing and manipulating the future one of her visions included her coming across three teenage girlsjulia sydney sweeny anya isabela merced and mattie celeste oconnorwho are in great danger ezekiel is on the hunt searching for the girls hes a man cursed by his given gifts and now seeks a way to balance things out worried for their safety cassie groups the three girls and tries to find a way to stop the man who wants to kill them a chase film emerges from this premise but the necessary tension thrills or wit to give the viewer a fun time  immediately after this setup for the main plot point madame web goes on a trajectory of plodding repetition where we have scenes of cassie experiencing visions and ezekiel talking to himself about wanting to find the girls before it is too late these constant exposition dumps intertwined with the runningandgunning make this film a very frustrating experience to endure there seems to be a lack of vision in the action set pieces and the narrative itself one might ask if the team put some thought into these sequences they feel like copies of what came before but rendered to their most unimaginative states  madame web treads the same waters as the premcu comicbook movies of the early 2000s in the likes of catwoman elektra and daredevil it fits into this schematic not only because of its setting and talented cast attached but also because of its sloppy and messy nature at the center of this story is an interesting simple story that a filmmaker can play with multiple writers were in charge of writing this story and you immediately get the sensation that what we see onscreen is a simplification of an amalgamation of more than a dozen ideas there have been many bad comicbook movie releases recently the difference between a film like thor love and thunder and the flash and this one is that although they are poorly constructed you can understand the concept in madame web you cant even grasp it  hector gonzalez is a puerto rican tomatometerapproved film critic and the cofounder of the prca as well as a

Feb 17 2024,negative, sonys spiderman universe ssu was an idiosyncrasy long before madame web was conceived 2018s venom revealed that star and executive producer tom hardy is a bizarre man in the best way possible venom let there be carnage upped the slapstick puerile tone and morbius was a film allegedly best left unviewed i did the universe is doomed not to feature spiderman those disney mcu contracts are mysterious beasts and their unusual efforts to differentiate themselves from the superhero pack have left them out of touch with popular and critical taste the worst madame web could do was poke a few more holes in the sinking ship and its such an odd swing that it fails to land even that to be clear the value of madame web and all the ssu is entirely divorced from quality in my book as a longtime apologist of foxs xmen series i appreciate anyone working against the notion that superhero movies are bound to the mcu formula or even a genre for that matter the xmen movies were a mess and i loved them for their highs and lows the ssu has been all lows so far but theyre throwing away narrow notions of superhero movies too which earns them a soft spot in my heart the venom movies are easier to forgive theyre charmingly bad anchored by a committed performance from hardy that deserves the same beloved status hugh jackman earned in his decades as wolverine  how did they mess this up first off they made it an origin story boring were over it just have a scene where the new superheros powers are explained and get to the good stuff we dont need dakota johnsons cassandra webb running around as a disgruntled paramedic rejecting thank yous from kids and complaining about new york city traffic an accident on the job awakens her ability to see into the future which tips her off that three teenage girls are going to be murdered by a leeringly evil man with spiderlike abilities tahar rahim and her intervention leads to the movielong discovery of her powers only by the end is she truly madame web and boy is it a slog to spend that much time on a plot everyone knows like the back of their hand the good news is that theres fun to be had along the way mostly unintentionally the script is a mess of blunt exposition that leads to some hysterically undeliverable lines which is somehow topped by every single word out of rahims mouth feeling like it was delivered in a sound booth far away from the set and entirely divorced from the tone of the scene but what really exemplifies this films selfinflicted tomfoolery is a cat cassandra is a stubborn loner you see which must have made the writers think of breakfast at tiffanys so they give her a stray cat she calls cat as a fun reference they mercifully resisted casting an orange boy to play the stray you cant outdo orangey the legendary cat actor featured in breakfast at tiffanys instead they cast an unmistakable rotund chonker to waltz onscreen and lap up some milk two things here one why would you cast an overweight cat as your stray theres no good answer to this one two many adult cats are lactose intolerant and even if the kitty can keep it down cows milk doesnt provide the nutrition they need cassandra may as well have given the cat a bowl of the films ubiquitous product placement pepsi for all the good she was doing it or maybe the film is implying that she doesnt care about the cat at all and is purposefully inducing diarrhea or bulking up an already big boy dont worry the movie isnt that smart they just made a minor plot point make no sense a small thing amid major plot points that make no sense  the other inexplicable selfinflicted wound is the casting of dakota johnson her lowkey borderline petulant presence makes absolutely no sense as a burgeoning hero and whether this incongruity is a positive or negative will entirely come down to personal taste for me she operated as a salve that nearly healed the whole thing she never feels like she wants to be in the movie and the most verve she brings is when shes seemingly playing with the material talking down to the very movie shes leading johnson has long been making promotional work performance art remember her takedown of ellen degeneres and with madame web shes seemingly targeted this playful disdain for industry requirements on the ubiquity of superhero movies or maybe thats just wishful thinking on my part and she just delivered a terrible performance either way the performance is hilariously offkilter as jarring and strange as all of michelle williams work in the venom movies hence making it of a piece with the rest of the ssu the ssu just happens to be awful so bad some raise up the films as funbad im not quite there on madame web but i bet theres a slightly worse cut of the film that could nudge me over the edge
Feb 17 2024,negative,at best this movie feels like it exists to tease a more interesting film and drop spiderman easter eggs in execution the characters are all underdeveloped the performances wooden and the few good ideas waste
Feb 17 2024,negative, sonys fourth spiderman spinoff madame web was doomed from the beginning made in conjunction with marvel the superhero film features a passionless dakota johnson in her worst performance since the fifty shades of grey trilogy the story written by director sj clarkson and three cowriters including the team responsible for morbius gods of egypt the last witch hunter and dracula untold is filled with ridiculous dialogue and we get a secondrate villain played by tahir rahim who mutters his badly dubbed lines you dont have to be a clairvoyant to catch the warning signs just watch the trailer paramedic cassie webb dakota johnson saves lives when shes not being saved by her coworker ben parker adam scott after he rescues her from a submerged vehicle she awakens with superpowers including clairvoyance cassie sees snippets of the future which begin as weird moments of déjà vu when she begins to realize whats happening in groundhog day doover style her second sight puts her in the path of three teenage girls about to be murdered the teens played by sydney sweeny euphoria as nerdy white girl julia cornwall celeste oconnor ghostbusters afterlife as skateboarder mattie franklin and isabela merced as brainiac anya corazon are seen in cassies visions donning cool spidergirl suits while battling the storys villain ezekiel sims rahim who wears a black spiderman suit cassie saves the girls who dont know each other when they come together on the subway the scene filled with lackluster cgi the saying a hero is only as good as its villain is a cliché but there is truth to that line in madame webb rahim a good french actor whose breakthrough performance came in 2009s a prophet is dreadful as the storys barefoot dapperdressed antagonist ezekiel who speaks in an annoying low gravel rahim is in competition with johnson for the films worst performance webb takes place in 2003 as evidenced by britney spearss toxic which spurs the girls to table dance in a roadside diner while expressing their love for the new jam this is just before ezekiel shows up trying to kill them again only to be saved by cassie the song seven nation army by the white stripes would have worked better in the scene and it falls in line with the timeframe when cassie discovers an old photograph dated 1973 of her late mother constance kerry bishé with ezekiel in the amazon jungle she travels to the site where she encounters the leader of las arañas a group of spidermen who travel across the treetops and we learn more of the webbs backstory complete with betrayal and a mythical spider the film opens with the amazon scene before jumping 30 years to nyc  apart from the bad and insensitive dialogue cassie asking her partner ben who cant wait to be an uncle if he wants to get shot in queens has spurred an online backlash the origin storys biggest problem is that its 2hours of setup followed by the credits the films ending should have happened 45 minutes into the film leading to a fully realized madame webb mentoring the teens as they become spidergirls preparing to battle ezekiel for the rest of the story as is we get glimpses of a much better film in cassies visions showing the young women in greatlooking costumes battling an older greyhaired ezekiel pepsis product placement is so conspicuous that the films climax involves a fight scene on a giant neon billboard for the cola madame webb follows sonys spiderverse spinoffs venom and venom let there be carnage plus the jared leto vampire flick morbius all of which are better than this hot mess  adam scott mike epps zosia mamet and emma roberts as pregnant mary parker cue the music are wasted in the film the silver lining is at least they are not subject to much of the horrible dialogue i like dakota johnson shes given us many terrific performances including 2022s cha cha real smooth but she is miscast as cassie and for most of the film she delivers her lines with a lack of enthusiasm i dont blame her the song bury a friend by billie eilish serves as a harbinger of bad films it was featured in the trailers for madame webb and night swim on the small screen it has the opposite effect as the foreboding track fits perfectly as the theme for hbos true detective night country mailing address 2003 8th ave 300 fort worth tx 76110phone 8174059318email hellofortworthreportorgour missionwe pledge to produce highquality objective local journalism that informs public decisionmaking addresses the quality of life of our communitys citizens holds our policymakers accountable and tells our readers stories by listening to them and making sure they are valued and understood in all that we do earning the trust and respect of our audience is paramount our reporting will be free to all who access our primary digital channels
Feb 17 2024,negative, yikes ive made a habit and a living from pulling the wings off the more pitiful creatures caught up in the marvel and dc universe but arriving at madame web with fortinbras timing some two days after its release i find the carcass stripped clean by critics and audiences alike this is a bad movie we can all agree on as the nadir moving forward this is multiverse metaverse cobblersoverse stuff from sony licencing the spiderman universe from marvel but somehow not having the rights to show the main character ie a worthless property i remember the speculation when all this potential with ip was initially being unlocked theyd say imagine a film about miss monneypenny but who wants that she sits at her desk and flirts with the male staff thats all she does make her do anything else and shes just not miss monneypenny anymore theres absolutely nothing in madame webs universe to make it worth exploring for supposed fans of this genre so set your selfserving gobbledygook threshold to overload and lets get stuck in instead of the aged psychic grandma in the comics this madame web is cassandra webb a spunky nyc ambulance driver played by dakota johnson the daughter of a woman who had her health restored by mysterious spidermen after giving birth in the jungle in peru in 1973 why a heavily pregnant woman in 1973 would be in a jungle investigating spider people might seem like an issue until you set eyes on tahar rahim so good in a prophet now looking like benedict cumberbatch playing manuel from fawlty towers and speaking the same kind of englishassheisspoke except the words never come out of his mouth you have no idea of the torment and torture of dying all over againcan you imagine how frustrating its been trying to identify someone youve only seen in a vision sigh whats gone so wrong for sj clarksons movie so it looks like they planned this movie as a religious nativity scene around the birth of andrew garfields spider man then redid it around tom hollands incarnation of peter parker theres continual compelling visual evidence through sound and music that its 2003 and not 1993 for all the difference that makes theres timespecific adverts for pepsi and beyonce and characters discuss how britney spears toxic has just come out webbs coambulance driver is adam scott from parks and rec but hes so old now hes playing peter parkers uncle ben so that madame web can help him with his mad rush to the hospital for the birth of spiderman madame web also goes to a baby shower for bens sister mary emma roberts and has prophetic visions of the future that may not come true meanwhile ezekiel sims rahim has a vision of a gaggle of costumed and accessorised marvelsjustice societywho cares spidergirls killing him and is tracking down the young women and kill them first all you need to know is that madame webs badlyedited dejavu visions enable her to change the future save the girls and kill the baddie madame web wins out in annoying fashion because although she claims she cant control her powers she gives every scene a doover when she doesnt get what she wants and the audience have to watch the same action over and over again with different outcomes similarly the filmmakers seem to have had several doovers at adjusting the timeperiod characters and storyline here with telltale dialogue not synchronised with the images sydney sweeney is amongst those buried in the jumble johnson cant do anything as a character who spends her recreational time staring at her own birth certificate in an effort to remind herself and us of who she is nor can johnson do much with a scene in which madame web rescues the girls by stealing a taxi and driving it through the window of a restaurant an act which fails to arouse any consequence in a fakey new york that looks like it was smooshed together from old photographs and adverts he can climb on walls how is that even possible the hipster spidergirl team ask about ezekiel sims opening up another confusing question i thought peter parker was trying to protect his own identify rather than the existence of all superheroes ever perhaps thats why his birth takes on an almost biblical reverence here with uncle ben as joseph its hard to find the right words to close out this gibberish gumbo of remixed rehashed lore but somehow madame web provides it in the climax when you take on responsibility great power will come sony had madame web written by the guys who wrote morbius they were so pleased with how hard that turd flushed i wouldnt trust them to empty my bins and yet here we are the verdict is in file madame web along with elektra and the most annoying confusing unwanted cashgrab spinoffs at the end of the comic book era im blaming the distributors nothing else to see except this and memory so as depressing a double bill as i can remember interesting to see the bullet sydney sweeney dodged actually the three kids were impressive thought the superhero costumes plain awful who in their right mind could have greenlit such nonsense this is pretty much a prequel and dakota johnson just looks plain puzzled to be in it the whole alternative future notion is quite clever but gets boring quickly at least i saw them months apart but theyre both bleak but in different ways being able to see a minute into the future is like a cheat code rather than a superpower no chance of losing out while youre resetting every time things go against you so like spidermans fluid her powers dry up whenever she really needs them i think constant recutting has rendered this film as gibberish i genuinely cant imagine this getting greenlit on that script its also worth noting that all the mcu and dc hate is directed towards female led films indicating that male fanboy angst is driving the collapse of these franchises interesting gender perspective  did they hammer black widow as well it looked like they reshot stuff to bring in that other element it wasnt much of a concept and giving a glimpse of what the teenagers could do was like a credit sequence just awful so much manoeuvring yet i genuinely didnt get who these girls were or what this had to do with peter parker being born or why there were no other superheroes apart from ezekiel sims it was like reading the manual for a product you cant use written in a language you barely speak they can have that quote for the poster im both a big marvel and dakota johnson fan i found this awful just awful there are a couple of scenes with dialogue that sounds like artificial intelligence wrote it which is not a compliment the marketing folks were more than devious when it came to the trailer but they had to do something to make it look watchable  dont want to spoil anything for those who venture forth now to be sure i dont think it is the worst superhero movie ever made i think the best way to sum it all up is it looks like it was produced and directed in the time period it is actually set in which also is not a compliment dakota is so much better suited to cha cha real smooth and peanut butter falcontype roles a superheroinenope felt like an elektra period marvel movie compromised ham fisted product johnson good in the films you mention but has an impossible role to play here that chat either the spider people was awful and the stuff between rahim and zozie mamet was absolute cringe did they change the time period after it was shot i couldnt work out exactly what had gone wrong but something did pulling kraven the whatever he was from last year suggests its a turkey as well you cant tell from the trailer quite how off the rails this goes not good you comparing it to elektra was all that was needed to sink this ship even psychic grandma could have foretold that sony would screw this up why couldnt sony have just made a psychic grandma movie thats what the fanboys want maybe not with her in it but set in that universe oddly enough thats one of a blizzard of problems here madame web has intimate do overs so cant lose as a superhero of course her ability to use her super powers comes and goes just like how spideys web fluid runs out at key moments when the narrative suits its kiddie stuff out of curiosity was there any dumb sinister six stuff here no vulture no morbius have they given up on the dream of a sinister six movie without the guy the sinister six are supposed to fight no nothing im sure there are better placed than me to get the easter eggs that are usually jammed into this i was out the door before any postmid credits malarkey but apparently theres none it seems to be about establishing this all girl spiderman alternative team but they dont seem to have names character or even costimes the way they appear in the trailer is somehow outside the scope of the film no venom no anything i cant even see what a fanboy would get from this maybe on your second watch things will click into place to be honest all the bad press had me kind of interested and the trailer actually looks kind of interesting but still pretty sure ill pass this demo site is only for demonstration purposes all images are

Feb 17 2024,negative, madame web sonys latest entry in its ongoing spiderman universe is a tangled mess not winkingly fun enough to be camp its an embarrassment of dull action sloppy plotting and a protagonist who seems like she wishes she were anywhere else dakota johnson persuasion plays cassie webb a new york city paramedic whose driving skills are her greatest skill before she becomes clairvoyant her second sight activates after she nearly dies on the job granting her visions that first feel like déjà vu then evolve into her seeing a mysterious man attacking three teenage girls the seeds of cassies power come from the peruvian jungle where her late mother constance kerry bishé decades earlier searched for a spider that could cure various illnesses upon learning the amazing arachnid also grants people wallcrawling powers and super strength a colleague ezekiel tahar rahim napoleon doublecrossed the pregnant constance shooting her and stealing the spider redsuited spider men laughably drop from the jungle canopy to help but only manage to save the baby along with a suitcase full of convenient photos and journals flashforward to 2003 where the adult cassie has a work partner named ben parker adam scott severance whos excited to be an unclethe only spideyrelated tangent the film has meanwhile ezekiel has become wealthy but obsesses over a recurring vision where the teens kill him once they develop special powers and their own spider gear every day that goes by my appointment with death grows closer he says that holds true for us all although its not clear what ezekiel does with his precious time beyond sit in a highrise drive a corvette and growl at zosia mamet molli and max in the future as a techsavvy underling after fate places cassie in the girls proximity cassie intervenes when ezekiel in a spider suit crawls on subway ceilings and more without anyone noticing new yorkers are notoriously blasé but come on set in queens new jersey and the peruvian jungle by way of filming locations in massachusetts and canada the films screwy geography is the least of its problems four credited screenwritersmatt sazama burk sharpless claire parker and director sj clarksonbarely develop the story or these characters they dont even bother to have cassie do proper cpr which is a key plot point she just does chest compressions not the breaths the american red cross recommends johnson has become known for her dry deadpan delivery in interviews but that demeanor here reads as if shes tired and miserable as the teens sydney sweeney anyone but you isabela merced migration and celeste oconnor a good person bicker between tabledancing at a diner while theyre supposed to be lying low the action such as it is often involves cassie driving a stolen cab or ambulance the film cares nothing for continuity or basic common sense with her driving the same smashedup cab before and after popping down to peru clarkson anatomy of a scandal films cassies visions at varying speeds repeating the same moments until cassie realizes shes seeing the future the less said about the wispy weblike special effects the better the context of madame web as a film is more interesting than anything onscreen the ringer this week and npr previously covered how sony legally must churn out something related to spiderman every few years or lose the movie rights to the friendly neighborhood webslinger that sony has held since 1999 sometimes that generates pop culture magic such as with the recent tom hollandled spiderman trilogy or the animated oscarwinning spiderman into the spiderverse other projects such as the tom hardyled venom films have a bmovie goofiness thats hard to resist madame web essentially kicks the rights issue down the road until another project like this years kraven the hunter arrives further enmeshing spiderman within sonys clutches although spidey cant legally untangle himself viewers at least can tap outand should valerie kalfrin is an awardwinning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at rogerebertcom in their own league script the hollywood reporter and other outlets also a screenwriter and script consultant shes passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability lets tell better stories and tell stories better
Feb 17 2024,neutral, madame web would be fun if it was a lot better or a lot worse its nowhere good enough to be a firstrate superhero movie nor is it bad enough to be an amusing batman  robinstyle trainwreck the story takes place in 2003 and indeed the film feels like the comic book fare of the early to mid2000s  stuff like elektra catwoman and the punisher when filmmakers were still trying to figure out how to bring secondtier characters into the liveaction realm and since its an origin story the plot ends at the spot where most people will wish it began new york city emt cassie webb dakota johnson inexplicably begins getting glimpses of the immediate future after a neardeath experience her visions involve three teenage girls juila sydney sweeney mattie celeste oconnor and anya isabella merced theyre in peril from ezekiel sims tahar rahim a guy with spiderlike powers who has had his own premonition that they will one day kill him cassie attempts to rescue the girls while simultaneously figuring out how her abilities tie into his if you guessed he was in the amazon with her mom researching spiders before she died youve obviously seen the trailer the screenplay for madame web is atrocious writers matt sazama and burk sharpless also wrote dracula untold the last witch hunter power rangers and morbius their track record is obviously not great sims is a flat uninteresting villain with paperthin motivation the dialogue is frequently awkward and when the girls become costumed crimefighters at the end no explanation is given for how that occurs superhero origin stories need strong characterization and tight plotting to make viewers care about the buildup we know were not going to see the familiar madame web and the spiderwomen until the final minutes so if we arent invested in their genesis the result is empty  surprisingly little action takes place in the movie when it does the editing is confusingly choppy thereby robbing it of excitement director sj clarksons idea of style is to have the camera flip over during the middle of fight scenes a technique that reeks of desperation and becomes tiresome the concluding battle is particularly messy with shoddy cgi and a corny bit of product placement that finds everybody brawling in front of a pepsi sign actually product placement is ubiquitous a calvin klein billboard factors prominently into another scene for all thats bad about madame web a level of entertainment does exist thanks to the actresses dakota johnson is terrific giving a funny selfknowing performance she seems to recognize how dumb the story is and her turn as cassie almost plays like sarcastic commentary on it on their side sweeney oconnor and merced work up fun chemistry as the teens each provides her character with personality despite the bland script collectively they keep the movie from sinking into bottombarrel marvel fare ie morbius and fantastic four the four leads are easily the best thing here they could headline a gradea superhero movie or shine in an intentionally goofy entry like the marvels instead theyre trapped in a poorly written stiffly directed dud what a waste
Feb 17 2024,negative, it gives me no pleasure to report this because we could use some fresh and original superhero adaptations on the big screen these days but the dakota johnsonstarring madame web is one of the worst comic book movies ive ever seen everything about it seems flat and artificial and contrived from the limp dialogue to the annoying special effects to some surprisingly uninspired performances given the talent level of the cast even some of the actors come across as if theyd rather be anywhere else but in front of a blue screen pretending to fight a lackluster and illdefined marvel villain while straining to be heard over all the audio pyrotechnics madame web kicks off with a cheesy and poorly shot prologue set in the amazon in 1973 with kerry bishé as constance webb a ninemonthspregnant researcher desperately seeking to discover a legendary spider with magical venom that could unlock i dont know the cures for diseases and the mysteries of life and all that jazz when constance finally finds the spider she is betrayed and shot by her hired security expert one ezekiel sims tahar rahim constance dies while giving birth to a baby girl flash forward to 2003 and queens where cassie webb dakota johnson is working as a paramedic with a bewilderedlooking adam scott as her best friend and partner ben ben hmmmm or maybe not hmmm now we know its 2003 because we see a terribly photoshopped billboard for beyoncés dangerously in love and britney spears toxic is prominently featured and at one point cassie says i gotta get home in time for idol  even though nothing about her cynical hardbitten character would indicate shed be a fan of american idol or even own a tv with the fifty shades of grey star doing her best to let us know she knows this is all camp nonsense cassie starts to experience jarring and often violent miniflashforwards to the immediate future these constant visions are rendered through the use of a split diopter lens as well as some audio stingers that result in some of the most grating sequences ive ever experienced each one of these scenes should come with two caplets of tylenol in this same timeline ezekiel is experiencing his own visions in which he is killed by three future spiderwomen in present day theyre still teenage girls who have yet to become superheroes ezekiels plan is to kill them now before they can kill him later celeste oconnor foreground from left isabela merced and sydney sweeney play teenagers destined to become spiderwomen who need the protection of madame web dakota fanning through a strange series of coincidences that might not be coincidences cassie meets the trio and vows to protect them celeste oconnor is mattie franklin isabela merced is anya corazon and sydney sweeney is julia cornwall they are all paperthin characters  required by the script to behave like absolute idiots and constantly put themselves in danger even when they know some sort of ceilingcrawling maniac is trying to kill them after a series of clunky poorly choreographed and fakelooking battle sequences we get a tease to a sequel that most likely will never happen if were lucky 
Feb 17 2024,negative,it collapses so pathetically that studio executives might as well have dialed 911 to rescue it 
Feb 17 2024,positive, sony is taking another crack at making a spiderman movie without the titular character venom and its sequel were decent morbius was a guilty pleasure that was lambasted by critics so where does madame web rank a bit closer to the latter madame web follows cassie webb dakota johnson a new york paramedic who after a neardeath experience discovers she can see pieces of the future and even change the outcome as shes struggling to learn how her new ability works webb comes across three girls who are being hunted by a mysterious man with spiderlike abilities the man is ezekiel sims tahar rahim a wealthy researcher who stole a rare spider from an isolated peruvian tribe in a remote region of the amazon the spider gave him powers but also cursed him to repeatedly see visions of his death and that future death would supposedly come at the hands of three girls played by sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor in order to prevent his death ezekiel decides to use his powers and fortune to track down the girls who would grow up to become spiderwomen and kill them before they get their powers seeing ezekiel murder them in several visions cassie resolves to protect the teens until she can find a way to stop ezekiel but the key to her future turns out to lie in her past specifically her mothers journey to and death in the amazon  with a 14 percent score on rotten tomatoes its clear critics and audiences dont think highly of madame web its corny the writing is at times nonsensical and the editing can be downright nauseating at times the effects one of the key components of any superhero film have moments in this movie that give madame web the appearance of a rough cut rather than a completed project this is most apparent in the climax which takes place atop an exploding fireworks warehouse this is a film that will fall to pieces at any point with even a shred of serious thinking how can a wanted paramedic afford to charter a private plane to peru on short notice its inexplicably set in 2003 but seems to feature technology more common in 2024 especially where ezekiels woman in the chair hackerassistant is concerned  johnson does her absolute best to give a charming performance in a film burdened with such nonsensical and cliche writing but theres only so much she can do she clearly has the acting chops to deliver a strong performance in a dramatic role as shown in cha cha real smooth some of her efforts shine through but most of cassies standout moments are swallowed by the storm of mediocrity that makes up madame web  parks and recreation fans who accidentally stumble into a theater to watch madame web will be pleased to see adam scott playing cassies emt partner hes perhaps the best part of this film and all he had to do was channel his inner ben wyatt madame web feels like an early 2000s superhero movie outside of its own time and that seems to be sonys vibe with these sort of spiderman movies without everybodys favorite webslinger but whereas venom and its followup made decent money morbius floundered and madame web will likely flop what remains to be seen is which camp kraven the hunter will fall into for what its worth this critic had fun watching all the aforementioned movies masterpieces no enjoyable for what they are possibly for a select few that will be enough
Feb 17 2024,negative,not to pile on but sadly this film repeatedly fails to find its legs all eight of them a disjointed and chemistryless origin story that barely draws from the original the most fun part is the incredulous discussions youll have after 
Feb 16 2024,negative, cassandra webb develops the power to see the future forced to confront revelations about her past she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies if they can all survive a deadly present one of the great blunders in recent hollywood history involves the executives at sony pictures circa 2000 rejecting a deal that would have given them the rights to every superhero in the marvel universe the comic book company had just filed for bankruptcy and were in desperate need of a cash infusion so when sony exec yair landau was sent to inquire about their studio obtaining the rights to spiderman marvel chief ike perlmutter had an alternate proposition for him  take all our characters for 25 million when landau reported the offer to his bosses they rejected it saying no one gives a  about any of the other marvel characters go back and do a deal for spiderman this deal was closed for 10 million as for the rest of the characters apparently a great many people gave a  about them ever since realizing their mistake sony has been trying to jump on the superhero bandwagon with various incarnations of the webslinger as well as films focused on ancillary characters in his universe which they have the rights to the result has been misguided efforts like the overblown venom 2018 and its sequel the misguided morbius 2022 and now the absolutely awful madame web a mess of a movie that is at times so incredibly inane it may have a future as a cult classic jump ahead to 2002 and cassie dakota johnson is a new york city paramedic who has always been socially a step behind everyone else on a call one day she has a near death experience which unlocks some latent psychic abilities now she can see the future something she has in common ezekiel who has come to the big apple to track down julia cornwall sydney sweeny anya corazon isabel merced and mattie franklin celeste oconnor he has foreseen that these three teenagers will kill him and he wants to beat them to the punch fortunately cassie can see what is to play out and comes to their rescue overplotted and underwritten the film contains some of the most simplistic dialogue in recent memory as well as character actions that make little sense johnson does her level best to bring a bit of fun to this and shes the best part of the movie while her young counterparts accord themselves as well as they can however even the most skilled thespians would be unable to salvage this lifeless desperate product i dont require an aaron sorkinlike script or perfect plotting from a superhero movie but on the other hand i expect more than the nonsensical mess concocted by four writers presented here

Feb 16 2024,negative, four people worked on the screenplay for madame web 2024 and every one of them should be ashamed it wants to bill itself as a psychological thriller with action and adventure but it feels like the longest commercial for medication that helps you remember where you put your keys its difficult to imagine someone not sitting down after drinking heavily and saying how can we maintain a connection to spiderman without actually saying spiderman and other drunk people threw out a bunch of ideas after skimming a wikipedia article and consulting a dirty sock and voila a germ of a parasite of an idea formed and madame web was born in deepest darkest peru constance web kirby bishe searches in vain for a rare spider whose venomous properties could be the key to solving disease forever she has selfish ulterior motives for finding and potentially wiping out a species of arachnid for an untested chemical property that is literal years away from being tested in humans while risking disease and permanent injury to her unborn child but thats a flashback for another time her guide or sherpa or assistant or himbo tagging along for the malaria ezekiel sims tahar rahuim doublecrosses her and steals her prize constance is mortally injured but her child is saved by a secret tribe of spider people with the promise that the child will return to the hidden jungle when shes ready to learn the truth i can think of no bigger screw you colonizer than making a child work for answers to questions she doesnt know shes supposed to ask thirty years later in 2003 cassie is a paramedic with the social skills of a jutting tree root she was raised in the foster system and holds a grudge against her mother for having the audacity to die in a forest cassie is getting flashes of déjà vu and visions of terrible events to come but lacks the selfawareness or common sense the good lord gave a box of hair to do anything about it through poor judgement and basic incompetency she finds herself in charge of three impulsive and unattended teenagers sydney sweeney celeste oconnor isabela merced and must keep them alive by abandoning them in a forest abandoning them at a motel and ditching them with a friend so she can do some research which involve going through her mothers 30year old research things and looking thoughtful then she does a turn and burn to deepest darkest peru  last minute on a paramedics salary  matching 30yearold photographs to the everchanging wilderness to get the mystical answers she seeks meanwhile ezekiel sims has somehow become very wealthy but frankly isnt any smarter he has also acquired spiderperson powers like strength and walking on ceilings from the spider he stole from constance how no one has time for villainous origin stories when we have an entire heros origin story to screw up he also sees his own future death at the hands of three women in spider costumes he sets out to stop these women now yet in their past by using advanced ctv technology how this knowledge is obtained using a stolen nsa key card with the weakest system password any 12yearold could have hacked isnt mentioned because those are details clever screenwriters come up with ignoring that taking action on a future event automatically changes how the future plays out madame web plods along for nearly two hours if youre expecting to discover how the three spider women become spider women with extra legs the power of flight and electrical webs this movie isnt it madame web is not a movie anyone deserves and sony slipped this to reviewers mere hours before its premiere its the sort of passive hand off thats not a sign of great confidence dakota johnson known best for some of the most lackluster erotic scenes ever committed to film from fan fiction doesnt just sleepwalk through madame web shes in a vegetative state letting the action happen all around her when her character is feeling motivated its only to run  run to the car run to the ambulance run through the warehouse all to be just a bit too late to be effective the choices cassie webb makes barely serve her reckless behavior as a paramedic but were supposed to believe that from this mess of a human will be reborn as the great mutant precog madame web no we wont thanks madame web force feeds the kind of midcentury morality that says single women will prove their worthiness to society if they refuse to get married and have children see the sentinel 1977 in this case cassie ends up sacrificing fundamental pieces of herself to become dependent upon the next generation of spider people her children this plot twist to bring the movie in line with comic canon completely ignores the previous 110 minutes while also ignoring the entire set up of the film if you allow yourself to get angry now you can save yourself the price of a movie ticket and the gas since were at it lets talk about the music if youre going to set a movie in 2003 maybe have music released in 2003 thats what made other loud action movies like bumblebee 2018 so much fun by using relatable identifiable music from the era there are six pop tunes in madame web dreams by the cranberries 1992 whats up by 4 non blondes 1993 bitch by meredith brooks 1997 i think were alone now by tiffany 1997 scandalous by misteeq not released in the us until 2004 and toxic by britney spears 2004 i can pull the billboard top 100 for 2003 and blindly pick more appropriate songs like bring me to life by evanescence or miss independent by kelly clarkston like everything else it appears not even the barest effort was exerted for the music and since music sets the tone for scenes all of it felt off and awkward finally i want every single one of you to apologize to the marvels 2023 because despite the pileon due to the cast the director and the screenwriter all women it was an enjoyable 105 minutes and told a complete story not madame web though and because it didnt tell a complete story there is the implied threat of future movies its disrespectful madame web is rated pg13 for mild swears lots of spiders many instances of the bird explosions truck accidents ambulance accidents people falling people getting poisoned childbirth and more spiders
Feb 16 2024,negative,so pathetic it makes someone want to go back in time and give the execs who keep commissioning these movies arachnophobia
Feb 16 2024,negative,i owe an apology to the marvels madame web was one of the most painful theatrical experiences of my entire life
Feb 16 2024,negative,too many writers revising rudderless material so that sony can keep hold of the rights to this ip and share in marvel studios profits when linked to tom hollands spiderman 
Feb 16 2024,negative, barely 10 to 20 minutes in it is easy to see the bleak future of the twohour movie  and the franchise that might be on the anvil over at sony it goes nowhere the dialogue is hamfisted the action amateurish the visual effects rudimentary and the final outcome disastrous as for the acting the less said the better and that certainly isnt for want of effort the actors strive very hard indeed the strain shows with an overload of inanities to deal with and tide over the cast  besides dakota johnson it includes sydney sweeney and tahar rahim  is hardpressed to pull the proceedings out of the fire there is little humour going around most of the films attempts at being funny fall flat and the bursts of energy that peppers madame web are too overly affected to be effective dakota johnson she of the three 50 shades films is saddled with a role that approximates the characters arc in the film  until the very end she struggles to figure out who andor what she can be if she were to put her mind to it in her original comicbook avatar madame web is an aged sightless wheelchair user endowed with powers that help her see the future in time to be able to stop or alter unwanted events in the movie cassandra cassie webb johnson is a new york fire department ambulance driver who is constantly racing against time an accident triggers a startling change in her she experiences disturbing visions of the immediate future that alarm and forewarn her unlike the cassandra of greek mythology three girls she decides to help against a malefic force believe her helpful prognoses first up cassie saves very casually if not unintentionally a pigeon from a death foretold and then moves on to bigger creatures and lives as it dawns upon her with a bit of help from a figure hidden in her past that she is no ordinary 30yearold woman the villain played by rahim the french actor has never been so shoddily treated by a movie script can crawl on ceilings swoop upon his prey at will and emit a fatal neurotoxin from his hand but neither he nor the film has a way of wriggling out of the web of mediocrity that they are caught in madame web is deadonarrival fare disneys marvel movies when things tend to go right often deliver levels of entertainment that can keep audiences invested in the makebelieve world that they conjure up with all their might in madame web nothing works nothing at all an overwhelming dullness creeps into everything that sonys columbia picturesproduced film rustles up most of the action in madame web takes place in new york in 2003 the period movie feel that director sj clarkson and her production designers seek to impart to it  to help the audience get a sense of the time and place pepsi cans of a certain vintage a giant calvin klein hoarding through which the heroine drives an ambulance and a poster announcing beyonces debut album are thrown in  seeps into the overall look and texture of the film and not always in a good way madame web is stylistically obsolete and technically sloppy  it is at most times reminiscent of the time when hollywood superhero movies were only beginning to find their way forward and paving the ground for a spate the mcu fare that now crowds everything out madame web opens in the peruvian amazon where cassies pregnant mother constance kerry bishe is on an expedition to look for a rare spider with healing abilities she is betrayed by an evil associate ezekiel sims rahim who wants the spider for himself constance dies but not before being bitten by ab arachnid and giving birth to cassandra cassie webb who acquires psychic powers thanks to the beneficial venom that passed on to her the rest of the film has neither bite nor bang as the baddie who too foresees his death in a vision and sets out to eliminate the three teenage girls who he knows will cause his demise the girls are just girls but each possesses the potential to be a spiderwoman still in their teens they are well away form acquiring any real powers that is where cassie comes in she has visions that reveal troubling events of the immediate future she babysits the three girls  julia cornwall sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced  babes in the woods who need all the handholding that they can get from cassie  through the tough situations thrown at them by the crawling menace that ezekiel turns into if one were able to say that all this is fun while it lasts madame web might have just about passed muster since it isnt the movie is exhausting pointless and totally bereft of the kind of flashy  and superficial  craft that superhero movies usually ride on it is all very well to rustle up a femalecentric superhero movie but all that madame web is likely to do is give all that are involved with the making of this forgettable movie a bad name that will be difficult to live down it would be regarded as the worst of its kind had it not been competing with morbius the sony spiderman universe monstrosity that preceded it
Feb 16 2024,negative,the cast is this films only redemption but even they cant salvage a dreadfully bland script beyond the writing there are pacing and editing issues for days 
Feb 16 2024,negative, after the incomparable success of spiderman across the spiderverse on every conceivable level sony pictures decided to dig deeper into the spiderverse this time pulling out a character that most mainstream moviegoers know little about and make her the focus of their next big motion picture so instead of a movie about hobie brown spiderbyte or even spiderrex we got madame web  as for the characters only cassie and her buddy ben adam scott are somewhat fleshed out while no one else receives any type of character development beyond what the film requires for a specific scene or moment everyone either needs to be saved or they are the villain or they are ben other than that they are filler johnson and her spiderstans do a decent enough job and are committed to the material but rahim as sims is one of the worst screen villains in the last few years which is saying quite a bit considering we were just subjected to modok in antman and the wasp quantumania darbenn in the marvels and atticus noble in rebel moon sims is a thirdrate saturday morning bad guy straight from the wacky races who literally screams where are my spiders while waking up in a cold sweat 
Feb 16 2024,neutral,im not sure veteran television director sj clarkson feels fully in control of her debut feature but she deserves kudos for keeping in as much of johnsons compellingly quirky performance and compiling a pitchperfect collection of bangers
Feb 16 2024,negative, the sony picture universe of marvel characters elegantly abbreviated as spumc has been suffering tremendously as it attempts to pad the marvel cinematic universe unfortunately for madame web the attempt to parallel the success of spiderman through alternative means has teed itself up to forever live in infamy by spinning a story nobody asked for sonys decision to greenlight madame web in the state that it was is astounding the fact that the entire filming process was complete edited and somewhat promoted proves that studios are willing to create content for the sake of using marvels sake  even in vain what exactly was the motivation here besides spitting on the spiderman legacy was it worth pouring a lifechanging amount of money into morbius for women the entire concept of madame web is inconceivable but the execution is shockingly poor then again who exactly is madame web for its prepeter parker and yet miscalculates the birthday of tom hollands webslinger in the marvel cinematic universe look superhero movies arent for everyone and thats understandable but would it kill sonys creative team to factcheck the timeline they assumedly wanted to align with screenwriting has become an incredibly fluid art form yet those credited on madame webs screenwriting team may want to remove this specific title from their portfolio altogether every scene feels like an absolute chore to get through and theres nothing particularly interesting about how the screenplay is written  the most memed line from the trailer he was in the amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders right before she died isnt even in the movie itself  line deliveries are lifeless and flat  no member of this cast could be bothered to sincerely engage with the script and their apathy is more than present its as if lead actress dakota johnson had a completely different idea in mind when her agent booked her for a marvel movie she works through madame web as if shes in a daze and is already thinking about how she can redeem her career after agreeing to take such a dismal role madame web is  marveladjacent and serves as another illfated attempt at repackaging characters that havent been locked under disneys domain  that being said marvels ongoing quest to remain relevant outside of its moreanticipated properties didnt exactly stick the landing  its sincerely puzzling as to why sony insisted that madame web was even made it holds no stake in sony pictures regretfullygrowing marvel subuniverse nor does it bear any deeper significance for marvels mainline movies  it exists for the sake of existing and in the most pitiful way everything about madame web effectively works against its favor an incohesive plot questionable dialogue an apathetic cast and cringeinducing cgi elevate a predictably bad movie into an even more abysmal one if theres one thing about madame web its that its the perfect movie to pirate through an incredibly shady secondhand torrent site save your money and skip this one completely  110
Feb 16 2024,negative, after a couple of venom films and a morbius im not sure if madame web will bring any valuable weight to sonys spidermanless spiderman universe granted tom hardy has pulled in high numbers with his wild take on eddie brock and who knows maybe the upcoming kraven the hunter will spin this web of missed opportunities in a more vital direction however as it stands for all the merit that could come with a film designed to be relatively standalone and focused on strong female characters that would ideally appeal to a teen girl audience missing the mark in so many ways does no one any favors and likely keeps peter parker swinging in a different direction while anyone at least a little comic book savvy or those who remember their spiderman cartoons well enough likely recalls the character of madame web as being a blind elderly woman who sits in a fancy chair and passes along cryptic clues to our favorite webhead this is a film that wants to go over how someone rose to be in this position set in 2003 a loosely applied date as several elements suggest this was not always the year the movie was supposed to be set in the goal of madame web is to establish how a paramedicturnedclairvoyant will lead a team of spiderwomen sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor to take on various bad guys why we need a whole movie to establish this rather than get straight to it emphasizes one of the key issues in this film and why it feels like a regression for 2024 comic booksuperhero movies having to go through the motions means watching madame web stumble through a series of scenes weve seen in plenty of these movies by now whether its the opening sequence where dakota johnsons cassandra webb is born that is straight out of blade the awkward realization of having new powers that recalls daredevil or the eventual teaming up of seemingly unconnected characters being sought after by another akin to xmen we have all the usual beats in place now of course many of these films good and bad all lift many of the same plotlines to get through their origin stories madame web sadly opts to clumsily take its turn not unlike fantastic four pick one or ghost rider its evident from the getgo as we are quickly introduced to the films villain ezekiel sims tahar rahim whose entire performance appears to have been badly redubbed add to that a poorly rendered cg spider and my hopes for this film to at least top morbius were quickly dashed cut to the films 2003ish present day and you have johnson and adam scotts ben parker aha doing their best to at least have fun banter before things take a turn theres probably something to be said about a paramedic whose abrasiveness and desire to be left alone is only countered by a strong sense of duty however thats undone by the movies inability to show cassandra as a hero we actually want to root for at times like these one would want to at least be able to say something along the lines of for all its flaws johnson holds onto her dignity or whatever but thats not the case here detached in a way that suggests this isnt the film i signed on for johnson hits a few necessary beats early on only to become a character either annoyed by those around her or making a choice to leave the annoying characters around her to solve the mystery of why said irritants are being targeted it makes her an odd superhero and johnson joins the other cast members by delivering lines in the style of fifth attempt during zoom rerecording sessions this film not only feels like a throwback to the days of lesser superhero films that sat alongside what raimis superior spiderman movies had to offer but it also fits in by being seemingly embarrassed about having ties to a comic book that suggests having to use names like madame web which is never said in this movie and wearing goofy costumes director sj clarkson making her directorial debut following a long list of tv credits including marvels jessica jones finds scant moments to inject any real sense of style here with only ezekiels more villainous form a nonspiderman costume that looks an awful lot like a blacksuited spiderman getting a few instances that stand out thanks to camera rotation while one could say this is a movie aiming to be a more streetlevel superhero flick it feels more like a busy comic book thriller with no real sense of what to do with its 80 million budget an awful lot of time is spent with characters inside vehicles perhaps more could be done if this film wanted to either be more fun by way of its ensemble cast or harness the ridiculous energy that comes from a plot borrowing choice ideas from both the terminator and the dead zone sadly madame web does none of these things its never morbin time in these parts even a random trip to peru where cassandra ditches the teen girls shes supposed to protect doesnt yield anything beyond yet another expository sequence ezekiel sims similarly doesnt get to live up to his awesome name as hes nothing but a force for evil his overthetop terribleness that quickly establishes him as a dangerous threat never amounts to anything more in the form of showiness so the film leaves us with johnson who is mostly out to sea a dryly funny adam scott in the films 6th most important role and for some reason comedian mike epps who doesnt get to say anything funny in between are the three young women with very little to offer and emma roberts as a pregnant mary parker to allow the film some fun in making its audience do the math to figure out how an unborn spiderman fits into all of this theres no joy in watching a film like this as nothing good comes from it i havent even mentioned that for all the nonsense being fed by this story its also pretty lifeless meaning it becomes a slog pretty quickly but with that said what else can i expect from yet another attempt to build something like this without much desire to deliver anything more than a demand fulfillment sent down by the studio i can go along with the idea that plenty of people worked hard on delivering a final product but its a shame to see a movie with so little movie to actually offer worse than generic madame web feels like an obligation come to life with performances that lineup with the best sleepwalkers iffy attempts at excitement via psychicallytinged action sequences and a bland story designed to build toward a bydefault more interesting concept to work with in a sequel that will unlikely happen theres just nothing here nothing has made me interested in seeing more of what this particular webline in sonys spiderman universe could deliver and seeing yet another superhero movie that dares to sell audiences on a diverse femaleled story lose the thread on what works doesnt help at all this film is far from spectacular as its a tangled mess
Feb 16 2024,positive, this week im recommending three new films a superhero film a romcom and a fatherdaughter drama plus four streaming gems including a landmark of american independent cinema civil rights and palestinian documentaries and an experimental dance film 
Feb 16 2024,negative,its bad it never gets any better then you go home thats the whole experience
Feb 16 2024,negative, the death of the comic book movie genre is being greatly exaggerated despite the fact that madam web is one hell of a motive for its murder theres an oftrepeated sitcom joke where a character has to find something goodbutsmall to praise in a horrible play or movie that their friend did the lighting was atmospheric theyll say the lighting sucked in madam web any compliment is a lie it is palpable what a horrible time everyone had making the movie a wildly unpleasant experience that can only be topped by having to watch it only us spiderman nerds care but the original madam web was a silverhaired blind fortune teller in a wheelchair who dressed exclusively in a spideremblazoned slanket somewhere in the multiverse helen mirren got an oscar for bringing that version to life in this one dakota johnson is cassandra webb a character whose defining characteristic is that shes unlikeable thats not a shot at johnson  although its also not not a shot  so much as it is a literal fact pointed out by other characters in the film those other characters include ben parker adam scott thats right the film serves as the origin story of spideys father figure uncle ben whose defining characteristic is reminding everyone that the second season of severance is overdue set in 2003 for  and this is very important  absolutely no reason the nonsensical plot sees cassie granted the ability to kinda sorta see versions of the future because her mother got bit by a magic spider in the amazon while dying during childbirth she has a vision of ezekial sims tahar rahim killing three teenaged girls julia cornwall sydney sweeney mattie franklin celeste oconnor and anya corazon isabela merced their defining characteristics are shy sassy and shybutsassy respectively why is zeke trying to off some younguns because he too has magic amazonian spider mojo that shows him a future vision of the three women as superheroes that toss him off a building to his death it may be interesting to discover how they become spiderthemed adventurers so the movie never goes there it does spend a lot of time with zosia mamet in front of a wall of monitors telling her evil boss where to find the ladies and it also shows the origins of spidermans defining mantra only instead of with great power comes great responsibility a jungle wizard says when you take on great responsibility great power will come which is a just really truly absolutely not true and b almost the logical opposite of what that message is supposed to be about everyone everyone in the movie gives a horrible performance none worse than rahim whose every line of dialogue was clearly redone in post its genuinely quite funny how he only talks when offcamera or when it is too dark to see if his words match how his lips move theres a really upsetting scene where the girls dance on a table to britney spearss toxic for a bunch of what appear to be frat boys the finale takes place in a fireworks factory and said fireworks are shown blowing holes in brick walls the pepsi ad placement is so blatant its a sign of restraint madam web doesnt stand over a defeated villain and say should have had an icecold refreshing pepsicola alison willmore at vulture says in some sequences johnson gamely gives math lady meme face as her character cassandra webb first tries to accept and understand the precognitive powers shes developing in others she recites her lines with the resignation of someone who has come to terms with the fact that shes appearing in a real stinker girl give us nothing no seriously theres no point in doing anything more rosa parra at in their own league says the trailers sold me on an actionpacked film where a group of women were going to be kicking ass but instead i got a movie about cassandra web becoming a guardian to the teens and her journey in dealing with her powers and the teens were massively underutilized emmanuel eman noisette at the movie blog says from the cringy spiderman references and absurd logic of its characters this film immediately becomes one of the more forgettable comic book movies of the year this felt like a troll job to spite fans who are tired of these spidermanless films
Feb 16 2024,negative, produced in association with marvel madame web follows in the critically mauled wake of venom venom let there be carnage and morbius the last of which qualified as the worst of the bunch until now is madame web bad enough to put a final nail in the coffin of increasingly feeble superhero epics the jury is still out but it is second to none in the dark art of boring you breathless the usually frisky dakota johnson is stuck in this 2003era origin story about the soontobe madame web aka manhattan paramedic cassie webb now struggling with her newfound power to see the future as a clairvoyant how could she not predict the disaster ahead cassie is not alone in her identity crisis there are other potential super divas gearing up including euphoria breakout sydney sweeney as nerdy white girl julia isabela merced as latina mathlete anya and celeste oconnor as black skateboarder mattie flashforwards show them in various stages of spidey cosplay doing lame things it took four screenwriters to concoct basically theyre dodging the villainous ezekiel sims a strangely bland tahar rahim who holes up in a penthouse making mischief with a nutso techie zosia mamet for background the film opens with a spider research trip to the amazon in which ezekiel kills cassies pregnant mom kerry bishé but dont worry spider venom saves the infant cassie meanwhile ezekiel is haunted by visions of these future spider girls who are keen to take him out he insists they must die cassie has other ideas which she carries out with the help of fellow paramedic ben parker a barely used adam scott whose pregnant sisterinlaw is mary parker emma roberts any relation to peter parker aka spiderman one guess the tangled plot resists deciphering as it forces a connection between characters that defines implausible the actors are stuck with unplayable roles johnsons sexy deadpan and aura of mystery can work wonders in such films as cha cha real smooth a bigger splash and the lost daughter but cassie is a nothingburger part that would stymie even a young meryl streep whos to blame for choking the life out of madame web the obvious suspect would be the director but british firebrand sj clarkson a gifted tv director succession orange is the new black dexter is reduced in her misfire of a feature debut to keeping the actors from tripping over the truly atrocious dialogue better luck next time the real culprit here is the greed manifested by studio suits who keep hawking cheap knockoffs madame web feels like a random collection of halfbaked ideas thrown into the air and allowed to land with the cynical assumption that well buy any lazy hackwork that is spiderman adjacent kill me now and theres no end in sight you should know that the ssu has two future installments  kraven the hunter and venom 3  ready to go in this year alone that is definitely more like a threat than a promise madame web comes in at under two hours and thats the best thing i can say about it even the thought of a sequel would be cruel and unusual punishment
Feb 16 2024,negative, like any true daughter of hollywood dakota johnson is a professional who understands that you have to work with the material youve got her breakthrough role as anastasia steele in the fifty shades movies was a triumph of never holding herself above lines like punish me show me how bad it can be or the requirement to bite her lip so frequently she must have needed chapstick after every take but even johnson has her limits and madame web one of sonys attempts to build out its own spiderverse blows so far past them that you can practically guess which scenes were shot last based on the degree to which its star has given up in some sequences johnson gamely gives math lady meme face as her character cassandra webb first tries to accept and understand the precognitive powers shes developing in others she recites her lines with the resignation of someone who has come to terms with the fact that shes appearing in a real stinker girl give us nothing no seriously theres no point in doing anything more cassandra  cassie to her friends which include her emt partner ben adam scott and the trio of teenage girls she ends up trying to help  is one of the deeper cut characters that are pretty much all thats left for marvel and dc movies to dredge up at this point aside from a latebreaking and wildly mangled ability to be in multiple places at one cassies powers which develop after a neardeath experience involve an ability to see the near future it could make for an interesting exercise pitting someone with knowledge and foresight but no physical gifts against ezekiel sims tahar rahim a protospiderman villain who can climb walls punch hard and poison with his touch but madame web helmed by prolific british tv director s j clarkson cant come up with a remotely exciting way to pit these two against each other ezekiel wants to kill three highschoolers  the meek julia cornwall sydney sweeney the requisite stem girl anya corazon isabela merced and the rebellious mattie franklin celeste oconnor  because hes plagued by prophetic dreams in which the three costumed and superhuman kill him cassies own visions are rendered in smeary bursts that are hard to make out and even after she reluctantly becomes the girls protector she mostly only anticipates new and not especially coollooking ways to run away madame web is draggy through most of its middle and inept by its end but its also the kind of bad movie that is difficult to describe without making it sound awesome for instance it is set in 2003 as signaled by a dangerously in love ad and mention of martha stewarts legal woes for no obvious reason aside from the fact that it needs ben full name ben parker to not yet be an uncle to his future spidernephew and yet  the movie plays bewilderingly coy about who ben is he refuses to say the name of the woman hes started seriously dating presumably may and just when his pregnant sisterinlaw mary emma roberts is about to reveal her babys name ben and cassie are called away to an emergency the movie takes place in new york but cassie does manage to take an effortless midmovie jaunt to the remote peruvian jungle to visit the place where the scientist mother kerry bishé she grew up resenting died while there she communes with some indigenous spiderpeople who may be the stuff of legends but who conveniently speak english before popping back to queens for the big finish the climax by the way takes place in an abandoned factory prominently labeled with a neon pepsicola sign theres a lot of pepsi product placement but filled for reasons unknown with boxes and boxes of fireworks superhero movies arent going away but theres a schadenfreude in watching madame web and getting the feeling that the oncedominant genre is fullon dissolving like reality does toward the end of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind its not just that studio execs obviously reworked the film to the point of incoherence with johnson herself freely admitting that the finished script was nothing like the one she signed on for its that there is no evident vision to madame web at all no sense of why anyone involved wanted to make it aside from the compulsion to keep milking this ip for whatever last drops of profit can be squeezed out i wouldnt say its joyless because no film can be entirely without joy when it has johnson hating on children and saying the line hope the spiders were worth it mom but its an 80 million project with no reason for existing aside from seeding spinoffs with the younger characters that are unlikely to actually happen the more these movies have to serve as marketing campaigns for future installments the less pleasurable they become as experiences in themselves with madame web at least theres no pretending that something good is coming down the pike when johnson settles into the thinking hard face thats cassies main expression you have to wonder if shes actually just considering firing her agents thank

Feb 16 2024,positive, bob marley one love 12 107 minutes m the music is great but the flow is stilted and much of the dialogue incomprehensible in the loving biopic bob marley one love  some strong stretches manage to capture the peaceloving spirit of the father of reggae such as the concert he staged during a violent election period in jamaica director reinaldo marcus green king richard also brings us into how and why marley created reggae theres no question how convincing a job british actor kingsley benadir does in his portrait of marley as a loving family man and a star largely unaffected by ego as he gains global popularity  regrettably the rambling episodic nature of the storytelling is coupled with a commitment to cultural authenticity that even more regrettably results in some fasttalking heavilyaccented performances that are tough to decipher the film could have done with subtitles an option that will no doubt be available when the film enters the stream on paramount perhaps its best to wait till then madame web  116 minutes m if you were to believe the thermonuclear attack launched by the worlds motion picture critics against madame web you could be forgiven for expecting this marvel film to be among the worst entries of the superhero genre if anything madame web turns out to be a rather pleasant and enjoyable surprise a wellmade and wellpaced origin story for a band of female superheroes who exist in the spiderman cinematic universe so its one of those hybrid marvel films where sony owns the rights to the characters  for those who care about such matters dakota johnson she of the 50 shades trilogy puts in an aboveaverage performance as cassie webb a new york paramedic who grew up as a foster kid knowing little about her scientist mother who scoured the depths of the amazon searching for a medically valuable spider cassie discovers she has some spideytype powers as well as a touch of clairvoyance that tends to kick in at opportune moments cassies quest is to protect three young women sydney sweeney celeste oconnor and isabela merced who are destined to be masked guardians in the future provided they can survive the competing quest of a villain who wants to kill them all so he can be left alone to exploit a rare spider venom ok the plot isnt exactly william goldman but its still a heck of a lot more coherent than a lot of other superhero films that have not drawn anywhere near the same degree of critical ire so never mind the critical mauling the film has received madame web chimes in as a superhero lark that sits well above the dreck offered up by the genre in recent years inspector sun and the curse of the black widow  88 minutes pg think agatha christie meets a bugs life and youve got the gist of inspector sun a brightly animated comedymystery lark wherein the titular detective a sevenlegged spider with poirotstyled pencil moustache tries solving a rather complex murder case on board an art deco flying boat as it wings its way from shanghai to san francisco in 1934 fizzing with one liners and a cast of insect and insectadjacent characters remember spiders are not insects inspector sun is a lovingly rendered throwback to oldstyle film noir mysteries and the clichés they rode upon its replete with retro references adults will likely appreciate more than kids fortunately he has janey emily kleimo a morethancapable jumping spider assistant to help him work through the blizzard of clues surrounding the untimely demise of crime boss dr bugsy spindlethorp scott geer as the genre conventions dictate chief among the suspects is of course his exwife arabella killtop jennifer childs greer a sexy black widow spider who steps comfortably into the role of femme fatale the dialogue is crammed with quick jokes many of which might fly over the heads of young kids who to be honest might also struggle to comprehend a plot that while wellthought through is perhaps a few degrees more complex than it needs to be you have to listen fast to catch all the lightningfast exposition still it all comes together in the end with a terrific action finale in san francisco bay beneath the yettobecompleted golden gate bridge director julio soto gurpide working from a screenplay by rocco pucillo ties everything together with panache they dont scutter about in the crawlspaces of the plane

Feb 16 2024,neutral, if theres a rule to be aware of when it comes to sonys socalled spiderverse movies its this if spiderman isnt in it its likely to disappoint that applies to venom venom let there be carnage morbius and now madame web although all these properties have comic book sources none has translated well to the big screen this is in part due to poor writing but is equally the result of a general lack of direction on the part of sony which outside of its partnership with marvel studios for the tom holland spiderman series doesnt seem to understand the characters over which it has stewardship madame web is another example of a comic book movie no one was clamoring for two things come to mind immediately when considering this production the first is how disjointed and haphazard the storyline is frequently employing sleightofhand to resolve conflicts it is evidently the first chapter of a longer story since three of the four principals never develop their superpowers which are hinted at in flashforward dream sequences and exist predominantly to fill damsels in distress roles the second is how juvenile the dialogue is this is especially evident at the end with a voiceover pronouncement that would have been at home in a saturday morning cartoon  like argylle madame web makes for a better trailer than a full movie thats because the central premise  a superhero whose power is the ability to see short distances into the future and thereby alter the timeline if she wishes  is ripe with possibilities none however are effectively explored maybe thats the trap of the origin story nature of the narrative its so busy introducing characters and establishing situations that theres no time to do anything more than dispatch a feeble villain in a perfunctory fashion one of the reasons why madame web doesnt work is because theres rarely any tension for an action film even one falling into the superhero subgenre the dearth of excitement is a death sentence although its refreshing to see studios continue to uncover female action heroes worthy of screen exposure this one follows the marvels in that regard its disappointing to find how shabbily treated they are perhaps madame web might have worked better had it narrowed its focus to a single character  in this case cassandra web dakota johnson the addition of three teenagers in need of protection  julia cornwall sydney sweeney anya corazon isabela merced and mattie franklin celeste oconnor  muddies the waters this wouldbe series might have been better served by delaying their inclusion until a potential sequel speaking of elements that were not in the final cut of this movie its evident that some connective tissue with the spiderman movies was sloppily edited out of madame web the footprints have been left behind  the character of cassies best friend ben adam scott is unquestionably a younger version of spideys uncle ben and the baby born during the course of the proceedings is peter parker it seems likely that these things were acknowledged in the script at some point but were elided from the final cut those who watch the names scroll by at the end will learn the truth adam scott is credited as playing ben parker mary parker bens sisterinlaw and peters mother is also in the movie played by emma roberts madame web opens with a short prequel set during 1973 in the amazon jungle it introduces the mother of the films main character played by kerry bishe a scientist studying rare spiders after discovering an amazing new species she is attacked by her alleged bodyguard ezekiel sims a dreadful tahar rahim who steals the spider and leaves her for dead she is rescued by local tribesmen who are able to keep her alive long enough to give birth to cassandra  thirty years later cassie is a new york ambulance driver after being involved in a neardeath experience she begins having episodes in which she can seemingly see into the future after determining that shes not hallucinating she begins to tinker with her abilities meanwhile ezekiel now possessing powers gained from the spiders venom is having recurring dreams of his death at the hands of three women he uses stolen ai to locate them and plots their murders when it comes time to execute his plan however his murderous intentions are foiled by cassie who has a vision of him killing julia anya and mattie and acts to save them sadly madame web fails to rise above its pedigree as a lesser superhero movie it does nothing to convince viewers that theres value to be found in a story not featuring a marquee comic book character theres a growing sense that sony is overreaching by plumbing the bargain bin of the ip for which it owns the rights and trying to forcefeed the public with characters like venom carnage morbius and madame web well never know whether a wellcrafted riveting madame web might have made this an earlyyear box office gem because thats not what director sj clarkson has delivered her vision  or at least the one sony allowed to reach the screen  is a tired infantile exercise in exploring the worst tropes of origin stories 
Feb 16 2024,negative, madame web is a movie filled with ambulance action table dancing and  this is more like it  a tribe of amazonian spider people very indyish and very promising but then theres also an infestation of product placement of the most shamelessly brazen sort and you marvel that studios give a thumbsup to this sort of thing and then wonder why their movies die on the vine  the movies title character played here by dakota johnson first appeared in marvels amazing spiderman comics in 1980 and shes kind of interesting  a blind precog who can see into the future and possibly change it shes very super in her native format not so much in this movie though here shes almost completely presuper and largely preoccupied with looking after three bratty young acolytes sydney sweeney celeste oconnor isabela merced who as we eventually see and instantly guess are on their way to becoming fully suitedup spiderwomen later on in what sony pictures and marvels movie arm must have been hoping would mark a return to the longago glory days of the spidey franchise but as an attempt to kickstart a new spiderman dynasty the movie falls seriously short the story is virtually all intro with not a lot of payoff in spidey action none actually  although were clearly in spideys world here the celebrated webslinger never puts in an actual appearance  judging by the critical hostility that has greeted madame web the possibility of future adventures now seems iffy but the movie does indicate a way forward for this sort of picture in a time of mounting superhero fatigue among moviegoers presumably people whove paid to sit through such widely reviled films as the marvels and aquaman and the lost kingdom the piddling morbius  another attempted spiderman spinoff  and the awful eternals introducing three fresh young superwomen into the spiderman universe would seem like a surefire way of reigniting interest out in the youth market and it would help mightily if the producers could hold on to dakota johnson for any future installments  her air of serene selfpossession in the face of all the movies limp cgi and lunkhead dialogue when you take on the responsibility great power will come is wonderfully calming if shes not appalled by the movies mad editing and muddled plot two of the pictures three writers also worked on morbius why should we worry the story begins in peru in 1973 where a woman named constance kerry bishe is researching a tribe of spiderworshippers assisting her for reasons unclear is a treacherous character named ezekiel sims tahar rahim who is bedeviled by a recurring dream about three young women hes convinced will one day kill him better he kills them first he figures  constance who is pregnant gets bitten by a spider and later gives birth to a daughter she names cassandra johnson the little girl grows up to be an emt and we first meet her wheeling around manhattan in an ambulance alongside her partner ben parker adam scott there is a lot of racing about from one emergency to another and since cassie can see into the future  and must then relive what she and we have already seen  the movie begins to feel padded  soon we reencounter ezekiel whos also in new york now and busily monitoring the movements of cassandra and the three girls with whom shes become encumbered for reasons purely misterioso ezekiel and a sidekick named amaria zosia mamet are employing the usual sort of allseeing computer setup to locate the three young women they eventually find them taking part in a big action scene down in the subway where everybody gets to meet a sort of evil spiderman actually ezekiel in a blackandred supersuit who is of course in a homicidal mood  the story sprawls cassie is at pains to announce her concern for the safety of the three girls now that ezekiel is on their trail but then shell run off to south america or someplace leaving them on their own  and leaving us to cope with all the commercial shillery rearing up around what seems like every corner theres a sudden beyonce billboard visible in one scene beyonce is signed to sonys columbia records label and when we take a break to attend a cookout with ben and his pregnant sister mary checking off their familiar spideyworld names we cant help noticing that everyone is drinking pepsicola  a warmup for the movies big finish which takes place atop a huge pepsi billboard on the bank of the hudson river im not making this up  in order to really work the movie would have had to give us a look at the three fledgling spiderwomen learning their trade and having their first crimefighting adventures did someone really think it best to hold off on providing that sort of basic audience pleasure to save it for some future installment that as now seems entirely possible no one may ever request 
Feb 16 2024,negative,congratulations sony you outdid yourself you actually made a movie worse than morbius madame web is another obvious case of sony churning out a movie to keep the spiderman property
Feb 16 2024,negative, the ben affleck version of daredevil hit screens on valentines day back in 2003 so its fitting that madame web not only is set during that particular year but also opens in theaters on the same day 21 years later heck all thats missing is a hit evanescence song on the soundtrack i bring this up because sonys latest excursion into its marvel spidermanadjacent cinematic universe is the most secondtier early2000s comic book yarn thats seen the light of day in ages and this includes both the venom entries and 2022s morbius director sj clarkson has delivered a glossy hyperactive jolt of colorfully unvarnished absurdity that could almost be fun if it wasnt so poorly plotted and obnoxiously dumb the film comes tantalizingly close to being an unintentional parody of the superhero genre and that happy accident almost makes watching the resulting mess worthwhile what madame web does have going for it is that it is fairly well cast rarely slows down has some nice visual flourishes and doesnt take itself too seriously dakota johnsons seeming disdain for the material nicely fits her lead character of new york city paramedic cassandra webb she brings a sharp sense of humor and a cutting wit that makes much of this nonsense tolerable sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor are also rather good as the teenage trio webb protects from harm while adam scott is having the time of his life as ben parker a name that should be familiar to fans of everyones favorite wallcrawler all over the world granted the same could be said about daredevil and yet two decades later that piece of goofy schlock is still considered something of a disaster and for good reason but one thing it undeniably has over clarksons equally braindead slice of superpowered hokum a great villain two of them actually however michael clarke duncan as a suitably threatening wilson fisk and colin farrell as magnificently outofhisgourd bullseye both deserve to be in a much much better motion picture unfortunately i have absolutely no idea what happened with tahar rahims performance as peruvian madman ezekiel sims though rahim is a sensational actor known for his superlative turns in a prophet the past and the mauritanian it sounds like almost all of his dialogue was done via automated dialogue replacement adr as if he were starring in some 1970s italian spaghetti western or giallo his characters motivations are never explored and rarely explained and certainly not in any detail simss superhuman abilities seem to change whenever the plot requires them to making him not so much a threat as a vaguely unthreatening terminator clone and what is that plot webb is an orphan who 30 years after her traumatic birth suddenly gains furtive groundhog daylike glimpses into the future that she cant control this leads her to julia cornwall sweeney anya corazon merced and mattie franklin oconnor three teens from different worlds who have been marked for assassination by a determined sims sims has been having nightmares of them growing up to be vigilante superheroes who for reasons he does not know break into his manhattan skyrise and throw him out the window to his death instead of waiting for that to happen he decides to kill them while theyre still in high school and webb is the only one who can stop him or something like that it honestly doesnt matter simms wants to kill the girls they dont want to die webb tries to gain control of her prognostication abilities to keep him from doing it and in the process learns how her mother kerry bishé was betrayed and then murdered while researching spiders in peru theres not a great deal more to it the story and screenplay credited to five different writers including clarkson is all over the map it makes playful references to the superherowhoshallnotbenamed peter parkerspiderman although as hes nothing more than the bun in mary parkers emma roberts oven this isnt a surprise but the film also doesnt do a thing to flesh out any character other than cassandra webb and this includes julia anya and mattie heck if someone revealed that sweeney merced and oconnor adlibbed all of their dialogue id be tempted to believe them but thats the least of the films structural problems not to be a broken record but why is sims the way he is if this peruvian spider is so well known around the world why did no one other than cassandras mother go look for it including after her death if julia anya and mattie end up being spiderpowered superheroes within a few short years why does all of new york lose its collective crap when spiderman comes along after theyve been doing their thing for probably at least a decade what exactly are the rules regarding webbs abilities some of these questions are important others arguably not so much but the fact that all and several more are given not so much short shrift but no shrift at all is an issue a few implausible occurrences here and there and a small cadre of narrative shortcomings arent a deal breaker but an onslaught of them one right after the other to the point where it becomes borderline comical thats too much of an ask which brings us back to those notsofondlyremembered 2000s catastrophes like elektra catwoman fantastic four and the aforementioned daredevil there was talent involved with each from a production standpoint they all had game casts and the same can be said about madame web but the latter falls into a similar trap of mediocrity they all became ensnared in and its a shame cassandra webb didnt see that regrettable

Feb 16 2024,negative, not unlike a burger at arbys or whatever kfc was doing with the chizza madame web is a quizzical aberration of capitalism of course meme culture makes you morbidly curious no its probably not been prepared with sanitary methods in mind yes it will make your tumtum hurt madame web is the latest entry in sonys spiderman universe or ssu you know the mcu the dceu this is that for sonys spiderman movies but they can only include spiderman proper now  as in say spiderman no way home  when the mcu sphere is also involved if that gives you a headache the ssu was once known as the sony pictures universe of marvel characters or spumc they pronounced it spumsee kind of like the c diff that would inflame your colon after eating a promotional tiein meal somewhere for madame web you may have read elsewhere that madame web is an objectively terrible but subjectively delightful slice of camp cinema  or a bad movie that mostly knows its bad leans into said badness and achieves a level of entertainment in spite of itself no no no no no no madame web is just bad the ssu has camp its called venom and its also called venom there will be carnage in those films youll find outsized melodrama exaggerated excess bromantic chemistry and the endlessly delightful sight of tom hardy cooling his overheated genitals in a hoitytoity restaurants lobster tank a third one is coming later this year it should be fun meanwhile madame web instead offers the following a lead performance from dakota johnson whose clear and charmless contempt cant be cut around however exhaustive and nauseating the editorial efforts three supporting performances from sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor that wouldnt pass muster in the smallest of community theaters a villain whose voice someone hated so much it has been largely overdubbed by a man who sounds quite ill and nothing like actor tahar rahim and a bycommittee screenplay that tiptoes around very specific spiderman references like uncle ben peter parker uncle jonah lol and with great power comes responsibility at least cowriters matt sazama and burk sharpless returning from the shockingly preferable ssu entry morbius appeased the lawyers and in the ssu those lawyers seem to be all that matter  from the ones who enforce sonys rights to nonspider man characters from spiderman comics to the ones assisting on the financials for q1 2024 madame web is ultimately a bunch of names and numbers on a ledger  one likely to turn red if theres any justice left  and it musters a similarly exciting energy its a meal like the one brundlefly would consume in david cronenbergs the fly whittled down to goopy enzymatic mush by vomitous acid there are at least a couple of interesting things about madame web first are the panic switches seemingly pulled in postproduction to align its 2003 setting with the birth of  well lets call him petrus parkus you know the character played by that very famous actor todd netherlands very cute to believe anyone from this movie will ever play these characters again at all let alone alongside an actor like todd netherlands  the second is the tension established among johnson sweeney merced and oconnor oh it has nothing to do with their fright at becoming the prey of mean ol ezekiel sims rahim if in appearance only who prowls around new york like an evil spiderm  sorry arachnid male neither does it have to do with the concern about their prophesied or presenttense superpowers instead it has everything to do with the optics of when to drop their representation for roping them into this debacle ok maybe thats unfair to their repsno one made them sign on for madame web thats what makes johnsons pissy presstour persona even more puerile she chose this all right maybe lines like ok so this guys hands somehow release an acute neurotoxin or but i dont have a neuromuscular disorder werent in the original script but her character was surely named cassie webb in a movie called madame web which is adjacent to spiderman but only adjacent  good job lawyers with mediocre source material comes modest expectations besides doesnt johnson  among the most vapid juiceless alist performers there is  need to give more than one performance somewhere above average before something is truly below her johnsons goodfaith effort begins and ends with the sameold peeshiver face every actor makes when playing someone with precognitive abilities to see the future before it happens thats cassies superpower unlocked after the perpetually putupon paramedic plunks her head on the windshield of a taxicab plummeting off a bridge its kind of like a less gory final destination a franchise whose finest sequence this film seems poised to reference but no that vehicle has a better 2003 final destinationish film to appear in anyway the same peptides that will later propel the heroism of petrus parkus pump through cassies blood too and her accident also unlocks longdormant secrets about her mysterious birth of course those secrets would be less dormant had cassie browsed her dead moms treasure chest at any point in the 30 years of her life before this film takes place sims has spidey sense too hes got the moves like parkus will one day have but hes also been cursed to see his eventual fate at the hands of julia cornwall sweeney anya corazon merced and mattie franklin oconnor in 2003 theyre just teens who dance on a table at a diner to britney spears songs as american diners were wont to let teens do back then later theyll become superheroes  if cassie can keep them alive in a film that can hardly keep its sense of time science or legal issues that would prevent a kidnapping suspect from peaceing out to peru as a maniac with inexhaustible surveillance resources hunts her no less two years before youtube debuted and four years before anyone had an iphone a subway rider watches horizontal video on a mobile device julia anya and mattie leave a campfire burning to dance at that diner and wouldnt you know it cassie does not return hours later to find a conflagration worthy of national news coverage budgeted at 80 million madame web might be the most expensive cpr training video of all time and it uproariously sends cassie to peru for a full week of selfdiscovery while sims ostensibly continues to track the girls in new york using omniscient satellite powers at least the popsong soundtrack is chronologically sound but with madame web if you wake in the morning and you step outside and you take a deep breath and you get real high youll still scream at the top of your lungs whats goin on johnson will be fine after madame web sweeney will be fine adam scott and emma roberts who turn up for thankless paycheck roles will be fine too cry neither for sazama and sharpless who are almost certainly on retainer for several more rounds of clist spideycharacter scripts instead feel the worst for director sj clarkson  a 20yearplus veteran of prestige tv who has seen several bigticket projects come her way and never materialize and who will almost certainly take undue blame here despite a keen visual knack for kinetic energy that gets lost in all the chopping the best part of the future is that it hasnt happened yet says one character theres no real good spin on madame web but that might be the best clarkson can hope for
Feb 16 2024,negative,the whole movie is like eating something you thought would taste good but is so soft and mushy and flavorless that you realize there is really no reason at all to keep eating it would be an insult to tofu to call the movie that
Feb 16 2024,negative, while madame web immediately became a meme after its first trailer dropped i have to admit i was quite intrigued by the premise a team of spiderwomen comprised of hollywoods biggest leading ladies all woven together by a psychic web sign me up unfortunately what we get with madame web is a lackluster origin story devoid of much action powers or sense dakota johnson stars as cassandra web a loner of a new york city paramedic who finds that when you take on the responsibility great power will come in a new play on the iconic spiderman line the responsibility protecting three young women from a mysterious rival who wants them dead with her newfound clairvoyance theres sydney sweeney as the meek julia cornwall isabela merced as the independent anya corazon and celeste oconnor as the rebellious mattie franklin all four of them share the same experience as abandoned women who dont have real family to rely on it makes sense that this leads them to become a found family of sorts but the story lacks the emotional depth needed to be believable while this quartet seems like a match made in leading lady heaven the girls are sidelined for most of the film cassie is often having them hold tight for three hours in the woods while she runs around trying to figure out whats going on or disappearing mid film for an impromptu trip to peru that explains her past these types of transitions feel lazy and reductive  tahar rahim plays our generic bad guy ezekiel sims who strangely sounds as if hes been dubbed over in every scene he has no real motivation as a villain other than a vision that the future spiderwomen are going to kill him we dont know when or why and it all comes together rather dully its particularly disappointing because the most thrilling moments are when we get to see the girls with their spiderwomen powers which are only seen in his vision we never see them use powers in this film let alone see how they get them the film does do a nice job of creatively tapping into cassies visual web of powers as well as the trendy 2000s in one scene she rewrites history by crashing a stolen taxi into a diner in a sequence soundtracked by britney spears toxic the most interesting aspect of the film is the minor storyline focused on the spiderman universe we all know and love we meet uncle ben adam scott and his very pregnant sisterinlaw mary emma roberts theres hints of ben dating someone new  future aunt may anyone  and mary goes into labor delivering a healthy baby boy they dont come out and say it but we all know its a baby peter parker the end of the sony film is a mad dash to connect the film to the character in the marvel comics that finds cassie suddenly blind and paralyzed giving off a professor x energy as she welcomes the girls as her metaphorical daughters its so on the nose that it becomes cheesy that cheap quality is a running thread with most of the film as it is full of moments that are laughably bad or awkward due to the set ups and dialogue all in all madame web wastes a strong cast with a halfbaked story weak dialogue a pointless villain and no real development of a majority of the characters or their powers while i would love to see this cast of spiderwomen actually get a chance to shine this film may be too bland to start a franchise kristen maldonado is an entertainment journalist critic and oncamera host she is the founder of the outlet pop culture planet and hosts its inclusionfocused video podcast of the same name you can find her bingewatching your next favorite tv show interviewing talent and championing representation in all forms she is a rotten tomatoesapproved critic a member of the critics choice association latino entertainment journalists association and the television academy and a 2x shorty award winner shes also been featured on new york live ny1 the list tv den of geek good morning america insider mtv and glamour
Feb 16 2024,negative,people will wish this was made by warner bros so itd be abandoned for a tax writeoff 
Feb 15 2024,negative, wow well this is definitive we all knew that superhero movies were breathing their last and that recent flops the marvels the flash and antman 3 had signalled the inevitable end of it all yet still nothing can quite prepare you for this latest and surely final instalment from marvels spiderverse in its sheer mindboggling awfulness it represents to paraphrase robert de niros al capone in the untouchables the death of the superhero genre the burning of the superhero genre to the ground and then the returning in the middle of the night to piss on the superhero genres ashes
Feb 15 2024,negative,lame dialogue a pervasive lack of wit and an inability to overcome marvel fatigue keep this one from going anywhere
