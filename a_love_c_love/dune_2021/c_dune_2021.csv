"Mar 24, 2024",positive," “Dune” or “Dune: Part One” (2021) is the second film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel series. In the future year of 10191, an Emperor governs the universe, and this universe’s most valuable resource is spice, which aids in interstellar travel, but it is only found on Arrakis, a desert planet. The Emperor determines which House (thank you, “Game of Thrones” for making these concepts more comprehensible) will occupy Arrakis and insure that spice can be harvested without interference from the indigenous people, the Fremen, who never consented to the Emperor’s rule. The brutal house of Harkonnen have occupied the land and grown wealthy as a result of their position, but the Emperor orders them to withdraw and gives the job to the House of Atreides, whose head is Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and whose home planet is Caladan. His consort, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is training their young, inexperienced son, Paul (Timothee Chamalet), in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, a group of women who possess physical and mental abilities, even though men do not exhibit these traits; however, Paul is different. He dreams of fragments of the future, is learning how to control minds and shows physical prowess that other men do not exhibit. Moving to Arrakis challenges the House of Atreides to the point of possible extinction, but also makes Paul’s dreams come true. Why would I, a person who had zero interest in Herbert’s novels and did not enjoy David Lynch’s version (through no fault of Kyle Maclachlan), commit to watching not one, but two or more Dune movies? Denis Villeneuve. I found most of his films prior to “Blade Runner 2049” (2017), which is gorgeous, to be riveting, and arresting visuals accompany surprising stories. Apparently Villeneuve’s lifelong dream was to adapt Herbert’s universe for the big screen so while I am happy that he, like Paul, is finally able to bring his fantasies to life, it is not always a good thing for him or everyone else. No slander on Villeneuve’s adaptation, which I prefer over Lynch’s take, but “Dune” is broad in its characters and narrative. It feels predictable, and there is zero investment or tension over well-known characters’ development. Villeneuve’s “Dune” is the cinematic equivalent of a meditation garden: gorgeous to watch with its characters’ polished skin, smooth stonelike spaceships, sand enveloped landscapes, sunlight and shadows playing portentously on golden, bronzed metallic surfaces or verdant landscapes contrasting its arid sister planet. It is important for visuals to tell the story, but the people feel like the supporting actors, not the driving force, as they float elegantly with their gravity defying suits or trembling shields. The more that a person’s face is covered, the less than the audience can relate to them or should be suspicious of them. It is like a tasteful “Star Wars” with superb production values, but lacking in the raw, untidy energy of Lucas’ epic. While Timothee Chalamet may be the headliner, “Dune” is an ensemble affair; however, Chalamet sets the dour tone as a brooding, wan Paul. At least cowriters Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (who penned “Prometheus,” “Doctor Strange” and “The Mummy”) and Eric Roth (“Wolfen,” “Forrest Gump,” “The Insider,” “The Insider,” “Ali,” “Munich,” “A Star Is Born,” “Killers of the Flower Moon”) acknowledge that the man boy does not look like he can hold his own in a stiff wind, forget a physical confrontation. In one scene, Paul dodges and catches a minute assassination drone, a hunter-seeker. At the time, it seems plausible and deft, but as the film unfolds and more impressive warriors cannot withstand such an attack, it becomes retroactively impressive. Paul’s slight frame makes sense because if he displays feminine mental abilities, he should also possess feminine physical attributes. Paul’s sullen countenance is not chronic and breaks when he spends time with his weapons teachers and father’s faithful aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, who is still gorgeous but mostly cleanshaven), an adventurous cheerful bro type, and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), a man determined to teach Paul how to fight because the memory of war haunts him. Paul reverts to his original settings countenance when he is with his parents. The weight of his parents’ expectations, his predicament and his visions suppress his youthful buoyancy. In retrospect, Duke Leto Atreides (the scrumptious Oscar Issac sporting a lush, perfectly trimmed beard) feels like an inspiration for Ned Stark, and the only person on the chessboard who wakes up too late to the stakes of the pageant-filled game that he is playing and begins panicking long after it is too late to turn things around. The Duke is the kind of guy that others may not need to go to the trouble of assassinating since he engages in enough activities that could get him killed. He fancies himself above the Harkonnen because he is respectful of the Fremen and treats them like people, but he still wants to harvest the spice and make the Emperor proud so the only difference is a lack of self-preservation gene and good manners. His disembodied hand on Jessica’s neck, a gesture of love, gets framed as a feeble attempt at possession and control. His identity is irrelevant in the sequence, and he almost does not exist long before he arrives at Arrakis. The real star of “Dune” feels like Jessica. Ferguson is born to play supernaturally dubious women, and Jessica in Part One may edge out her performance as Rose the Hat in “Doctor Sleep” (2019) because of the range of her character’s journey through the course of the film. Jessica appears to be a privileged mother and significant other, but she gets the best lines during the Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling, who is incapable of delivering a less than excellent performance despite the heavy veil) implementation of a test, “Fear is the mind killer.” It is like someone else delivering Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” speech. The creative choice suggests that she is being tested as much as Paul by refusing to save him. There is an interesting power struggle between Jessica and the rest of the Bene Gesserit regarding how to produce the Kwisatz Haderach through a breeding program. If any part of “Dune” feels reminiscent of Villeneuve’s previous films, it is the breeding program. It reprises themes from “Enemy” (2013) and “Blade Runner 2049.” All women in this universe, except for Fremen women, are double agents with their own agenda by belonging to this breeding cult which entwined itself into the framework of this problematic structure. While Paul’s existence and survival would be impossible without them, especially his mother, at some point, everyone views the women with more suspicious than declared enemies. By the end of Part One, Jessica bears no resemblance to the woman having breakfast with her son in the opening. She is a fierce, driven, and focused person intent on her mission and survival. Even though the plot points may be intentional, sardonic takes on such tropes as the noble savage and the white savior, they simultaneously validate such tropes in the overt storyline. It is kind of like the think pieces on “Saturday Night Live” where a problematic political figure goes on the show and makes fun of themselves. Showing that you know something is problematic is not the same as not being a problem. “Dune” is not doing the same work as Bong Joon-Ho’s “Snowpiercer” (2013) or “Parasite” (2019) where he takes a storyline where the audience expects one well-trod turn of events then subverts it by obliterating all expectations because the narrative is inherently flawed and needs to be flipped. Narratives like “Dune” understand what is wrong but cannot imagine how to obliterate it or what being right would look like. The story’s structure is kind of like Paul. He is aggrieved that his mom and her fellowship are treating him and others like puppets, but he rather likes being center stage whether as a duke’s son or the Fremen’s champion. It is hard to give up benefits of something that works for you. It also unironically purveys in tropes like the evil albino. Evil albino in chief is Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whom Stellan Skarsgard plays and proves why he thrives in Lars von Trier films. He relishes being unrecognizable under mounds of practical effects and makeup. In gender bending casting, Sharon Duncan-Brewster plays Dr. Liet Kynes, a character with ambiguous allegiances, who gets an eleventh-hour trite backstory, but on the way to that moment, is mysterious and intriguing as Arrakis’ guardian. Javier Bardem plays Stilgar, a Fremen, and largely provides comedic relief. “Dune” is a stunning realization of a beloved sci-fi series, but I felt nothing. Jargon heavy and remote, Villeneuve’s proudest achievement feels like a step back in terms of being more than the equivalent of a purveyor of beautiful gowns. Once the occasion is over, it can be forgotten without any sense of lessons that can be extracted to preserve the heart and soul on harsh, realistic days of drudgery. Side note: loved Villeneuve’s allusion to famous paintings such as Casper David Friedrich’s “Wanderer above the Sea of Fog” or Jacques-Louis David’s “The Death of Marat.”"
"Mar 1, 2024",positive," Synopsis: The feature adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. When it comes to blockbuster spectacles, this past year has been filled with them due to several lockdowns worldwide preventing them from releasing in 2020. It seems like many companies from Disney to Universal are trying to make their voices the loudest in this competition, and yet it has been Warner Bros. who have created the most buzz throughout this past year. Whether their strategy to trying to be the first with Tenet or having a day-and-date release plan with HBO Max worked or not, their blockbusters become staples for the film community. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is certainly no exception to that rule. It may be intimidating thinking of entering the fictional world of Arrakis in the form of a feature-length film, but Villeneuve takes steps to make sure that the film is accessible to any film fan. It does not matter whether you have read the source material or not, the information given in this adaptation is easy to process and engaging to follow along with. Part of that comes to the choice of splitting the book up, with this film being Part One of what will hopefully be a series to come. This choice gives the film plenty of time to breathe and digest the world around us. Villeneuve is known for his incredible sense of world-building and Dune is no exception. Not only are the visuals stunning, but the set of characters all help establish the landscape and political state of this time. Following Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet), the son of a Duke and someone who at a young age is coming to terms with the power his family holds and the religious and political stance his mother follows, the audience is eased into the exposition alongside Paul as we see him go on an epic journey. The visions that Paul has throughout, seeing his meeting with Chani (played by Zendaya) and a ritual duel he must face, the audience is immersed into this world and the stakes that are at play throughout. Even though this is available to watch on HBO Max in the US, there is no better way to see this film than on the biggest screen you can. When the camera pans over the mass amount of desert, the vibrant colors light up the screen as the scope of the landscape becomes clear. It is not just the huge showcase scenes that are impressive though as cinematographer Greig Fraser is able to capture the more intimate moments, particularly with Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson), beautifully and showcase the more vulnerable moments on screen. It would be enough of a cinematic experience with just the visuals, but the technical elements within the sound are award-worthy. The sound design is balanced incredibly well, something that most major blockbusters struggle to do. The dialogue is clear and easy to understand, and yet it does not take away from the roaring of the aircrafts and the action that takes place. Not only that but this film is accompanied by the best score of the year, of course, done by the one and only Hans Zimmer. The blend of orchestral music and the vocal choir creates a range of tones that helps accentuate any moment on the screen, leaving shocks going through your body. In particular, the track “Ripples in the Sand”, used as one of the leading songs in the promotional material for the film, highlights just how good this score really is. For some people, this film may feel anti-climactic and unfulfilling as of this moment due to it being the first part. There is no clear resolution as the journey has only just begun, but the structure of the film does help answer a lot of questions and the choice of where to cut the film does feel perfect in its own way. Villeneuve has managed to create a cinematic masterpiece that makes 155 minutes fly right by, whilst also begging for another three hours to complete the rest of the story. It has been a long time since I have been this excited about a cinematic experience, and I hope everyone else goes out to support it as well."
"Mar 1, 2024",positive," Approaching a monumental project like Dune has destroyed many great filmmakers. While David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation continues to grow a cult following, it’s far from well-regarded. Alejandro Jodorowsky never saw his depiction come to life, despite some wild and ambitious plans. Yet the choice to serialize and break the story into two parts helps Denis Villeneuve‘s Dune shine as a science fiction epic. Few movies showcase this scale, and once again, Villeneuve proves himself one of the best filmmakers alive. However, some early pacing issues and the two-part nature make Dune feel somewhat incomplete. Past the year 10,000, two rival families come to blows. The Harkonnens ruled Arrakis with an iron fist. The planet, home to the indigenous Freman, possesses large reserves of Spice. However, the Emperor of the Known Universe strips the Harkonnens of their rights to the planet. Worse, the stewardship of the planet passes to House Atreides – fierce rivals of House Harkonnen. The battle for control of Arrakis begins a deadly game, one that leaves Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) on a collision course with destiny.  Herbert’s Dune often received criticism for its depiction of colonialism and white savoir tropes. Unfortunately, these issues cannot be wholly corrected with the castings, but Villeneuve adds more nuance than most directors would. His version does not mix words and lays the track for the idea of propaganda working its way into religious sects.  Villeneuve’s depiction of the Bene Gesserit – a group of mystical women who serve as concubines and partners to the heads of houses – is perhaps the most alluring aspect of Dune. Ferguson’s performance as a woman with incredible power yet few resources makes for an impeccable performance. I personally pushed for Ferguson in the awards race, primarily based on her ability to craft an emotionally affecting performance, while still assisting the worldbuilding. While there are other performances that stand out, Ferguson remains the film’s MVP.  The largest issue facing Dune: Part One undeniably revolves around the table setting it must perform. By splitting the story into two halves, Villeneuve sets up an epic second half of the story. However, it also means that long sequences serve merely as exposition and world building. This is not always exciting cinematically, and simply repeating “desert power” does not further explain why the Fremon would be so valuable as allies.  One sequence, when Stilgar (Javier Bardem) meets Leto,  works wonderfully. Other moments become too repetitive, such as seeing Fremon near Paul refer to him as their mesiah across several scenes. Surprisingly this becomes an issue of “tell instead of show,” a rare moment for Villeneuve to overembrace dialogue. While Dune: Part One mostly avoids the pitfall, the scenes where it does not stick out like a sore thumb.  As Dune: Part Two  gets ready for release, it’s worth revisiting our introduction to Arrakis. While the first part feels like table setting, it succeeds because of its brilliant visuals. Villeneuve continues to build an impressive blockbuster resume and has become a master of sci-fi in the last decade. While Dune: Part One may only be the beginning, it’s a culmination of Villeneuve’s journay as a filmmaker and visionary. "
"Feb 26, 2024",positive," I’ve always been interested in Dune, but attempts to get into the beefy novel in the past have failed and while I enjoyed the 80s cheese-fest adaptation it didn’t really feel like I’d experienced the all-time classic, so when this film came along and was said to be only half the book due to how accurate they aimed it to be I was excited, but also weary of potentially the second film not being made so put it in the back of my mind until Part Two was official… Then I sort of forgot about it, until now! So with Part Two about to hit cinemas, let’s take a look at the first half of the original Dune story, shall we? In the far flung future the planet Arrakis is among the most valuable as it’s the only planet in the known galaxy that produces a substance called “Spice” that allows interstellar travel. For many years the rich (and now super-wealthy due to owning the Spice trade) House Harkonnen have ruled over the planet but suddenly a call comes from the Emperor that they’re to leave as their rival house, House Atreides, are the new owners of the fiefdom. This is the general set up, that and on Arrakis there are native people known as the Fremen who have fought against the Harkonnen for decades. The focus soon narrows on our lead protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who is not only the son of Atreides leader Duke Leto Atriedes (Oscar Isaac) but also the son of Lady Jessica (Rebecca Freguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit, a cult of sorts that have the ability to influence and even command people by the use of their voice and despite the Gesserit being exclusively female Jessica has been teaching Paul in their ways. Paul has been having visions recently about Arrakis, more specifically a girl (played by Zendaya) and due to this is increasingly invested in his Dad’s plan of siding with the Fremen to create a large army to fight off the inevitable attack by the Harkonnen. As the Atreides get settled on Arrakis we find out that the Harkonnen leader, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) has made a deal with the Emperor to wipe out House Atreides and thanks to this not only does he have his own army, led by his nephew Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista) but also a couple of regiments of the Emperor’s guard to do the deed. After a scene where Leto and his son explore the local climate, which includes large spice mining craft that has to deal with a colossal sand worm that sees Paul nearly killed when he accidentally inhales some Spice in the air and has another vision, it becomes night and the attack begins. While Leto falls (though he does nearly kill Vladimir in his final moments) Paul and Jessica manage to escape thanks to the efforts of Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and the local ecologist and “Judge of the Change” Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) but end up having to travel the dangerous sands of Arrakis when they use their commanding voice to down the Harkonnen ship they were on. It goes without saying given the cast but the acting is top notch and thankfully the visuals match it, especially the deserty world of Arrakis itself (which is handy given the majority of the film takes place there!) plus the soundtrack is mesmerising and played just right. You could argue a slow pace across its two and a half hours, though to me that was perfect as it really did need everything to be set up and for you to care about these people before it comes crumbling down, and I’d understand annoyance if you went into the film not knowing this was a “Part One of Two” but I can only say that I really enjoyed my night in with the film and I’m frankly glad I waited this long because having to wait years for part two would’ve been a killer! Dune’s first half lived up to the hype as a mix of political intrigue, sci-fi storytelling and a large selection of really interesting characters, all with great visuals and sound design to match. The two and a half hours flew by and left me really looking forward to more, which is something very few films that length can claim. Roll on Part Two! As Paul and his mother survive a night on the sands the new Duke of Atreides has another Spice-induced vision, this time of himself and the mysterious girl starting something of a war across the known galaxy and deposing the Emperor as they watch the bodies pile up in their name, a vision that scares the boy and has him lash out at his mother for giving him these gifts. The two decide to cross the desert to find the Fremen, for assistance to get off-world in Jessica’s mind but for Paul it’s all about fulfilling his father’s dream of uniting them so he can get revenge on the Harkonnen and reclaim Arrakis. On the way they narrowly avoid being devoured by a massive Sand Worm in a great scene you saw in all the trailers."
"Feb 24, 2024",positive," 2021 is a year unlike any other, but also a year like every other year.  Yes, theaters reopened (kind of). Yes, cinema was saved by three young men in spider suits (kind of), And yet, living in an area not catered to by independent film, many of my best films of the year happened right at the end, which always makes context difficult. On top of that, there are films that, as of this posting, are not available to be seen (I’m looking at you, The Tragedy of Macbeth and The Worst Person in the World).  But I digress, as there were still great films to be seen in 2021.  Here are my Top 10 this year, minus some movies that I wish made my list. I solemnly swear that films like Copshop, No Time To Die, In The Heights and tick, tick…Boom! were on my Top 10 for most of the year.  Alas. Ridley Scott provided maybe the biggest surprise of the year. Not sure that there was a movie with worse press leading up to its release. A Rashomon-like story about a sexual assault? Directed by a man? Yikes.  And yet, it all works. Ben Affleck gave us one of my favorite characters of the year, and Jodie Comer is a Top 5 female performance for sure. Her subtle (and unsubtle) acting choices differentiating the three versions of the story take us on a serious journey, not only into the events, but her character’s psyche throughout. Plus, the titular duel absolutely lives up to the hype.  The brutality of the time is encapsulated perfectly in Ridley’s vision. This is one of the many late comers to my list, but Mass was worth the wait. Yes, it is stagey. It is basically in one location.  But the screenplay and simple camerawork draw you in and brings you into horrific pain. Looking away never feels like an option and that is due to four, near pitch-perfect performances. Picking a favorite seems trite as they all build on each other. But it was wonderful to see Jason Isaacs being given a chance to bite into a serious role again. He, along with all three “leads”, deserves both serious awards consideration and a chance to play these types of characters again. Welcome to the year of the musical! As a fan, I am here for it. I actually have three musicals in my Top 20, but this is the best of them. Yes, there is one gaping hole of charisma in a lead, but the other lead and supports make up for it. Ariana DeBose lives up to Rita Moreno, Rachel Zegler passed Sondheim’s test, and Mike Faist absolutely owns Riff. But still, the most important pieces are behind the camera. From the audacious opening shot to the decision to stage “America” off of a rooftop; Spielberg, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and a fabulous adaptation from Tony Kushner enable West Side Story to make all the right choices for a 2021 update. The first of three foreign language films may be the most difficult film on my list. Not too expected, given that it is adapted from a short story from Haruki Murukami short story. The film dares to truly take its time. Not every journey is worth three hours, but the performances of Hidetoshi Nishijima and Tôko Miura carry the film, even in moments of silence. Drive My Car will not be for everyone, but for those willing, your patience will be rewarded in the purest form of empathy available for cinephiles this year. Possibly the most beautiful, and near inscrutable film this year, is David Lowery’s epic, Arthurian tale. In a film world full of obvious explanations, The Green Knight provides precious few. Dev Patel proves once again, that you can use a diverse cast of phenomenal actors and it doesn’t make one bit of difference. He defies your sense of supposed believability and completely inhabits the character of Gawain. Patel exhibits sensuality, insecurity, and honor all in one beautiful two hour stretch. Lowery proves, once again, that he is a do everything filmmaker that, love him or hate him, has a singular vision worth watching. Look, let me get this out of the way.  I’m a fan of the book, and I was completely sure that no one could do this. But by god, Mr. Villenueve found a way. Part art film, part big budget science fiction, Dune really hit all the marks. There are even moments that surpass the novel, especially the relationship between Leto and Paul, mainly due to a heartfelt speech from Oscar Isaac. Stunning cinematography paired with a perfectly cast film (especially Jason Momoa, of all people) ends up with a truly rewarding big screen saga for the ages. Just give me Part 2 already! This was definitely the movie I looked forward to most this year. I mean it’s Paul Thomas Anderson, the man hasn’t made a bad movie yet. It’s weird to find a movie underwhelming at number four, but I firmly expected this to be my favorite of the year. But it is still, obviously, fantastic. Most of the complaints about the film are wildly overblown, but it is a challenge. Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman shine, and it is especially lovely to see normal looking people in major film roles. Licorice Pizza also provides maybe the most fun low speed vehicle chase in film history. It is a grand, fun, romantic ride, that I guess will provide even more greatness on rewatch. Much has already been said about Jane Campion’s western masterpiece, and for good reason. It is indeed truly great. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a career best performance, American accent and all. His switch from terrifying monster to tough love mentor (and back again?) is truly one for the ages. Campion, in a change from previous work, zeroes in on toxic masculinity with a laser focus that is wildly uncomfortable to watch. The Power of the Dog proves, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that you do not need pure good character to root for to make your movie not just watchable, but engrossing.  Yes, yes, the movie where she has sex with a car.  It’s real and it is phenomenal. I did not think that I could be more impressed with Julia Ducournau after Raw, but this is somehow even better. Her lack of concern with being accepted or understood by mainstream audiences is infectious. Titane plays with gender, parental relationships, and sexuality in equal measure. It is a near impossible film to describe or recommend, but here I am doing both. If you actually want to be pushed as a film viewer, Ducournau is the director you should be watching. She managed to make a movie weirder after making a film about cannibalism. Some of the most stunning imagery of the year wrapped in a film that sticks with you for months. Ugly and beautiful. Pedro Almodóvar and Penélope Cruz are obviously a match made in cinephile heaven. It seems like no one gets her skill set quite like Pedro. Parallel Mothers is a rare movie, one that completely subverts expectations just with the final scene. It feels like melodrama, surrounded by political moments that will be forgotten. But have faith, it all comes together with a perfection that is unnerving. The final shot colors the journey we have been on in a way that will haunt you, as long as you are paying attention. Not only am I sure that it will become even better on rewatch, but it has actually gained in my esteem, the more I think about it. This is Almodóvar at his most political and romantic, an absolute treat for all of the senses. "

"Aug 10, 2023",positive," BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — One new version of an old story that works while another one that fails are among this week’s new entertainment options. “Dune” 3 ½ stars: Director Denis Villeneuve faced a major challenge in creating “Dune,” an epic science fiction production based on the classic 1965 Frank Herbert novel of the same name. Herbert’s writing is so rich and complicated that past efforts to adapt the book have either failed to happen or in the case of the 1984 film from director David Lynch, could not live up to the power and grandeur of the original writing. Villeneuve (“Blade Runner 2049”) has succeeded where others have failed by showing a deep respect for the novel but also being equally aware that the very essence of the production is that it must be entertaining. His “Dune” is a visually stunning tale of greed, power, hope and love that finds sharp contrasts in a monochromatic environment. Telling the tale in a proper way is complicated by the futuristic world that Herbert created as the setting for his story. Unlike the picturesque beauty of the “Lord of the Rings” setting or the intergalactic backdrop of the “Star Wars” franchise, “Dune” unfolds in a world almost void of color. Despite the harshness of the location, Villeneuve has created a film that embraces what should be dismissed as visually bland and shows how beauty can be found in even the most subtle of differences. He got great help from two-time Oscar-nominated production designer Patrice Vermette, two-time Oscar-nominated editor Joe Walker, two-time Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer in creating the stunning visuals in the film. “Halloween Kills” Grade ½ star: The film picks up moments after babysitter-turned-vigilant Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) have “killed” Myers in the 2018 film “Halloween.” They have left him caged in Laurie’s basement that has been set on fire. Of course Myers doesn’t die and sets off on a killing spree where the deaths range from grossly bloody to super silly. No one should ever have to die by having a car door hit the gun they are firing and accidentally shooting themselves. David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, Scott Teems – writers of “Halloween Kills” – try to pass off what is shorter than a fortune cookie message as a full movie script. The entire story is Michael Myers kills stupid people who chase him. The trio has taken the pathetic horror film trope of having the victims of the killer hopelessly running away until they can be slaughtered and turned it into everyone running toward the killer until they can be slaughtered. They were going to get killed anyway but the stupidity level of this movie will make your head hurt. “Cobra Kai III”: Series takes place more than 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). “Mass”: Two sets of parents (Reed Birney and Ann Dowd, Jason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton), agree to talk privately in an attempt to move forward years after an unspeakable tragedy tore their lives apart. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Aug 8, 2023",positive," Initially scheduled to be released in 2020 and postponed many times due to the pandemic, Dune (2021) has been on everyone’s radar for over a year, and with good reason. Ever since the release of David Lynch’s 1984 misfire and an ambitious but flawed 2000 television miniseries, as well as the failed release of Jodorowsky’s promising adaptation, fans of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed novels have been waiting a long time for someone to bring Dune to the big screen while preserving the scale and scope of what continues to be one of the most beloved and influential sagas in sci-fi history.  And, with master storyteller Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) at the helm, a stellar cast, and a team of creatives of the likes of composer Hans Zimmer (Inception), director of photography Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty), production designer Patrice Vermette (Arrival, Sicario), editor Joe Walker (Blade Runner 2049), and Oscar-winning visual effects supervisors Paul Lambert (First Man) and Gerd Nefzer (Blade Runner 2049), it won’t come as a surprise that Dune is just as enthralling, epic and stunning as we hoped it would be. Though Villeneuve’s latest film isn’t, at times, entirely satisfying narratively speaking, it’s certainly the best adaptation of the novel to date, as well as a technically flawless, incredibly immersive experience whose impressive world-building requires you to watch it on the biggest screen possible. Set thousands of years in the future, Dune is a story that touches upon many themes and takes place in an interstellar society where different civilizations are fighting to gain control of “the most valuable substance in the universe” —  a rare and highly valued natural resource they call the Spice, which can influence anything from space travel to commerce, knowledge, and even human existence itself. But Dune‘s universe is as complex as it is full of planets, whose inhabitants come with different sets of motives and purposes: there’s the desert planet of Arrakis, where the Spice can be harvested, but that is made inhospitable by elements that vary from unbearable heat and frequent sandstorms to terrifying, deadly “sandworms” that tend to show up at the worst possible time. Living on Arrakis are an indigenous, spiritual human civilization called the Fremen, as well as many wealthy “oppressors” that take turns colonising it, sent by the emperor to harvest the Spice.  When Dune begins, an imperial decree has just made Duke Leto of the House of Atreides (Oscar Isaac, of the Star Wars franchise and The Card Counter), from planet Caladan, the new governor of Arrakis, and that causes friction with the previous residents of the planet, the Harkonnens, rivals of the Atreides. Led by Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, of Chernobyl and Mamma Mia!) and eager to regain control of the planet, the former colonisers start plotting to defeat Duke Leto and his family — the Duke’s concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, of Mission: Impossible – Fallout), who’s part of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient religious order of women with superhuman mental and physical abilities, and their son, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, of Call Me by Your Name and Little Women), who shares her mother’s powers and who also happens to be destined to save the universe and ensure the future of humanity.  Just like the book, the film begins with Duke Leto, Jessica and Paul embarking on a trip to Arrakis with swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, of Aquaman and Game of Thrones), and follows them on a journey where nothing and no one are quite what they seem. As the Atreides attempt to forge alliances and fight for their own survival, Paul tries to decode a series of visions that mainly involve a mysterious Fremen girl whom we’ll later come to know as Chani (Zendaya, of Malcolm & Marie and HBO’s Euphoria), and to master the “Voice,” the power of the Bene Gesserit, in the attempt to become the “mind powerful enough to breach space and time, past and future” that many believe to be coming to save the world. This brief introduction doesn’t even begin to describe the complexities of Dune‘s universe, a world made of a myriad of characters and exploring many themes, from religion and politics to environmental change, all while following a young man’s journey of discovery of his own identity, and a quest to fulfill his destiny that sees him battling against powerful, unknown forces. In fact, Dune‘s world is so intricate and full of characters, locations and unknown terminology that one of the issues with past adaptations of the novels was that the uninitiated struggled to understand the universe’s dynamics and rules: that was the case with David Lynch’s film, where the initial lack of explanations on the nature of the Sand and the characters’ role within the narrative made it hard for people who hadn’t read the novel to follow our hero’s quest.  But what’s really impressive about Dune (2021) is that it’s surprisingly easy to follow: co-writers Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) cleverly weave information into the narrative in a way that ensures we’re immediately able to grasp the essential facts we need to know about a world that never fails to be absorbing and intriguing, as there’s just as much mystery and action to keep us entertained throughout. In fact, it’s easy not to notice that Dune is nearly three hours long, as it’s so effortless to get drawn into an utterly fascinating world we can’t wait to explore, made all the more compelling by the film’s sound design and cinematography, as well as a series of memorable performances that will have your eyes glued to the screen. As a fan of the novels, it has been a lifelong dream of composer Hans Zimmer (Inception) to score a Dune adaptation, and, when the opportunity came along, he rose to the occasion by crafting an unforgettable, instantly iconic score that highly contributes to giving the film a more defined identity, as well as making it more immersive and affecting on an emotional level. Dark, ominous cues make the tension rise and the action become more urgent, while percussions draw us into the film’s mysteries; the use of certain notes often gives the film an otherworldly quality, and a feeling of suspension of time, while a chorus of female voices makes everything more solemn and mystical, reflecting the power of the film’s female characters.  And, if Dune‘s score and sound design give the movie more depth and meaning, it’s the film’s stunning world-building that gives us a world that you’ll instantly recognise if you’ve read the book, and that you’ll be immediately drawn to even if you haven’t. While the sci-fi components of the film, such as the suits worn by the Fremen, the sandstorm and a series of buildings, ships and props, are somewhat reminiscent of Arrival, the gorgeous, desaturated palette that defines Arrakis gives us plenty of meditative, quiet moments, while the mystical quality of Paul’s visions reflect his mental state, as well as the journey that’s ahead of him. Needless to say, Paul couldn’t have been played by anyone else but Timothée Chalamet, who inhabits the role with incredible confidence, showing us a character in constant evolution who does what he can to control the forces (and Voices) inside him without losing his own self, all while having to unexpectedly take on a new role that’s bigger than himself. If the film’s screenplay gives Paul plenty of epic, memorable lines, it’s Chalamet who brings his character to life by letting raw emotion through at exactly the right times, showing us a “lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground” who inevitably becomes the leader he was meant to be — which makes for highly rewarding, meaningful storytelling. Sharing many scenes together, Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson complement each other perfectly, and the chemistry between them is undeniable.  Ferguson excels at playing one of the most complex characters in the film, showing us a woman who’s constantly conflicted between her duties as a sorceress and as a mother, and giving us more than one goosebump-worthy scene while also conveying the wisdom of someone who’s seen and experienced a great deal during her lifetime. Chalamet and Ferguson are the film’s standouts, but every single cast member gives us incredibly committed performances that help give depth to their characters: Oscar Isaac moves us more than once as Duke Leto, one of the film’s most likeable characters, while Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) imbues enigmatic Fremen leader Stilgar with passion, gravity and raw power with facial expressions alone.  Zendaya‘s body acting draws us to her character even if she hardly ever speaks, Stellan Skarsgård never fails to terrify us as Baron Harkonnen, and Dave Bautista (the Guardians of the Galaxy films and Avengers: Endgame) and Josh Brolin (Milk and Avengers: Infinity War) are just as fearsome as Harkonnen’s nephew and war master. Among the supporting characters, the standout is Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Sex Education), who plays ecologist Liet-Kynes (who has been gender-swapped from the novels), one of Dune‘s most fascinating and intriguing characters, made unforgettable by the intensity with which Duncan-Brewster delivers her lines. When I left today’s screening of Dune at the Venice Film Festival, I was mesmerised by the craft on display, from the film’s achievements on a technical level to a series of highly believable, committed performances that, alone, make the film so very compelling and absorbing. Yet, I found that something was missing, and that something has to do with the film’s narrative. While it’s no secret that the director would like there to be a Part 2 to the film, it’s also hard not to notice that Dune would feel absolutely incomplete if it were to stand on its own, as not only does the entire film revolve around a conflict that isn’t resolved by the time it ends, but the ending itself feels like it should be a beginning, and it can be very frustrating to get invested in a story that ultimately leaves you with no answers and no real resolution. Only time will tell what Dune will turn out to be, as a final product, and whether or not it will be developed into something more than a standalone film: for now, we can enjoy watching an incredibly well-crafted adaptation that’s faithful to the source material while also breathing new life into it, and an immersive, epic cinematic journey that will absolutely leave you aching for more."
"Jul 28, 2023",positive," The many media attempts at adapting Frank Herbert’s epic space fantasy Dune speak to its lasting appeal and its potent impact. David Lynch’s 1984 movie, defended by the filmmaker’s most ardent supporters but excoriated by a larger chorus disappointed in the heavy hand applied by House De Laurentiis, marked the end of a lengthy journey to the screen that defeated the likes of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott along the way. Dreams of what might have been — Orson Welles as Baron Harkonnen! Moebius and H. R. Giger design! — gave way to the realities of any “faithful” adaptation. At its best, Herbert’s book presents a stunning vision of political power, ecological/environmental awareness, ruling-class genealogy, military conflict, thrilling mysticism and religious myth-making filtered through a messianic hero’s journey. At its weakest, Dune has too many scenes of people standing around and talking. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One is a worthy addition to the collection, besting the Lynch film in certain ways but still flummoxed and frustrated by the source material’s conversation-heavy downside. Villeneuve is clearly a fan, a Bene Gesserit-level adherent to the Weirding Way and a desert mouse who respects the Shai-Hulud. The director’s impressive track record with dazzling ideas and/or imagery in settings both smaller (Prisoners, Enemy) and grander (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) raised expectations higher than a Guild Navigator on uncut spice. In Dune, the filmmaker delivers at least 450 meters of world-building eye candy to remind everyone of Herbert’s far-reaching influence. Villeneuve juggles a huge cast filled with famous and should-be famous performers well-suited to flesh out their occasionally flat literary antecedents. Some great faces made up Lynch’s roster, including many favorites in the filmmaker’s stock company, and Villeneuve could not ask for more capable portrayers in nearly all the principal and supporting roles. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica and Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, despite sharing few one-on-one scenes, walk off with the movie. While Lynch’s screenplay diminished and truncated Jurgen Prochnow’s Leto, Villeneuve concentrates the time and attention required to both express the Shakespearean tragedy of the Red Duke and articulate the emotional connection between Leto and his son. Perhaps Jodorowsky was on to something when he argued for a 10 to 14-hour running time. If all goes according to plan, Dune: Part Two will remedy the insufficient, almost fleeting, presence of Zendaya’s Chani, Javier Bardem’s Stilgar and even Dave Bautista’s Beast Rabban. There’s no question that Villeneuve’s decision to divide the book leaves both newcomers and the Dune faithful with lots of questions and the empty feelings that go along with unfinished business. As many viewers have already noted, the second section should have been filmed at the same time and prepared for a 2022 release. Villeneuve’s  Dune  takes itself so seriously that plenty of observers have dipped their Gom Jabbar needles into poisoned inkwells. David Ehrlich’s vicious takedown at IndieWire is entertainingly arch, slightly cruel and not entirely fair. Peter Opaskar’s wild, tongue-in-cheek defense of Lynch’s version as the greatest film ever made — one of several recent reassessments of the 1984 movie — was posted at Arts Technica before the critic watched the new one. I am glad to live in a world where we already have two big screen interpretations and Frank Pavitch’s fantastic documentary. If we don’t destroy ourselves, there will surely be enough Dune by the year 10,191 to please everybody. Greg Carlson (@gcarlson1972) is an associate professor of communication studies and the director of the interdisciplinary film studies minor program at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota. He is also the film editor of the High Plains Reader, where his writing has appeared since 1997."
"Jul 27, 2023",positive," Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival) and featuring a killer cast including Timothee Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name), Rebecca Ferguson (The Greatest Showman) and Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), the sci-fi blockbuster of the year is finally here. Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a young man born into a great destiny, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his people. As the planet falls into huge conflict over the spice, the most precious resource in existence, Paul and his family must conquer their fear to survive. Having a cast this star-studded definitely paid off, every performance managing to deliver. Rebecca Ferguson was a stand-out as Lady Jessica, the Mother of Paul Atreides who is competent in using 'the voice', a skill enabling her to manipulate speech to take complete control over others. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) also impressed as Duncan Idaho, a great fighter and commander who does his best to protect his people. Josh Brolin (Avengers: Endgame) brings humour and heart to the movie with his character Gurney Halleck. Timothee Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides was fantastic, proving he can lead a movie with ease. Paul is a very troubled character who battles with who he wants to be and who he is expected to be, Chalamet managing to perfectly capture every emotion. With a cast this big and a story this dense, many actors unfortunately did not receive enough screen-time for us to root for their character and learn enough about them. Oscar Isaac was under-utilised even though he was in a leading role and gave a great performance, Stellan Skarsgard could've been a much more menacing villain if given more time to shine, and fan favourite Zendaya (Euphoria) mostly only appears in dream sequences with few lines delivered. Already proving himself in the sci-fi department with previous accolades Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Denis Villeneuve was clearly the man for the job. His direction is phenomenal, which is apparent in every element from the acting performances to the visuals. Dune is a sight to behold, featuring some of the most gorgeous cinematography of the year as we venture to the planet Arrakis. Every shot appears to be meticulously crafted, focusing in on the characters as the vast landscapes fill the background.  Hans Zimmer impresses yet again with a heart-pounding original score, pairing well with the cinematography to create an immersive experience. As epic as the score was, it unfortunately took precedence over the dialogue at times, especially during act 2 when a lot of whispering is used. It can sometimes feel difficult to hear line delivery from the likes of Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson, which hinders enjoyment as its a huge world being crafted with lots of exposition. It definitely demands a rewatch in that respect. It's important to remember before heading in to see Dune that this is only half a story; those familiar with Frank Herbert's novels will already be aware of the scope of the source material, and the title claims its only Part 1 when the play button is pushed. On one hand, the story feels slightly incomplete, as the movie features a lot of exposition and world building, feeling more like set-up than a complete story. On the other hand, this is hopefully only the beginning of what Dune could be, with a lot coming up to look forward to. Villeneuve does well to include a healthy amount of both character development and world building, with action-packed scenes aplenty to balance out the heavy exposition. Thankfully, Dune shows rather than tells, allowing the audience to think for themselves and piece it all together. It does its best to avoid confusion, and if Part 2 hopefully comes to fruition, it could be even bigger and better. Dune is a masterful sci-fi blockbuster that is going to please the majority of its audience. The visuals are crying out to be seen on the biggest screen possible, easily becoming the movies standout. Every performance delivers, Zimmers score is impeccable, the characters are likeable and the action scenes are well choreographed and entertaining. Unfortunately, its difficult to give Dune full marks as at times it felt like it didn't truly get going, and we needed much more development as certain talents were underutilised. That being said, Villeneuve did his best to include vital information to ensure the audience understood the complex story, and has set up a delectable world that can only get more exciting from here. It is a movie that is likely preferred after a couple of rewatches, an activity that fans and critics alike have not found a chore to undertake."
"Jul 26, 2023",positive, A true cinematic treasure that will be cherished for decades to come & gave me the same feeling that I got watching A New Hope for the first time. This is Epic to the highest of standards & I need more right now.
"Jul 26, 2023",negative," The 2022 science fiction epic, Dune, was a passion project embarked on by French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. Villeneuve foreshadowed his ability to deliver breathtaking images as far back as 2013 with his excellent yet underseen thriller, Enemy, which features a gargantuan spider towering above the skyscrapers of Toronto. Dune takes place over eight thousand years from now when humanity, under the auspices of a feudalistic empire, has colonized various planets. In a veiled reference to colonialism and Middle Eastern oil, the most important planet politically and economically is the inhospitable desert world of Arrakis, informally referred to as Dune, and the only place in the cosmos where “spice,” a substance necessary for interstellar travel, can be found. Timothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of the Duke of House Atreides, played by Oscar Isaac, and Lady Jessica Atreides, portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson. Paul accompanies his parents to Arrakis after his father accepts the emperor’s request to restore stable spice production, even though House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and sworn enemies of the Atreides, have other plans. Apropos of Joseph Campbell’s mythology of the chosen one, Paul might be the messiah prophesized by the desert dwellers who have lived on Arrakis for thousands of years. Villeneuve has taken Frank Herbert’s classic novel and crafted a film that strains under the weight of his obvious reverence for the material; there is a Shakespearean gravitas to Herbert’s writing, but the ponderous sense of self-importance that permeates Dune is reminiscent of George Lucas’s Star Wars prequels. The only attempts at anything resembling lightheartedness are two lame jokes that land with a thud near the very start of the film, both of which are shown in the trailer. Visually, Dune is unquestionably awe-inspiring, as evidenced by its sweep of technical awards at last year’s Oscars. But the special effects dwarf human interactions, as evidenced by Dune’s total shutout from every acting category. As with superhero movies, the talented cast is in service of spectacle, doing little more than providing the expositional sutures that connect one elaborate set piece to the next. When the virtual camera does pull away from massive CGI spacecraft, sandworms, and desert battles, Villeneuve’s direction struggles to create memorable performances. Timothée Chalemet delivers most of his lines as if he’s battling lockjaw; macho warriors played by Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa are stereotypical characters that could have just as easily been inhabited by Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson; and Oscar Isaac is uncharacteristically one-note as Paul’s father, wearing his stoicism like The Shroud of Turin. The rare exceptions include Rebecca Ferguson as Paul’s fiercely protective mother – she gets to flex her thespian muscles the most – and Charlotte Rampling, who dominates the screen as the venomous Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood of witches. However, if you’re a fan of impressive world building and special effects done on a spectacular scale, Dune definitely delivers the goods. To paraphrase Roger Ebert’s advice following the home video release of an earlier desert-based epic, Lawrence of Arabia, you could watch Dune on your TV and enjoy some of its majesty, but to experience it properly, it needs to be seen on the largest screen possible. Dune: Part Two is scheduled to premiere in November, so those regretting having missed out on the first chapter’s original theatrical release will be able to catch up with it on its inevitable re-release. Ever since he was a teen, Paul has been involved in some form of film criticism, exhibition, or production. For the better part of two decades, he moderated the film discussion group, Let’s Talk About the Movies, which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic Del Mar theater in downtown Santa Cruz. In 2023, Paul's insightful KSQD movie reviews earned him Tomatometer-Approved Critic status on Rotten Tomatoes (https://rottentomatoes.com/critic/paul-kanieski)."
"Jul 25, 2023",positive," Synopsis: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will survive. It's no secret that Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite filmmakers. Ever since Incendies, all of his films received my highest rating, except Enemy, which I still love tremendously. Therefore, it was impossible to set low expectations for an adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, one of the most prominent sci-fi novels of all-time. The first and only translation to the big screen was in charge of David Lynch back in 1984, becoming one of the most impactful movies of the respective decade to receive a cult following, despite the well-known production problems that resulted in a divisive flick. I intended to rewatch Lynch's version a few days before Villeneuve's take, but due to recommendations from fellow colleagues, I stepped back in order to try and feel the immense scale of Dune - both technically and narratively - as if it was my very first visit to this vast universe. With a screenplay written by Jon Spaihts (Passengers), Villeneuve himself, and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born), plus the ensemble cast stacked with stars who could lead any blockbuster, I entered the glorious IMAX theater, and I left… completely and utterly stunned. Fortunately, for good reasons. Despite the overwhelming hype from over-the-top early reactions - journalists craved for that pull-quote harder than with any other film this year - I tried my best to not let the global positive feedback impact my expectations too much. After all, ""this is only the beginning"". At the time of this review, the second and supposedly last part isn't yet officially confirmed, but it's a matter of time for it to be certain. But let me focus on this first chapter because it has a lot to explore and discuss. And I mean, a LOT. The lengthy runtime and deliberately slow pacing don't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Villeneuve's filmography. With Dune, his filmmaking traits fit like a glove. The lingering camera helps the viewers feel every story beat, almost as if the audience is watching a documentary and following the events in real-time. I'll get to each cast member later, but obviously, it's tough not to feel engaged in almost every scene when so many talented actors are around. One of the most challenging tasks about adapting Dune is its world-building. Heavy exposition is somewhat inevitable, but Villeneuve is able to balance the different voice-overs - spoken in different, distinct languages - in seamless fashion. The riveting opening sequence with Zendaya's (Malcolm & Marie) narration quickly establishes an intriguing premise to an extremely complex, layered story that tackles numerous topics spread across Houses Atreides and Harkonnen, as well as the Imperial House and the Fremen - guardians of the Arrakis deserts.  Thematically, Dune is one of the richest sci-fi/fantasy narratives ever. Probably, the most political saga of the genre. The constant backstabbing between the distinct houses - Atreides has loyalty and mercy as their banners, while Harkonnen is based on power and brutality - gives rise to discussions about economic growth, limited resources, climate issues, war, wealth, space travel, and so much more. Villeneuve succeeds in taking a brutally intricate story and making the long runtime worth the viewers' investment. Practically every scene with or without dialogue gets its respective payoff throughout the movie. Nothing is shown on screen without a purpose. Even the several shots highlighting the spaceships taking off or landing add to the tension of those moments, aided by Hans Zimmer's powerful score and Theo Green's impressive sound design. I'll take this last sentence as a transition to write about the award-worthy technical aspects because if there's something certain about this year's Oscars and similar shows is that this film will receive dozens of nominations. Technically, Dune should be the new definition of ""epic"" in the dictionary. Nowadays, blockbusters ""look great"" regularly, but this new adaptation of the famous novel is simply a completely different beast altogether, just like Blade Runner 2049 was in 2017. From the eyegasmic visuals to the heart-pounding score, every single audiovisual element is meant to be witnessed in the biggest theater on the planet. An exceptionally immersive cinematic experience that will please the eyes and ears of every moviegoer.  The sound and production design surround Dune within a massive scope, a truly colossal, outrageously big film. Of all the hyperboles that people have been (over)using to describe it, I accept with all my heart the ones related to the gargantuan scale of this beautiful piece of cinema. The shot selection is on-point throughout the entire movie. DP Greig Fraser (Rogue One) delivers wide shots worthy of belonging in a museum. Every frame is dripping with visual quality, but the lack of a broader color palette is definitely a personal nitpick in an otherwise technically perfect flick. The character work is remarkable, to say the least. With such a jammed cast, the writers develop each character through interesting dialogues and gripping action/war sequences. The viewers will have no issues differentiating each character and associating them with their respective House and role there. Honestly, to be able to balance and encompass so many people and storylines successfully is a monumental task, even with the extended runtime. The acting is phenomenal across the board. Timothée Chalamet (Little Women) proves his haters wrong by compellingly leading a huge blockbuster filled with renowned stars. As Paul Atreides, Chalamet shows a much more serious side of him, and Villeneuve's style allows the actor's expressions to remain on screen enough time to show the viewers what his character is genuinely feeling and thinking. However, my personal standout has to be Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep) as Lady Jessica.  The actress offers the best performance of the entire cast, demonstrating her outstanding emotional range. An incredibly passionate interpretation of the second most important character of the film, who adds a mysterious layer to the already tense atmosphere. I won't go through the whole cast, but I still have to mention Stellan Skarsgård (Chernobyl) as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen - steals every scene he's in with a fiercely menacing display. Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Josh Brolin (Avengers: Endgame), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), and Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Sex Education) also deserve much praise. Zendaya and Javier Bardem (Mother!) are barely in the movie, which could disappoint a few audience members. If the viewers aren't familiarized with the original novel or the 1984's film, Zendaya's continuous presence in the press tour and marketing campaign will feel like false advertising for this movie, even though her character undoubtedly possesses a significant role in the sequel. The actors are great as expected, but their short appearances - mainly the actress' - are connected to my major issue with the film. ""Dreams are messages from the deep"". That's the first piece of voice-over heard in Dune. Paul has countless dream sequences vital to better understand his arc, as well as the overall plot. However, both the moments where these are inserted and their quantity hurt the already steady pacing. Dune is indeed a slow-burn, but despite knowing it's only half of a gigantic movie, I still believe this part could have gone even further. I'd gladly watch thirty extra minutes to get a bit more of the Fremen's arc, but the unnecessarily repetitive dreams drag the narrative too much for my taste. The more I think about Dune, the more I love it. In fact, there are many more memorable scenes than I ever anticipated. I vividly remember dozens of sequences, whether these are the energetic, explosive action/war scenes - impossible to imagine Dune out of the Best VFX category - or the highly engaging dialogues, such as one with Paul and a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. Game of Thrones fans will find some political similarities that might help them enjoy this saga even more. In fact, comparisons with two other popular franchises have to be made. From a filmmaking perspective, some shots resemble The Lord of the Rings' depiction of its famous kingdoms. The first time Arrakis is seen by the audience is quite similar to when Gandalf visits Gondor. In addition to this, Villeneuve truly cuts this first part in half in the sense that it feels like this film doesn't have a proper third act. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there's still a conventional climax and some sort of final build-up to let the audience know the movie is about to end. On the other hand, Dune ends somewhat abruptly, as if someone came in and stopped the projector midway through the film. Nevertheless, from an audiovisual standpoint, Dune has much more in common with Star Wars. From the enormous spaceships to the actual space travel and various planets, it's challenging not to find several resemblances. Bear in mind that sharing common elements doesn't mean a particular franchise is as good or better than the other, far from that - in that regard, don't forget Dune was around way before SW. Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story surrounded by an absolutely massive scale. Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography, despite some narrative-pacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences. Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out in a stellar cast, where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive. From the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions, without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting action/war scenes, the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen, where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie. Finally, don't forget that epic sci-fi/fantasy films are quite rare, so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out, instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas. There's enough space to love them all."
"Jul 24, 2023",negative,Dune is so engaged in getting the plot right and building an appropriate world that it doesn’t have time to let its characters bond or develop a real connection.
"Jul 21, 2023",neutral," Synopsys: Feature adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. Denis Villeneuve is a visionary director unlike any other working today, whether it is a tale about questioning your life after a traumatic abortion like in Maelström (2000) or the pulsing chain-of-events caused by a government task force to stop a Mexican drug cartel in Sicario (2015). Although most recent works dwell in the sci-fi genre, all his pieces deal with the search for identity and center on a character who feels lost in his environment. For his next project, Villeneuve wants to tackle Dune, the Frank Herbert odyssey that many describe as “unfilmable.” Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is a gifted young man destined for many great things beyond his understanding. He must travel to one of the most dangerous planets in the universe, Arrakis (also known as Dune), to secure the future of the Atreides heir, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his people. However, the Atreides aren’t the only ones trying to conquer the planet. The malicious Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) wants a war for the planet’s supply of one of the most valuable resources in existence: melange, better known as “spice. Herbert’s novel has influenced many auteurs to create their visions or franchises, notably George Lucas with Star Wars. A long time has passed since Dune got published, and there have been multiple stories like this: a young hero is destined to save the world with his unique abilities. That storyline of the “chosen one” or “the messiah” has been refurbished many times; some films go in a more original route, while others just stick to the regular formula and fail. In this case, you feel Villeneuve’s passion for the source material; nevertheless, his vision arrives lifeless and lackluster. His adaptation is divided into two separate parts, and it is evident that this is indeed a segment of the narrative because it feels incomplete in structure. It’s not the literature as a whole but the core of Villeneuve’s vision. It feels like an extended prologue before going over to part two if it even happens. It is the opening crawl from Star Wars, a prelude to what may be considered “the good stuff.” One of the reasons Alejandro Jodorowsky never got to make his version, and David Lynch’s ended up like that is because of the material. It is too large in scope and oeuvre that it would take over three pictures with a 3-hour runtime or a 9-hour romp to cover it with fulfillment. And for a person who hasn’t read the book, like me, you won’t understand much of what’s going on. Its narrative is concocted by stone-wall scripture that is impenetrable to get through if you aren’t familiar with it. There is also an issue regarding the characters and their development in this grandiose tale. Since the writers skimmed over some of their arcs and went with a drier route, you don’t have any emotional devotion to them whatsoever. You don’t empathize with any nor get reasons to care for them if they get into sticky situations. Not even the resplendent all-star cast could elevate their galactic trooper personas. Some deliver a good performance, most notably Rebecca Ferguson as the elegant Lady Jessica and Jason Momoa as the wild uncle Duncan Idaho. I wish I had seen more from Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. All caked-up in make-up with black oil covering his body, playing his villain with a pantomime and egregious demeanor like Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. On a more positive note, there are some impressive technical aspects in this film that are amusing to the eye. The tactility of the atmosphere is strong, making you feel the sands of Arrakis brushing through the cinema. Unlike other sci-fi displays, you don’t question the artificiality of this fantasy world. The costumes and production design are lavish, and the cinematography, although it lacks a bit of color, is nice to look at. However, when it comes to the visual effects, I feel somewhat mixed about them. Not that it seems shoddy or creaky, but at times, you can sense the green-screen mechanics in the background, taking you out of the experience for a quick second. As the clock ticks to the grand finale, an unnecessary cascade of explosions and slaughter meshes into the story. You just wish it would amount to something great in the end; a piece of cinema that truly captures what the sci-fi and fantasy genres can bring to the table when executed astonishingly, for example, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (2003) or Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017). Villeneuve can build spectacle and innovative tales because we have seen him do it before, but his rendition of Dune isn’t one of them. Finally, the spice opera ends, and the only question in your mind is if that was really it. I guess we’ll just have to wait to piece the puzzle together because these 155-minutes served as a curtain-raiser. And remember: “this is only the beginning.”"
"Jul 19, 2023",positive," I’ve watched more movies in 2021 than I have any other year, and I couldn’t be more excited to explore all the different varieties that I was able to discover. Because of the large amount that I saw relative to years previous, I felt like this year I was really able to define my taste in what I enjoyed and why I liked certain pieces of media. It became more clear to me what makes a movie objectively “good”, and what makes it enjoyable for me to watch, and I’m so excited that I’m able to share my list this year of my top 10 favorite movies from 2021. Only making a small splash at the box office, The Eyes of Tammy Faye moved me incredibly because of Jessica Chastain’s transformative performance, and the powerful commentary about religion, capitalism, and greed. Chastain as Tammy Faye portrays a morally grey character as someone filled with so much brightness and joy and genuinely believes what she’s doing is good, contrasted with what we, the audience, know are disgustingly selfish and offensive acts. Chastain delivers such a powerhouse performance that’s grounded and emotional while staying campy and entertaining to watch. In most senses, I actually hate this movie. Watching Danielle (Rachel Sonnett) interact with her family is almost unbearable to see. They push her around (literally), pull her arms, talk about her weight, criticize her eating, question her career choices, and pressure her into a myriad of uncomfortable situations. Set at a shiva in a tiny house, the amount of people surrounding her and desperate for any escape is suffocating. It reminds me so much about how I often feel when I go to my own family functions (and reminds me why I avoid my family), which is why it’s so amazing. It’s incredibly relatable, and it’s comforting to see that maybe I’m not the only person who dreads going to family functions. As a former theatre person, this film hits all the right points exactly as it needs to. I ended up quitting theatre (ironically after I had already received my degree in it) because of how difficult it was to sustain a real career in it. Andrew Garfield is able to teeter the line of the struggles of being a creative without ever stepping into the cliche of the tortured artist. As Lin-Manuel Miranda’s directorial debut, he wisely frames the story as semi-biographical. The framing device is able to enhance and benefit the story by putting songs side by side to the events they’re depicting in both comedic and dramatic senses, and it centers on the heart of the musical, Jonathan Larson. I’m a huge fan of animation. I often find it frustrating when the medium is only regulated to children’s content, so it’s always refreshing when there’s a piece that uses it in a creative and artistic sense to tell mature stories. I couldn’t be more excited when I heard about Flee, which combined the medium with the documentary genre, making an incredibly rare and beautiful film. I was drawn to the material of the documentary as well, about a gay refugee recounting his experience fleeing his home country. I have the privilege of living in a country where I’m not persecuted for my sexuality, and I believe it’s important to learn more about those who do not and try to better understand their experience. It was incredibly moving and heartbreaking, and the animation made the documentary aspect of the film come to life, compared to feeling as if it was merely an interview. Adam McKay is an incredibly divisive filmmaker, but I usually fall on the side of loving his work. I was a fan of the political commentary that Vice was making, and I thought the satire and comedy created an absurd and fun watch. I was looking forward to Don’t Look Up because of the cast, and the general vague plot description. A lot of criticism has been thrown towards this film for being too obvious, but I thought the point McKay was trying to make was incredibly effective, and it was nice to see the craziness of the world we’re living in portrayed as how it actually feels to live in it; often frustrating but usually ridiculous at how oblivious and indifferent most people are. I could continue watching this film over and over again, and I find it hilarious every single time. The emotional premise combined with the incredibly poignant and relevant political commentary of the film is great enough, but it’s the performances that really elevate this film. Originally written to be a one act play, the film forces the characters into one room for a brutal conversation for its hour and a half runtime. All four members of the ensemble cast are stellar in their roles and the performances they deliver, with each one having at least one moment that will prove to you how incredible they all are. Ann Dowd and Martha Plimpton are definitely the stars of this film, and I can’t remember the last time I cried so many times in such a short time span. Underrated and, in my opinion, an underseen movie, Nine Days is a sort of philosophical sci-fi that asks the questions of what happens to us BEFORE we are born. So many pieces of media speculate what happens to us after we die, so it was unique to see something from the opposite perspective. Ironically, without even showing any of the characters living their life, it really shows us what the meaning of life is, and how to find purpose and joy where there might not always be any. The outlook on life from the different character’s perspectives sets up great dynamics and conversations to sort through and try to find yourself in when you’re agreeing or disagreeing. It’s a moving piece that shows us how we can either live as if life is meaningless, or we can find joy wherever it may be, and I think that’s incredibly powerful. I’ll be honest, this year was the first time I ever ventured into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have steered clear of the MCU mostly because I felt there wasn’t much to them; they were just big budget films made to appeal to the widest audience and make the most money without any sort of artistic purpose. I watched WandaVision when  it premiered this winter because of the great reception it was getting, and I fell in love with both of the main characters, but especially with the nuanced portrayal of Wanda’s grief and PTSD. By July, I watched Iron Man for the first time and slowly made my way through the MCU, trying to hit certain benchmarks before each film came out. In some ways, I still feel the same way I do about the MCU. Most of the films from the franchise are good enough, but nothing amazing. They’re all entertaining, but I don’t always feel like they have much depth to them. Spider-Man: No Way Home completely moved me by the amount of heart that was put into the final installment of the trilogy by its entire cast, and the desire to please fans who cared not only about the MCU, but the character Spider-Man, in particular. It also expands on the character and the universe it’s in, without getting too complicated and sticking true to the formula that works best for these films. Was it anything amazing? Not by any means. Did it open my eyes as to why so many people love these movies? In a sense. It was my first “huge” marvel theatrical experience (as Shang-Chi didn’t quite sell out, and Eternals was a critical flop). What this movie did was remind me why I love movies, even in their simplicity, and I can’t trade that experience for anything else. Is this the best thing Pixar has ever made? I don’t think so, not nearly by a long shot. However, this movie means more to me than many other animated pictures ever could. While it’s not explicitly gay, the narrative behind Luca and its two main characters, Luca and Alberto, are incredibly gay coded. Disney/Pixar is still hesitant to label and create a gay story, especially one with kids involved. I want to say as a gay kid this would have been so important to me, but honestly, I never really knew I was gay until I was a teenager. As kids, we’re raised that straight is the norm, until proven otherwise. That’s why as a gay adult this means so much more to me. It’s beautiful seeing two kids just be authentically themselves and have fun with each other, in the cute way that kids would have crushes on each other. I can see all the criticisms that others might have with this film, but to me it holds such a special place in my heart. As my most anticipated film of 2021, Dune would have had to be very bad to make me not like it. I was much too young when The Lord of the Rings came out, and this feels like the first large scale and giant spectacle work since then. Laced with complex politics, interesting themes on religion, gender, imperialism, and environmentalism; this has just about everything a fantasy/sci-fi fan could want. Its world building is so intricate and detailed, between the plot and the action sequences, it’s easy to stay entertained through it’s two and a half hour runtime. While some criticized it because  it doesn’t feel complete as it only covers half of the book, I personally felt satisfied, and the ending only made me more excited for the upcoming part two."
"Jul 19, 2023",positive," Groundbreaking Oscar-nominated director, Denis Villeneuve, has returned with Dune, the story of Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto who embarks on a harrowing journey to the most dangerous planet in the universe to preserve the legacy of his family and people. At the core of this intergalactic power struggle is spice which has become the most important commodity in the universe. Based on Frank Herbert’s bestselling novel of the same name, it is a coming of age story for the king-in-waiting who is forced to put his training in combat and his special gifts to the test on this death defying mission. The film explores a variety of themes including facing and overcoming ones fears. We also see different relationship dynamics play out on screen as Paul learns who he can trust; most importantly learning to trust himself. Chalamet shines in the lead role as he portrays the wise beyond his years Duke, while still revealing his youth, zeal and inexperience. Rebecca Ferguson (“Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”) delivers an equally believable performance as Lady Jessica, his mother and concubine to the Duke who not only gave him his unique powers, but is forced to train him in how to use them (think Obi Wan Kenobi and a young Luke Skywalker). As he learns to trust himself, she in turn must learn to trust her son as he grows into the man and leader he was destined to be. Also appearing in the film is Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”) who sometimes draws criticism for playing the same character in all of his roles. While Momoa plays the predictable role of the muscle-bound warrior and swordmaster, Duncan Idaho, in service of the House of Atreides, he breaks the mold slightly by revealing deep love, affection and loyalty to Paul. Meanwhile, Oscar Isaac (the “Star Wars” franchise) is the wise and almost fearless Duke Leto Atreides. As one of the few characters in the film who isn’t some sort of alien being or doesn’t have a special power, he not only provides a human touch to the film and a connection point for audiences, but he impresses as he is able to rule and garner respect and loyalty simply off the strength of his character. Rounding out the cast are Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), who in limited screen time continues to show depth and maturity as she evolves from a child Disney star, as well as Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), and Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”). Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is simply epic in every sense of the word, from the acting and action sequences, to the score from Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. The grandeur of the film is accentuated by captivating shots and landscapes, including large and arid sand dunes, that not only create a sense of desperation but leave you feeling amazed at the beauty and expansiveness of the world they live in. Between the shots, action and visual effects, viewers may have trouble deciding where to look on the screen. While the film is said to be true to the original novel, viewers will be able to enjoy it without having read the novel or watched the original 1984 adaptation of the film. If you like the Star Wars franchise you will definitely enjoy Warner Bros’ and Legendary Pictures’ Dune."
"Apr 5, 2023",positive," When the theatrical and HBO Max release of Denis Villeneuve's new sci-fi epic Dune were still three months away, a handful of Imax theaters across the US hosted a special two-day Dune event. The presentation revealed the first 10 minutes of the film, as well as 15 minutes of related materials and the movie's trailer.  I attended the event. Here's what you need to know to prepare yourself for the film, which arrives in theaters and on HBO Max Thursday, Oct. 21.  SPOILERS AHEAD: From this point on it will be difficult to talk about the experience without spoiling the film, so if you don't want any details ruined, please stop now.  The Dune universe is a lot. The scale of everything is ridiculous, its rules more than a little weird, and you could probably spend the time it would take to see this film in its entirety breaking down the galactic politics leading up to the opening scene. But instead of holding your hand through all of author Frank Herbert's backstory, this film just drops you in the middle of everything. You get a brief explanation from Chani, played by Zendaya, about why the planet Arrakis is important, how ruthless the Harkonnen family are and that suddenly they left. There's a question about who the new oppressors of Arrakis natives the Fremen will be, then immediately you're taken to the bedroom of royal scion Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, and his story starts.  As a fan of the Dune universe, I loved this. No hand-holding, no background, just 60 seconds of introduction and off we go. I wouldn't go so far as to say it felt like the introduction you get in the book, but the feeling of being dropped into something that feels impossibly big is familiar.  I'm grouping all of the different special abilities you see in the Dune universe as powers for the purpose of making this point. Across all the scenes included in this preview we get to see Paul using his Voice on his mother Lady Jessica and master of assassins Thufir Hawat wield his Mentat ability, and there's a one-on-one fight with personal shields on. Spectacularly, none of these things looked or felt the way I'd imagined they might. In each case, what I saw on screen was even more impressive.  The unique audio choices that represent the Voice, the way Thufir's eyes instantly go white as he processes information and the skin-close shimmer of a personal shield all made me so excited to see more of each.  This was a fascinating detail from the conversation between Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer. The legendary composer said it was weird epic space films are always scored with music that sounds decidedly Earthly, so he sought to find new sounds to help demonstrate how alien these planets truly are. He didn't specify just how he invented these new sounds, but in the example scenes, he certainly nails a strangeness in the score.  Zimmer also relies on singing, especially when someone from the Bene Gesserit nuns is on screen. The higher-pitched chanting or soft-spoken women singing in the background immediately bring a feeling of power and terror to their scenes, which is appropriate given everything they're capable of.  I've seen many iterations of the Dune vehicles across TV, film and video games, and I've never felt like any of them fit the descriptions in the books. I'm not sure the vehicles in this new Dune movie match what's in my mind's eye either, but they're undeniably the coolest versions I've seen so far.  The Ornithopters in Villeneuve's Dune are more dragonfly than bird in design, but they do a great job moving more like the animal than a ship, which was the point in the books. These small crew ships were always supposed to fly more naturally than mechanically.  The Carryalls are often described as ""like an Ornithopter but bigger,"" but that isn't what you'll see in this film. They don't look bad at all, but they don't look like bigger versions of the main vehicle.  Spice Harvesters feel truly massive in this film. The sheer size of them, even as one is fully consumed by a giant sandworm, is incredible. Finally, the Spacing Guild Heighliner no longer looks like a space ship, and that's great. The scale of these vessels were often lost in previous films and shows, but this version helps show how insanely big they are.  There's been a lot of conversation about whether the Fremen eyes were enough. In the past, their eyes have always been presented on screen as glowing, piercing, electric blue. While that looks great, I never felt like it did justice to the way the eyes are described in the books. In fact, the Eyes of Ibad are described as being blue within blue, with no white at all. I think this is more realistically presented in this film. It feels more plausible that the blue would be intense but not unnatural. "
"Feb 10, 2023",positive," Welcome to the end of the beginning. 2021 was a lot of things for a lot of people, but a common trend I see is soul-sucking. It started with an insurrection and ended with another pandemic relapse. And while there was a lot of good to come from the year, it certainly didn’t always feel like it. So congratulations on making it to the end of a horrible year. 2021 didn’t have a lot of interesting Marvel projects for me. I liked a lot of Wandavision, Loki was fun, but the rest kinda just passed by for me. My review of Eternals is on the site (here), and I wasn’t super hot on the film as a whole. As for No Way Home, well, I didn’t like it. It’s got some soaring highs, but most of the film falls flat on its face for me. Enter Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Unlike other films on this list trying way too hard to be something they aren’t, Shang-Chi knows what it is and embraces it completely. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is about arrested development. It’s about the weight of legacies, the weight of living up to the greatness that has come before you. On a meta-level, it’s a Marvel project about having to co-exist with other Marvel projects. And through its vulnerable performances from Tony Leung and Simu Liu, the film ascends beyond typical marvel fanfare. That focus on running away from greatness really resonated with me in a year of creative burnout. And while these themes are serious and heavy, the film never becomes too dark and cynical. It’s extremely funny, with some of the best comedic editing in all of the MCU. And with legendary cinematographer Bill Pope behind the lens, it’s got the best action in the MCU. All in all, it’s one of the best marvel flicks of the past decade, and easily one of the best films of the year. It’s on Disney Plus and well worth a watch.  Malignant is easily the most fun I had at a movie theater this past year. Not the best movie I watched in a theater (those are coming up) but the most fun. James Wan made a horror classic with Malignant, a film that is best experienced blind. If you haven’t watched this yet, please do. It’s campy. It’s funny.  It’s properly scary. And most importantly, it’s got some heart behind it. Like many entries on this list, Malignant feels like a passion project, a love letter to monster flicks of the past. And for that, it’s one of my favorites of the year. And oh yeah, that chair throw is peak 2021 cinema.  Lin-Manuel Miranda has had one hell of a year. From the adaptation of his musical In The Heights, to his songwriting for Disney’s Encanto, there is no arguing that Miranda has been at the top of his game. And all this is a prelude for tick, tick… BOOM, a musical created by John Larson nearly 30 years ago, and brought to life by a bombshell performance from Andrew Garfield. For a film with BOOM! in its title, tick, tick… BOOM is defined by its smaller moments. While other musicals from the year have been defined by the larger-than-life choreography, Manuel’s subdued direction is kept close and intimate. Some of the greatest songs are sung by a small ensemble on a stage. But this tiny nature is the magic of tick, tick… BOOM. It’s a film that puts you in Larson’s shoes, his small apartment on the east side, and lets you live with the anxiety and pressure that comes with being a writer. It’s a film about pushing past your own seven levels of hell to create something great, time and time again. And thanks to Garfield’s eccentric performance, tick, tick… BOOM is a film worth remembering. It may feel like doomsday, but that’s when you need to soldier on. It’s on Netflix and is worth a watch.  This year I got to watch a lot of the blockbusters that came out, and this swan song for Daniel Craig’s Bond was my favorite of the traditional bunch. It does what no other Bond film ever has, or could: it forces Bond to grow up and mature. I’ve loved each of the Craig era films; Casino Royale and Skyfall, especially. But both films, in retrospect, leave Bond with a lot of emotional baggage that’s never been dealt with… until now. No Time To Die may have a near 3-hour runtime, but it’s paced expertly, and lets the emotional stakes take charge, so I didn’t feel that runtime at all. Add in a stellar performance from Daniel Craig, gorgeous cinematography from Director of Photography Linus Sandgren, and great direction from Cory Joji Fukunaga, and it’s one of the year’s best and an all-time Bond film. I briefly mentioned Lin-Manuel Miranda’s songwriting for Encanto when discussing tick, tick… BOOM, and for good reason: it slaps. From catchy tunes like “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” to the power ballad that is “What Else Can I Do?”, Miranda’s songwriting is on fire with Encanto. This is further elevated by the flawless work of the animators. Each character is personified through wonderful design and great vocal performances. To cap it all off, the story by Jared Bush, Bryon Howard, and Charise Castro Smith focuses on empathy perfectly. It’s on Disney+ and is a wonderful watch for the whole family. Since the “White Rabbit” trailer dropped for The Matrix Resurrections, I knew we were in for a treat. Lana Wachowski made a film that grapples with loss, abandonment, artistic intent, and more for a legacy sequel that never needed to exist. The Matrix had its trilogy, its story was told, and yet, Resurrections doesn’t feel like a tacked-on cash grab. As I put in my letterboxd review, it’s a legacy-quel with something to say. It’s impossible to separate Resurrections from the world it is born into; a world where the red pill has become synonymous with the alt-right, where studios are willing to leave storytellers behind to build a franchise, and where friends and family have been taken away in the most painful of ways. The magic of Resurrections is that it uses its place in franchise filmmaking to critique, grapple, and re-establish why stories matter. It’s not primarily an action film; it’s a love story about having your stories appropriated by others. And it may be a bit exposition-heavy, but I love how much passion went into this film. The return of Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss is fantastic, and the new additions to the cast are on fire. I especially love the costuming in the film. This isn’t a standard legacy-quel, and it’s all the better because of that.  Yeah, big shocker here. The guy who loves space science fiction has Dune in his top ten of the year. But let me take a stab at this from another angle: Dune; like every work on this list, feels like a work of art born of love and passion. Listening to Denis Villeneuve talk about Dune is mesmerizing. And watching this three-hour, incomplete space movie about a bunch of different houses fighting over space drugs shouldn’t work. And yet, it’s a world that I become entranced by. Maybe that’s just the power of Hans Zimmer, whose work here is a career-high. Or perhaps it’s the work of every cast member bringing House Atreides to life. But I believe it to be the work of a visionary director, coordinating it all together to make this massive, political space movie come to life. The ships are more than huge, the battles are explosive and quick, and attempts of survival seem futile. But it’s through those fighting efforts of Paul (Timothee Chalamet) that we are brought into this conflict. Every piece of this film feels meticulously crafted for the theater experience. From the booming score that bombards our hearing to the massive cinematography that fills our eyes, Dune is a true masterpiece. I can’t wait to see how this duology ends, and if Denis Villeneuve sticks the landing, this may be the best science fiction movie of all time.  If Dune is all about being HUGE, then CODA is the exact opposite: small. CODA, directed by Sian Heder, tells the story of Rubi Rossi, the only hearing member of her family, a girl in her senior year of school torn between being with her family and following her dreams of becoming a singer. Much like Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, CODA is a story that resonates with me as I find myself in a similar stage of life to Rubi and Christine. But it’s not just the story that is really good in CODA. It’s got some of the best performances of the year, with Troy Kotsurand Emilia Jones standing out. Its sound design and editing are superb, creating empathy for the deaf community through simple and effective sound design. With one of the most clever scripts of the year, CODA made me feel a lot of feelings, so it’s my third favorite film of the year. It’s exclusively on Apple TV+, so catch it there.  For the longest time, this film held my number one spot for the year. It’s got a near-limitless depth, with each viewing providing something new. Considering it’s an adaptation of a poem from the fourteenth century, I think that’s an impressive feat. The film is a road movie, split into chapters, focusing on the adventure of Sir Gawain, a knight only inname. Through his journey to the Green Chapel, Lowery grapples with ideas of honor, purpose, and achievement. I made an entire post on why this film deserves ALL THE OSCARS so check that out for an in-depth look at this modern masterpiece from David Lowery (here). If you haven’t watched The Green Knight, go do it. It’s got one of the best 4K releases of the year, which enhances the gorgeous cinematography, the rich sound design, and the ethereal score that permeates the film.  The Michell’s vs. The Machines is the passion project from the artists at Sony Animation that stole the top spot from The Green Knight one week ago. The Mitchell’s vs. The Machines is an emotional rollercoaster for the whole family, telling the story of Katie Mitchell, an aspiring filmmaker whose relationship with her dad is stuck in production hell. When the family road trip to drop Katie off at film school is interrupted by the apocalypse, the Mitchells will have to come together to save the world. There is a lot to love about this film, thanks to the efforts of director Michael Rianda and producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Every element of this film feels made to create emotion. From the animation style to the hilarious fourth-wall-breaking gags, it’s a movie that feels made for me. Each character is relatable in their own ways. And like Lady Bird and CODA, it’s another film focusing on parent-child relationships when the child grows up. So yeah, it’s my Kryptonite. It’s on Netflix now, and I heavily recommend this pop-art-infused adventure to everyone in the family."
"Nov 28, 2022",negative," Two of this year’s high-profile Venice premieres, Dune and The Card Counter, are auteurist works recognizable by multiple of their makers’ signatures. Both star Oscar Isaac and arrive as pandemic-affected productions that (try to) bear no trace of that circumstance. Dune finished principal photography before COVID-19’s global spread, while The Card Counter was 3/4 of the way through production when it hit; Isaac completed its rescheduled remainder before flying to Hungary for Dune reshoots. Optimistically subtitled Part I (this covers the first of the novel’s three volumes)*, Dune arrives with the unplanned burden of attempting to make the case for the Big Screen Experience—Denis Villeneuve’s been very publicly unhappy with the pandemic initiative of a simultaneous theatrical/HBO release. The film’s first act, however, is regrettably anti-persuasive on the theatrical viewing front: widescreen, shallow-focus close-ups of people talking through expository set-up. Frank Herbert’s source novel has infamously defeated previous adaptation attempts thanks to the challenges of compressing a mythology that’s surprisingly complicated given how simple it is on a fundamental level—two families warring for control over the same territory, whose indigenous inhabitants resist both. The draw is spectacle, yet it takes a long, dull time to get there. Timothée Chalamet is Paul Atraiades, next in line to maintain his family’s colonialist practices by harvesting “spice” from planet Arrakis and reluctant to assume the enterprise. Chalamet occasionally shows off plausible swordfighting skills during the first 40 minutes—prone to joyously, seemingly unselfconsciously gamboling and weaving through most roles, here the admirably physical actor channels all that energy into this one action movie direction. Otherwise, he’s as weighed down by humorlessly functional dialogue as the rest of the cast, easier to identify by archetypal role than their sometimes complicated names. Mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is loving but fearful for Paul amidst palace intrigues, father Leto (Isaac) similarly caring but politically reactionary; weapons trainer Gurney (Josh Brolin) is seemingly hostile but deeply loyal, his counterpart Duncan (Jason Momoa) a emotional-puppy-dog alternative. Leading the bad guys are Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, trapped inside what appears to be a Col. Kurtz latex fatsuit and bald cap) and warrior Globbu (an uncharacteristically uncharismatic Dave Bautista, whose performance tops out the growls-per-minute ratio). As part of his research, it’s known that Herbert read T.E. Lawrence’s The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, echoed in Paul’s journey from ambivalent would-be representative to full-on desert rat walking off with Arrakis’s resistance. Whether Herbert saw Lawrence of Arabia isn’t known, but it’s impossible not to think of it, since Villeneuve’s Dune unfolds against identical-looking landscapes also shot in Jordan. Yet for all the sand and desert architecture, Dune under-delivers on both sheer scale and action. Momoa and Bautista are both fine fighters who get relatively little chance to kick ass, the rest of the cast is on dialogue duty and most setpieces are of the “CG ships crash through CG haze into CG sands” variety. Even I, a Dune novice, knew enough to expect that something called a “sandworm” would show up eventually and look cool; the dialogue promises its arrival throughout, like a teaser for the end of the movie you’re already watching—and it is in fact pretty neat when it shows up, but too little too late. DP Roger Deakins was originally attached to this but split before production for unspecified reasons. His three previous collaborations with Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049) looked more like each other than they did the director’s work with other cinematographers, and I liked them more than any of Villeneuve’s other films accordingly. Here, working for the first time with Greig Fraser, Villeneuve suggests that—questions of color, grading, grain et al. aside—he does now have a consistent visual playbook all his own, which doesn’t turn out to be a good thing. There are ominously controlled overhead helicopter desert shots like Sicario, giganticicist and darkly colored interior sets out of 2049 and gauzy handheld dream vision shots of a woman staring out on an empty landscape around magic hour a la Amy Adams in Arrival. These go-to approaches are scattered between the more generic dialogue and action, and it makes the current limitations of Villeneuve’s visual imagination perceptible. The biggest problem, though, is Hans Zimmer, whose score is incredibly loud and unremittingly the dominant sound for more of the movie’s 155 minutes than not. Zimmer’s approach to musical cultural appropriation has been blithe since at least 1994’s The Lion King, while his subsequent rise to Coachella fame has accelerated improbably. Both worlds collide in Dune’s score, a nightmare barrage of field-filling drums punctuated by the odd muezzin-ish call to prayer—given how fraught the material already is (brown-skinned desert peoples vs. The Man), the Orientalist tinting is poorly thought through. Every time I went to the multiplex in summer 2016, I’d walk past an auditorium booming the thunderous punching-sounds foleys and Zimmer’s score from Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and it never failed to make my life a little more unpleasant. Five years later, the most cogent thought I emerged from Dune with was, “Hans Zimmer must be stopped.” I can’t improve on the coinage Paul Schrader came up with decades ago to describe his signature works as “man in a room” movies. As he recently reiterated to the Los Angeles Times’s Mark Olsen, “they usually involve a man alone in a room, wearing a mask, and the mask is his occupation. So it could be a taxi driver, a drug dealer, a gigolo, a reverend, whatever. And I take that character and run it alongside a larger problem, personal or social. [… In The Card Counter] the mask he wears is a professional poker player. And the problem that runs alongside him is that he is a former torturer for the U.S. government. So it’s a mix of the World Series of Poker and Abu Ghraib”—a fully accurate synopsis, to which I have little to add. The Card Counter is fully a “late auteur” effort, where economy of means and distillation of thematic intent routinely crosses the line into dramatic lassitude, down to perceptibly/charmingly slow driving shots (anyone that slow during interstate travel would get rear-ended in no time). Isaac is the aforementioned Abu Ghraib torturer, pseudonymous William Tell, who now bounces from casino to casino grinding out acceptably small winnings. At night, like the protagonist of an underbudgeted Jean-Pierre Melville movie, Tell retreats to anonymous nearby motels; when he enters, he takes down not the mirrors (which Melville characters stare into before going to meet death) but the framed wall art. Then he sits and journals his thoughts, which are peak Schrader (“Is there a limit to how much it takes to reach expiation?”). Card Counter’s main problem is the absolute lack of chemistry between Tell, his financial-sponsor-turned-love interest La Linda (Tiffany Haddish) and Cirk (Tye Sheridan), the more innocuously/platonically charged Jodie Foster to Isaac’s De Niro. (“With a K,” Cirk keeps saying—not until the credits did I know at which end the unorthodox letter went). The latter’s father was a soldier alongside Tell who came home, abused his family and committed suicide. Cirk wants homicidal revenge against Major John Gordo (Willem Dafoe), the private contractor who trained both Tell and Cirk’s dad; Tell, who alternates between laconic moodiness and awkward lunges into near-banter, wants to save Cirk from the probable consequences of his vengeful instincts. Even when all three leads are seated at the same table, they seem to be talking past each other on the world’s most awkward speed date for a surrogate family unit, with the would-be parents making ostensibly fond references to “the kid.” In American Gigolo, Light Sleeper and First Reformed, redemption gets conflated with sex in the single figure of a romantic interest; saddled with the latest iteration of this unenviable function, Haddish is unprepared to make the leap to her “comic performer shows off dramatic chops” role. But both the hits and misses in Card Counter are irrelevant to its central charm, which is comparing/contrasting how it varies the tropes of Schrader’s self-created genre. Gigolo harvested “Call Me” for two hours of instrumental variations in Giorgio Moroder’s score, while Light Sleeper assigned Greek chorus function of sorts to Michael Been’s value-neutral, lyrically on-the-head songs. Similarly scored, Card Counter hands these duties over to Been’s son—Robert Levon Been (of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club), co-writing with Giancarlo Vulcano—and the results are truly dismal, aspirant imitation late period Talk Talk crossbred with one of Eddie Vedder’s gloomier days. (I can’t tell if one lyric, repeated over and over, goes “In my lonely admiration” or “In my lonely abnegation”—either would fit.) Like Dafoe writing with a bottle of wine in Light Sleeper and Pepto Bismal-fueled Ethan Hawke in First Reformed, Isaac keeps his very own diary of a country priest alongside a bottle of whisky, recording angst in voiceover that reads out the handwritten text. Dafoe’s handwriting was loopy but sloppily legible cursive, Hawke’s enviably neat longhand; Isaac demonstrates freakishly legible, disciplined and consistent cursive. Teaching cursive has been, by and large, phased out, so this is a record of a dying art, as is the film itself—20 years from now, no one will be making movies like this. Most perverse and moving, though, is Schrader’s third riff on the ending of Bresson’s Pickpocket, where protagonist Michel meets his love Jeanne in prison. She rests her hand against the wire separating them, he puts his head up and announces “What a long, strange path I’ve taken to find you.” American Gigolo first repurposed this as a final prison reunion between Richard Gere (points at screen: “That’s the American gigolo”) and Lauren Hutton, speaking on phones separated by a transparent pane. “My God, Michelle, it’s taken me so long to come to you,” Gere says and rests his head against the divider as the camera tracks in from her side, arriving at an angle where it almost looks as if she’s transcended the barrier to touch him—a striking effect, held briefly before a cut to black and credits. In Light Sleeper, Dafoe’s not in jail proper but a detention center awaiting sentencing; Susan Sarandon comes to visit and reaches out to hold his hand across the elbow-height token wooden barrier separating them. This time the shot’s held for the first half of the end credits, a solid minute-plus during which the strain of holding the position on both their arms is perceptible. Card Counter takes this final gesture much further, with a reunion now stripped entirely of dialogue and a final shot of just Isaac and Haddish’s fingers reaching out, a glass pane separating them in the frame’s middle. This time, Schrader has his performers hold their position for the entire end credits, during which both performers adjust their fingers and drop their wrists as the shot rolls. This metaphysical reconciliation is now fully rendered as a feat of mild physical endurance, a devotional gesture both odd and touching for the reverence it shows this ending and its faith in its enduring power, no matter how many times distilled and refracted. * Full disclosure: I try to read the source novels of films I write about, time permitting, but there was zero chance I was going to ingest the 700ish pages of Dune. I did try to read it as a pre-teen, when I made the dumb mistake of trying to read the 50+-page appendix first and was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of made-up proper nouns. Wikipedia, of course, is no substitute for direct knowledge, but this entry’s credibly thorough and I’m reasonably sure none of what I’m about to say is completely off-base.↩"
"Nov 23, 2022",positive," A film is, at its core, a piece of entertainment. While cinema is also a fascinating and diverse macrocosm of art, films like Dune make the case that intermingling approaches to the medium aren’t always possible. The novel and the film are about a noble house that is given control over the desert planet of Arrakis. There, a mysterious substance, explained more adequately in the novel, is mixed in with the sand. The spice has a psychoactive property that enables the consumer to become hyper-aware, which helps to navigate ships through the vast and dangerousness of outer space. The cast is superb. Oscar Isaac is the patriarch, Rebecca Ferguson his wife, and Timothée Chalamet is his son; Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Change Chen, and Stephen McKinley Henderson play military and civic advisors to the house. Stellan Skarsgård leads a rival house with his own raft of servants including Dave Bautista and David Dastmalchian. Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Babs Olusanmokun, and Golda Rosheuvel play Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants, the former three of which have little narrative relevance and don’t make their first appearances until late in the film. And rounding out the cast are Sharon Duncan-Brewster as an imperial ecologist and Charlotte Rampling as the head of Ferguson’s Bene Gesserit religious order. Science fiction is a way to look at the current political landscape far removed from the actual events and shine a bright spotlight on problematic behaviors. Frank Herbert’s Dune is a perfect example of this and in many ways so much more than this. The novel looks at falling republics, ecological malfeasance in the pursuit of oil (in the case of the novel, spice), and religion and how seamlessly it can be integrated into a society. The difference between a novel and a movie is built on how you can actually review the material and reflect on it. With literature, you can stop and look up relevant terms, learn peripheral information, and absorb what you’ve read. With a film, all of that introspection must be done after the fact and you are required to be entirely present in the movie and be able to make notes of any unusual situations or ideas that you need to look into later. For a casual moviegoer, a lot of that information is missed and left merely as confusion. Director Denis Villeneuve tries to convey that as simply as possible and he does an admirable job with it, but without the core foundation of the written work, some of the minutia and subtlety is sometimes missed. Dune is a film that is largely faithful to the source material and like The Lord of the Rings, which defined how a fantasy novel could be adapted, it leaves out some of those details to streamline the film. Being a film based only on the first half of the Dune novel, there’s perhaps more to be learned from the eventual sequel than could be assessed ahead of time and the movie provides plenty to chew on in the interim. The break feels natural and the events to come will be rather interesting to see, but it also feels incomplete, mostly because a lot of the religious commentary and mysticism isn’t given its proper due. In addition, some of the political machinations of collapsing empires is present and some is absent. That too needs fleshing out in the subsequent film. Solid performances and some gorgeous visuals help absorb the audience into the narrative in ways that would otherwise be challenging. Villeneuve does well at avoiding over-explanation of the plot and conveys much of what makes the source material involving. However, in the end, Dune is a movie that needed more entry-level information than could easily be experienced in the relative brevity of the motion picture form."
"Nov 12, 2022",positive," A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. Frank Herbert’s source novel is so grand in scale and dense in detail (it even has appendices detailing events and terminology), that reading it or watching the film requires a PhD in science fiction, let alone adapting it to the big screen. (NB: if you are looking for a handy primer to the saga, read this Dunesplaining article from Empire). So it is quite the flex for director Denis Villeneuve to helm Blade Runner 2049, one of the greatest sequels of all-time but an initial box office failure like its predecessor, and then double down on making a new version of Dune. Not only that but agreeing to film the first half of the story on the proviso that Part 2 would only be made if it is a success. It is understandable why people would be nervous about his prospects. Alexander Jodorwsky’s failed attempt in the 70s is now the subject of a documentary. There was also David Lynch’s 1984 critical and commercial failure. Somewhat harshly in retrospect despite Lynch himself calling it “a huge, gigantic sadness in my life.” One of the main issues with Lynch’s version, was the over-reliance on voiceover to try and explain the plot. Also, despite its 137 minute runtime, once House Atreides falls on Arrakis, the film feels incredibly rushed. Bouncing from one major plot point to the next until an emotionally unsatisfying climax. There is no such issue here. In fact, the exact opposite. As evidenced by 2049, a film in which one could have spent hours immersing themselves in, Villeneuve is an absolute master at world-building. Part One takes its time to introduce each new character, faction and world in immense detail. Helping to create a deep connection and emotional investment that will continue in the next film. Lynch’s Dune was unfavourably compared to Star Wars. True, both stories follow the adventures of one family in an intergalactic war for power however this new version only really looks to that galaxy far, far away for inspiration in design. Like the original Lucas trilogy, opting to build gigantic sets and film on location to generate a grounded sense of reality within the fantasy. As the winds blow spice and sand around the characters here, one feels they are right there with them on Arrakis.  Anakin Skywalker may have said “I don’t like sand. It’s coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.”  However there was clearly no Melange on Tatooine as if there were, he might have enjoyed it a bit more. For you don’t even need to physically ingest it in the cinema screen to know you are seeing something truly special. Paul Atreides may have a destiny similar to the Skywalkers yet so does the actor playing him. Timothee Chalamet has been the internet’s and Film Twitter’s chosen one ever since Call Me By Your Name. There was symbolic passing of the torch from Pattinson to Chalamet in The King. In a way, Pattinson going “you can deal with all the fangirling and memes for a while, I’m off to do more A24 movies”. Having provided supporting turns for the likes of Gerwig and Wes Anderson, here he fulfills his potential as a leading man. Proving himself worthy and capable to lead a major franchise of his own.  Like Luke in A New Hope, he starts from a place of tempestuousness, trepidation and fear. Fear is the mind killer after all. Yet by the end of Part One, he has taken his first steps into a larger world. He grows in confidence, strength and physicality as he progresses. Going from boy to man before our eyes whilst hinting at even greater things ahead. Chalamet is helped no end by having a Fantasy Film ensemble to spark and bounce off of. Some make strong but fleeting impressions, knowing they will return down the line, such as Brolin, Bautista and Skarsgaard. Of the rest, there is no weak link with Jason Momoa injecting some swagger as Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac & Rebecca Ferguson shining the brightest as Paul’s parents. To be honest, there are no weak links to be found anywhere. No tears in the stillsuits as it were. Hans Zimmer’s industrial score (bagpipes?! Who knew?) and Greig Fraser’s cinematography are simply out of this world. So people of the world, spice up your life and see Dune. Don’t worry about seeing it on “the biggest screen possible” as some critics would tell you. Just see it. So Villeneuve can conduct the final part of this truly epic space opera."
"Oct 11, 2022",positive," As a self-proclaimed Denis Villeneuve superfan, and for that matter, a Dune novice, I found his tenth directed feature film to be a tad too long, despite its epic scope, jaw-dropping action sequences, and visually stunning images. The adaptation of what many consider the most significant science-fiction novel of all time could not have been easy. There are piles of exposition that need to be explained for anyone new to the series. For those, the first act can tend to be confusing. Some will even find it convoluted, but it is understandable considering the source material’s density. Of course, the film opens with the title sequence, Dune: Part One. So, the insight I’m offering is hardly mind-blowing. This first installment aligns with The Lord of the Rings –– a necessary step to something better, even great.  By all accounts, Villeneuve’s Dune uses about half of the first book. (Even with numerous installments in the series, the director said he only plans on doing two films to tell Herbert’s story). Dune takes place in, you know, the future. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is given the job of governing the planet of Arrakis by the emperor. A desert planet enriched in “spice” (referred to in the book as “melange”), the richest material in the universe. Spice has the power to extend life, enhance levels of thought, and allow travel to move faster than the speed of light— this world’s B-12 shot. Even though Leto knows of the dangers and likely retribution of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) of the House of Harkonnen, he will do anything to get the planet back. This enrages his psychotic nephew, Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista). Though the Baron seems to have a plan that he hasn’t told his followers yet. The Duke brings his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and his son, Paul (Timothée Chalame). He brought along an army and his trusted advisors, including Paul’s mentors, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), and the House of Atreides Mentat, Thufir (Stephen McKinley Henderson). When Leto takes over, he shows a kind heart. He offers equal rights to the Fremen — natives to Arrakis. They live in the desert and are led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). The land is subject to extreme, dry heat. Oh, and those giant sandworms that led everyone to know about the noise ordinance. All of this happens while Paul continues to have dreams of the future. Others doubt him, but Jessica suspects he may be the Fremen’s Messiah. If you thought my synopsis was confusing, the film drops you in the middle of a world that somehow manages to be vague and convoluted at the same time. However, the exposition-filled first act is woven into dialogue that is as natural as one could hope for. That credit should go to the script by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Passengers), and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump). It’s informative while still entertaining, and you never once think of their vision as anything less than cohesive. Though, Dune, like Rings and Star Wars, doesn’t have a breakout character that represents a sense of comic relief. Momoa’s Idaho has the most fun in his role, but the film desperately needs more of this. Despite my slight criticism over the length and its story that can lean toward the south of sun-baked, Villeneuve’s film is well-crafted and has a maturity that we haven’t seen in an epic since The Lord of the Rings. It’s a heck of a ride. When all hell breaks loose, the invasion scenes that you see in the trailer are spectacular. I’ve never been one to set a moral high ground on how films should be watched, particularly with the rising costs of a theatrical experience and not to mention the current pandemic. Still, Dune demands to be seen on the big screen. The production value exceeds expectations, even more than any film I have seen in years. The team that Villeneuve gathered is of the highest caliber. From Tom Brown’s (Saving Private Ryan) art design, Jacqueline West’s (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Bob Morgan’s (Inception) costume design, Greig Frasier’s (Rogue One, Zero Dark Thirty) stunning cinematography, and Hans Zimmer’s beautiful, evocative score, it all exceeds expectations. However, the heavy metal bagpipes were an odd choice. Then, the only thing that can exceed that is the cast that Villeneuve has gathered here. The cast is pure perfection. Chalamet holds his own here, and it will be exciting to see his growth going forward in this film series (I still contend the studio will want to take scrap a part two and make it a trilogy). Brolin and Isaac stand out, like Ferguson, as she continues to find the poignancy in any action heroine she takes on. She has wonderful chemistry with Bardem’s Stilgard that points to an exciting storyline going forward. Even if Zendaya is underutilized here, she will have a more prominent role in future installments. Overall, Dune’s exceptional qualities far outweigh its minor criticisms. If anything, the first film feels incomplete, which is understandable considering the massive scope. If part two is the final chapter, perhaps both will make one five-hour film feel like a complete experience instead of one step to the bigger picture. Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website. Since a young age, Marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous “Rotten Tomato” approved status – in 2023, he achieved that status."

I'm beginning to think that one of the unexpected side-effects of 18 months of COVID is the ballooning out of film running times. It might be posited that filmmakers, knowing they didn't have to rush films out until audiences were back in cinemas, took their time, killing hundreds of hours micromanaging their editorial team and making the most of every frame filmed. Dune, Denis Villeneuve's stunning imagining of the Frank Herbert novel, comes in at two and a half hours long. And Villeneuve's film only gets itself halfway through the novel. This is a ""Part One"", with the second half yet to be filmed and due for release in October 2023.  Fans will want to know how this stands against David Lynch's also-brilliant camp 80s version. The answer is, they are both glorious, and they are completely different.  Villeneuve has a strong aesthetic to impart that references Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, Geiger designs and Lawrence of Arabia, amongst other iconic visual references.  From Herbert's cult 1965 novel, Villeneuve works with co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth on a deliberately paced screenplay as true to the novel as is possible without being 15 hours long.  On a distant set of planets, a decades-long battle of political power and intrigue has been playing out. On the sandy desert planet of Arrakis, the Harkonnen clan has controlled power and, most importantly, the mining rights to the planet's lucrative spice.  Arriving on Arrakis is head of the Arteries family, Duke Leo (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Jessica might be a royal wife, but she is also a sister in a powerful sorceress-like religion, the Bene Gesserit, and it seems her son with the Duke, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) may have inherited some of her powers.  The people of Arakis have a myth of a foreign hero who will come to be their saviour, and signs exist that this person may be Paul Atreides, and the sisters of the Bene Gesserit are keen to bring this myth to reality.  But it is possible that the Emperor's placement of the Atreides onto Arrakis was a deliberate action to undermine or ruin the family, with doom coming at them from all sides, only one being the desert's giant sandworms, and many more sources being the Harkonnen waiting in the wings with massacre on their minds.  When Paul and his mother are marooned in the Arrakis desert, his growing powers may be able to save them, or perhaps their saviour might be the indigenous Arrakis girl Chani (Zendaya) who has been haunting his dreams.  The star power in this production is dazzling. Charlotte Rampling is terrifying as the mother of the religious sect, Stellan Skarsgard barely recognisable as the corpulent murderous Baron Harkonnen, a shaved Jason Momoa is just as handsome out of his Aquaman garb as the Artreides family bouncer Duncan Idaho.  Performances are equally strong, but the star power of this film is the production design. Particularly delightful are the imaginative engineering of the film's ships and other tools, beginning with imaginative tri-winged dragonfly-inspired aircraft, or the film's training weaponry that coat their wearer in Minecraft-like techno blocks.  The production team play with political symbolism, not just from Leni Riefenstahl's playbook. It's not just the film's characters that are imbedded with fascist ideology. Herbert wrote his novel in the post WWII ear, but Villeneuve hints at more contemporary inspirations.  Villeneuve's world-building is epic. Visually epic, but also part of his approach to the screenplay's slow deliberate pace to pull out the novels more important scenes and storylines. Paul only meets Zendaya's Chani at the film's end, and we can imagine the second film, when it comes, will enjoy a swifter pace, now the world-building is out of the way. "
"Aug 16, 2022",positive," It’s hard not to be excited for a Denis Villeneuve movie. The French Canadian director, screenwriter, and producer has such a compelling filmography. I was introduced to Villeneuve via his 2010 Oscar nominated drama “Incendies”. But it’s his terrific run since then that has turned me into a bonafide fan. I enjoyed both “Prisoners” and “Enemy”. His 2015 border thriller “Sicario” may be my favorite film of his to date. “Arrival” was my #1 movie of 2016 while 2017’s “Blade Runner 2049” was a gutsy and heady sequel to a 1982 sci-fi classic. It almost feels like a natural progression for Villeneuve’s next film to be his biggest and most audacious project to date. “Dune” is certainly that. This massive sprawling science-fiction epic is the first film in a two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 cult novel of the same name. Packing a hefty budget and a star-studded cast, “Dune” is a herculean undertaking brimming with ambition and made with the unquenchable passion of a filmmaker who has called this his “longstanding dream“. There are a number of ways that a project of this size and scope could have gone awry. But Villenueve is a savvy filmmaker with a dedicated vision. I’ve seen “Dune” multiple times now, and I can honestly say that I’m struggling to find a single bad filmmaking decision anywhere in his movie. Bold statement, I know. Without question, it was the right choice to break this up into two movies. This film literally starts with the “Part One” tag and ends around the halfway mark of the “Dune” story. As mentioned above, this benefits the film greatly because it allows the right amount of time for us to be immersed into this striking and complex world. And it allows Villeneuve (who co-wrote the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) to acquaint us the many political, ecological, and societal intricacies that help give the story depth. Set in the very distant future of 10191, “Dune” tells the story of young Paul (Timothée Chalamet), the gifted son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), the leader of the powerful House Atreides. They live and rule on the planet Caladan where Paul, next in line to lead, is trained in combat by close friend and House Atreides warrior Duncan (Jason Momoa) and Leto’s top aide Gurney (Josh Brolin). His mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), an acolyte of a mysterious sisterhood called the Bene Gesserit, teaches him the secrets of a mysterious inner power he possesses, a power that’s causing haunting dreams of a troubling future. Meanwhile on the harsh desert planet of Arrakis, the brutal House Harkonnen, ran by the chillingly vile and grotesque Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), have become obscenely rich controlling the planet’s production of a priceless mineral called Spice. The Harkonnens callously harvest the coveted natural resource, avoiding massive sandworms and persecuting the resilient indigenous clan known as the Fremen. Their leader is Stilgar (a solemn and reticent Javier Bardem) and also among their ranks is Chani (Zendaya), a young woman who has been appearing in Paul’s dreams. After an imperial decree orders the Harkonnen off of Arrakis, the emperor grants stewardship of the planet to House Atreides. Suspicious of the mandate but loyal to the call, Leto accepts with hopes of forming an alliance with the native Fremen. That proves to be easier said than done. After 80 years of oppression, the Fremen are leery of any new offworlders. And can the Harkonnens be trusted to leave behind all the wealth and power found in the sands of Arrakis?  Ultimately the film very much belongs to Paul, a young man trying to find himself while being pulled in every direction. As Leto’s heir, everyone expects him to be next in line to lead House Atreides. Jessica’s sect (led by a wonderfully creepy Charlotte Rampling) hopes Paul is “the one” which they intend to use for their own cryptic purposes. And the Fremen, having heard of this messiah-like deliverer, wonder if Paul might be the fulfillment of that prophecy. As Villeneuve patiently and methodically lays out his story, we’re struck by the surprising amount of narrative depth. Not only is “Dune” thematically rich, it’s filled with connected backstory. But to the screenwriting trio’s credit, they often (and smartly) allude to the lore rather than bury us in it. Yet there are still many layers to their story, and it’s impossible to narrow the film down to one single category. Of course it’s science fiction, but it’s also a coming-of-age story, a war movie, an anti-war movie, a sociopolitical parable. Another testament to the film’s richness. But without question the movie’s biggest strength remains its world building. From the imaginative costumes to the jaw-dropping production design, Villeneuve and his talented team of creators have made a stunningly tactile world and every frame gives us something worthy to consume. Whether it’s the lush overcast Atreides homeworld with its vast waters and craggy coastlines or the stark yet gorgeous oceans of sand on Arrakis that look like golden brown meringue through DP Greig Fraser’s camera. Interestingly, the technology of “Dune” leans more primitive than futuristic which helps the world feel rooted in our reality. There are no fancy LED panels and very little high-tech gadgetry. Even the structures convey this, often resembling old ruins rather than state-of-the-art facilities. The ships are massive and breathtaking spectacles yet designed with a cold austere simplicity. The machinery has a rusty industrial look and even the incredibly cool ornithopters (which resemble giant dragonflies) are a believable evolution of our standard helicopters. To the performances, I admit to being a bit of a Chalamet skeptic. I’ve never thought he was a “bad” actor, just not up to the gushing hype that follows everything he does. Here he earns the praise he’s been getting. Chalamet brings a boyish petulance to Paul in the film’s early scenes, but over time convincingly turns his vulnerability to maturity. Isaac is fittingly stoic. Momoa is full of charisma. Brolin is stern and abrasive. Ferguson deftly manages the emotionally meatiest role. Skarsgård is devilishly menacing. Sharon Duncan-Brewster is mysterious yet exciting. Zendaya does fine with the few scenes she’s given. I honestly didn’t know what to expect from “Dune”. I’ve never read Herbert’s book and I don’t remember a thing about David Lynch’s 1984 film. Perhaps that’s why “Dune” 2021 blew me away. From its opening shot to the final fade, I found myself enraptured and transported. Villeneuve’s captivating direction, Hans Zimmer’s brooding exotic score (one of his very best), the exquisite sound design, the visual feast that screams to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Together it all makes for a smart, evocative, and rousing experience that reminded me at every turn of why I love cinema. And this is just Part One of the story. Honestly, this very well could be my movie of the year.  It’s brilliantly realized and it’s easy to follow, despite the fact that it throws a lot of information and lore at you.  I have to give real credit to Villeneuve and the writers for making it accessible.  I love the 1984 movie, despite its problems, but this blows that version out of the proverbial water.  My biggest gripe with Dune is not with the film itself, but rather the way the movie was handled by Warner Bros.  This is a big-screen movie in every aspect, so putting on HBO Max on the same day as it hits theaters was incredibly stupid.  Looking at the world-wide box office results, my gut feeling is that Part 2 will be greenlit pretty soon, but for a while it looked like that was entirely up in the air.  While I absolutely believe that Part 2 will happen, anything else Dune-related won’t.  At least, not under the current leadership.  Hopefully, when Discovery takes the reigns, they’ll understand Dune’s real potential.  As it stands, Denis Villeneuve’s film is absolutely incredible.  The sense of scale is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before.  And this is done WITHOUT 3D.  5 stars?  Abso-frickin’-lutely. Wow, Keith, what a wonderful review of the movie.  I still haven’t seen it but I read the book and see the movie follows the plot well.  I’m glad he bent towards lo-tech rather than hi-tech, as he did in Blade Runner 2049. Thanks so much. As you can tell, I’m REALLY high on this movie and recommend on the biggest screen possible. It’s a breathtaking experience that genuinely transports you to another world. I loved it! I have just come back from the theatre after watching this film. It is every bit magnificent and your review echoes my thoughts perfectly. A Timothée Chalamet film from the first to the last frame I was reminded of Matrix, ‘He’s the One’ dialogue stirring the pot. Fingers crossed that Part 2 happens quickly. I must have a part 2. If for some insane reason it doesn’t get the green light it’ll be one of the biggest travesties in movie history. But I’m really confident that part 2 will be announced. Oh, there’s no doubt that we’ll be getting a part 2.  Whether it gets greenlit by Warner Bros. in the next couple of weeks or when Discovery takes over in March, a part 2 is most certainly going to happen.  With a movie of THIS scale, you really don’t want to NOT finish the story.  The problem is that we won’t see part 2 for at least 2 years, if they start production soon. I know it! Talk about a painfully long wait! I have heard rumors (and I emphasize “rumors”) that HBO Max was interested in a series from the Dune universe. Who knows, but I would be all for it. It was a stunning movie; even though it wasn’t a 100% faithful representation of Herbert’s book, it was a fan’s dream come true. Being that the book itself was such a complex and grand story, I believe Dir. Denis Villeneuve really encapsulated the book in this first part movie as best as it can be translated into film.  I was left speechless about ’10 minutes into the film as I didn’t realize how quickly I had become sucked into the entire atmosphere that Villeneuve managed to create in the movie. Fantastic, and I’d also give it a 5/5 (originally 4.5/5) as I realize it really does match up fantastically with the book. Safe to say, though, I also agree that Villeneuve’s work usually speaks for itself. So I’ll be incredibly excited for the second part to release as well! I love your perspective (as someone who is a fan of the book). I love that it is winning both fans of the book and those with no connection. That’s a sign of a well-made adaptation. I am also a bit of a Chalamet skeptic, his range here needs to be a bit broader, but that is mostly the writing. Momoa practically steals all the energy of the movie. I am afraid I compared every moment to the 84 Lynch version, sometimes it excels and in other places it fall short. I think the two part decision is the right one as long as they actually do part 2. A great looking film, I’m still not sure it has solved all the puzzles that plagued everyone who has attempted this, but I am very happy it exists. I’m really looking forward to reading this review in full when I see this soon. I have to keep as much of it a secret as I can! But . . . . wow it’s been hard. Make sure you let me know how you feel about it. I was blown away and really impressed with how Denis brought this massive vision to the screen. I saw this yesterday afternoon where I realized why I spent more money on the typical afternoon ticket because I went to a Dolby Atmos screening of the film and… it was worth it.  I’m finishing up my own review of the film right now as… FUCKING GIVE ME PART 2!!!!!! Great review. I definitely agree with you about this movie. It was truly a fantastic and cinematic experience and I felt that Villeneuve was perfect for the feature and did the source material justice. Thanks Jason. I’m so enthusiastic about it. I’ve seen it three times now and have picked up something new each time. Huge fan of it. I’ve read the books and am glad to read in your comments that it sticks pretty close. Looking forward to seeing it at some point. This is on my must see list and will hopefully catch it. I hardly recall the novel . I just couldn’t get into Herbert’s narrative and the story didn’t grip me but I know many who love it and that’s all cool. So I’m looking at this movie from a different perspective , in a way much like you . The main attraction for me was Denis Villeneuve , I’ve truly loved his work , especially in the science fiction field . Both Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival were fantastic , so I was confident he would handle Dune well. Once again an excellent ,thoughtful and comprehensive review . Thanks my friend. Absolutely see this, on the big screen of at all possible. I know “see it on the big screen” is often thrown out there without much thought. But this truly is a testament to the theater experience. Anxious to hear what you think of it. “I just received news from Legendary that we are officially moving forward with Dune: Part Two,” the filmmaker said. “It was a dream of mine to adapt Frank Herbert’s Dune, and I have the fans, the cast, and crew, Legendary and Warner Bros. to thank for supporting this dream. This is only the beginning.” Great review! I’m in the same boat as you, never read the books and I never saw the original film and was totally captivated by this. Bring on part two! Thank you! Love that you loved it. I was excited for it but honestly didn’t expect to be sucked in the way I was. I can’t get it out of my head."

"Jul 11, 2022",positive," ​Hype is the mind-killer. Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s genre-defining science fiction novel has arrived after much anticipation, both optimistic and pessimistic. Before seeing the film, I straddled the line of those two camps. I didn’t enjoy the novel when I read it last year in preparation for its original November 2020 release date. Still, I also value ambition from filmmakers above nearly all other directorial qualities. To my surprise and delight, like a sandworm rising out of the desert landscape, “Dune” snuck up on me until I was firmly and happily in its grips before I even fully realized it. One of the story’s many hallmarks is its elaborate fictional world. The novel’s unabashedly fantastical world-building is faithfully emulated in the film. We follow Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the heir apparent of the powerful House Atreides. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), has trained him in the ways of the mystical group, the Bene Gesserit, and his father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), has made sure that he’s equally prepared for physical combat. The all-powerful Emperor decrees that House Atreides shall take over as rulers of the desert planet Arrakis, home to “spice,” the universe’s most valuable product. As the family moves onto the hostile new world, political complications arise, and Paul must face his destiny head-on – even if it is still a mystery to him. And that is the shortest possible description of “Dune” that I could come up with. There is enough complicated history, power dynamics, extraterrestrial abilities, locations, and other world-building details to fill several file cabinets, let alone a Hollywood script. It is therefore beyond impressive that this adaptation manages to keep the narrative focused and coherent. Like so many science fiction films, seemingly every other line of dialogue involves at least one made-up word. And while many films can confuse the audience with such hastily tossed-off otherworldly descriptors, “Dune” never loses its viewers. It establishes every aspect of its complex world firmly and assuredly. If one weren’t paying complete attention, it would still be possible to get lost in the twisting narrative, but the film is compelling enough to securely hold its viewers. It also, happily, manages to avoid the knowing cynicism that Marvel has made a trend amongst modern blockbusters. Those films tend to undercut their own power to make the audience feel okay about liking decidedly dorky material by cranking up the self-awareness in a way that only comes across as increasingly disingenuous. “Dune” is delightfully imaginary and knows it. This is deep, unyielding science fiction that trusts in its audience’s intelligence and maturity. And yet, even in its self-seriousness, it’s never dour or too heavy. It strikes the perfect tone between dense and entertaining. It throws a lot at its viewers, but it rewards patience and attentiveness with its well-structured screenplay. But even if you just took the film in as a visual experience, you’d still be impressed. The beautiful and varied costumes do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making characters, tribes, and clans distinguishable. The soldiers’ armor looks resourceful yet stylish, and many of the more decorative outfits are pleasingly ornate. Just to highlight one costume as an example, Charlotte Rampling’s Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother looks like a glamorous chess piece in mourning. I can’t undersell how satisfying it is to repeatedly watch long, flowing garments whip around in the desert wind. The production design uses an intelligent mix of real-world locations and CGI environments, rather than just relying on green and blue screens to transport the characters to alien worlds. In this sense, it recalls the look and feels of fantasy worlds that have aged the best, like those in the “Lord of the Rings” series and “Game of Thrones.” And the visual effects overall are both well rendered and impressively composited, which is essential in selling such a vast fictional world. They’re particularly adept at portraying the different scales of imaginary objects and creatures, both big and small. The cast list is also so impressive. It is hard to imagine that any potential casting choices came before those with which they landed. Nobody misses. Chalamet is an assured lead – he’s headstrong in a way that’s true to his boyish character while never coming across as arrogant or annoying. Ferguson was my personal favorite of all the performances, acting as a constant source of assurance and stability for both her fictional son and the real-life audience. Rampling is pure terror incarnate in her minimal screen time – I wish we saw more of her captivating work. And Jason Momoa is a delight as one of Paul’s combat mentors. He brings a welcome light energy to the film while never distracting or undermining the tone. “Dune” effectively won me over and brought clarity to a story I previously only found confounding. Villeneuve adds his usual brains and soul to yet another epic blockbuster property and, once again, he’s secured victory. But it is we, the audience, who gets to reap the rewards of his hard work."
"Jul 8, 2022",positive," A spice-war space opera about feuding houses on far-flung planets, Dune has long been a pop-culture building block. Before Frank Herbert's 1965 novel was adapted into a wrongly reviled David Lynch-directed film — a gloriously 80s epic led by Kyle MacLachlan and laced with surreal touches — it unmistakably inspired Star Wars, and also cast a shadow over Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Game of Thrones has since taken cues from it. The Riddick franchise owes it a debt, too. The list goes on and, thanks to the new version bringing its sandy deserts to cinemas, will only keep growing. As he did with Blade Runner 2049, writer/director Denis Villeneuve has once again grasped something already enormously influential, peered at it with astute eyes and built it anew — and created an instant sci-fi classic. This time, Villeneuve isn't asking viewers to ponder whether androids dream of electric sheep, but if humanity can ever overcome one of our worst urges and all that it brings. Dune tells of birthrights, prophesied messiahs, secret sisterhood sects that underpin the galaxy and phallic-looking giant sandworms, and of the primal lust for power that's as old as time — and, in Herbert's story, echoes well into the future's future. Blade Runner 2049 ruminated upon a similar idea in its own way, as many movies do. Indeed, Ridley Scott was hired to helm Dune before Lynch, then made the original Blade Runner instead, so Villeneuve is following him again here. Dune's unpacking of dominance and command piles on colonial oppression, authoritarianism, greed, ecological calamity and religious fervour, though, like it's building a sandcastle out of power's nastiest ramifications. And, amid that weightiness, it's also a tale of a moody teen with mind-control abilities struggling with what's expected versus what's right. That young man is Paul Atreides, as played by Timothée Chalamet in a stroke of genius casting that seems almost fated — as if returning Dune to the big screen had to wait for the Call Me By Your Name star. (The book also earned the TV miniseries treatment in 2000, and we should be thankful that a 90s iteration soundtracked by the Spice Girls' 'Spice Up Your Life' didn't ever eventuate.) When the narrative begins in Villeneuve and co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth's (A Star Is Born) retelling, Paul's life has been upended. House Atreides, led by his father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, Scenes From a Marriage), must leave its watery home planet of Caladan to take over the desert world of Arrakis. Previously run by their enemies in House Harkonnen, it's the source of the universe's melange stores, with the spice making interstellar travel possible. Spice also expands consciousness and extends lives — and, while forced by imperial decree, the monstrous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, Chernobyl) isn't happy about handing Arrakis over. To say House Atreides' move doesn't go smoothly is like saying that its new home is a tad toasty, but the tricky transition is just one of Dune's concerns. Another: the plans for Paul. House Atreides' heir, he's being trained as such by the Duke, security expert Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson, Devs), swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, Aquaman) and weaponry whiz Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, Avengers: Endgame). But Paul's mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Reminiscence) hails from the Bene Gesserit, an all-female group who pull the galaxy's strings, and she sees him as its fabled chosen one. On the page, Dune sports an abundance of plot, of which this film only relays half; its title card dubs it Dune: Part One, a move only backed up post-US release when Dune: Part Two was greenlit. This opening chapter is never overladen, however, even if the Fremen — Arrakis' blue-eyed Indigenous peoples, including tribal leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem, Everybody Knows) and the defiant Chani (Zendaya, Malcolm & Marie) — are clearly poised to enjoy a larger part in the sequel. Savvily, one of Villeneuve's big choices is to let Chani's narration introduce the movie. It immediately helps to side the feature with the oppressed, rather than merely embracing several layers of power from the get-go. It also signals a concerted effort to ensure this isn't primarily a story of men. It whets the appetite for more, too, including from Zendaya — who doesn't get much screentime, but still leaves an imprint that'd stick even in sand. Treading not only in Lynch's footsteps, but in Chilean French director Alejandro Jodorowsky's — whose aborted 70s stab at Dune is chronicled in stellar documentary Jodorowsky's Dune — is a mammoth task. Big-budget slams and failed visionary attempts tend to stick in filmic memory. Plus, Lynch's movie featured a heap of other future Twin Peaks stars, and Sting, and a score by Toto (no one blessed the rains, though). Meanwhile, Jodorowsky had Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali and Orson Welles, with Pink Floyd on soundtrack duties. To match, Villeneuve boasts a magnificent cast, all doing their utmost, while Hans Zimmer's throbbing notes set an intense and ominous mood as expertly as his immensely dissimilar work on No Time to Die also did. But what gleams brightest in this take on the tale is its breathtaking visuals, meticulous plotting, a pace that gives the narrative space to breathe and an alluring sense of mystery, as well as the ability to prove simultaneously vast and intimate. When Dune's desert landscapes linger as far as the eye can see, they shimmer with heat, texture and possibility. When the film lurks in palaces bubbling with political scheming, it hews slick, muted and brutal. As lensed by Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Lion), these are shrewd choices — pitting the expansive, grainy yet inviting against the confined, sleek and savage — in a movie that knows how to make every image both count and feel visceral. Awe-inspiring to behold, and operatic, Dune turns a literary giant into a cinematic one. It broods brilliantly, dreams vividly and muses sharply, as Villeneuve's work (see also: Arrival and Enemy) does at his best. It stages tremendously engaging action sequences, too, as Sicario also did. The one drawback: as grand and majestic as it is, and as much of an astonishing feast for the senses as well, it could use a slightly wilder streak. Dune rarely makes surprising moves — it doesn't quite take a ""walk without rhythm and it won't attract the worm"" ethos to heart, aka the line from the book that's immortalised in Fat Boy Slim's 'Weapon of Choice' — but it's always thrilling, immersive and spectacular."

"Jun 25, 2022",positive," While we’re a handful of days behind schedule, The Letterboxd Files with yours truly has returned for another round of things that you could’ve already read if you had a Letterboxd and followed my account. If you don’t, never fear. I’d never deprive you of these painfully casual film blurbs. I wouldn’t even dare. This week, we’ve got Elvis, a spattering of William Friedkin and Wolfgang Petersen (because why not) and more reviews from the vault because I have a job and didn’t watch as many movies this week. Lmao, Baz, you crazy SOB. Elvis is a 159-minute atomic blast of rhinestone glory. Genuinely unsure how Austin Butler pulled that off, and how Tom Hanks was able to be so evil with that accent. A stunner. Let Luhrmann do whatever he wants for the rest of his career. Can we put to rest the idea Walk Hard made it to where you can’t do a biopic like this anymore? Literally just hire someone as insane and opulent as Baz Luhrmann and nail the cast. Elvis is a rattler. No idea how Baz decided to put a Denzel Curry track in the Elvis movie, but I support. Maybe not my favorite Petersen film, but it’s pretty compelling when it’s showing the horrors of contagion and how futile we are to nature. Having actually lived through a pandemic and gotten the virus in question (with tons of vaccine flowing through me), it is fascinating to see the “what if?” horrors of 90s imagining of what this might look like. Clearly it’s going off a disaster movie’s playbook, and the military conniving feels a little trite for how something this serious would actually go. But just having lived through a moment where U.S government severely mismanaged the opening stages of a pandemic…incompetence and malevolence at the federal level don’t feel that off. Petersen really found something to say with the state of our leadership at the top with his government trilogy (this, Fire, AF1), and though this is the least effective of that trio, it’s still a noxious reminder of how we pale in comparison to nature’s worst. Cute monkey, too. God bless Wolfgang Petersen for mounting such a thrilling, phenomenally stupid-yet-surprisingly deep studio blockbuster at a time where we need way more of that than Spider-Man 7. Gary Oldman snapping in every scene is a hoot. I originally intended to only watch an hour of this, but it was so magnetizing, I couldn’t do anything but finish it. The classic 90s political thriller, complete with an air-tight script for 2+ hours, some great performances and a steady hand from Wolfgang Petersen. I miss Clint Eastwood acting in other people’s movies. Just a grand time. A scuzzy, sun-drenched LA neo-noir where nobody is good forever and everyone has something to hide. Obviously the car chase is a landmark, which what else would you expect from the guy who made The French Connection, but I was equally impressed by Friedkin’s ability to zap the film of any predictability. It’s just a daring, morally dubious cops-and-grifters saga with one hell of a Willem Dafoe performance. Everything burns. It’s stunning to me we used to live in a world where this was a major release from a movie studio. Sure, it got stomped by Star Wars, but what didn’t in 1977? A clear pathway for movies like Uncut Gems and Triple Frontier, and a white-knuckle, unforgiving descent into a very specific land of desperation. One of the few movies where it felt like anything could go wrong at any moment, and you feel that tension from opening to closing credits. Friedkin is a master of shot composition, and in building that exact shade of gut-wrenching tension that makes you want to yell at the screen. There’s something powerful that the film that’s going to stand as the future of Pixar is made by a team of amazingly creative women. Domee Shi elite: best directorial debut at Pixar since Lee Unkrich doing Toy Story 3. Staggering talent. It’s got shades of Scott Pilgrim and Aardman, which is one of the higher compliments I can give a movie. It nails the 2000s feel, down to the fact that it feels like one of those 00s live-action family films aimed at preteens. That’s a feat! I usually don’t give Disney credit for creative risk anymore, and boo on them for pulling this from theaters, but this is a step in the right direction. You quite literally can’t make this movie 10 years ago. Generational spectacle. It’s the first of a whole, but it feels still like a complete journey. It’s one of those rare experiences you can’t miss on the big screen – like, if you have any love of film at all, you must see it at least once in a premium format. I think it’s going to be canon one day / it’s the shining example of Villeneuve’s talent and what makes him the most interesting director working. I mean this seriously – some moments in this rival the same awe I felt the first time I watched 2001 in a theater (IMAX) – you just get those goosebumps and feelings of disbelief at what you’re watching. I still don’t know how they pulled some of this off – I’ll be honest, I got a little emotional watching some of this again in such a grand way. Not just for what we missed during the lost year in theaters, but just in appreciating what the best of what the spectacle of moviegoing can give you. A+ movie. The bulk of this is very squarely fixed in a Bush America, and some of the commentary lacks the kind of nuance that we’ve learned about global
politics since it came out. I think some of it is the same kind of issue Blazing Saddles faces now – timely subversion that now looks dated without viral context – but some of it is just Parker/Stone’s sense of humor just not advancing past what was allowed at the time. Some of it is aggressively funny, some of it is just not quite there anymore. What’s surprising is some of its best material isn’t even humor – it’s the darkness that seeps in with the characters and the story. The music is solid, the puppetry is deeply impressive, the puking scene is still the funniest part besides the house cats. I really wish there was more here that aged well, but it’s still quite good for what it’s trying to do. It’s not my favorite thing Parker/Stone have done, but it’s important for what it accomplished, even if what some of it accomplished shows a little naivety and insensitivity. As much as the absence of John R. Dilworth looms over this (it’s very weird he virtually had nothing to do with the revival of Courage and didn’t sign off on this), this is leagues better than the CGI Scoob! movie that committed the unforgivable sin of recasting Shaggy. Matthew Lillard is the only person that should be allowed to play or voice Shaggy until his passing; this should be U.S. law. The tonal clash of Courage’s artsy/creepy horror comedy and Scooby Doo’s kooky 60s mystery caper isn’t nearly as jarring as you’d expect. No Dilworth means the graceful terror of the original Courage series is missing, but the body horror comedy and abstractions, and all the usual beats, for Courage are present. The original show is landmark for animation and one of the best animated series of all time; this revival is pretty darn enjoyable in a “good fan fiction” sort of way. Thea White’s Muriel being back and is just as good as ever, just before her passing, hits hard. I forgot what a spectacular piece of voice acting that was and what a great, tender character she is. She and Courage’s dynamic still hits home. So sweet. Some of this is a little too goofy for its own good (Eustace’s rap number is a choice), but it’s so much better than it has any right to be, and just so, so much better than the big-budget animated film meant to spark a cinematic universe. It gets both series’ right, and it has Lillard right where he needs to be. Also, what a randomly hilarious/moving statement on the relationship the anxious have with calming apps. The likely first and last Courage family reunion was a nice little thing I didn’t know I needed. Mixing in Scooby-Doo is a clever little wrinkle that makes this direct-to-DVD ditty worth the time. The best and worst of Kevin Smith, rolled up into a delicious burger that gives you the runs. As I get uncomfortably closer to 30, I can’t help but feel much more so now the burden of time than I did when I snuck-watched this in 2006 that Smith places on Dante and Randal, selling burgers and talking pop culture into their 30s as life passes them by and they start to grapple with the fact that they’re not really “young” anymore. You can tell that Smith is at war with himself as a creator here, still slinging the same shock-disgust humor but wholly unable to fumble the emotional beats that define his best films. He can’t let go of some truly uncomfortable jokes by today’s standard (half of Randal’s shtick would get tossed out in millisecond in today’s climate, for obvious reason), which makes some of this movie age like an old hamburger on the sidewalk. It’s not really “fair” to judge everything on that standard, with Smith more than willing to answer for Randal’s defeating immaturity with deep-seeded insecurity and fear for how small he feels in a world that seems to be passing him by and a past he probably never fully appreciated until it was long gone. They say youth is wasted on the young, and it’s clear Smith is asking himself, and his pop-culture obsessed audience, if they really understand how precious the days of empty chatter with beloved buddies are, how the time you spend with those you love and the good you can rummage up to do for others really cements your time on this planet, not the big dreams you muster or the life goals you feel bound to complete. Dante and Randal may feel lost in the dog days of the service industry, but it’s that they’re together that makes it worthwhile, and even joyous and well worth the menial nature. Though, Smith’s irony comes with finding that out before so much of it is off the clock. You can’t always appreciate what you’ve got while you’ve got it in abundance, which is why life can be so bittersweet. Smith’s penchant for vulgarity and shock value never served him quite like he hoped; this, of course, came before his spat with Rotten Tomatoes and Cop Out/Yoga Hosers period when you could tell he was struggling to find his voice as an artist who saw an industry starting to pass him by and a style that was growing more dated by the hour. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot was actually a pretty nice little comeback vehicle for him, and clearly, Clerks III might be his best chance in decades to make a sincerely good movie, informed by real-life struggle. Dante and Randal have always been his most honest characters and best evolving reflections of self, as you can tell Randal’s teary lament to Dante in jail is fully Smith purging his own insecurities about aging onto the page. Making Randal have a heart attack to directly mimic his own experience really has some dramatic potential that rivals anything he’s done in his career. It might be the best proving ground he’s ever had. Though, you just hope the juvenile sensibilities strike more toward character than offensiveness. I get some of Randal’s gross-out, low-brow, creepy gags are of their time and made to reflect a shallow, immature, likely dishonest goober who talks a big game and doesn’t have much to back up with. But his persona is caught between genuine empathy and a damning sense of obsoleteness. People complain “you can’t make this anymore” with certain comedies, but clearly some of this movie’s humor is irresponsible and embarrassing. Thankfully Smith has beyond evolved his rhetoric (his latest View Askew film finds a much more palatable sensibility), but you’ve got to weigh this film’s good heart, smart wordplay and deeply touching character work and performance with its at times bewildering lack of awareness. Though, that’s Smith for you circles 2006. Jeff Anderson’s performance, beyond being really nuanced and powerful at its best moments, also captures a sense of lowliness and timidity that does make this film’s most face-planting moments feel less proud and more self-critical than Smith’s page does. This is a very good film in spurts, and a bizarre, rusted time capsule in other ways. It’ll rightfully stay in its time of release and probably will get revisited with some negative attention once the new film comes out for how cringey some of the humor is. But also don’t forget the beating heart of it all, that helps contextualize some of this film’s lesser angels as sad consequences of living life without full awareness of how precious it is and how wonderful it is to have those around you. A glorious over-exaggeration. Jan de Bont knew how to give folks a good time at the movies. For the goofy moments and aged VFX, there’s a real sense of terror with the storm and a real sense of excitement for the chase. It’s a great cast, Bill Paxton such a loveable jackass in this, and Helen Hunt does a great job as the anchor for the emotion. PSH, obvs., is the MVP though, the world’s best storm-chasing hype man. This is a little long and ridiculous, but it’s also just a tour-de-force roller coaster theme park attraction. Which is ironic, because the actual theme park attraction for this sucked. Look, the Russos were a weird ass pick to direct this movie being that the last non-MCU film they made was You, Me and Dupree. Cherry is a lot of things, and at times, the Russos completely whiff on what they’re trying to say, only to be bailed out by their really impressive cast. The Russos know how to cast well; that’s the only reason this film, at least to me, holds itself together. It’s a glossy Goodfellas of an addict’s descent, free of any nuance. The Russos are not the guys who will give you that. But Tom Holland is a supremely gifted young guy who understands the story much better than the Russos do, and he’s pretty dang good here. He’s better at capturing the dangers of  boredom and economic disruption, better at casting a side eye to the empty, dangerous machismo of his military training, better at portraying the devastation of PTSD and the inability to find meaningful help for it, better at sliding into addiction and eventual ruin. The Russos don’t know how to do any of that convincingly, but their filmmaking still, somehow, refracts back with oomph because they were smart enough to wrangle in Holland (and Ciara Bravo, who does some under-appreciated heavy lifting her). The Russos are not probably going to make another movie like Cherry with some of these reactions devastatingly negative, but I found some engagement in this thing. It’s no better or worse at fast food imitation of a better filmmaker than its peers (I think they’re doing more Refn than Scorsese), and it’s, again, anchored by an actor in a better movie. Holland is genuinely good here, and that military section is genuinely interesting and thoughtful in its brazenness to depict the downsides of army life in such a crass, empty way. It’s unafraid to have a more blunt conversion about the 00s wars than some other things I’ve seen, and I liked that about it. The addiction drama is grimy and shallow, but Holland, Bravo, Jack Reynor and Forrest Goodluck are so dang good in portraying the darkness and immorality of the moment that it becomes surprisingly watchable. I don’t think the Russos are doing bad work here, but I question what happens if the cast falls through. It’s a decent flick, but Holland earns his stripes. A voracious, twisted vision of Hell, a carnival of sin and discord forged in the bowels of something unholy and wretched. Gaspar Noe by means of Lars von Trier with John Waters, David Lynch, Harmony Korine, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Zombie, Darren Aronofsky, Uwe Boll, the Farrellys and Tim Story serving as creative consultants. A disturbing survey of a languishing grave of holiday capitalism, screeching from the beyond warnings of greed and excess. A demented ballet of gruesome revenge from an ugly, amoral soul. I feel I am drawn to this film for its pungent nostalgia, for the feelings I have when I watch it that cannot be explained for the quality of what I’m watching, but I also defend the filmmaking. This is what happens when a film goes so off the rails that it dips into a twilight zone where so many delirious accidents and haphazard creative choices get hocked together into something so unsettling, garish, crass, dated, individual. There will never be another movie like Ron Howard’s The Grinch and 2003’s Cat in the Hat. These are abominations, but also such fascinating time capsules and signifiers for what the Universal Studios corporate suite thought was cinematically appropriate for the work of Dr. Seuss. In a world of MCUs and sterile family entertainment, I crave something so disastrously captivating as Ron Howard’s The Grinch. It’s wrong to like this movie, but like it, I do, for all of its festering warts and licked toads. It’s legitimately entertaining in a very selfish way – I find no inherent value in what I’m watching, but I still take great pride in finding value in the experience. I think this film works in some ways because there are some genuinely great things about it, on purpose and on accident. Jim Carrey is a man possessed – it is the most physical performance of all time, and I’m dumbfounded and deeply fascinated that he did this, Me, Myself and Irene and Man on the Moon so close together. It’s like he did The Majestic as a way to come off the acid trip he must’ve had to go on to be in those consecutive movies. I don’t like to think he ever took the Grinch makeup off – he just stayed in there, pushing the brink of his mental stability until he was just Grinch, nothing less, nothing more. Just Grinch. It’s an astounding feat of physical comedy and excess emoting. It’s a miracle he was able to do this and make it so lasting – I mean that. Rick Baker and company’s makeup is unbelievable for how it just meshes into the characters. The dog is a good actor dog, Taylor Momson is a good kid actor, Tambor plays smug like a fiddle, Clint Howard is the perfect actor for such a besmirched production. Getting Faith Hill to sing the main song over the credits after this nearly two-hour psychedelic breakdown is absolutely hilarious. This movie should not exist but I’m so glad it does. It’s a wonderful example of some of the deeply strange stuff that masqueraded as family entertainment when I was a kid. I’m all the better and worst for it. I find value in this film. It’s a weird, unkempt, relentlessly crude-yet-disarmingly-warm piece of early 2000s kitsch. But it’s also one of the most popular and rewatched Christmas films of all time. Only a holiday movie could be so bizarre and still garner such adoration and loyalty. A cheap sizzle reel of hero worship and political myth-making; telling in its utter inability to find anything particularly laudable about Rudy Giuliani in flashbacks of his spotty career in public service as a draconian attorney-turned-mayor. Any virtue bestowed upon him is in imagined dialogue, where any of his actions are heralded as “the right thing to do” because he’s Rudy, a good American and New Yorker who *loves his city.* It’s telling Giuliani made a cameo in this to give it his official seal of approval – it’s mostly the biopic equivalent of blowing smoke up the buttocks. I really don’t know what to do with the 9/11 material here. It’s obviously the pivotal part of Giuliani’s public persona, what he was mainly known for pre-Trump. Giuliani’s actual response and legacy to that horrible day is much more complicated now than it was when this film was made, already coronated as “America’s Mayor,” a shine that largely followed him nationally up to his time in this current administration. It’s a little shameless to have footage used like this, pandering in a way to serve mainly the purpose of telling Giuliani’s story. It’s his movie, but this film’s handling of 9/11 feels very lacking. But it was also released in 2003, before anyone really saw the full picture? I don’t know. James Woods’ performance is kind of just what he used to do in movies; banter quickly and yell loudly. It’s a strange balance of wanting to portray Giuliani as this moral fortress who also casually cheats on his wife, shows no mercy in his law, uses the Southern Strategy to win an election and berates superiors as a showing of “strength.” He’s given a glowing aura the story can’t organically fulfill. On subtle purpose or accident, it just shows him as a brash, ineffective, “law and order” politician who gets thrust into history and is hailed in the moment for saying all the right things and being at the front and center. It’s not to say he didn’t do good things around 9/11; it’s just that he’s not nearly the unifying hero that this movie tried to make him out to be. Clearly this film has no cultural currency outside of that Twitter clip that went viral (not very indicative of the rest of the film, which is as a whole listless, uneventful and kind of boring), but it is a fascinating time capsule to see how reputations get built off of fictional work. He was America’s Mayor because that’s what folks were told he was. It’s how Trump was seen as a successful businessman who could stabilize the economy. Stories matter! Myth-making in politics is dangerous; this film is definitely guilty of this. It’s whatever. A Made-for-TV procedural biopic that can’t really rectify its desire to glorify its subject with a life’s story unable to provide many examples of why that glorification is wholly deserved. I really wonder what the good people at TOHO thought when they left the screening room after being shown Roland Emmerich’s take on the beloved Godzilla. It’s probably like what Walt Disney would think if those people who make cheap animated films with Rob Schneider for Redbox made a Mickey Mouse movie. Godzilla ‘98 is a thing to behold, a doofy creature feature where quite literally everyone is an idiot and common sense and basic physics are thrown to the wind in exchange for lots of explosions and loud roaring. The Godzilla roar is one of the most jolting noises in global cinema, and here, it’s sounded so much, all at once, you lose sight of it and just get lost in the cacophonous nonsense. I can’t deny Emmerich must’ve had the time of his life here, because this is a silly movie with a true sense of personality. It has no idea it’s so crazy and lazily written, and it marches around like it’s the second coming of Jurassic Park. Jan de Bont was originally supposed to make this, and I would’ve been so curious to see what that would’ve been like. He showed so much clever restraint on Speed, and Emmerich never met a restraint he didn’t want to break with 30 tons of explosives. He’s basically who he is as a filmmaker, a much less problematic, hokier Michael Bay who has destroyed the world like 5 times. Respect is due to how unfailingly sincere he is, even if his films have never been particularly great. Godzilla ‘98 is a big, uninspired, contrived mess, but you have to at least somewhat enjoy how happy-go-lucky it is. Like, they basically took a big dump on the Godzilla mythos and reduced him to a lifeless, CGI horror of a dinosaur, and I still didn’t hate this stupid movie because of how eager it is. I really, really hated how they lost Godzilla so much. No one in New York could not keep their tabs on a gigantic monster; multiple scenes have everyone asking “where’s Godzilla?” like it’s Homer Simpson trying to pitch Poochie to the Springfield TV execs. He’s right there, you’ll yell at the screen! He’s right there! Godzilla is right behind you! How did he go from rampaging in the streets to hiding in the sewer system? Why does the Mayor in this get so mad about evacuating the city after a gigantic dinosaur attacks? Why did this film cast Harry Shearer to play the news anchor when he also voices Kent Brockman on The Simpsons, making a phrase like “the Disney Store has been looted” less of a forbidding sign of the times in this movie and more like an episode of The Simpsons? Why was Hank Azaria’s character composite for “Animal” the cameraman “a slice of New York pepperoni pizza brought to life by a wizard?” Why did they try to lure Godzilla by putting down a big pile of fish in the middle of New York City? Why is the military so stupid in this, even by the standards of movie military people? Is that *really* Godzilla, or just a giant stupid lizard who apparently has the ability to lay hundreds of eggs, in the span of like an hour, much less. Why was a renowned nuclear physicist taking a picture of Godzilla with a disposable camera multiple times? Why didn’t I absolutely hate this movie? I think it was because of the French military subplot. I did enjoy that. Jean Reno is always great. This is ok? Gleefully dull, but with enough earnest panache and spirit that you can’t dismiss it outright. There is a great moment where Matthew Broderick (a casting decision I actually didn’t hate) tried to escape on an elevator at Madison Square Garden from a bunch of hungry baby Godzillas, barely getting the door to close to save his hide. He gets to another floor, and the door opens. He sees a bunch of other baby Godzillas chowing down on a popcorn machine. They look at him. He says, “wrong floor,” and closes the door. I laughed. This was a heck of a bit. Why couldn’t the whole movie just be that? Godzilla as an IP is fine now. This is, ironically, kind of like the 2001 Planet of the Apes film I just watched (in 2020). This one is probably more remembered since it was such a big thing, but they’re both big-budget one-stop pop culture moments that flamed out because no one really liked them. This was also far too long, but I don’t think that really matters at a point. Liked those practical sets, though! Love those practical sets. What a fun, nasty little movie. Tim Burton got the raw end of the deal that this wasn’t a bigger thing. It’s got such an anarchistic spirit, it’s laugh-our-loud funny, it’s insanely creative, the multi-narrative layout works well and the aliens are so fun. It’s a better movie than Independence Day, and I wish we talked about this every 4th of July instead of Independence Day. It’s such a wonderful lampoon of the establishment and hammers in Burton’s disdain for those in charge. It’s also got the frenetic spirit of a PG-13 Tex Avery/Chuck Jones/Bob Clampett cartoon. The dove gag and ensuing “no birds” sign, and the aliens’ general disdain for birds in general, made be howl. This movie is a heck of a comedy, on top of its delightful parody of sci-fi tropes. I’m most struck by this rewatch because the animation is starting to really date itself. This movie is almost 20 years old! That astounds me. I was, like, 8 when it came out, and I remember being so enthralled with how weird and funny it was. I was laughing so much as a kid in this that I purposefully wet my pants so I could avoid going to the bathroom and miss any of the movie. I was that hooked; I peed myself in honor of Shrek. It holds up because it’s one of those movies that always will. It’s just hard to make an animated movie with this much staying power, one that, even if some of the animation is looking a little rusty these days, still crackles with so much wit and has such a large heart. Jokes I still laugh very loudly at: the Duloc welcome song and the exploding song bird, the brimstone exchange, most all of Donkey’s lines, probably more. The welcome song was one of the funniest things I’d ever seen when I was 8. The timing of that is unreal! Everything about Shrek is good. It’s all at once such an oddball movie and a towering achievement in animation; I think one fuels the other. Hot take: Shrek is a great movie! I’d kind of seen rumblings about people revisiting this and being kind of awestruck by it, and I can happily say I am now in the number that says the 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie is fantastic. I watched this on HBOMax at my fiancée’s (now wife!) house, and when she saw what I had watched, she texted me and said “did you really watch Josie and the Pussycats?” She is a very understanding person! I mean, yowza. Where the heck did this come from? Where was its audience when it came out? Why am I just now watching this? It’s great! It’s basically using a nostalgic IP as a Trojan horse for scathing, hilarious satire on the blind consumerism of the late 90s/early 00s, where people just bought stuff without really thinking “hmm, why am I buying this? Is this good? Is it good for me?’ I feel like we’ve all become more mindful of being advertised to and about the products we buy, but a movie like this still makes you kind of look around and see that we are still a world dominated by brands. It’s that now brands have to play fair, er, maybe just more fair than they used to? Consumerism being a means for conformity and a suppression of individual ideas, championed by those who are trying to compensate for how their individualism backfired on them, is not a theme I expected in the 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie. I really couldn’t have told you a year ago I’d be singing this film’s praises, mainly because a year ago I had forgotten this movie existed. It’s great! Unlike a lot of the teen-driven movies of its time, this one is incredibly smart and has some serious panache to the style. It mimics the boy band music video template in its aesthetic, which ages more like a wise stylistic decision to date the material rather than a point of convenience in the filmmaking process. The entire cast is excellent (I mean this in no point of irony; Tara Reid is Oscar-worthy in this film, like on the same level as Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids, as are the script, songs and maybe even Parker Posey and Alan Cummings), the satire hits in waves (I cannot understate how biting some of it is, particularly the way it brazenly skewers the music business and its treatment of the art, artists and audience), the humor is belly laugh worthy (the Du Jour, 2000-2001 graphic got me right in the kisser), the writing and direction are creative and assured and the music is legitimately great. Du Jour in and of itself is such a brilliant sendup of the boy band. Every single note of satire is just great here; the world might be different than when this was made, but my goodness, this is such a clever, endearing, madcap film. It’s genius how they pull this off and so sad that few people really grappled with how great it is when it was released. It’s one of the best cult films I’ve ever seen, and one of the flat-out best satires, period. Watch this! It’s on HBO Max (at the time) and it’s legitimately superb. We can’t go to movie theaters right now but my goodness you can sure plop on the couch and watch the wonderful 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie. One of the best things I’ve seen in awhile. When I was a kid, I didn’t watch this a ton after I saw it in theaters, primarily because this was the dark Disney movie I don’t think anyone in my family was keen on revisiting. I get why! It’s an inescapably human, decidedly non-Disney work, a gorgeous, philosophical rumination on religion, moral hypocrisy, the infallible nature of man, the power of kindness in a world that so often forgoes it, genocide, repressed human emotion fermented into pious villainy, the war within the church for servant love versus moral rule, inner beauty, societal oppression, etc. It’s not a movie 4-year-old Cory really “got,” I’m sure, and it’s precisely why, though they detract from the film’s swelling power at times, the gargoyles are necessary. Kids needed, y’know, something to hold on to, and wisecracking rock things do the trick! But adult Cory loves seeing something like the “Hellfire” music number in a Disney movie. This is the darkest “G” movie of all time! It’s like the Bambi’s mom scene for 90 minutes! Knowing deep down this isn’t even Quasimodo’s story, and though it’s thrilling and unforgettable to see him swing through the corridors of Notre Dame singing about going outside his shelled home. It’s Frollo’s story, the real Hunchback of Notre Dame, a grotesque man whose devious moral crusades mask his inability to rectify with his own shortcomings and fear of not being good enough for his false sense of righteousness. It’s a disturbingly relevant character, and Tony Jay voices the hell out of him. Musical numbers like “Topsy Turvy” and “Hellfire” just aren’t things Disney does or ever did. This film came out during a major transition for Disney and it feels like this film slipped through the cracks. A happy accident, if you will. I don’t want a watered down live-action version of this. I want the most PG-13 “G” movie of all time to stay how it is. If you just kind of let the gargoyle stuff be (the Jason Alexander’s gargoyle is attracted to a goat material is almost funny in a really embarrassing way), this film is the best thing the studio put out in the 90s that wasn’t Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin or Lion King. Heck, some of the highs here are as good as those movies, maybe better in some regards. This is a hallmark in taking a basic story trope, the boy and his dog, and driving in a wholly original, delightfully irreverent vision with it at its base. I really appreciate that Disney didn’t seem to hold this one back much; the studio’s output was at a point in the early 00s that, in a post-Tarzan world, they were making more non-musical risks. It eventually cratered and they had to return to the song-and-a-scene format of the 80s/90s Renaissance (Princess and the Frog/Tangled really starting in the second Renaissance), so some not good movies like Home on the Range and Chicken Little, slipped through. But so did outstanding films like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet. The voice cast here is just to die for (Daviegh Chase doing this and Spirited Away in the same year is unbelievable), and the animation is gorgeous. Sanders and DeBlois really let the backdrops take a dust into Hawaiian watercolor feel, and when a film this nutty and sweet also have a rigorous artistic backbone. These guys also know how to plot story like crazy so you know the pace, emotional beats (elite) and narrative payoff will be there. I wish Disney didn’t beat the heck out of this with that B-grade television show and all the direct-to-video sequels, because this film’s legacy deserves the gold standard. It’s one of Disney’s best animated films and one of its most proudly original. It’s also got the emotional sophistication you expect from the studio’s best works. It’s the A-team. The surfing Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride sequence is earned, not bought. When a film can pull something like that off so effortlessly to where it’s not like “hey, look, a great idea!,” that’s when you know."
"Jun 8, 2022",negative," Observo en la portada del suplemento dominical de este periódico, un titular con aroma lírico. Dice así: “La emoción de volver a las salas de cine”. No he prescindido de ese acto presuntamente emocionante después de los tres meses de confinamiento. Y puedo jurar que excepto en casos mínimos no me ha asaltado ese sentimiento que inunda el alma. La calidad narrativa o poética, el suspense o el miedo, la identificación emocional, las sensaciones que te regala ser testigo de historias, personajes, situaciones y diálogos dotados de arte, sería un motivo excelso para practicar el ritual de volver al cine, pero si lo que veo y escucho me desinteresa, aburre o irrita me da igual sufrirlo en una gran pantalla y acompañado o en una pequeña y solo. Comprendo el atractivo que reunirá para mucha gente que después de año y medio desértico se estrene comercialmente una película como Dune, que pretende representar al gran espectáculo. Hollywood sabe desde hace mucho tiempo que dispone de una clientela tan numerosa como fiel que responde a sus fórmulas invariables. Ocurrió con la saga galáctica (me gustaron las primeras, el resto me parece tan mecánico como previsible) y el cine de Marvel, habitado exclusivamente por superhéroes y supervillanos, un género lleno de ruido, abarrotado de imágenes rápidas y clónicas, música incesante, vacío. Hablo como siempre de mis gustos. El permanente éxito de taquilla de ese tipo de películas confirma que la clientela es masiva. Sus razones tendrá. Pero el gran cine de aventuras que me ha hecho feliz desde niño creo recordar o compruebo en gozosas revisiones que era de otra forma. Bueno, para gustos están los colores, que sentencia la sabiduría popular. Me acerco al pase de prensa de Dune a los cines Kinépolis de Madrid, que garantizan una visión y un sonido apabullantes. Está dirigida por Denis Villeneuve, alguien con vocación de autor que ha realizado películas que me inquietaron o fascinaron. Como Incendios, Prisioneros, Sicario y La llegada. Junto a otras que me parecieron tediosas, irrelevantes, pretenciosas, incluida la innecesaria continuación de la justificadamente legendaria Blade Runner. Aquí vuelve a adaptar al cine la saga literaria que se inventó el novelista Frank Herbert. No la he leído. Los aficionados a la ciencia ficción la veneran. Tendrán sus motivos. Es un género literario que no he frecuentado, aunque me apasione la obra de Ray Bradbury. Tal vez este hiciera ciencia ficción, pero ante todo siempre le he considerado un poeta terrenal. Y ya sé que sus crónicas fueron marcianas. La primera adaptación al cine de Dune llevaba la firma del santificado David Lynch. Me pareció un horror, un caos sin la menor gracia. Me atornillo en la butaca con la esperanza de estar entretenido o maravillado durante el muy largo metraje de Dune. Pero desde el principio me pierdo un poco con su argumento. Lo sitúa en una galaxia desértica, en la que lo más codiciado es la explotación de una especia llamada melange. El emperador debe negociar entre el poder que otorga a los épicos y civilizados miembros de la familia Atreides y la respuesta que darán los villanos, oscuros y sanguinarios miembros de la familia Harkonnen. Todo ello rodeado por un halo de esoterismo, incesantes batallas galácticas y el protagonismo elegíaco de un Atreides joven y destinado a convertirse en el símbolo del bien. O sea, el rollo de siempre, el enfrentamiento entre la luz y la oscuridad. Las imágenes son espectaculares y sombrías, la música no descansa jamás, el tono de la historia pretende ser epopéyico y filosófico. Nada de esto evita mi indiferencia hacia los personajes ni lo que pretende contarme el director tan estilista. Ninguna emoción, por supuesto, pero sí un notable tedio. Y deseo que le vaya bien a Dune, si esto sirve para el retorno del gran público, imagino que mayoritariamente juvenil. Pero a mí no me provoca ninguna de las sensaciones que me hacen seguir amando el cine. ¿Qué cine? El que me gusta, el que considero bueno. A estas alturas, abandonar el dogmatismo me parece una indeseable quimera."
"May 30, 2022",positive,"While clearly just the first half of a longer narrative, what a thrilling first half this is. "
"May 20, 2022",positive,"While Dune 2021 is a very well presented and styled gourmet sci-fi dish, for a platter stuffed with ""spice"", it unfortunately lacks a ton of Dune flavor."
"May 17, 2022",negative," If it had been an eight minute short, with the electrical Charlotte Rampling, as Reverend Mother Mohiam – in full goth regalia, in a darkened library, on a distant planet, pain-testing the blank slate that is Timothée Chalamet, as Paul Atreides, to gauge his capacity for impulse-control, and the suitability for the job of a Messiah – I would have given it a five-star, no questions asked. However, as things stand, the third screen adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert – the first famously being by David Lynch’s (1984), the second a miniseries (2000) –  is well over two hours long, and feels more like an obscure, scattered conversation overheard on a long train ride, peaking early with Rampling’s natural mystique, and then hitting a downward spiral – all dense plot and mild tedium, a bounty of sensual imagery wasted on zero substance. Its casting is a downer of sorts, too. Along with the choppy script by Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and Villeneuve, himself, the choice of actors is the film’s key mishap – predictably stretching from epic old-school to random indie, the weight of a performance as if measured in marketing-approved screen time.  Unlike the supremely confident Rampling, Stellan Skarsgård as arch-villain Baron (Vladimir!) Harkonnen and the brooding Javier Bardem as the earthy Fremen, Stilgar, had little manoeuvring space to flex their very significant acting chops. However, the hollow centre of the narrative doughnut firmly belongs to the permanently poker-faced Oscar Isaac, as Duke Leto Atreides, and the above-tagged Chalamet, as his son Paul – bearing both the burden of being the chosen one and carrying what was to be a thinking-man’s blockbuster without an essential element for this particular endeavour: action-hero bravado. A casting choice I could not explain in any other way than the fact that Chalamet seems a popular pick for big budget leads in recent years, and was pretty good in some of them. Rebecca Ferguson as the sorceress mother of Paul, Lady Jessica Atreides, of the order of Bene Gesserit, almost bridges the gap between the two thespian universes, simply by sheer determination to do her best for the story, and perhaps could have offered so much more were she not annoyingly framed as Terminator 2‘s (1991) Sarah Connor, thus her entire performance seemed to me a déjà vu. In a nutshell, nothing and no-one within Dune made me care even a tiny bit about a single royal from the noble House Atreides, lament the fate of the gorgeous yet deadly desert planet Arrakis, or even pay attention to the term spice, let alone remember why it is so valuable to everyone – which is why this incredibly sophisticated enterprise failed in a key mission of any quality storytelling, and therefore, a piece of cinema, at least with this one viewer – and that is some measure of emotional investment in a narrative. Haters are going to hate. As a Dune fan who read the book as a teenager, this version of the saga was Epic. As I said, haters are always going to hate. Readers, this film was magical and if you want a magical experiential viewing, see it in a theater with D Box motion seats."
"Apr 19, 2022",positive,Paul's family is evidently descended from a long line of matadors.
"Apr 16, 2022",positive," Who would have thought I would at all be fascinated by an epic movie based on a 1965 sci-fi novel, written by Frank Herbert, that spins an involved tale that begins with Duke Leto of House Atreides—of the ocean planet Caladan—being assigned to replace House Harkonnen as fief ruler of Arrakis…to control the lucrative (awk!) SPICE production?  Neither had I ever read the essential (for true sci-fi fans) Herbert novel, Dune, NOR watched the  reportedly disappointing 1984 film adaptation….also titled Dune. So why am I now driven to wildly applaud this 156-minutes of otherworldly, ultra escape—a flick I have been purposely avoiding since its inception?  ANSWER: Because this movie version of Dune (aka Dune: Part One) directed and co-written by Denis Villeneuve, has so enveloped my thoughts and dreams (at least one night, anyway) that I now give up. It has grabbed me in ways never felt since the first time I saw Star Wars during the summer of 1977. Let’s call Dune: Part One a deeply thinking person’s Star Wars.  Maybe I just love the giant sandworms of Dune because I groove on the sarlacc in Revenge of the Jedi. But there must be more to my Dune “thing” than one scary creature.  The paramount attractions, the visuals, connect immediately. The landscapes, costuming, sets, makeup, creatures, and wild special effects are stunning. So awesome are they that of Dune’s 10 Oscar noms, four won for Cinematography, Visual Effects, Production Design and Editing. Factor in two more wins for the Sound and Hans Zimmer’s Score.  Basically, the epic tale is one of political power and corruption set way into the future. (Egad, have we no hope of someday living in a society devoid of such strife?) Families are pitted against families, and planets against planets. Good and evil exist as do loyalty and deception. These are themes common to any literary structure in which—of course—conflict must exist. In Dune, the conflicts are often spectacularly shown (huge battles) or shadowy (Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, being groomed as a potential leader). Topping or at least equalling it all, is an international cast of impressive actors. Some of their characters will not make it to Dune: Part Two, to be released Oct. 20, 2023. (That is, unless they are somehow brought back from death.) Of course, I will not divulge who survives here.  The relatively brief list includes a Spell Check nightmare of Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides, the ducal heir; Oscar Isaac (Duke Leto Atreides); Josh Brolin (Gurney Halleck); Stellan Skarsgård (Baron Vladimir Harkonnen); Stephen McKinley Henderson (Thufir Hawat, the Mentat); Zendaya (Chani, a mysterious Fremen woman); Javier Bardem (Stilgar, Fremen leader); and Jason Momoa (Duncan Idaho, sword master of House Atreides). "
"Mar 30, 2022",positive," El principal escollo de todas las adaptaciones fallidas de Dune siempre fue, más que los costos de producción para la recreación de ese mundo desértico en el que deambulan los personajes, cómo dosificar toda la información concentrada a lo largo de la saga. Es decir, cómo articular la inmensa cantidad de trivia sobre distintos linajes, poderes, economía de extraccionismo y detalles híper específicos de trajes, armas y equipamiento, sin dejar de conservar cierta plasticidad y flexibilidad cinematográfica. En estas arenas movedizas se hundió nada menos que David Lynch, un artista intrínsecamente plástico. Si volvemos a aquella película, el principal problema no era la limitada libertad creativa bajo la supervisión de Dino de Laurentiis, ni el poco aire de movimiento de cámara que le brindaba el diseño de sets tan barrocos como estáticos, sino la hiperinflación narrativa. Como a Lynch nunca le gustó explicar sus películas, sus films siempre resolvieron todo por la vía visual. Sin embargo, ya desde el comienzo su Dune empezaba con un insoportable bombardeo de información, y en numerosas oportunidades se atoraba en una sucesión de personajes que narraban didácticamente un montón de detalles de la trama. Denis Villeneuve, un director que sabe administrar como pocos cantidades inusuales de información, tenía delante el reto definitivo, el gran gusano de arena a domar. Lo magistral de Villeneuve en este caso fue ir por la senda opuesta a mucho de lo que lo caracterizaba, optando por reducir la información a lo mínimo y centrarse, por el contrario, en el aspecto mucho más sensual, no narrativo, cuasi abstracto, que emanaba del libro. De esta manera, Duna funciona a veces como una extraña ópera abstracta en la que percibimos más las intensidades que la representación de los sucesos, y a veces no sólo no sabemos en qué parte de la historia estamos, sino qué es lo concreto que está sucediendo. Así, en la película podemos ver esa suerte de blitzkrieg traicionera de los Harkonnen, pero el registro de la catástrofe va más allá de los personajes y sus cuerpos: el terreno del conflicto y del drama parecería reducirse a algo más primigenio, donde los misiles y los estallidos se estampan en la pantalla en la forma de una fusión de luz y sombras, y donde las personas corren y perecen en su huida, pero no como seres vivos, sino como un grumo de óleo espeso que sobresale en la superficie de un lienzo (Duna por momentos es la respuesta futurista a la premisa de performatividad bélica pura de Dunkirk). Incluso en el momento apoteósico en que Paul Atrides (Timothée Chalamet) se enfrenta al gran gusano de arena, la boca del monstruo no se nos revela de la forma hiperdetallada en la que caería cualquier producción con un departamento de CGI multimillonario de hoy en día; al contrario, el avance es, más que hacia una sucesión de dientes aserrados de lamprea, hacia un agujero negro que denota un vacío total, algo que es peligroso, pero en una dimensión más metafísica que concreta. Es este uno de los múltiples ejemplos en los que se muestra que todo en la película es más operístico, incorpóreamente musical, que narrativo. No sería un atrevimiento decir que la autoría de Duna se disputa por partes iguales entre Denis Villeneuve y Hans Zimmer. En esta nueva búsqueda de sonidos o tonalidades que se superponen a lo melódico, Zimmer encastra con una dimensión persistente de los films del canadiense: en la mayoría de sus obras siempre hay algo imponente, tan inasible como insoportable de asimilar. En Incendies esta dimensión sobrecogedora se encapsulaba en ese juego matemático que explicaba el embarazo de una madre a manos de su propio hijo. En Arrival esta dimensión la encarna tanto la nave con forma de semilla que pende vertical a metros de la tierra como esos seres paquidérmicos con los que intentan comunicarse los humanos. Esta dimensión daliniana encarnada en las kilométricas extremidades también se daba en la araña de Enemy. Y en Sicario, si bien no hay un monstruo descomunal en lo físico concreto, la idea de que el verdadero mal está infiltrado en las fuerzas del orden adquiere una nueva dimensión terrorífica y omnipresente. Duna está todo el tiempo atravesada por este juego enmudecedor de escalas, pero el verdadero efecto es más sonoro que visual, con esos ensordecedores ruidos blancos de Zimmer que se superponen como bocinas o sirenas afásicas (sin que se pueda casi precisar si son diegéticos o extradiegéticos). Lo visual corre por el mismo carril: lo que vuelve terrorífico al Barón es esa mezcla entre gordura e ingravidez, la manera grácil en que flota entremezclada con esa grasa que lo envuelve (y que parecería estar densamente inspirada en el coronel Kurtz de Apocalypse Now). Hay una escena en la que el Barón sufre un ataque casi letal y de repente lo encontramos en una esquina del techo, respirando en un tubo de ventilación con esa fragilidad fiera que sólo tienen los animales acorralados: la sensación de asco y horror que genera es similar a la de encontrarnos a un murciélago herido que revolotea en nuestra habitación. Así, lo crucial en Duna son las imágenes y los sonidos, o más bien las emociones puras aguardando debajo de las arenas de estas imágenes y sonidos. Villeneuve muestra, con nada menos que un megablockbuster, el uso de su segunda voz casi como si pudiese controlarnos con la habilidad de la reverenda Gaius Helen Mohiam."
"Mar 29, 2022",negative," There are fans for whom Dune’s second coming has been anticipated with a kind of religious devotion. The first cinematic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s cult science fiction novel in 1984 was a film David Lynch would rather forget, so there were high hopes for Denis Villeneuve’s new version. Could they get it wrong again? Well yes, they could, but in a completely different way. This new Dune has tended to polarise its audiences, with some of its detractors now having second thoughts about the 1984 film. I remember that movie as a complete mess, but history lays the blame on the studio rather than the director. David Lynch, at the time, was one of the world’s most acclaimed emerging filmmakers, and there were huge expectations. It became over-ambitious, with the studios doing much of the cutting and editing, and Lynch not even present for retakes. If Lynch’s Dune could have been conceived as a mini-series, such as the highly successful Twin Peaks (1989-91), it might have had a better chance. (There was a three-part mini-series of Dunein 2000, directed by John Harrison, which proved massively popular at the time.) Even Lynch’s mangled final version clocks in at three hours, with a credit to Alan Smithee, the imaginary Hollywood director that gets the blame for Hollywood movies the real directors want to disown. Nowadays, Hollywood has a new method of dealing with a long, intractable story: turn it into a franchise. Why make only one blockbuster movie when you can stretch it out to three or four, or – in the case of Star Wars – infinity? So when faced with the problem of adapting a complex, sprawling novel with no fewer than five sequels, today’s studios see an opportunity to keep cranking out revenue for years to come. To me, the new Dune felt like one long, slow build-up for the movies ahead. The major characters and plot details are laid in; the battle lines are drawn up between goodies and baddies; we’ve been introduced to the special features of the desert planet; but by the time the credits roll it feels as if we’ve only seen the preamble. It’s often been said that Dune is unfilmable, and this new version is a tacit acknowledgement that there’s more here than can be squeezed into the standard two hours. To promise a whole series of films might be dressed up as a gift for fans, but there’s a lingering cynicism about this project – a feeling that it’s essentially a way of maximising returns at the box office. Many years ago I dipped into Dune (1959) and found it virtually unreadable, but the novel has millions of admirers. Herbert is famous for dealing with a raft of issues that have become only more important over time. There’s an ecological theme; an analysis of the human propensity to follow tyrants and strongmen; a warning about the dangerous nexus of religion and political extremism; a look at the appeal and effects of mind-altering drugs, and so on. Name a pressing topic of our time and it’s there in Dune. This doesn’t, however, do anything to improve Herbert’s prose style. In this, he is like so many famous American science fiction writers whose books are full of good ideas and bad writing. For another prime example try reading anything by Robert A. Heinlein. Somehow, Villeneuve and his colleagues have managed to capture the turgid aspect of Herbert’s prose in this new Dune, which is jam-packed with mournful stares, endless mumbo-jumbo relating to the House of Atreides, doomy prophecies, awesome responsibilities, and on and on. Everybody looks vaguely hungover and grumpy – as if this is the best way of conveying Deep Seriousness. For those of us who haven’t spent their lives studying the Dune novels, it’s portentous and confusing. The story is set in a distant future when interplanetary travel is commonplace, but for some unknown reason everyone likes to dress and act like figures from the Middle Ages. Feudalism seems to be the preferred political system, with the known universe under the control of the Padishah Emperor Corrino IV, who is every bit as teacherous as the Roman emperors. The good guys are the noble House of Atreides, who are invited by the Emperor to take control of the desert planet Arrakis, which provides a valuable ‘spice’ used for interplanetary travel. What they don’t know is that their stewardship is simply a ruse, a set-up for an attack by their hated enemies, the war-like House of Harrkonen. The reason for this double-cross is that the Emperor sees the House of Atreides as an implicit threat to his power – rather like Vladimir Putin views the Ukraine. There is, apparently, a prophecy or two to this effect, with the leading candidate for the Messiah being young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Naturally this makes Paul a marked man, but he is well protected by his sturdy, macho helpers, and the mystical charms of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who belonged to a sect of cosmic nuns before she married Paul’s dad, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Are you following this? The star of the movie is a massive CGI desert worm that gets excited whenever it detects a vibration in the sand. Its acting is far more expressive than any human character. Yet the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen (free men, get it?), have learned how to avoid worms. By the end of this first installment Paul has hooked up with the desert tribes and absolutely nothing has been resolved. I hope this doesn’t count as a spoiler but it’s painfully obvious at the half way mark that – like Paul Atreides – we’re in this for the long haul. I’ve generally found it’s impossible to say whether someone is acting well or badly when they’re kitted out in fancy dress and obliged to intone a lot of silly-sounding lines that advance an improbable plot. It’s no surprise that nobody in Dune has been nominated for an Oscar as a lead or supporting actor, not even the worm. Neither does Villeneuve score a Best Director nomination for his ponderous work. The only truly deserved nomination may be Greig Fraser, for some impressive cinematography. Although it has its fans and admirers, Dune can count itself lucky to make the short-list for Best Picture. The good news is that the studio will probably have a further five or more opportunities to improve their standing. Get ready for a long war of attrition."
"Mar 28, 2022",negative," Broadcast television is tanking so badly that ABC, the television network that airs the Oscars, has insisted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that eight categories be cut from the annual awards telecast, including Film Editing, Production Design, Sound, Original Score, and Hair and Makeup.  Worried about ratings and therefore ad dollars, ABC (a division of the Walt Disney Company), is willing to ignore the essential crafts of Hollywood filmmaking, from editing to hairdos, in favor of the rancid Best Original Song category. That way the aging broadcast TV audience won’t miss out on seeing performances by such contemporary crowd pleasers as former country-and-western sitcom star Reba McEntire, and maybe even overmodest, ubiquitous Lin-Manuel Miranda. Miranda also directed an Oscar-nominated film this year, so if he were to sing his song, it would be like if Alfred Hitchcock had also written “Que Sera, Sera” for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) and had to perform it onstage at the Oscars instead of Doris Day. Or, since Miranda has nominations for two movies, only one of which he directed, if Hitchcock had written a song in The King and I. This is what a film director is to ABC-Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros.-HBO Max. What film directing has become in Hollywood is a team-building exercise with lots of group hugs and a public-facing mascot from the generic world of show biz. The mascot could be anyone camera-friendly. Being a director is now something of an honorary position at that level, like being the Grand Marshal of the Hollywood Christmas Parade. ABC has lost faith in the films themselves, swallowing the right-wing notion that the nominees do not reflect popular taste. Therefore the less time spent on them the better. Give the people what we think they want: Beyoncé and Billie Eilish. Anything but actors from these movies. Olivia Colman? Where are the three Spider-men? Where is The Batman? The atmosphere in which the highest honors in filmdom are now broadcast to the masses is more like an episode of Wheel of Fortune in which the contestants can’t solve the puzzle, no matter how many vowels they’ve bought. The audience on social media engages in Frustration Discourse as they watch loser-winners grapple with their moments of professional glory on live TV, all so ABC can continue to exist in a world that has left it behind. It’s also a world in which actual movies have become marginal, especially during the Oscars. Every moment is confused, all of it a ritual no one in the film industry believes in anymore but enacts to ward off demons of their future: simultaneous release in theaters and on streaming, no back end, no residuals, voiceover work in animation and video games, shrinking foreign markets, foreign markets where film releases are moral quandaries, a series of bad decisions like the ones that led to The Suicide Squad, Cameo, and the final, furthest away specter: a world without an In Memoriam reel.  As I watched this year’s Oscar films, a cargo ship called the Felicity Ace burned in the North Atlantic. Massive and packed with luxury automobiles bound for the U.S., it was on fire and adrift, abandoned by its crew, its shipment of expensive cars doomed. Life at the beginning of the pandemic reminded me of the Costa Concordia, the luxury cruise ship in Jean-Luc Godard’s Film Socialisme that later sank, a metaphor for the shipwreck of capitalism that Godard guided into reality in 2010. Now this new Titanic appeared without people, only machines, floating aimlessly and aflame as the pandemic moved into a new phase, possibly its end phase but probably not. CODA admirably focuses on the working life of a Gloucester fisherman family in which the father (Troy Kotsur), mother (Marlee Matlin), and son (Daniel Durant) are deaf (and played by deaf actors), and the daughter is not. Their struggles with the hearing world and with unfair labor practices, and their plan to collectivize the docks, are the backdrop for daughter Ruby’s conflicted desire to get away from the sea and go to the Berklee College of Music. The deaf characters are easy to relate to in this pleasant, unmemorable movie. For instance, even though I can hear, I would have the same confused, impatient reactions were I forced to attend a high school musical. Presented with a group of teens singing David Bowie’s “Starman,” I would watch in silent frustration, too. The issue is that for me it would be easier to forget. The self-conscious boredom and fascism of Denis Villeneuve’s films, along with their sandy-inky beige-taupe-gray-black-brown-orange color palette, make them look different than other blockbusters. They are in fact post-blockbusters, and Villeneuve’s unnecessary new version of the first part of Dune shows how a depressed attitude that has given in to all that is wrong with current Hollywood filmmaking, and has also given in to all that is wrong with the world, might appear to be new. Especially to a director who believes mankind still tells stories around the fire at dusk, or after dinner, or before watching Euphoria, which Zendaya is also in, but more often. After all, as Flaubert said about writing Salammbô, “Few will guess how depressed one had to be to undertake the resuscitation of Carthage!” Same with the resuscitation of Dune, which already exists as a movie, a TV miniseries, and a documentary about a movie version that didn’t happen and should have. The futility and pointlessness of Villeneuve’s secondhand white-savior epic comes through as laziness. To understand that, we need only compare one scene from the 1984 David Lynch version to the same scene in the new one. In Villeneuve’s hand-in-the-painbox scene, nothing is charged with hidden meaning, and nothing seems painful to Timothée Chalamet’s Paul. It is not much of a trial for him, and all the work in the scene is done by Charlotte Rampling’s Bruce Conner Couch costume. We know Chalamet will not have a problem. It’s already clear he is “The One.” In Lynch’s version, which incidentally occurs in a movie that is not that great by the end but is at least very weird throughout, Kyle MacLachlan’s Paul seems genuinely frightened by being forced to put his hand deep inside a woman’s box. The viewer does not yet understand Paul’s status in this world, and there is no way to know what will happen when he places his hand in this trap. Where Lynch is hallucinatory, intense, and Freudian (or, in a word, hysterical), Villeneuve is dull and literal, and his scene is simply a test that allows the lead character to move up a level, like in a video game or a YA novel, which we knew he was going to do. Later in the movie, the idea that Chalamet could just speak in a certain tone of voice and other people would do exactly what he wanted them to do reminded me of Brooklyn teens ordering in restaurants. Lynch’s penile sandworms, pre-CGI, were better realized and more menacing, and the Harkonnens, whose name is now pronounced differently, were more disgusting in 1984. This Dune toys with the idea of genocide, but it’s mostly a movie for people who like to memorize things. All these stupid names, one after another. Frank Herbert was trying too hard. So is Villeneuve. This basic Lawrence of Arabia tribalism and its jihad-mongering, with its conflicted son and dangled possibility of revolution, were also aspects of Villeneuve’s equally ponderous Blade Runner sequel. Since these notions have already appeared in so many other twenty-first-century blockbusters, it is hard to ascribe them to Villeneuve-as-auteur, despite all the black water he dips them in before rolling them in the sand. Jackie Wilson said the Troubles were a wee bit of fun now, weren’t they? In our little house on our little street, which were fine for us when they were being bombed, we had perfect TV reception, and Pap (Ciarán Hinds) was twenty years younger than Granny (Judi Dench), who loved nothing more than winning acting awards. Pa (Jamie Dornan) was handsome and good, when he was around, and in perfect shape from those Fifty Shades of Grey sessions, and Ma (Caitríona Balfe) was such a put-upon knockout mommy like she was in Ford v Ferrari that she should have been in this a lot more, instead of it being such a Balfe fast. Our director, Kenneth Branagh, he loves Shakespeare and Agatha Christie and, yes, even Thor, which he reminds us of with a shot of a comic book, but in black-and-white, unlike the splashy Marvel comics in West Side Story, which is also set around the same time, has a lot of music in it, and is about two sides fighting a turf war. Belfast is in black and white so Branagh can separate it from his hack work, because it’s a personal story from his childhood, and because documentaries about the past are in black and white (or “monochrome,” as Netflix calls it now when promoting films like Passing), and Belfast takes place in the past and it’s about real things that happened. 2021 was a big year for b&w, and this movie falls in line with one of its current uses: telling stories for dads. Branagh’s explosion of treacle, with Jude Hill as a cuddly blond toddler, was the most popular. Mike Mills’s C’mon C’mon, with Joaquin Phoenix as a public radio producer shepherding a neurotic little kid (Woody Norman), was enervating to the point of narcolepsy, the opposite of what Branagh’s doing in Belfast. It was unlovable.  The best of these films, and therefore the most ignored, was Alexandre Rockwell’s Sweet Thing, in which his own daughter and son (Lana Rockwell and Nico Rockwell) are menaced by an alcoholic father, who Will Patton plays with every stop pulled out, a performance of total fucked-up-edness, a man trying to be nice before he loses it completely and swirls down the drain. Rockwell’s film also featured Van Morrison music like Belfast, but not in the same celebratory, uninhibited way. Sweet Thing is set in a kind of fairytale, skid-row present and shot in New Bedford, Massachusetts, without any cute Irishness, even though there’s no doubt some could have been located in the area. Sweet Thing confronted American racism and child abuse and cops shooting black kids, none of which were presented as fun like the Troubles in Belfast, though Rockwell placed them in a beautiful film where his use of black and white was justified and worked. It made Sweet Thing more immediate, not less. It was clearly a Gen X movie about childhood, in which Rockwell’s memories of freedom and neglect were poured into a constricted, dangerous present. Sweet Thing was also unlike Mills’s film, which took place coast to coast in Dullsville, U.S.A., and catered to and indulged kids while recapitulating white parental self-regard instead of exposing it like Rockwell did in his film. C’mon C’mon (terrible title) attempted to do that through documentary scenes with black parents and their children that struck me as well-intentioned cop-outs. It therefore made sense that Phoenix worked for NPR in it, but I don’t think that was the idea.  Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem are post-life versions of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in Being the Ricardos, spruced up and perfected by computers and surgeons to exist as animatronic forms whose ability to handle drama and comedy surpasses anything humans could do back in the 1950s. Creating these androids on his keyboard and in the studio must have been so difficult for Aaron Sorkin that he dropped his own mask and finally admitted it was entertainment, not politics, that has interested him all along. What else could explain the outright fabrications in this movie, which include a phone call from J. Edgar Hoover, in front of a live studio audience, that washes away Lucille Ball’s 1930s membership in the Communist Party and makes everyone cheer? This right-wing appeal to Hoover and the FBI is the opposite of Clint Eastwood’s in J. Edgar (2011), where Eastwood and Leonardo DiCaprio carefully outlined how a police state was created in the U.S. That Sorkin glosses the McCarthy Era like this and places himself to the right of Eastwood is surprising. But it makes sense, because no one in Hollywood is more aligned with the entertainment/tech industry/Washington politics nexus than the power-loving, success-worshipping, union-hating Sorkin. Somehow this extended to slighting Karl Freund, the German cinematographer of I Love Lucy, who invented the three-camera sitcom setup that’s still in use seventy years later. Why Sorkin chose to do that is also telling: it made Desi Arnaz look smarter, Sorkin’s goal with all his protagonists.  Jessica Chastain’s performance as Tammy Faye Bakker, disgraced televangelist wife and singer, borders on the monstrous. By the end it almost crosses over into a kind of American Fellini. It doesn’t, though, because The Eyes of Tammy Faye is a whitewash of this con artist’s life. Like her husband, Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield), Tammy Faye was a grifter who preyed on the homebound via broadcast TV, convincing them to send money so that their souls would be saved and they would go to Heaven. The Bakkers of course lived in luxury and built a Christian theme park with that money. No one at any time seems to have brought up that they were turning Jesus Christ into Mickey Mouse. Chastain and her screenwriter and director want us to believe Tammy Faye was an ambitious but God-fearing Christian puppeteer desperate to get out of her Minnesota hometown. The film excuses her, insisting her Christianity was deeper than that of her televangelist competitors—Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and their ilk. Though it is clear Tammy Faye empathized with gay men stricken with AIDS and tried to convince her followers to treat them as human beings, not as the pariahs the Reagan Right wanted them to be, this fact doesn’t exonerate her. As a Christian, it was the least she could do. Her second husband, a church builder and developer played in the film by Sam Jaeger, ran afoul of the law just like her first. The film, however, shows Tammy Faye alone at the end, toughing it out in a crap condo, not married to conman number two.  The fun here is supposed to be in watching Chastain transform from a cute, peppy, and horny Bible-college student in the late 1950s into the full-on, Divine-in-a-John-Waters-movie look of Tammy Faye’s infamy thirty years later. While she is never not a chipper cornball high on her own supply, she is never tragic, either, because like a Trump wife, she shits in a gold toilet. Garfield’s Jim is a closeted, prissy fake, yes, but Tammy Faye is a grotesque with a Betty-Boop-meets-Sarah-Palin voice, unhappy because she’s blinkered to reality. Through it all, the Bakkers’ audience of twenty million kept sending them money whenever Tammy asked. Though she did live in a life-size dollhouse, her fate was to become a national joke, not the heroine of an Ibsen play. King Richard demonstrates, step by step, the value of sticking to your plan, even if some folks think you’re crazy. I don’t mean Richard Williams’s plan to turn his daughters Venus and Serena into tennis champs. I mean Will Smith’s plan to win an Oscar. Williams, like the actor who plays him, knew the value of finely tuning a capitalist product and introducing it into the marketplace as a brand. This is a business movie, which reaches its height not when Venus Williams (Saniyya Sidney) almost wins her second professional match and reveals her talent and grace to the world, but when the Williams family decides to hold out for a better sneaker deal. “Nine months later,” we read on screen at the end of the movie, “Venus signed a contract with Reebok for twelve million dollars.” I don’t mind being nudged to cry as the Williams sisters’ reach for the stars in Compton. But I call “out” when I am asked to weep with joy over their first professional product endorsement. I did not quite get why the theater director protagonist (Hidetoshi Nishijima) in Drive My Car was not allowed by the theater company to drive himself to work every day. The idea that it would have been an insurance liability seemed odd. In any case, his 1987 red Saab 900 becomes essential to Hamaguchi’s film, and without it the rehearsals of Uncle Vanya that make up much of the rest of the drama would have been stifling. Not that the film is necessarily opened up by the driving, since a lot of that is interior: a man inside a car listening to the voice of his dead wife (Reika Kirishima) on tape while another woman (Tōko Miura) drives him around. Cars attained a strange new level of prominence in movies in 2021, an indicator of our changing relationship to the automotive as cars helped destroy the planet, became unaffordable as the pandemic continued, and sometimes burned and sank into the ocean. I don’t mean in F9, the latest Fast & Furious movie, in which a car travels into outer space, driven by Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris. F9, a truly stupid movie, wastes resources, just burns through them to make money, and part of its stupidity is that it makes room for Helen Mirren and Cardi B before explicitly comparing the idea of “family” to a 1970 Dodge Charger. That’s not it, Vin. Not at all. But it is not too far off from Julia Ducournau’s staggering Titane, a French film in which a woman (Agathe Rousselle) has sex with a Cadillac (baby, you can fuck my car), gets pregnant, and gives birth to a hybrid. As in Spencer and France, these films explored women’s relationships with their automobiles, putting them in the driver’s seat instead of men. Titane took this to an extreme that was maybe too much for car-centric North American viewers. It didn’t meet with the same outrage as David Cronenberg’s 1996 adaptation of J. G. Ballard’s Crash only because it came out during the pandemic, and the few people who saw it were rendered speechless. It was my favorite film of last year. Cars develop consciousness in these films. The way the voice of the wife returned, speaking through the Saab’s tape player in Drive My Car, pointed in that direction—the direction of getting over grief and loss as we try to return to life. It is a trend that began in art films with the talking limos in the garage at night that ended Leos Carax’s Holy Motors in 2012. In the recent King Car, an underseen Brazilian movie that is almost as good as Bacurau and has a lot in common with Titane, director Renata Pinheiro creates a revolutionary situation in Pernambuco, prompted by a talking car in a junkyard. Sex with vehicles ensues. “From this evolution there is no return,” King Car explains. Through intercourse with machines, in this contaminated environment, “we discover our true values. It’s where we face our ghosts.” These three films are the products of different cultures with different film traditions, but there is a direct line connecting the ghosts in each. Car accidents were way up in the U.S. last year. College students strapped for cash began living in their cars inside university parking garages, and reality TV shows staged deadly airborne car stunts. A show at the Museum of Modern Art called Automania put cars on display like in a showroom, parked safely away from the road. It was evident on movie screens, however, that the evolution of the automobile as a sexy, dangerous vehicle continues in new directions, and they are not driverless ones. Cars exert a different kind of control than that and have a tight hold on us, driving mankind. The in-reverse, out-of-gas moving truck scene in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza approaches driving from the opposite direction. It’s an anti-chase that glides backwards without a roar. Alana Haim guides the truck expertly, younger men nattering at her, threatening to choke her. The film becomes obsessed with the 1973 oil crisis, which is maybe why it’s so frenetic and high-energy. Characters are in motion and running—Haim runs so much in the film that it becomes like a parody of The Worst Person in the World. The adult men in Licorice Pizza are automotive maniacs, poor players strutting their hour in the movie, actors and directors playing actors and directors. Defined by nostalgia for 1970s California, Licorice Pizza is to 2021 what American Graffiti was to 1973, but from the other side of the mirror. Anderson’s 1970s beats George Lucas’s 1950s because Anderson is expressing a minority opinion, not celebrating a majority culture. American Graffiti existed as something it knew everyone who saw it would agree on. Licorice Pizza turns the camera around and speaks to the few. Thus, everything is backwards and wrong in Licorice Pizza, as it was in the 1970s when compared to now: children raise themselves, adults date teens, teens start businesses, restaurants alienate customers, and getting work is an audition for something else, with hidden, sexual motivations barely under the surface erupting as stupid jokes. It is impossible to know whether things are based on skill or luck as the world slips backwards into the future. Everything is temporary and can be snuffed in an instant, like the waterbed sales that reverse supply and demand overnight. The effect is that Licorice Pizza can never be central to the culture it is part of. That is its strength. It exists on the edge of Hollywood and is written in the margins of the film industry, adjacent to it, with an address in the Valley. This movie seems like a transitional film for Anderson, a stopgap, like so many things that emerged during the pandemic. And like the pandemic, it goes on too long but time flies. The melodrama in Pedro Almodóvar’s latest film is deceptively muted, though the film’s plot is brazenly manipulative. The director of All About My Mother makes it easy to guess how this story of thwarted motherhood will unfold as soon as Janis (Penélope Cruz) and Ana (Milena Smit), both pregnant, end up in the same hospital room. This concentration on the present-day mechanics of the plot buries the film’s parallel story, about mass killings in fascist Spain in the 1930s under Franco. Parallel Mothers is a film of corpses and skeletons as much as it is about babies and children. Almodóvar leads the viewer to an excavation the same way Janis leads Ana to understand the history of her country. Unlike the story of what happened at the hospital, it should not come as a surprise to her. Almodóvar has always dug up whatever is buried in the subconscious of his characters. As they fall into comas, we find they have been raised in caves or that their family history is hidden below the surface in a mass grave. From film to film, his characters’ psychological states come more and more to resemble the political history of Spain. At the same time, his filmmaking, like Penélope Cruz, does not age. He seems more contemporary the more he becomes an outlier to the mainstream of commercial cinema. Billy Wilder told Almodóvar there was one thing he should never do, and that was to give in to the temptation to make a film in Hollywood. Almodóvar has made twenty-two films since his first in 1980, and now we learn he is on the verge of making his first feature in English, with Cate Blanchett. Either it is time for him to show us how it’s done, or this is a bad idea. Over forty years, we’ve learned from his films that things usually don’t go so well, but it’s foolish not to be optimistic. As things fall apart, at least they can look great. That is a lesson Maggie Gyllenhaal did not keep in mind as she adapted Elena Ferrante’s novel The Lost Daughter for the big screen (Netflix). In Almodóvar’s Julieta, two actresses played the same woman twenty or so years apart, as Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley do here. Where Almodóvar dressed his seaside tale in 1980s New Wave colors and Hitchcockian ambiance, Gyllenhaal’s beach melodrama is a new kind of arthouse film for home viewing, in which seriousness of intent must be signaled at all times. Through flashbacks, Gyllenhaal makes the bizarre or mysterious elements of the film too clear, right up to the end, when everything goes haywire in the opposite direction, and it becomes hard to understand what’s happening. Colman phones her daughter and bleeds into the tide with an orange in her hand, a stew of symbols assembled from previous scenes.  The problem is the flashbacks. We see Buckley as the young Colman, an English professor and a harried mother and wife embarking on an affair with a colleague who is supposed to be brilliant. Played by Peter Sarsgaard to resemble late-period Michael Stipe, this sensitive, bearded academic cracks jokes about Pierre Bourdieu and Paul Ricœur (a first for Netflix). It is therefore obvious in a second why the middle-aged Colman feels such guilt for abandoning her family. Still discombobulated years later, she vacations in Greece next to a sketchy, semi-Mafia family like the one that lives across the street from me. She finds herself dancing to “Livin’ on a Prayer” by night and translating Dante into English by day, two strange activities we didn’t expect from her or anyone this year. The film follows the Chekhov gun rule, but with a hatpin Colman gives to shady, unstable Dakota Johnson. It was only a matter of time before Johnson returned it.  The movies force us to ask questions. Seeing The Eyes of Tammy Faye right after Nightmare Alley prompted a brain teaser, since the two films share a scene: Would you rather see Jessica Chastain give Andrew Garfield a hand job in a bathtub, or see Toni Collette do the same to Bradley Cooper? That was the old-timey con-woman convincer move, as far as Hollywood was concerned last year.  Guillermo Del Toro’s remake of Nightmare Alley corrupts an evil story. William Lindsay Gresham’s terrifying and singular 1946 novel was itself a tale of corruption and the great sui generis work of hardboiled American fiction. Its plot did not need to be tampered with, but Del Toro and Kim Morgan’s screenplay cheapens something that purposefully dealt in tawdriness. Since this film comes close to being Del Toro’s best, it is too bad he had to throw out the penultimate sections of the book. I mark it down to his essential torturer’s mentality. His flaw as a screenwriter-director-producer it that he thinks of himself as a great liberal and friend of the common man, but he can’t not revel in the infliction of pain and suffering on his villains. So instead of just making the millionaire industrialist Grindle (Richard Jenkins) a vindictive and deluded mark for Cooper’s fake mentalist, Stan, Del Toro has to turn Grindle into a serial killer who must be beaten to death, and then have Grindle’s bodyguard (Holt McCallany) run over by a car, in graphic detail. In Gresham’s novel, Grindle becomes Stan’s Javert, the figure who hunts him, turning him into a drunk, a hobo, and finally the thing he most fears becoming, a carnival circus geek. Here I must indulge in psychoanalysis, like Cate Blanchett’s character does in the movie. In fact, I suspect on some level Del Toro wants the viewer to. I put his cruelty down to his subconscious identification with Grindle more than Stan. At some level, Del Toro recognizes himself in this wealthy sociopath, an aspect of his personality he wants to punish and kill, harshly. There is no mercy there. That kind of unnecessary cruelty continues to mar his serious work, as it did in The Shape of Water. Otherwise, Del Toro’s Nightmare Alley is a model of atmosphere and production design, with beautiful, committed performances from character actors who were given great roles, most of all Collette, Jenkins, McCallany, David Strathairn, Willem Dafoe, Mary Steenburgen, and Tim Blake Nelson, though if Nelson and Dafoe had swapped roles, the film would have ended with an extra dash of evil, turning it more hardboiled and more Detour-esque, a tale of fate more than gore. With the menacing Dafoe as the guy doing Stan the worst favor at the end, and Nelson the creep who got him into it in the first place, the balance would have tilted in the direction of eternity, or at least hell, where Del Toro thrives, poking away with his pitchfork. In all the film industry talk about how Nightmare Alley and Steven Spielberg’s new version of West Side Story underperformed at the box office, and how that proves audiences are uninterested in seeing non-franchise films by high-end directors in theaters, no one seems to have considered that both remakes are period pieces, and that the original films, when they came out, were not. They took place in the present of the time they were made. So maybe it is something else the audience has rejected. Cigarettes aside, Spielberg’s film is marvelous, an improvement on Robert Wise’s 1961 film version of the Bernstein-Sondheim musical. That one was distinguished by Daniel Fapp’s stunning, Tashlinesque color cinematography as much as by the music. Unfortunately, there was not much Fapp could do with the brownface the actors playing the Sharks and their girls were forced to wear by the producers.  Though it is better than that, and maybe Spielberg’s second or third best movie, it nonetheless feels academic somehow, the large cast a jobs program for theater kids, the gentrification theme something I don’t believe Spielberg cares about in the least or has any experience with. Tony Kushner’s rewrite of Arthur Laurents’s original book for the show is quite convincing, however, as Spielberg goes bravura immediately, with a Kane-esque crane shot (computerized) through the ruins of the neighborhood that became Lincoln Center. This shot links the opening to so much in Spielberg’s previous work. It is a set piece from a war film, reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler’s List, and of course, Lincoln, since a sign enters the frame that says LINCOLN in huge letters. Once again, all history is the same to Spielberg, a teenage gang war in Manhattan the equivalent of World War II, 1961 the same as 1941.  Doing mid-century modern and crime jazz, Spielberg remains obvious. After an astonishing overhead shot of mounds of salt in a municipal salt shed as gang members approach in shadows from both sides, Spielberg has to have one of the gang members shout, “It’s salt! For when the streets ice up!” Because after all these years he still thinks his audience is not the brightest, and all the world is the mass audience to him. As the song “Tonight” has it in the movie, “The world was just an address,” a lyric that never sounded so fatalistic to me until I heard it in a Spielberg movie in 2022, with the wealth gap widening and pushing all but the richest people out of this city. Spielberg moves “Gee, Officer Krupke” indoors, to a police station waiting room, which works better and makes more sense than the nighttime storefront in Wise’s film. More importantly, every decision Spielberg has made to open the film into the city streets works magnificently in this last-gasp movie of joyous urban life, all of it perfectly executed and choreographed with great verve and beauty. His Maria (Rachel Zegler) is more soulful than Natalie Wood was in the earlier film. With her Barbara Steele or Soledad Miranda looks, she fits into this film without a happy ending, adding to the sense that things will not work out, that the lovers are doomed along with the freedom their access to the city promised. There was always a bit of 1960s horror in this operatic tragedy. Then, it was the predictive horror of youth in revolt. Somehow the director of Jaws found it on location, in some small way, like he did in Martha’s Vineyard half a lifetime ago. He gives in to it. There is no future for these lovers, no way to fight against what is happening to them and their neighborhood. Jonathan Larson’s life was tragic. Cut short by an aortic dissection in 1996 just as his musical, Rent, was about to open to great success on Broadway, he’d written Tick, Tick . . . Boom! in 1991, but it was only performed twice in his lifetime. Now Lin-Manuel Miranda has turned this autobiographical musical into a Netflix movie starring Andrew Garfield as Larson. As in CODA, we hear “Happy Birthday” performed, because these films are about the birth of artists in their quest for musical theater acclaim. Both films have a desperate, fleeing quality, which posits that seeking artistic success is difficult and punishing, too hard on others around you, and a race against time. In the hands of Miranda and Garfield, this becomes a form of desperation in which every song is forced out as a last-ditch effort. Near the end, when Michael (Robin de Jesus), Larson’s best friend and roommate, discovers he has AIDS and sings, on the verge of tears, “Is this real life?,” the answer is yeah, but no. That’s because show biz dreams swamp social reality every time, even in scenes that pit them against each other. Part of Larson’s story is that in the late ’80s he wrote an elaborate sci-fi musical called Superbia that was excellent but too complex to be staged. In Miranda’s movie we see a bare-bones preview of it performed for critics, investors, and Stephen Sondheim (Bradley Whitford). In the context of 2021 and Netflix, Larson-Garfield’s description of Superbia in this performance takes on an added resonance. Superbia, he explains, “is a satire set in the future on a poisoned planet Earth, where the vast majority of humanity spend their entire lives just staring at the screens of their media transmitters, watching the tiny elite of the rich and powerful who film their own fabulous lives like TV shows.” Including this can be read as either a pitch for Netflix to make another Larson movie or an example of how capitalism and spectacle absorb everything. Rest assured, however, that if Netflix did make it, they would probably hire Ben Wheatley to direct it, which would prevent anyone from enjoying and absorbing it. What we have here is the kind of movie André Bazin called a “superwestern,” which is “a western that would be ashamed to be just itself, and looks for some additional interest to justify its existence—an aesthetic, sociological, moral, psychological, political, or erotic interest, in short some quality extrinsic to the genre and which is supposed to enrich it.” Doubly true in this case, because in Jane Campion’s Power of the Dog, her lead character (Benedict Cumberbatch), the ruthless cowboy with the non-ruthless name “Phil,” is exactly that—ashamed to be just himself. Phil is a repressed gay man in a macho profession, needling his weaker brother (Jesse Plemons), who has married a woman (Kirsten Dunst) Phil considers a slattern. Dunst’s greenhorn son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) notices this and contrives to eliminate Phil from the ranch. Here it’s the opposite of the situation in the superwestern Shane (1953). Instead of “Shane, come back, my mother wants you,” its “Phil, go away, my mother doesn’t want you.” As a Netflix art film, a perfect breeding ground for a movie like this, it is also super-serious, like The Lost Daughter. Similarly, the film’s ambition leads to confusion. Again, the ending is murky. A lasso soaked in anthrax is something new in a western, it has to be admitted, but getting to that point was a slog, a slow crawl to the Oscars. In a non-superwestern, somebody on the ranch would have smacked Phil in the mouth in the first scene. Though he is threatening and mean-eyed, he is no Liberty Valance, and his needling of the other characters is intolerable and obvious. The way he keeps talking about “Bronco Henry,” his absent mentor who we are led to believe was also his lover, is repetitive and tiresome. On the ranch it would have become a source of humor. Phil’s banjo duel with Dunst’s poor piano playing, in fact, is more like something from Blazing Saddles than Unforgiven. Most damningly for this film that is so subtly concerned with right and wrong, Campion’s use of New Zealand in place of Montana and a British actor for a ranch boss is the moral equivalent of computer-generated imagery. That brings it back to Bazin, where it should end. Ultimately, Campion’s portrait of a repressed cowboy, I think, flatters Hollywood. Varmints like Phil may or may not have tamed the West, but for sure they continued on to Los Angeles to found talent agencies and direct superhero movies. Joel Coen’s black-and-white film of the Scottish play is not made for an age when the TV remote and the smartphone are pointed toward your hand. More like a silent movie by Lang or Dreyer, this Apple TV production overwhelms Shakespeare with monolithic sets, powerful compositions, and piercing cries. Frances McDormand as Lady M. and Denzel Washington in the title role struggle to keep up with the mise-en-scène, while Kathryn Hunter, an amazing actor I do not remember seeing before, plays all three witches and the Old Man in tour-de-force performances that minimize digital trickery but still get lost in Coen’s frames. It was inevitable that this version would be compared to Orson Welles’s. His cheapo 1948 Macbeth for Republic Studios is better because it isn’t as distant as Coen’s, despite being seventy-three years older, but it’s more awesome, with more cold terror and high drama. Welles goes for it, as usual, while Coen’s film is something of an exercise. As for being the first film from a brother act minus one, even with Shakespeare writing the screenplay, this movie certifies Ethan’s value. When the best thing in a Coen film is a long sword fight, something is missing, and The Tragedy of Macbeth is a movie where we can pinpoint what it was.

"Mar 28, 2022",positive," Warner Bros. and Denis Villenueve both have a lot riding on Dune, the latest stab at adapting Frank Herbert’s seminal novel for the big screen. The last time the epic sci-fi was made into a movie it flopped hard at the box office, as did Villenueve’s Blade Runner 2049; the filmmaker’s most recent attempt at reinventing a decades-old classic for modern audiences. The fact Dune‘s title card has a ‘Part One’ prefix signals right from the beginning that the director has no intention of telling a complete story, which is the single greatest and most glaring weakness of a film packed top-to-bottom with strengths. Of course, nobody knew that the pandemic would come along and decimate the entire entertainment industry, but it’s a bold and downright risky move opting to spend $165 million on a star-studded blockbuster that doesn’t have an ending. Dune has been called unfilmable on plenty of occasions, and you’ll likely be less than ten minutes into the 155-minute running time before you decide whether or not the story is going to be up your street. Opening any film with a voiceover that delivers exhausting exposition is a gambit, but the incredible visual style on display from the very first frame offsets the dry info dumps about Arrakis, spice, the Houses of Harkonnen and Atreides, Fremen and all the rest. Make no mistake about it; Dune is a dense, complex and incredibly ambitious slice of Hollywood spectacle, one that might not be for everyone. However, if you immerse yourself into the richly-detailed world and allow the sheer scope of this thing to wash over you, the end result is comfortably one of the most distinctive and unique studio-backed titles to come along in a long time. Trying to condense the plot of Dune is a fool’s errand, but in the broadest of strokes, it’s a classic Hero’s Journey right out of the Joseph Campbell playbook. Timothee Chalamet’s Paul Atreides is the son of Oscar Isaac’s Duke Leto, and they’ve just been appointed by the Imperium empire to assume command of operations on Arrakis. Paul has continuous dreams that may be prophetic in nature, with Zendaya’s Fremen Chani a recurring figure in all of them. As it turns out, the House of Atreides has been lured into a planetary ambush by the Harkonnen, forcing Paul and his mother Lady Jessica to flee into the desert, all while the young man wrestles with the destiny of being Muad’Dib, essentially the Chosen One of the Fremen. If that doesn’t sound like your bag, then there’s really no point in watching Dune at all, because huge swathes of the narrative are dedicated to characters talking about political machinations, prophecies, double-crosses, disbelievers and the like. On a technical level, though, Dune is never anything less than spectacular and often outright astounding. Villenueve is one of the best visualists in the business, and when you marry that to Greig Fraser’s stunning cinematography and an understated yet still sweeping Hans Zimmer score, it’s always a feast for the eyes and ears. Early comparisons to Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars sounded lofty, but they’re not entirely accurate, either. Dune is a much different type of movie, and while it shares plenty of DNA with those aforementioned classics in terms of expanding its mythology and laying the groundwork for what’s to come, Villenueve isn’t so much interested in action sequences or a stirring sense of adventure as he is in treating everything with the utmost seriousness, solemnity and thematic weight. Luckily, the cast are about as uniformly excellent as you’d imagine given their pedigree. Chalamet makes for a well-rounded protagonist even if he does flirt with bratty territory once or twice, with Isaac and Josh Brolin furrowing their brows and letting their gruff charisma shine. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista do veer a little into the one-dimensional side of things, which will likely be rectified should we get that Dune: Part Two, with Jason Momoa providing the only real levity and lightness of touch as Duncan Idaho, regularly popping up to steal scenes thanks to his easygoing natural charisma. Another issue with Dune is the pacing; it’s a long movie that very much feels like a long movie at points, but at least it’s frequently punctuated by grandstanding scenes of great actors doing great acting, intricately-choreographed fight sequences or some classic CGI destruction on an intergalactic scale. As an experience, it’s unlike anything else you’ll see this year, and Villenueve wasn’t lying when he said you won’t get anything close to the best of Dune if you watch it at home. Circling back to this beginning of this review, just to reiterate that a lot of people are going to find the ending of Dune infuriating. For two and a half hours, Villenueve’s awe-inspiring effort has been building towards Paul finally meeting Chani and becoming the man he was always destined to be… and then it ends. Calling a movie Part One is fine if Part Two is already guaranteed to happen, but Warner Bros. have made it clear that finishing the story is entirely dependent on how the first half fares at the box office. If the numbers aren’t up to scratch, then Dune will always have an asterisk next to its name as 50% of what it wanted to be, so let’s hope that audiences turn up in their droves to see it this weekend."
"Mar 26, 2022",negative,"A dishwater war narrative masquerading as sci-fi.
Pshaw."
"Mar 23, 2022",positive," The desire to acknowledge mainstream movies alongside typical Oscar fare isn’t a new development: From The Dark Knight’s Best Picture snub inspiring a rule change to the nearly implemented Popular Film award, the Academy wants the best of both worlds. But the focus on the fan-voted awards and the hype that surrounded No Way Home potentially sneaking into this year’s Best Picture race have ignored the giant sandworm in the room. There’s already an epic, immersive, crowd-pleasing tentpole up for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, and Dune doesn’t just deserve a seat at the table. An ambitious spectacle with a level of craftsmanship comparable to The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Mad Max: Fury Road, Dune winning Best Picture is exactly what the Academy needs: a blockbuster celebrating the inimitable, awe-inspiring power of the big screen that everyone can get behind.  The critical and commercial success of Dune was hardly a sure thing. Celebrated auteurs have twice tried to make a movie out of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel. The first attempt, from Alejandro Jodorowsky, was never completed—though its failure was turned into a documentary—while David Lynch disavowed his fascinatingly flawed adaptation that made it to the screen. But these high-profile setbacks didn’t deter Denis Villeneuve, whose impressive CV of big-budget genre filmmaking includes a worthy, sumptuous sequel to Blade Runner. If someone was going to crack the code to Dune, Villeneuve seemed a good bet.  Villeneuve’s solution was to split Dune into two films, a move that would give the political machinations of Herbert’s dense, sprawling text more time to breathe. That Villeneuve made this decision without the guarantee of a sequel was quite the flex, but Dune: Part Deux was put in an even more precarious position when the pandemic arrived and WarnerMedia controversially elected to have all its 2021 theatrical releases simultaneously available to stream on HBO Max. Villeneuve voiced his frustrations with the company in a scathing Variety op-ed in which he extolled the virtues of the theatrical experience and how essential it was for Dune. But reading between the lines of his column, you could also sense the palpable anxiety that a half-completed Dune would become one of cinema’s greatest what-ifs. (A what-if that was partially self-inflicted, no less.) Of course, there’s no longer any concern about the franchise’s future: The sequel is happening. And the fact that Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures made the announcement within days of Dune’s release spoke volumes of Villeneuve backing up his big talk with a very big movie.  Dune made an impression before a single frame was even shown on screen, as the discordant sounds of the Sardaukar—their garbled words translating to “Dreams are messages from the deep”—set the tone for a jarring, transportive experience. In an era of cinematic universes that pander to audiences with familiarity, there’s a lot to admire about Villeneuve’s confidence in his own, uncompromising vision—and that viewers will go along for the ride. It helps that the special effects spared no expense. The sandworms are as unfathomably enormous as advertised, underlining that, despite the expanse of barren desert on Arrakis, the planet is very much alive. The dead-of-night siege perpetrated by House Harkonnen against House Atreides was laced with apocalyptic dread, as hulking ships descended from the pitch-black sky to raze everything in their wake. Throw in Hans Zimmer’s booming, Oscar-nominated score, which in certain theaters rattles your seat like a plane going through turbulence, and you can understand why Villeneuve was so insistent that Dune had to be seen on the big screen.  Dune winning Best Picture won’t save theaters, and it probably won’t halt the Oscars’ ratings slide. But in adapting one of science fiction’s most iconic—and notoriously unadaptable—novels into a blockbuster with artistry, gravitas, and a battalion of movie stars to bring it to life, Villeneuve has created something special. Dune is an antidote to stale, familiar franchises, and a breathtaking reminder of why we love movies the way they’re meant to be seen. With the Academy fretting about the waning popularity of its award show, and an industry continuing to reckon with the ever-shifting tides of the pandemic, the Oscars can do much worse than embracing desert power.  Rachel and Callie discuss the Bravo news of the week and dive into some recent episodes. Then, Jodi hops on to talk ‘The Valley’ and ‘Vanderpump Rules.’"
"Mar 13, 2022",positive," Whatever your entertainment needs, we got your back (and hopefully your mind) with Queerty’s weekly “Culture Club” column with some of the highlights of new releases, streaming shows, classics worth revisiting, and what to drink while you watch. If Lawrence of Arabia director David Lean ever made a sci-fi movie, it would probably look a lot like Dune, possibly the most ambitious genre movie since Lord of the Rings. Director Denis Villeneuve cements his place as one of the rising auteurs with his adaption of Frank Herbert’s classic novel about commerce and political machinations in the year 10,191. The sprawling cast list and labyrinthine plot aren’t easy to condense, though the basic gist is thus: in the future, mankind has colonized a huge portion of the universe using a chemical spice as a means of space travel. Said spice is only found on one planet, and two ruling clans vie for control: the brutal Harkonnen, led by a sociopathic Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), and the egalitarian Atreides, led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Amid the conflict, Leto’s son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) begins to experience prophetic visions, suggesting he could be a long-prophesied super-being. If nothing else, Dune wins its place as a masterpiece of adaptation, truncating roughly half the novel into its runtime to expand the book’s monomaniacal focus on Paul into a more ensemble narrative. Villeneuve also updates some of the novel’s dated elements, racially and gender-diversifying the cast, and eliminating the book’s homophobia. Herbert’s novel portrays the Baron as an incidental homosexual—something the 1984 film version by David Lynch radically amped-up (seriously…it’s one of the most homophobic movies ever made, folks). Here, Villeneuve keeps the Baron’s sexuality subtle, but evident. Chalamet again proves himself one of the best actors of his generation in the lead, while supporting players David Dastmalchian (as a creepy human calculator called a “mentat”) and Sharon Duncan-Brewster (as a native paleontologist), almost steal the movie outright. With a visual style that resembles a National Geographic from the distant future—brightly-lit images that look totally real, even when CGI—as well as scenes of Chalamet and Isaac scantily clad, we recommend seeing Dune in IMAX wherever possible. The movie is an epic reminder of how magical the cinematic experience can be, and one of the best films of the year. Director Rachel Boynton examines American polarization over politics and racial history in this excellent new documentary. In Civil War Boynton travels across the country examining how opinions—and indeed, teaching history—of the Civil War and racism vary by geography. In the South, schools tend to teach that slavery and racism had little to do with the war itself, which, they say, was started by northern states wishing to subjugate the south (forget that whole bit about the South seceding from the Union, but nevermind). Residents there, meanwhile, romanticize the Confederacy as a sort of Utopia undone by federal government overreach. Contrast that with the North, where states do teach that the war resulted from disputes over slavery, but don’t always address the issues of systemic racism and bias that still affect African-Americans to this day. It would be easy to dismiss Civil War as a work trying to shame the south and nationwide white complacency, but Boynton’s camera paints a far more complicated picture. In a masterstroke, the director opts to interview school children of varied ages and races to discuss their own impressions of the Civil War and racism in America. That leads to some very moving passages of personal testimony. Furthermore, Civil War argues that our current age of “alternative facts,” Fox News and OAN has much older roots dating from Reconstruction: the Union might have won the war, and slavery might have been abolished, but the South won the aftermath, finding ways to continue to subjugate African-Americans and keep the racist spirit of the Confederacy alive. It’s a must-see for anyone concerned over racial justice in the United States today, and anyone wondering how politics have become so polarized. Queer actor Misha Osherovich leads this new young adult horror series about three teenagers battling a mysterious cult and monsters from another dimension. The series follows a group of teenagers in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Carrie (Stefanie Scott), escapes a supernatural cult that has held her captive most of her life, and joins forces with Nolan (Osherovich) and Tasha (Sofia Bryant) to elude Arthur (Will Yun Lee), a fellow cult member tasked with capturing Carrie. Yet, as the three engage in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, malevolent spirits begin to plague the town, threatening to destroy everyone and everything. Fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer-style horror and occultism will have a ball watching Girl in the Woods. For queer viewers, the show also offers a good deal of empathy, fleshing out Nolan’s story of questioning gender and sexuality, as well as enduring homophobic harassment. Indeed, as played by Osherovich, Nolan feels the most fleshed-out of all the characters, and his/their storyline also has the most emotional resonance. Besides, it’s a lot of fun to see a queer character on a monster-slaying adventure. Ridiculous, if touching, we give the series our recommendation for Osherovich’s performance, and Nolan’s storyline. Director Daniel Sánchez López’s festival favorite arrives on streaming this week, inviting viewers to indulge in its meditations on male on male love. Boy Meets Boy follows Harry (Matthew James Morrison) a hard-partying Londoner about to leave Berlin to return home. Two days before his departure, he meets Johannes (Alexandros Koutsoulis), another handsome man that offers to help him print his boarding pass. The two begin a wandering journey together in search of a printer, and along the way, explore their mutual attraction. Marketing materials for Boy Meets Boy market it as a sort of queer answer to Before Sunrise, and in general, we agree with that assessment. The entire movie hinges on the chemistry between Morrison and Koutsoulis, and the two establish a very strong, erotic rapport with one another. On the other hand, the story itself has very little in the way of action—most scenes consist of Harry and Johannes engaging in long conversations about love, sex and queer life. That makes for a talky movie in general, though we did find López’s dialogue both sharp and astute. Boy Meets Boy doesn’t exactly break new ground as cinema, though it does feature a sincere, romantic story, and hint that López, Morrison and Koutsoulis all have bright careers ahead. Give the film a watch—we think you’ll agree. The world of legitimate theatre returns at last, and this touring company of the classic Lerner & Lowe musical welcomes LGBTQ audiences this week with a special reception. For the uninitiated: My Fair Lady adapts queer playwright George Bernard Shaw’s play Pygmalion as a musical. Low-class flower seller Eliza Doolittle dreams of one day living a more charmed life. Speech professor Henry Higgins thinks he can help Doolittle accomplish her goal—simply by teaching her proper manners and elegant speech, which will grant her class mobility. The two develop a complicated friendship as they set about passing Eliza off as royalty…and discovering that men and women needn’t be lovers to have a relationship. Ok, we’re going on record now by saying, contrary to conventional opinion, there is zero romance between Eliza and Higgins. George Bernard Shaw would agree with us, and wrote several essays explaining why. Chief among our reasons (and one implied by Shaw): Higgins is actually gay, and while Eliza may protest that he doesn’t treat her like a lady, she comes to see his larger point: he wants to treat her as an equal. Keep that rumination in mind while watching this lush new production, directed by Barlett Sher who originally helmed it as a 2018 Broadway Revival. Queer audience members should also take note of a special reception this week, held at the nearby Hard Rock Cafe, which will feature a pre-show mixer, complimentary hors d’oeuvres and a cash bar. Come enjoy some refreshment, meet a cultured new friend, and take in a night of classic—and queer—theatre. Comedy troupe The Queer Agenda returns with its latest comedy sketch this week, a satire of straight criticisms of LGBTQ people. “Cis-Hets in Queertown” imagines a world where queer people comprise the majority, and have to put up with the icky affections of seeing straight people (gasp) show affection or (double gasp) marry and have families. It’s a cathartic laugh for those of us who have had to (groan) listen to the same kind of ridiculous vitriol from straight people our whole lives. Queer recording artist Ryals drops his new album this week, a song cycle inspired by loss of a parent, navigating a foreign society, and enduring a life of homophobia. Far from the downbeat tunes the subject matter would imply, Ryals has composed an energized and sassy compilation of synth-pop, electronica and sexy dance tracks about resilience and personal inspiration. Our favorite track: the piano ballad “My Days,” about filling loneliness with hook-ups and suffering imposter syndrome when successful. The composition and Ryals wailing vocals recall Lady Gaga’s “You & I.” Electronic artist Sofi Vonn releases the video to her latest single this week, a meditation on finding a deep, abiding relationship in a world driven by hook-up culture. With a combination of pop-dance beats and Vonn’s rich, soulful vocals the song inspires us to want to dance in the sun with someone beautiful. That, folks, is not a bad thing. In honor of Drag Race alum Manila Luzon releasing her own line of SERV pineapple vodka this week, we’ve obtained this exclusive cocktail recipe from the queen herself. Fruity and potent, it has the flavors of a tropical cosmopolitan, perfect for sipping alongside any of this week’s Culture Club selections. We can't rely on mainstream media to tell our stories. That's why we don't lock Queerty articles behind a paywall. Will you support our mission with a contribution today? Hi! I’m apparently the anti-wikidBSTN! I’m very much into the Sci-Fi or Fantasy-Mythology genres, but Lord of the Rings left me feeling meh and DUNE was the very first book I ever couldn’t finish. I hope you get your wish for the movie. It’s always nice when a childhood favorite book becomes an internationally popular movie. The south could certainly use more shaming and white complacency in America really can’t be touched on enough, but thank goodness there’s a “touching” part to comfort the viewer.  Are high? Higgins isn’t the least bit concerned about Doolittle’s goal. She is but an experiment to him. He recognizes his work will help her perhaps get a job in a flower shop, but that is a meaningless side effect of his plan to show off how great a teacher he can be. Civil War sounds like it could be an important documentary but I doubt the people who most need to see it will. Millions–most?–Americans still think Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, effective January 1, 1863, ended slavery even though it was the Union Army, which included hundreds of thousands of Black soldiers, that defeated the Confederacy decisively in 1865 to end slavery de facto, and the 13th Amendment, passed by Congress and ratified by 27 of 38 US states in December 1865, that ended chattel slavery de jure. The US did not even publicly commemorate the 150th anniversary of the end of this momentous war, the most violent and deadly on US soil, which suggests how unresolved the issues it represented still are."
"Mar 10, 2022",positive," There are waves in the sand, and they're moving. Your mind is not playing tricks on you, though the thought might pop into your head while you're immersed in the engulfing landscapes of “Dune,” Denis Villeneuve's transporting, richly textured adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi novel about political intrigue, what it means to be a leader, and things that go bump in the sand. Any concerns this reviewer might have had about the “Sicario” auteur's ability to tackle the source material's dense and complex meditation on lust for power and violent backstabbings were promptly allayed by the confident mise en scene and effortless worldbuilding. It bears the French Canadian director's trademark gravity, but not in a way that it becomes overbearing or numbing as it sometimes has been. There are even moments of levity. Could this possibly be the same storyteller known for his pessimistic worldview? Believe it. The 54-year-old filmmaker reportedly wanted to make a piece of pop entertainment that both cinephiles and Joe Moviegoer could dig. Mission accomplished. At least for now. Let's call this massive movie ride by its original, and more honest, title: “Dune: Part One.” Villeneuve, working from a screenplay credited to him, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, has opted to cover roughly the first half of the book, delivering a final cut that clocks in at 155 minutes. It feels just right to this sci-fi nerd, but more on that later. There's an inevitable sense of déjà vu that comes with seeing the story of young, gifted, troubled Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and the baptism by fire that might just make a leader out of him. After all, David Lynch had a go at it in the 1980s. While the results there were far messier and more erratic, I still have a soft spot for his gaudy vision. Blame Kyle MacLachlan's Pisces energy and Sting's scenery chewing. Temptation was purposely resisted to revisit the 1984 film prior to seeing the 2021 production. What's most striking about Villeneuve's more reined-in reimagining is that despite the distant future setting, and all the thrillingly rendered technology that goes with it, this “Dune” feels thoroughly old-fashioned. It often plays like an early CinemaScope sword-and-sandal epic in space opera drag. There's no attempt to 'roid things up to appeal to a younger demographic. This filmmaking team has astutely intuited that if you assemble this machine right, people will be drawn in regardless of aesthetic preferences. You won't need a glossary to guide you along. Everything is laid out with the kind of clarity that is too often taken for granted. Paul's dad, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, rocking some mighty facial hair), accepts the stewardship of Arrakis, a desert planet known as a sparsely populated wasteland. It is also the source of “the spice,” a photogenic grain with manifold qualities, including making space navigation possible. The drug also enhances mental abilities in a way that makes real-world hallucinogens feel like Tylenol. A family of noble lineage, with plenty of enemies, is tasked with overseeing the celestial body that houses the most coveted substance in this interplanetary empire. What could possibly go wrong?

The film alternates between scenes showing Paul —withdrawn, brooding, haunted by visions that look uncannily like Arrakis — interacting with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), his devoted father and those in their immediate orbit, and those that introduce us to the miscreants plotting to swoop in and ruin the Atreides clan's ambitious plans. That would be Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, bearing a possibly coincidental resemblance to a certain political figure) and his nephew, Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista). Thrown into the mix is Reverend Mother Mohiam (a shrewdly cast Charlotte Rampling), member of an exclusive sisterhood trained to hone abilities that some look down upon as witchcraft, but whose gift for backdoor wheeling and dealing can turn the tide in the minefield that the Atreides family is about to enter. Mohiam, still miffed at Jessica for reasons revolving around Paul and Leto, is unsure as to how Paul fits into her plans. In a squirm-inducing scene, she tests his ability to withstand pain.

Leto has big plans for his son, as does his mother, but as the attractive household leaves their ocean-rich planet for the arid sands of Arrakis, it becomes clear Paul might be destined for even greater things. The iconography in the desert planet, with its tribal culture and territorial disputes, brings to mind the Arab world, both during the time of T.E. Lawrence and its contemporary unrest. Add the way Paul is regarded by the native residents, or Fremen, as a messianic figure who would fulfill a prophecy, and that could make some viewers look at Chalamet's scrawny aristocrat as a white savior. But it's clear Villeneuve aims to highlight the character's insecurity, his trepidation that he might fall short of the duties that will be asked of him. When the other shoe drops narrative-wise, there's a controlled grandeur to the chaos. There are few surprises from a storytelling viewpoint, but it's all executed with such airtight precision that we can't help but be swept along. There's an adolescent earnestness that, coupled with the prowess behind the camera, results in a viewing experience that is at once comforting and oddly endearing. Also, those sandworms are about as spectacular as promised. (Man, they're big.) Kudos to cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette for sustaining a chiaroscuro look that makes every surface so tactile. This is sci-fi made with chops and conviction, and as such, it never comes across as filmmaking by committee the way other franchises frequently do.

Mature yet juvenile, otherworldly yet pleasingly familiar, “Dune” demands to be experienced on the biggest screen you can find (sandworms!). Yes, I'm aware it's on HBO Max for a limited time, but if you have resumed going to the theaters, take the plunge. After all, personal filmmaking on such a massive scale only comes across once in a blue moon. (Isn't that so, Peter Jackson?) That big, fat grin I had plastered on my face never faded. Denis Villeneuve's “Dune” is now playing in wide release, including IMAX engagements at AMC Aventura Mall, AMC Sunset Place, Regal Cinemas South Beach, and the granddaddy of them all, AutoNation IMAX at the Museum of Discovery and Science in Fort Lauderdale. It is also available to stream on HBO Max for the next 30 days, but it's so much better on the big screen.

"Mar 10, 2022",positive," When you read a lot of genre fiction, or even regular literary fiction that leans toward the complex, you hear the word ""unadaptable"" a lot. Tons of Stephen King books are ""unadaptable."" Thomas Pynchon is ""unadaptable."" House of Leaves is ""unadaptable."" For decades, Frank Herbert's audacious science fiction masterwork Dune was considered unadaptable, and then, in 1984, David Lynch's attempt proved that to be more or less true. It's so dense, and there is just so much detail to get across to your audience, even in the background exposition before you get to the actual narrative. Nevertheless, it's one of those books that is so beloved and influential, it's always in the back of Hollywood's mind, waiting to be put to screen once again. Denis Villeneuve, having proven himself with his Oscar-nominated Arrival and improbably fantastic Blade Runner sequel, was handed the reins to take another shot at it, this time separating the story into two parts—the first of which comes out October 22 in theaters and on HBO Max. Dune, technically titled Dune: Part One, introduces a universe ruled by a substance so precious, noble families wage war upon each other to gain control of it, until one family realizes the true scope of the wealth buried beneath the sands of one desert planet. It feels like the movie that fans of the novel have been waiting for. Everyone else's mileage may vary. The year is 10191 and humanity is ruled by a planetary Imperium that tracks and manipulates the relationships between the noble houses, shifting families back and forth according to the Emperor's whims. The favor now seems to land on House Atreides, who has been gifted control and residency of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, covered as it is with desert from pole to pole. Dune is the home of spice, a substance that allows the members of the Spacing Guild, who take it as a drug, to jump through space, transporting people and materials all around the galaxy. Whoever controls spice production on Arrakis will become very rich indeed. But the Atreides family and their vassals need to tread lightly: The gift of Arrakis is definitely a test, and likely a trap, overseen by the Atreides' powerful enemies, the brutish House Harkonnen. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and his family, Bene Gesserit (an order of genealogy-obsessed sorceresses) concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their fey son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), arrive on the planet ready to ally themselves with the blue-eyed Fremen, the native human population who have developed ways of surviving in the wasteland, building ""stillsuits"" that recycle the body's water and walking in odd ways so as not to attract the attention of the giant sandworms that swim beneath the desert's surface, plaguing spice mining equipment and swallowing anything in their path. Before they can accomplish much, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his forces, led by the sadistic Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) wreak havoc, changing the course of the Atreides family's fortunes. What they don't count on is the hidden power of the Atreides son Paul, who has a connection to the Fremen deeper than any of them suspect. As you can probably tell by the two whole paragraphs of plot description, Dune is complex. And, again, this is only the first part, setting up the exposition needed to understand what's going on and then cutting off about halfway through the novel, as Warner Bros. prefers to wait to see how this movie does before allowing Villeneuve to film Part Two. What's impressive about this movie is how straightforwardly it sets up everything you need to know, giving plenty of context to bizarre phrases like ""Kwisatz Haderach"" and ""gom jabbar"" so that anyone paying attention can pretty competently follow what's going on. It also has plenty of room for long, involved conversations between characters, using the space efficiently to introduce nuanced relationships between them—during a ceremonial meeting, Duke Leto mutters to his Warmaster Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) to smile, and Halleck responds, stonefaced, ""I am smiling."" The friendship between Paul and jovial swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) is particularly rich. Villeneuve uses these interactions sparingly, but they breathe life into a story that could very easily become extremely dry and dull. That's what's impressive about Dune: To make a film this straightforward out of some of the densest material in science fiction is a feat, and one that Villeneuve and his actors accomplish pretty much without a hitch. As long as you're paying attention, you'll get it. Conversely, if you don't feel like paying attention to what's going on, the movie is a true feast for the eyes (and the ears, thanks to some garish sound design and Hans Zimmer's booming score). Building interiors are stark, angular, shadowed; spaceships are chunky, loud, and tangible; costumes are extravagant, with voluminous flowing veils, comically high headdresses, and tubes poking out of every fold. Airships are outlined by searchlight beams cutting through thick mists, miles of sand vibrate in waves as worms pass underneath. Dune can't really be called ""accessible,"" because the novel itself isn't what we'd call accessible, either. Audiences who are predisposed to find fascination with its complex political intrigues and gibberish phrases will enjoy it, those who already don't like those things likely will not, and those on the fence are hard to predict. The movie, like the novel, makes you work a little for its affections, and will reward you for the effort. Bigger rewards will likely come in the sequel, adapting the more psychedelic, more out-of-this-world material of the book, which makes Dune's current situation (a dense space opera released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming) more than a little precarious. Dune: Part One will leave fans not only wanting, but hoping for more. The spice, in other words, must flow."
"Mar 10, 2022",positive," Sicario , Arrival , Blade Runner 2049 - it’s fair to say Denis Villeneuve has been on a bit of a roll behind the camera.   And now the French-Canadian director has turned his hand to adapting Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, which paved the way for Star Wars and many other genre favourites.   Unlike mega-fan Villeneuve, I am no Dune aficionado, having never read the book or seen David Lynch’s mostly derided 1984 take on the source material.

The free download features the latest breaking news and exclusive stories, and allows you to customise your page to the sections that matter most to you. Given the original book is around 500 pages long and crammed with world-building and lots of characters, Villeneuve wisely took the decision to split the story into two movies.  As has come to be the way with Villeneuve’s work, Dune is an exceptional looking film; you quickly get swept away in the desert planet of Arrakis and the sandy, dusty surroundings are punctuated by cloudy blue eyes, neon lasers and sun-kissed skies.   The scale is epic and you should see Dune on as big a screen as possible, with the moment the famous giant sand worms finally make their appearance counting as event cinema at its best.  Villeneuve’s cast are suitably stellar. At first I was concerned Chalamet might struggle to carry the weight of his key role but he grows into it masterfully.  Other standouts include Rebecca Ferguson ( Lady Jessica ), Oscar Isaac ( Duke Leto ), Zendaya ( Chani ) and Josh Brolin ( Gurney ), while there are slender but unsettling turns from Stellan Skarsgård ( Baron Harkonnen ) and Charlotte Rampling ( Reverend Mother Mohiam ).  Some characters are clearly set up for bigger things in the next movie and this also leads to a lack of resolution which, along with a lot of dialogue that will go over non-fans’ heads, grates at times."
"Mar 10, 2022",positive," Dense with lore and backstory that may be a touch intimidating to the uninitiated, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s doorstop sci-fi classic Dune is a windswept epic in the true sense, tawny-tinted and forebodingly handsome in its design.  Dune is about a young man born to high status, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, soft-spoken, with a wellspring of defiance in his eyes), whose family have been offered a dubious gift from their Emperor: a desert planet called Arrakis, inhabited by native people called the Fremens who have been brutally oppressed by a savage race of warriors known as the Harkonnens.  There’s real visual dynamism in the film, with a strong backbone of rhythmic editing to intersperse Paul’s journey with oblique visions of a cloudy future. The production and costume design, too, are austerely beautiful, particularly its dragonfly warplanes and octagonal concrete palaces.  Chalamet is well backed by a strong supporting cast, from Stellan Skarsgård as head of the warlike Harkonnens to a heroic battle-hardened soldier played by Jason Momoa.  Engrossing and frustrating in equal measure, Dune is the first instalment of what may prove to be a science-fiction Lord of the Rings; a mega-budget world-building fantasy on a huge scope. What hampers the film most is the concept of its serialisation: while it’s a compliment to say that I wished it would continue after over two hours, it simply fizzles instead, offering a half-hearted conclusion in service of setting up a sequel. Ultimately, Dune sacrifices its own momentum to cut itself in two rather than commit itself – and its audience – to following Paul on his long and dangerous journey. It lacks a certain faith in the viewer, and that’s a shame, because the film’s ambition is admirable. "
"Mar 8, 2022",positive," In the long history of novels being adapted into films, it seems a certainly that people have always spoken of ‘unfilmable’ books. Of course they are usually only considered unfilmable until an enterprising production team actually films them, as was the case with Peter Jackson’s widely acclaimed The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Frank Herbert’s Dune has spent a lot of time on people’s lists, despite both a 1984 feature film and a 2000 TV miniseries. In this case people use these adaptations as proof of their ‘unfilmable’ sentiment. Both film and series have their own critical flaws, and these seem to justify the argument that Dune is simply too long, too complex, and too expensive to film. Acclaimed writer/director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Prisoners) has taken a red-hot go and proving the naysayers wrong, with his 2021 epic feature: titled Dune in all marketing materials, but Dune Part One once the audience has paid for a ticket and started the movie. Not only it is a slightly dubious bit of deception, it is also a key sign of how Villeneuve has attempt to ‘film the unfilmable’. Rather than adapt Herbert’s entire 412-page novel in one shot, he has split the work into two. For those familiar with the plot, Villeneuve’s Dune goes as far as Paul meeting the Fremen in the desert. To see the rest of the story, viewers will have to wait until late 2023. For those unfamiliar with Dune, it is an epic science fiction story set far into humanity’s future. The known universe consists of a massive empire, within which rival aristocratic houses compete for the emperor’s favour. Travel between star systems requires the use of a substance called melange, or ‘spice’, and it is only found on the planet Arrakis – more commonly known as Dune. The brutal House Harkonnen is robbed of its control of Dune, with authority given by the Emperor to fierce rival House Atreides. The Harkonnens, of course, are not prepared to let go of their prime asset so they can help it. That set-up barely scratches the surface of Dune, of course, and the main challenge facing any filmmaker is how to capture and deliver an enormous amount of world-building, history, and political machinations into the space of a few hours. There is also the extensive cast of characters, whose varying allegiances, goals, and personalities must be established and played out. David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation essentially tried a ‘kitchen sink’ approach, overloading the film’s first half in particular with names, characters, and situations piled so thick and fast that it simply became confusing. Villeneuve tries what is essentially the opposite approach, stripping out a lot of extraneous detail and trying to both slow down the feed of information and only give the audience what they need to know at any given time. The approach seems only partially successful, as well as rather uneven. In some cases it still feels as if too much of the novel was unnecessarily retained. In others the absence of proper explanations renders some of the characters’ choices a little difficult to understand. What is included takes two-and-a-half hours to play out, at what often seems to be an interminable slowness. I cannot shake the feeling that with a little more trust in the audience and a more energised pace, Villeneuve could have captured the novel very effectively in the space of three hours. As it stands, this slow and methodical technique seems to show off a director afraid of their own production: as if one over-confident misstep would mean ruin for the whole enterprise. It is, of course, impeccably designed. From the costumes to the enormous machinery and craft of mining spice the film presents a beautifully realised and consistent universe. It lacks a variety of colour, which seems a shame – everything is either grey or brown, which seems as much a hallmark of post-Gladiator epic filmmaking as the whisper-and-shout delivery of the dialogue. Villeneuve has assembled an absolutely outstanding cast of actors to populate his Dune. Timothée Chalamet presents the precise blend of youthful naivete and inner strength than protagonist Paul Atreides requires. Oscar Isaac and Stellan Skarsgård are fine as rival leaders of Atreides and Harkonnen. A fine range of actors fill the various supporting parts: Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Chang Chen, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Zendaya, and a number of others. They are uniformly superb, yet as with the other elements of the film they feel very carefully arranged like figures in a doll house. It would be hard not to recognise an allegory of the colonial oil trade in the Middle East within Herbert’s Dune. The film certainly does, with Hans Zimmer’s multi-layered score reflecting the music of the region and the costuming the fashion. The Fremen – indigenous peoples of the deserts of Arrakis – are simultaneously fetishised as an exotic 19th century Arabia and apparently cast entirely without actors of Middle Eastern ethnicity. It is not the best of looks; neither is the film’s apparent embrace of the ‘white saviour’ narrative – although that is more a result of splitting the story in two than anything else. Dune is certainly worthy – oh so worthy – and handsomely produced, and should please most fans of Herbert’s iconic novel. At the same time it feels rather like a film made in fear: fear of making the wrong creative choice, or omitting the wrong bit of the book, or even the wrong delivery of a famous line. It would be a lie to claim I did not enjoy it, but like Lynch’s previous attempt I enjoyed with some fairly major caveats. To my mind both films together demonstrate that Dune is far from unfilmable – but that perhaps the best film version would exist somewhere between the two. It is hard to fully pass judgement of Villeneuve’s Dune. By the end of 2023 we can hopefully tell for sure."
"Mar 7, 2022",positive," One of the most anticipated films for many attending the New York Film Festival was without a doubt Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. The outlandish and artistic sci-fi epic will leave audiences wanting more. This is definitely a good thing. Many will be satisfied with the product Villeneuve has bred for the big screen, creating a take on outer space visuals somewhat reminiscent of Salvador Dalí. Dune, or Dune: Part One as it is officially titled onscreen, is an adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. It follows a young Paul Atreides who might just be the chosen one. Finding out is part of the journey. His family must travel to a hazardous planet to fulfill a duty assigned to them by the emperor. They quickly come to realize that malicious work is at play as they try to harvest the planet’s resources only to come across various setbacks and deadly threats. Dune is your typical hero’s journey. Paul ventures into the unknown, crossing the threshold into a world foreign to him, yet familiar all the same. Audiences will be able to fully transport themselves to Paul’s reality. It does a good job of helping one understand the rules of the world in a quick stride. That being said, it does not hold the viewer by the hand. The exposition, while done well, might be overwhelming to some. There is a lot to take in and process, but once the ball gets rolling, there’s no stopping it. The story itself is a calculated adaptation of a colonial narrative set in worlds unknown and new to us. The most lengthy task at hand was to convince the audience of this world’s realism. To hook them in. Dune succeeds at this. However, the grand scale splendor isn’t enough to distract from the absence of Villeneuve’s trademark emotional vulnerability.  Many have praised the 2017 film Blade Runner 2049 for balancing its cold exterior with said vulnerability at its center. While Dune is a nearly perfect film, it exudes a hollowed-out nature at times. To perfect the visual spectacle, the film creates emotional moments that, while well-timed and fitting for the narrative, often feel formulaic. At the very center, one can’t help but think the emotional core of the film is missing. At its roots, it’s also a conflicting narrative. The hero of the film partakes in the colonial siege of a foreign territory. While his family suffers the consequences, he is framed under the guise of empathy. Part one of the Dune duology in short tackles the crumbling of an empire. It explores loss under the ruse of conquest for honor. Villeneuve ventures into the politics of expansion and takeover that will ring true to many that face this reality today. Nevertheless, the film does not go beyond that. It presents the ramifications of forced subjugation, leading up to the exploration of the other side’s perspective in the future installment.  In terms of the performances, the cast was one to watch. An excellent and dynamic ensemble, they make the best of every scene. To name a notable outlier would be difficult because one cannot excel at what they’re given without another. Timothée Chalamet might be the exception due to the cards he’s dealt as the protagonist.  The mountainous weight of Dune weighs down on Chalamet’s shoulders. As a result, this adds to his portrayal of Paul. A young man with too much to take on too fast. The same doubt one might cast on his ability to carry the role translates into the same doubt one might have on whether Paul is prepared to step up to the challenge. Without a doubt, they both are.  While lacking the visual charisma Chalamet often brings with his presence, he was a mesmerizing lead. Clouded by conflict and turmoil, it contributes to the troubled atmosphere of the story. He’s able to characterize the film as an exploration of a subtle loss of humanity through the sacrifice of one’s empathy in the face of loss through his performance. His journey will probably seem to many as the antithesis of K’s own in Blade Runner 2049."
"Feb 21, 2022",positive," Perhaps the best, or at least the most revealing, thing that can be said about Denis Villeneuve’s grandly mounted adaptation of Frank Herbert’s “Dune” is that he makes it look easy.  This isn’t to say any filmmaker could have shepherded the movie to life, nor that this installment announcing itself as “Part 1” doesn’t mean Villeneuve has been graced with a bigger sandbox in which to convincingly create set up this sandswept saga about intergalactic rivalry and schemes which span centuries. Rather, Villeneuve makes adapting the narrative intricacies and otherworldly enormity of the source material look easy by succeeding at probably the hardest thing: Committing wholeheartedly to an aesthetic vision so shamelessly grand and evocative that, at its best, this story of young Paul Atreides on the desert planet Arrakis feels like the story Villeneuve has been quietly working towards for the better part of the last decade.  In certain respects it’s true. Not for nothing has the French-Canadian filmmaker become accustomed to making movies no one else would think to try, for good reason; “Arrival” is a masterwork adapted from a short story exploring language in the pitch of arithmetic, and the alluring open-endedness of Ridley Scott’s seminal “Blade Runner” practically made an unspoken rule that no sequel would be attempted. Villeneuve, it seems, enjoys breaking those rules almost as much as he ignores them altogether. This is to say, he so earnestly makes the case his trademark brooding, brutal style is the right vehicle for this half-adaptation of “Dune” that at a certain point you begin to wonder if Villeneuve doesn’t see himself in its central prophecy. He, as is the case with Timothée Chalamet’s Paul, is a lad of great expectations.  That only makes us all the more vulnerable to be initially enticed and then wholly entranced by the implications of a “Dune” adaptation which suggests the inevitability of disaster while wondering if destiny is something not to glorify but to fear. The lens is wide enough to reconsider the worlds of wizards and hobbits, should we choose to apply it. But with Villeneuve peering through, “Dune” most readily translates as a fable where the lines between losing and finding oneself are blurred against the backdrop of royal responsibility, moral emptiness and, yes, giant sandworms whose underground gliding the visual effects team realizes here with screen-shaking suspense.  You’ll hear those beasts referred to a few times as “Shai Hulud,” one of several phrases either derived or borrowed outright by Herbert and this screenplay (by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) from Middle Eastern vernacular. As was the case in 1965, so does it remain true here that “Dune” plays as allegory for resource-grabbing and interimperial tensions over valuable lands, only here oil becomes the ultracommodity spice and colonial powers become the houses Atreides and Harkonnen, the former of which has been assigned to take the reins in overseeing spice production on Arrakis from the latter. Contending evermore with the encroachment on their lands are the native Fremen, rebelling sometimes but mostly remaining in their isolated caverns while awaiting their emancipation. Meanwhile, Paul’s position as the perhaps-supernaturally inclined son of House Atreides leader Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, conveying a sense of regal capability) is also the reason he attracts the attention of the Bene Gesserit, a group of suspicious and strictly female string-pullers of which his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, the ensemble’s soulful anchor), is a member.  Got all that? Because it’s just the start. “Game of Thrones” fans might find it easier to settle into the behind-the-curtains plotting which will culminate in a massive nighttime invasion, but the rest of the audience can rest easy even as other faces arrive to bolster this story’s rosters. Helped along by a bit of movie-opening exposition underscoring the movie’s strange structure, “Dune” largely succeeds at one of its tallest tasks: Coherently positioning the players who fill the superbly rendered palaces the plot only partially unfolds in, and establishing their various loyalties through elemental means. The Atreides’ home planet of Caladan is a peaceful oasis of green and blue, for instance, while the Harkonnens reside on a stormy orb where they prefer their decor inky and oppressive. On Arrakis, the new abode of House Atreides is a city of geometric black holes that look as though they were excavated from the dunes themselves.  That those pompously massive sets (designed by Patrice Vermette) shrink into feeble sandcastles when the camera (manned with the assured hand of frequent Villeneuve collaborator Greig Fraser) soars toward the vast stretches of desert surrounding them is no accident. To fully appreciate the grandiosity of “Dune,” these most memorable sequences seem to suggest, we must notice the smallness as well—the way House Atreides ships, with their fluttering steel wings or spherical shapes, shrink to the size of bugs on the screen as they approach massive sandworms; the delicate and ominous framing of a fallen patriarch's hand at this first installment’s violent climax. What Villeneuve understands in bringing Arrakis and the power struggle over it to cinematic life is that sheer scale is a malleable force, and a viscerally overpowering one in a story nearly devoid of lightness or displays of affection. The epic’s investment in character resides on the edges of its spectacle, amid the juxtaposition of sandy mysticality and rumbling militarism. On one hand, Villeneuve’s faithfulness to Herbert’s novel extends to the rigid shallowness of this world’s denizens, ones defined almost exclusively by either calculation, greed, unquestioning responsibility or defiance. It’s difficult to imagine Chalamet imitating the space-opera buoyancy of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker, but “Dune” is also no “Star Wars,” which means the young star isn’t trying to. His hushed portrayal begins to feel more purposeful when “Dune” shifts to Arrakis, and that may as well indicate how the young star’s settling into the role is meant to mirror our own settling into this world.  On the other hand, the shallowness of motivation may very well be part of the point, and part of the reason Villeneuve – whose stories tend to locate a resonance in the desperately bleak – seems so natural a translator for “Dune.” His knack for visual grandeur will keep him making films for years, but the bigger the universe, the bigger the pathos that’s needed to fill it. Undoubtedly there’s an initial awkwardness in seeing these characters shift their positions on such an intricately staged, intergalactic chess board with such passivity.  But passivity is not a minor thing. Paths to predetermined places don’t appear out of thin air, not even the lethal, blazing-hot air of Arrakis. And “Dune” perhaps gets stronger and more tantalizing as its 155-minute runtime creeps along because Villeneuve – through beautifully edited sequences of recurring imagery and hazy chronological leapfrogging – foregrounds these ideas of powerful figures who are merely biding their time for power to be snatched away, finding comfort in the cognitive dissonance emphasized by the director’s technical precision. Agency and destiny are in constant conversation when it comes to Paul’s story, even if it takes about an hour for “Dune” to render their dialogue legible. And at its core is a messianic figure increasingly agitated about whether he can ever measure up to the narrative and aesthetic bombast he – and us, by proxy – is enveloped in.  “Dune” is haunting in these implications, and nearly potent enough to reflect on an entire genre as Chalamet’s performance increasingly reflects Paul’s subdued tug-of-war. You could call the cliffhanger ending rousing if you want, but I’m not entirely sure if Villeneuve doesn’t intend for the final moments of “Dune Part 1” to be a red herring. After spending the last few years debating if the director had the goods to pull this massive project off, it’s more than a little appropriate that there exists the possibility we could spend forever wondering if this iteration of Arrakis’s would-be savior has the capacity to see his path for what it really is, even as his footing grows ever more confident. "
"Feb 17, 2022",positive," Director: Denis Villeneuve
Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem. Following David Lynch’s divisive adaptation, for years it felt like Dune was one of those stories that would never make it to the big screen in a satisfactory way. Many adaptations have whirred into production before falling apart, but if there’s one filmmaker that knows about defying the odds, it’s Denis Villeneuve. The French-Canadian director was the one who brought us back to the world of Replicants in the astounding Blade Runner: 2049, and has cited Frank Herbert’s Dune as a passion project. Set in the distant future, Timothee Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, heir to House Atreides and son of its patriarch, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rachel Ferguson). As House Atreides arrives on the planet to take over the Spice mining operations, Leto faces several obstacles – a resentful native people known as Fremen, and the former steward of Arrakis, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). As a bitter betrayal unfolds, Paul realises that visions he has been having are indicative of powers that will make him a great leader, if he can only survive the planet’s deadly landscape. This is a truncated explanation of the plot, which only covers half of the first book (the title screen comes with a “Part One” caption). Isaac is a wise leader, and has some beautiful scenes with Chalamet, particularly an early walk by the coast where the pair talk about duty. Her devotion to her religion, and how it relates to her son’s destiny, make her an unpredictable element as things progress, but as ever the Oscar nominee brings a lot of passion to an essential role. Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa have some memorable scenes as enforcers for either side, while Josh Brolin is all business as he teaches Paul to fight. Zendaya is only really seen in flashbacks, and like Javier Barden as Fremen leader Sildar, there’s a sense that this is a teaser for more expanded roles in a sequel. Where many actors would have been making kissy faces at Marvel the moment they gained notoriety, the 25-year-old has opted for an interesting career path since breaking through in Call Me By Your Name. He forms immediate bonds with his co-stars thanks to a vulnerability that isn’t often seen in films of this scale, while still remaining a believable force in action scenes, despite his frame being intentionally slighter than his beefy colleagues. A story about a man’s destiny is hard to follow if you don’t care about the man, and Chalamet makes sure you’re with him each step of the way. While the ending and the subtitle “Part One” make it clear this is only the beginning, the complex piece stands apart in a world filled with superheroes and death-defying street racers.

"Feb 15, 2022",positive," DUNE (2021). With Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 reigning as two of the best science fiction films of recent vintage, director Denis Villeneuve attempts to go 3-for-3 with his ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert’s spice-world saga — or at least the first chunk of the hefty novel, as evidenced by the movie’s alternate title of Dune: Part One. Unlike Villeneuve’s previous pair, both of which are truly immersive experiences (particularly Arrival, the best picture of 2016 as shown here), this latest achievement produces a distancing effect that encourages respect rather than revelry. Its stateliness is both an asset and a detriment, as the picture looks absolutely stunning but occasionally feels too antiseptic for its own good. If nothing else, it stands head and shoulders over David Lynch’s 1984 dud (reviewed here), with a stronger cast, headier visual effects, and a more coherent storyline. Timothée Chalamet handles the pivotal role of Paul Atreides, believed to be “the chosen one” by the various factions jockeying for control of the spice-producing planet Arrakis. Paul’s parents are the noble Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and the devoted Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, arguably first among equals with a full-fledged performance), while his mentors include warriors Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). On the other side of the conflict reside the evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his crew, while more ambiguous in their intentions are Arrakis inhabitants Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya). Oh, yes, there are also sandworms on hand to devour the scenery. Even if Dune is occasionally chilly to the touch, there’s enough here of merit to warrant the upcoming Part Two. Extras in the 4K edition consist of making-of featurettes (including “Designing the Sandworm” and “Wardrobe from Another World”); a look at the various players; and pieces on three specific scenes.

An agreeable caper comedy that can’t quite maintain its momentum throughout its 109-minute running time, Gambit was amusingly advertised with the tagline, “Go Ahead Tell the End (It’s Too Hilarious to Keep Secret) But Please Don’t Tell the Beginning!” That beginning (spoiler?) finds British cat burglar Harry Dean (Michael Caine) explaining to his cohort in crime Emile (John Abbott) how he plans to use a Eurasian dancer named Nicole (Shirley MacLaine) to help him steal a valuable relic from the richest man in the world, the Middle Eastern magnate Shahbandar (Herbert Lom). It’s a scheme that, as we see, plays flawlessly in Harry’s mind, even though the reality proves to be much more taxing. Nicole is brassy rather than docile, Shahbandar isn’t a meek sheik but rather a shrewd and suspicious businessman, and even Harry himself isn’t as smart or suave as he would like to believe. There’s that unwritten Hollywood rule decreeing that whenever two attractive stars are cast in a movie, their characters must fall in love whether it makes sense or not. Here it doesn’t, meaning that MacLaine and Caine are far more effective when bickering than when romancing. Gambit earned a trio of Academy Award nominations for its sets, costumes, and sound. A remake appeared in 2012 — written by the Coen Brothers and starring Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz, and Alan Rickman, it (unlike the original) was a critical and commercial flop. As for MacLaine and Caine, they reunited for two more films far inferior to this one: the following year’s Woman Times Seven (reviewed here) and the misbegotten 2005 update of Bewitched. Blu-ray extras consist of audio commentary by director Ronald Neame; film historian audio commentary; the theatrical trailer; and trailers for other titles on the Kino label. THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963). Forget the film school staples for a moment: If you cross off the usual suspects (Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Seventh Seal, Bicycle Thieves, etc.) from my list of the greatest movies ever made, this World War II adventure yarn would be what’s left standing near or at the very top. Certainly, it’d be a tight race between this, 1938’s The Adventures of Robin Hood, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark for the crown of the most enjoyable matinee-style popcorn picture that Hollywood has ever produced — the masterpieces that movie buffs can watch anytime, anywhere, and instantly feel uplifted by the experience. Based on a true story, this centers on an attempt by captured Allied soldiers to escape from Germany’s most secure POW camp; among the all-stars cast as prisoners taking part in the breakout are Steve McQueen (iconic as Hilts “The Cooler King”), James Garner (irresistible as Hendley “The Scrounger”), James Coburn (amusing as Sedgwick “The Manufacturer”), Charles Bronson (terrific as Danny “The Tunnel King”), and Donald Pleasence (touching as Blythe “The Forger”). McQueen’s thrilling motorcycle ride has long been the stuff of cinematic legend, but the movie is packed with countless memorable episodes of this caliber. John Sturges directs with verve, with Elmer Bernstein contributing a sensational score that clearly should have taken that year’s Oscar (shamefully, the movie’s sole nomination was for Best Film Editing). The Great Escape runs nearly three hours, yet it’s the fastest three hours ever spent in front of a movie screen or television set. 4K extras include audio commentary (from 2004) by Garner, Coburn, Pleasence, and other cast and crew members; film historian audio commentary; a retrospective making-of featurette; a piece on the real-life escape; and the theatrical trailer. JUICE (1992). Landing in the year between the more muscular pair of 1991’s Boyz n the Hood and 1993’s Menace II Society (the latter reviewed here), Juice feels relatively puny by comparison. Ernest Dickerson, the ace cinematographer on Spike Lee’s earliest films (including Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X), made his directorial debut with this drama that focuses on the everyday activities of four black teens growing up in Harlem. Q (Omar Epps) is the talented one (he hopes to become a professional DJ), Raheem (Khalil Kain) is the charismatic one, Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) is the follower, and Bishop (Tupac Shakur) is, as the rest soon find out, the loose cannon. Far down on the totem pole (among other indignities, they’re bullied by the members of a neighborhood gang), the friends feel they’ve finally acquired some “juice” (aka power) once they manage to obtain a gun. The four plot to knock over a convenience store, but since Bishop is the one brandishing the weapon, what would have been a simple robbery turns into a case of cold-blooded murder. The first half of the film covers familiar ground, but Dickerson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) gives it enough of a fresh spin that it remains involving. But following the robbery, the picture morphs from a candid look at urban life into a preposterous pulp thriller, as Bishop suddenly turns psychotic and starts blowing away friend and foe alike. Dickerson loses his grip on the material, leaving his capable actors at the mercy of increasingly embarrassing dialogue and developments. Extras on the 4K 30th Anniversary edition include audio commentary (from 2017) by Dickerson; a retrospective making-of featurette; a piece on the successful soundtrack (which hit #17 on the Billboard chart); and a vintage interview with the four male leads. RICH AND STRANGE (1931). While Alfred Hitchcock called his 1932 effort Number Seventeen “a terrible picture” (see the details, and the review, here), all accounts report that he had no such disdain for the film that immediately preceded it. Originally released stateside as East of Shanghai, Rich and Strange is indeed a thematically rich and occasionally strange movie, as well as one of Hitchcock’s best non-thrillers. Fred Hill (Henry Kendall) is bored with his lot in life and yearns for adventure, so when he’s informed that an uncle is leaving him a sizable inheritance, he and his wife Emily (Joan Barry) leave the drabness of their London flat and embark on a lavish cruise around the world. Although the experience offers the couple an opportunity to rekindle their romance, they instead drift into the arms of others: Emily establishes a comfortable rapport with a British gentleman (Percy Marmont) while Fred lusts after a princess (Betty Amann) who’s not quite what she seems. Although creaky at times, this is a sparkling comedy imbued with some thoughtful observations on love and marriage. While Rich and Strange was certainly too minor to have served as inspiration for other filmmakers’ movies, it is interesting in that its general plot outline brings to mind the rich texture of William Wyler’s 1936 Dodsworth (reviewed here), itself adapted from the Sinclair Lewis novel that was released two years before this picture, while the marvelous opening sequence has a whiff of Jacques Tati’s Monsieur Hulot about it. Shakespeare scholars will appreciate the film’s title (taken from The Tempest), but cat lovers will certainly not appreciate the comedic fate of the feline slinking through the proceedings. THE 7TH DAWN (1964). Seven years after The Bridge on the River Kwai, William Holden again played a combative American coping with hot weather and even hotter tensions in Southeast Asia. He stars as Ferris, a former guerilla fighter who spends the years following World War II growing his wealth as a Malayan plantation owner. His fellow fighter Dhana (Capucine), now a schoolteacher, has become his mistress, but the third part of their triangle, Ng (Tetsurô Tamba), left them for an education in Moscow. Ng has now returned to Malaya, and Ferris finds it difficult to maintain their friendship since his buddy is now a Communist terrorist responsible for the deaths of numerous British civilians and soldiers residing in the country. Susannah York co-stars as a woman with the unfortunate name of Candace Trumpey; her primary purpose is to try to bed the older Ferris at every opportunity and, later, steer further into his good graces by offering herself as a hostage to Ng in an effort to save an imprisoned Dhana. The sociopolitical angle carries the movie along for a good stretch, but once the characters are forced to slog through the jungle in the dull third act, viewers are forced to slog through the remainder of the picture. SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL (1959). Opinions will naturally differ on the politics behind this drama set during the Irish War of Independence, but there will be no arguments over the quality of James Cagney’s performance. One of the greatest actors ever, he’s typically superb here as Sean Lenihan, a kind and cheerful professor who also turns out to be a fanatical leader in the IRA. One of his school pupils is the Irish-American Kerry O’Shea (Don Murray), who repeatedly turns down offers to join the cause for Irish freedom since he saw enough bloodshed while serving in World War I. But as Kerry witnesses more atrocities being committed by the brutal British occupiers known as the Black and Tans — and after he himself is tortured by a particularly sadistic officer (Christopher Rhodes) — he realizes he can no longer remain on the fence. Murray essays the film’s largest role — it’s also the blandest role, as Kerry O’Shea will make the switch from doubter to devotee in predictable fashion. The richness is instead found in other characters: Cagney’s Sean Lenihan is a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure who snuffs out lives as a revolutionary as often as he saves them as a surgeon; Chris Noonan (Cyril Cusack) is a soft-spoken poet whose gentleness belies his position as an IRA leader; and Kitty Brady (an excellent Glynis Johns) is a barmaid who fully commits herself to the cause (and to the men who appreciate the bedroom favors she gives them) but who never gains Lenihan’s trust. It’s odd to see Michael Redgrave, that most British of British actors, playing an Irishman (an IRA bigwig most likely meant to be Michael Collins), but it’s not surprising to see a young Richard Harris playing the most volatile of IRA flunkies. SPENCER (2021). Anyone who’s seen director Pablo Larraín’s 2016 drama Jackie will have a general idea of what to expect from his latest at-bat. Hardly a standard biopic, Jackie (reviewed here) moved at its own peculiar pace as it zeroed in on the grief crippling Jacqueline Kennedy (Oscar-nominated Natalie Portman) as she mourned her assassinated husband. Spencer, showcasing a terrific performance by Kristen Stewart, similarly gets up close and personal with its subject, both in Larraín’s shooting style and in scripter Steven Knight’s attempts to analyze and understand the mindset of Diana, Princess of Wales, during a particularly difficult period in her life among the royals. It’s Christmastime 1991, and Diana is duty-bound to spend the holidays in the company of the royal family. She loves her sons William and Henry (Jack Nielen and Freddie Spry), enjoys hanging out with the Royal Dresser Maggie (Sally Hawkins), and has an amicable relationship with the head chef (Sean Harris). But she has little use for the rest of the lot, including her unfaithful and bullying husband Charles (Jack Farthing) and the household’s senior attendant (Timothy Spall). Although Larraín occasionally indulges his star too much — how many shots do we really need of Diana dancing her blues away? — this “fable from a true tragedy” (as it’s described at the start) succeeds as a turbulent character study of an emotionally compromised woman who’s as much a prisoner as she is a princess. THE VAMPIRE LOVERS (1970). Sheridan Le Fanu’s classic 1872 novella Carmilla has served as the basis for numerous vampire flicks, although it’s probably safe to state that this blood-and-boob-filled adaptation from Hammer Films boasts the largest fan base. The first entry in the so-called Karnstein Trilogy — Lust for a Vampire and Twins of Evil both followed in 1971 — this turned Ingrid Pitt into an overnight genre star by casting her in the central role of a vampire with decidedly lesbian tendencies. With her penchant for buxomly beauties, she first overcomes Laura von Spielsdorf (Pippa Steele), the daughter of a respected Austrian general (Peter Cushing), before setting her sights on Laura’s even more enticing friend Emma (Madeline Smith). There’s also an attraction between Carmilla and Emma’s governess (Kate O’Mara); meanwhile, the men she bloodily dispatches stir no feelings but are simply foolish enough to get in her way. The Vampire Lovers was one of the pictures that marked Hammer’s turn away from producing literate horror yarns in which the heaving bosoms were kept clothed and toward releasing more promiscuous fare in an effort to remain visible in the wake of new types of horror films like Night of the Living Dead and Rosemary’s Baby. The influx of nudity and extra gore didn’t help — the studio was basically done by the mid-1970s — but even Hammer’s lesser efforts in this, uh, vein are generally watchable. The Vampire Lovers resides above that lukewarm designation, but some clumsy plotting works against its total success. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by Pitt, director Roy Ward Baker, and scripter Tudor Gates; a discussion of the film and its source material; an interview with Smith; audio of Pitt reading excerpts from Carmella; and the theatrical trailer. THE WOODY ALLEN COLLECTION (1994-2003). Because no stateside outfit will touch Woody Allen at this point in time, the unknown Quiver Films ended up with eight titles to release in one Blu-ray box set. So the good news is that 1994’s Bullets Over Broadway, one of Woody’s best and an Academy Award winner for Dianne Wiest’s hysterical supporting performance, is finally on Blu-ray. The bad news is that you can only purchase it alongside such extremely lame endeavors as 1998’s Celebrity (Kenneth Branagh, Leonardo DiCaprio), 2001’s The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd), and 2002’s Hollywood Ending (Téa Leoni, Debra Messing). As for the rest, 1995’s middling Mighty Aphrodite contains Mira Sorvino’s Oscar-winning supporting turn, 1996’s Everyone Says I Love You is an enchanting all-star musical featuring Edward Norton, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, 2000’s Small Time Crooks is minor Allen with some very funny passages, and 2003’s Anything Else, starring Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci, is better than its reputation."
"Feb 12, 2022",positive," Every few years, a film arrives that changes the landscape of cinema. Back in 2008, Iron Man was released and, in turn, began the creation of the most profitable franchise of this generation – the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since then, the blueprint for significant studios was to release any intellectual property with potential box office value. But what if a studio decided to release intellectual property without much-beloved success? Warner Bros. answered that question with Denis Villeneuve’s Dune and, in turn, may have laid the foundation for the beginning of a new expanded universe not seen since a galaxy far, far away. Dune was first tackled in 1984 by the legendary David Lynch to unsatisfactory results for those unfamiliar with the property. Lynch was given a tall order as he attempted to complete the entire story in less run-time than Denis’s epic first part. Ultimately, the property was left dormant until Denis was allowed to take a swing. Dune was left motionless primarily for failing the tall task of telling its story on the big screen, as many have viewed the Frank Herbert novel as unadaptable. Denis not only steps up to the challenge but ignites a level of cinematic nirvana unseen in quite some time. Dune is quite significant in scale, but its most grounded basic premise tells the story of the House of Atreides and their leader, Duke Leto, as he is assigned to rule the planet of Arrakis by the Emperor. However, while taking over Arrakis, many factions are not fond of this new appointment and attempt to take down the family. During this, Duke’s son, Paul, has visions that ultimately will force him to decide whether or not to accept his destiny. Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Erich Roth honor Herbert’s novel in their screenplay as they fully immerse the viewer in this world. Rather than hand-holding and explaining every ongoing event, their script lets the film breathe and enables you to discover all the elements in this world. In comparison, Dune’s world-building falls in line with the early seasons of Game of Thrones. Yes, there are a lot of characters, and yes, a lot is going on, but patience pays off as, by the film’s conclusion, stakes are elevated, and you can draw a line on who to root for and against? Bringing the screenplay to life is one of the best cast ensembles of the year. While Lynch’s Dune gave us the gift of Kyle Mclaughlin, Timothée Chalamet’s Paul is perfection. But, of course, there are roles that some actors are meant to play, and Chalamet was destined to bring Paul to life as he runs through an array of emotions that bring to light whether or not Paul is meant to fulfill his destiny. Complementing Chalamet is the always reliable Rebecca Ferguson. While first coming off as a throwaway character, her impact on the film’s second half stands out with some of my favorite moments. While some of the cast gets minimal screen time, they each lay the groundwork for what is expected to be further expanded roles in the second entry in the series. The sheer scale of Villeneuve’s vision is aided by the brilliant work of cinematographer Greig Fraser. Point blank, it’s the most beautiful looking film of the year. Fraser’s work creates a world that surpasses the sci-fi world and enters the stratosphere of the old Hollywood epic. Throughout, I began to think of Dune in the same cinematographic space of Lawrence of Arabia and how Fraser’s work is that good. Hans Zimmer’s score elevates the technical marvel of Fraser’s cinematography. While always reliable, it felt that Zimmer attempted to replicate his scores from The Dark Knight and Inception for the past 13 years. This time around, Hans-y shifts the sounds of these scores and creates an epic sound that matches the sheer magnitude of Dune. It’s the best score of the year, and there’s little question as to whether Hans is worthy of an Oscar nomination and a second win. Fans of Frank Herbert’s Dune will be delighted that Villeneuve treated his acclaimed novel with care and respect. While the film is dependent on a second part being greenlit, it does not take away from the accomplishment Denis and the company created with this film. Hypnotizing and emotional, this spectacle is set to immerse cinephiles into Villeneuve’s Magnum Opus and one that is set to redefine the theatrical experience."
"Feb 12, 2022",neutral," “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” Dune is the magnum opus of author Frank Herbert. First published in 1965, the award-winning book is a masterpiece. While it may not have invented the space opera, it’s certainly one of the most significant examples in sci-fi literature. Dune is the gold standard for fictional world-building and mythology by which all others should be measured. With Dune, Frank Herbert didn’t just tell the story of the young, noble Paul Atreides. He also created a whole history around an alternative future for humanity, set eons after the present day. Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy. While there have been multiple motion picture adaptations of Herbert’s saga in the past, most notably David Lynch’s 1984 attempt, renowned filmmaker Denis Villeneuve offers his latest attempt with the long-delayed Dune feature. Eons into the future, after humanity has already undergone a mass rejection of advanced AI and somewhat of a renaissance, the known universe is colonized and ruled by a feudal system of royal houses. Due to past events making the invention and utilization of “thinking machines” taboo, humanity instead sought to strengthen their minds as a substitute, leading to the creation of the Mentat Order, the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Spacing Guild and its navigators are responsible for overseeing interstellar space travel, made possible thanks to a substance known as the Spice Melange, aka the Spice. The Spice can only be found and mined from the inhospitable desert planet Arrakis, or Dune.  Among the royal houses is the noble and honorable House Atreides, rulers of planet Caladan and led by Duke Leto Atreides (Isaac). For years, Arrakis and its indigenous people, the Fremen, have suffered at the heel of House Atreides’ archrival, the vicious House Harkonnen. Strangely enough, the universe’s emperor, Padisham IV, has opted to shift course with Dune, demoting House Harkonnen from their failed stewardship of Arrakis and instead granting the fiefdom to Duke Leto. Now, the onus of mining the Spice and bringing peace between the royal houses and the Fremen falls on Duke Leto. However, House Corrino’s gift of stewardship of Arrakis to House of Atreides is not the gift it appears, but the start of a deadly conspiracy that could mean the ruin of Duke Leto’s family line. Son to Duke Leto and his former Bene Gesserit consort, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), is Paul Atreides (Chalamet). Even before the family commutes to Arrakis, Paul is already plagued by prescient dreams of the planet, some of which hold an ill omen for his closest friends and House Atreides subjects. Duke Leto charges top operative, Duncan Idaho (Momoa), to chart an advance mission to Arrakis to contact the Fremen in attempts to forge a peaceful alliance between the two groups. While Paul is Duke Leto’s heir, he’s trained for action by the stern and stoic Atreides Warmaster Gurney Halleck (Brolin). Paul is certainly his father’s son, but his mother’s as well. Lady Jessica once belonged to a mysterious order of the Bene Gesserit, whose goals don’t necessarily align with that of House Atreides and appear to have far-reaching plans. Thanks to his mother, Paul is attempting to fine-tune extra-sensory abilities pioneered by the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Arrakis was no mere gift by the Emperor. On an unforgiving desert planet with no water, adversaries for House Atreides are apparent on all sides. However, on Arrakis, there exists talk of a messiah, or Madhi, who will free the Fremen from oppression and make Arrakis into a lush paradise. Paul’s arrival on Dune appears to be prophetic to its natives. With a deadly trap about to be sprung, young Paul Atreides could be the key to unlocking Arrakis.  Despite its flaws, it’s unlikely that any director other than Denis Villeneuve could have pulled off Dune. At the very least, he respects the grandeur and elegance of this classic story. The visuals at work here are jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring. The spaceships look like giant, cocoon-like structures that fill up the entire screen. They look like they were ripped from the covers of the books, with giant gaping hatches. Every penny of the film’s $165+ million budget, from the Ornithopters to Shai-Hulud, is shown onscreen. Villeneuve has brought the world of Frank Herbert to life, and it’s never looked better. Villeneuve, cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette not only achieve the visual ambition of Dune but an amazing level of verisimilitude, even down to the desert’s flora and fauna, such as a little mouse that’s able to survive the harshest of conditions.  The cast’s two biggest standouts are easily Oscar Isaac as Leto and Timothée Chalamet as Paul. Isaac’s honorable Leto is an aspirational, yet tragic figure. It’s easy to see why he’s beloved by his subjects and inspires such fervent loyalty. He’s a man of reason, the compassionate and wise leader whom everyone wants. Unfortunately, it’s that very leadership that has made him an object of hatred for his adversaries who want nothing more than to destroy his entire line. Isaac perfectly depicts Leto’s nobility, his love for his friends, and his sincerity in his attempts to lead Arrakis to a better future, without naïveté in the fate that awaits House Atreides if they fail. Isaac captures the necessary gravitas for Leto. Among today’s crop of young actors, Timothée Chalamet was the only choice for Paul. His personality is refreshing, and he’s smart enough to be aware of the danger surrounding himself and his family. Paul is desperate to help, yet he’s not necessarily the best experienced to know how. Chalamet takes Paul from his very roots and shows the start of his grand journey from a young, upstart noble to someone who will become something more. Chalamet’s performance has a sweet, believable innocence; but beneath that innocence, there’s genuine fear, a fear that Paul must eventually face and let pass through him.  The more notable performances among the supporting cast are the smaller, more tertiary roles, such as Stephen McKinley Henderson as Atreides chief Mentat Thufir Hawat, Chen Chang as Atreides physician Dr. Wellington Yueh and David Dastmalchian as the Harkonnen stooge,  Piter de Vries. They are proof that there are no small parts. They all bring a unique energy to each of their characters and offer texture to this unique view of the future. Javier Bardem also makes the most of his screentime as the Fremen leader Stilgar, but his performance in this film demonstrates that it’s not yet his time to shine. Brolin captures the more serious nature of Gurney Halleck quite well. Unfortunately, the movie does not get to show his softer side, along with his love for music and the baliset. This exemplifies one of the unfortunate aspects of cinematic adaptations for dense sci-fi literature. The producers and writers felt it was necessary to justify Jason Momoa’s casting as Duncan Idaho, who is better described as Duncan Ida-bro. Idaho’s role is significantly beefed up a bit too much. In this role, expanding a character role to fit the actor doesn’t work. It would be preferable for the actor to bring the character of Idaho to life. Aquaman is Duncan Idaho, so he needs more screentime, fight scenes and cool one-liners. Gurney can’t play his baliset, but Duncan needs to be shown killing lots more enemies. While the movie’s production design and visuals are top-notch, there are a couple of instances where the movie does not meet its full visual ambition. The pain box scene, a pivotal scene straight out of the book’s opening chapter, looks even less inspiring than the 2000 Sci-Fi TV miniseries. Secondly, Paul never even gets to recite the Litany Against Fear even once. The way the scene plays out in the film focuses more on Lady Jessica, which undercuts Paul’s journey and struggle. Additionally, it can also be seen where the shadow of Blade Runner 2049‘s weak box office looms large over Villeneuve. There are many giant spaceships in Dune, but they are only depicted in orbit or just before take-off. There’s no depiction of Spacing Guild navigators, no actual interstellar space travel or visualization for how the navigators plot course through space. These are the parts where Villeneuve plays it safe with Dune, when he really should not have. These concepts make Dune pure sci-fi, and the production really should have gone all out and shown them onscreen.  What is commendable in the favor of Villeneuve, who co-wrote the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, is that a good chunk of the book’s initial half remains in the film. While not an exceptional word for word adaptation of the book, it does make a better attempt at adapting the source material despite multiple hiccups. That said, there is one significant instance where Villeneuve breaks the “show, don’t tell rule,” showing the cards of a certain major development a little too early. One particular line came off as a bit patronizing, like Villeneuve had to make sure the audience understands what’s going on, not trusting more casual moviegoers.  The biggest problem with Dune is that it cannot adapt the entire first novel. At two hours and 35 minutes, the film is already at a copious length. The pacing is not bad at all considering the length and such dense material. The unfortunate part is the movie abruptly ends. Subplots that are developed and introduced are left dangling without significant payoff.  The ending point Villeneuve and his co-writers opted for came out rather clumsy. It omits one of Paul’s best and most pivotal moments after significant screentime was dedicated to creating that moment. It’s possible this moment might come up again in a later movie adapting the rest of the book, but there’s still no guarantee that movie will even happen. That is the pitfall of ending a movie in the middle of a story and having to make the middle portion a third act for an already long movie, betting on the hope there will be enough interest to finish it later.  The result is that Dune feels incomplete. Hopefully, things will play out much better if the planned sequel does happen, but it feels like cheating to make a movie this way. On the other hand, the positive takeaway from this choice leaves the audience anxious for more. While much of Hans Zimmer’s work as a composer has largely been uninspired over the course of the last decade, his score for Dune is his best work in years. It actually sounds unique, grand and epic. Once it moves to Arrakis, the themes sound fitting and immense. This is not a lazy piece of phoned in work this time around for Zimmer. Regardless of some specific plotting and casting missteps, there is fine artistry at work in this take on Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi saga and one of the greatest novels ever written. At the very least, it’s a valiant effort in bringing pure sci-fi to the screen with the necessary epic grandeur. Dune is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen at least once.

"Feb 12, 2022",positive," Near the end of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, there’s a brief moment where our hero, Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, sees a small rodent scurrying on the sand. Paul notices how the creature’s large ears accumulate moisture into a droplet, which it uses to sustain itself under the harsh desert conditions. Sometime later, hopefully, we will see Paul name himself muad’dib after the rodent when he leads the Fremen, the nomadic people of Arrakis. But unless you’ve read Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel—or the Wikipedia summary, as people find the book difficult to finish—the significance of this moment may elude you. And yet, Villeneuve and his co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts included the scene in their adaptation. Their devotion to Herbert’s text captures his layered investigation of imperialism, Middle-Eastern culture, ecology, industry, patriarchy and matriarchy, and political strategy in fine detail. Tackling source material considered unfilmable by some, Villeneuve leaves no theme untapped and does what seemed impossible by capturing the book’s depth in a major motion picture. It’s a perfectly cast and handsomely designed production, full of incredible sights. But given that Dune represents only half of Herbert’s story, the other half of which remains to be filmed or even greenlit at the time of this review, we’re left to wonder whether Chalamet will ever become muad’dib. The latest attempt to bring Herbert’s tome to the big screen shares in a history of troubled adaptations. Chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky first tried in the mid-1970s, assembling artists like Moebius, H.R. Giger, and Chris Foss to create elaborate designs for a proposed 12-hour film that was never to be. David Lynch completed a screen version released in 1984, but he lost control to producer Dino de Laurentiis. Even if Jodorowsky or Lynch had been given limitless funds and creative freedom to complete their adaptations, the resulting films wouldn’t have been true to Herbert’s book. Both directors intended to explore aspects that interested them most. Jodorowsky seemed more driven by the potential for avant-garde filmmaking techniques and psychedelic artifice than doing the material justice. However, Lynch’s take, while beautifully staged, reduced the story to its roots in Joseph Campbell’s monomyth, developing the idea of Paul’s dreams leading to his emergence as a hero. Villeneuve is more selfless than his predecessors; he applies his aesthetic of lingering camerawork and mesmerizing visuals to serve Herbert’s vision, crafting a faithful translation. Writing this review, then, becomes a tricky task. For one, I cannot ignore that feeling of emptiness that Dune left me with when the credits began to roll. Should the film be blamed for this, or is that just the nature of this particular beast? Also, I cannot ignore everything I felt before that emptiness took over. Villeneuve does something incredible by visualizing certain scenes and characters the way I envisioned them when reading the book, which I cherish. Few science-fiction films have realized their source material so well (so far, anyway). The director, cinematographer Greig Fraser, and production designer Patrice Vermette render distinct worlds that reflect the story’s setting of several thousands of years in the future. The production resists the ostentation of Lynch’s version, preferring an elegant functionality to the costumes, sets, vehicles, and planetary designs. Yet, we see familiar sights, suggesting they originated from the unmentioned Earth. Small details such as bullfighting and bagpipes appear around the Atreides family, who hail from the ocean planet Caladan but have been tasked with overseeing Arrakis, a planet that produces “spice” needed for intergalactic travel—it also opens the mind and extends life. The Fremen, clearly drawn from Islamic and Middle-Eastern cultures, have a familiar spirituality that attracts Paul, recalling the titular enigma in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The film’s best scenes involve the curt Stilgar (Javier Bardem), whose social graces confound most members of House Atreides.  The story of Dune also remains true to the book, although the script makes slight alterations to enhance the depth of certain characters. Paul, of course, has more personality thanks to Chalamet’s slender frame, inwardness, and vulnerable gestures. His chummy relationship with his mentors, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), prove alternately endearing and parental. Oscar Isaac, too, brings a great deal of humanity to Paul’s father, Duke Leto, whose otherwise noble eyes also contain a parent’s unwavering love. The screenplay’s best alteration builds upon Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul’s mother and member of the Bene Gesserit—a group of powerful women who work in secret to shift power in the universe away from the unseen Emperor. Through haunting sound design and flashes of dream imagery laden with blood and fire, Paul hears the whispers of the Bene Gesserit and sees glimpses of his future path as a revolutionary alongside the Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya). Jessica hints that his future with the Fremen will “bridge space and time, past and future.” All of this talk of emergence and fate on a desert planet, and the viewer will begin to realize just how much George Lucas lifted from Herbert to write Star Wars (1977).  Still, in its current, halved form, Dune is an emotionally dissatisfying experience—mainly due to extratextual issues—albeit one that has the potential of becoming one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made. If “Part Two” happens, and it’s just as well-crafted as “Part One,” then cinephiles have a treasure awaiting them. But I feel about Dune similarly to how I felt in 2001 about The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, another open-ended chapter in a series. I recognize this film’s individual excellence, but its lasting effect may depend on what follows. At least with Peter Jackson’s trilogy, he filmed them all simultaneously, representing an enormous commitment on the part of New Line Cinema. With Dune, the studio’s commitment remains to be seen. In the meantime, Villeneuve’s treatment results in a million details that intrigue, from the way he portrays “the voice” in disorienting layers of sound to the way the mouths of Arrakis’ enormous sandworms resemble the iris of an eye. The director achieves another impressive trick by casting a roster of all-star performers who disappear entirely into their roles. Best of all, Villeneuve seems to understand the material better than any other director before him; he points every element of the cinematic apparatus toward the singular goal of realizing Herbert’s vision. It’s gratifying to see a filmmaker who understands Dune finally, but it makes my hope for a sequel even more desperate and, at this moment, worrisome. "
"Feb 12, 2022",positive,"Sure it is long and dense, but the drama of Dune is engaging and it does make the audience care about its characters and stories."
"Feb 12, 2022",positive," Dune is a superb sci-fi epic that shocks the senses. This review explores the movie on its own without reflecting its ability to adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel. Director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve crafts an experience that seeks to truly immerse the audience in its world, rather than just tell a story. It won’t be for everyone, but it’s quite hypnotizing if you give into it. 10191 is the year. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the son of a noble family with high expectations for his future. His family is tasked with ruling and protecting a dangerous desert planet, Arrakis. This planet has the “spice melange,” which can extend human life and create superhuman abilities.  However, Arrakis has dangers that the noble family isn’t entirely prepared for. The native Fremen people and incoming invaders are just a couple of the dangers. The heat is inhospitable and massive sandworms travel underneath the desert sand’s surface. Nonetheless, the noble family plans to serve and protect. Dune supposedly covers roughly the first half of the novel. The opening’s subtitle reads “part one,” which truly sets the tone that it isn’t going to deliver the whole story. It lays the groundwork for a universe that is so rich, it deserves more than one movie. Dune takes its time to get acclimated. It progressively introduces the characters and the stakes, but never gives too much away.  Dune is a sci-fi movie that places emphasis on family. Paul’s father Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) gives him insight into leadership. However, Paul’s relationship with his mother Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) is further emphasized. The mother-son relationship is truly tested as they’re forced into various dangerous situations. This dynamic is the story’s genuine driver to make viewers care about their journey. Dune is an intentionally slow-moving sci-fi epic. The movie seeks to absorb you into its universe before it advances. It does so with Villeneuve’s superb direction, Greig Fraser’s gorgeous cinematography, and Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly score. It’s otherworldly in both its nature and its quality. Every scene further hypnotizes deeper into its grasp, making the 155-minute runtime feel much shorter than it is. The characters’ depth is a tad lacking, yet Dune still manages to make their story matter. By becoming invested in their world, it simultaneously invests its audience in its characters. Paul is the least captivating of the bunch, although Chalamet does what he can with the part. Ferguson’s Lady Jessica is the most impactful performance here, showcasing incredible depth and nuance.  Dune is not the action spectacle that some folks may be expecting. It’s a slow-moving, yet entirely immersive sci-fi epic. See it on the biggest screen with the loudest sound system available. The movie will also be debuting on the streaming service HBO Max, but this is a film that begs for your total attention in a dark theater. Dune is an experience. Let it wash over you. I'm an avid film buff who's always on the search for the next best indie or horror movie. I'm most likely enjoying a nice cup of tea while writing film reviews or entertainment news."
"Feb 12, 2022",positive," A young man is destined for great things. It’s a set up so commonplace that we rarely give it a second look. Within fantasy and science fiction, it’s even more expected. Which is why Dune has always stood out from the rest. Frank Herbert’s novel is filled with political intrigue between warring houses and wondrous worlds that feel fully lived in. Yet at the center of it is Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his journey to find his own path through life despite many hands guiding him through it. As much a philosophical coming-of-age tale as an epic political science fiction and fantasy story, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Dune is a wonder to behold and fully realizes a universe that beyond its massive scale and otherworldly creations is subject to the same human problems that exist today. Those unfamiliar with Herbert’s novel may find themselves at a slight disadvantage when they begin watching Dune. Villeneuve goes the same route as Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings adaptations and does not hold the audience’s hand until terms like ‘Gom Jabbar’, ‘Kwisatz Haderach’, and ‘Shai-Hulud’ are beaten into their brains before moving on. Instead, Villeneuve lets these terms wash over the audience, sinking in if they do but moving on if they don’t. The term isn’t crucial to understand right away, it’s what it represents that matters most. Dune follows Paul as he and the rest of House Atreides leave their home planet of Caladan to accept stewardship over planet Arrakis and oversee the manufacturing of the galaxy’s most important resource: spice. Complications ensue when they arrive on the planet and find that the previous owners, House Harkonnen, have left them with a barely operable spice operation. While House Atreides attempts to get their mining operation back on its feet, plans are set in motion that will have massive ramifications to everyone involved. When people talk about Dune they always bring up the story’s devotion to spice. Why is spice so damn important? Well, the film gives a succinct explanation: it powers everything. Transplanted to modern society, that resource could just as easily be oil or water. Something to be hoarded and privatized. Villeneuve doesn’t spend too much time on the importance of spice other than reiterating how crucial it is that everything runs smoothly so the universe can run smoothly. Instead, where Villeneuve centers Dune is on Paul and the many forces attempting to shepherd him in different directions. He’s heir to the throne and will succeed his father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), but is also being trained by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), to harness the power of the ‘Voice’ and hopefully become the Chosen One, or the Kwisatz Haderach, as instructed by the all-female religious organization known as the Bene Gesserit. Then there are these dreams that Paul continues to have of a girl (Zendaya) on Arrakis that suggests a different path than the two he is being led on. There’s a reason Dune was largely considered unadaptable and it’s immediately evident when you try to explain the plot to someone. It’s a story with many characters, all of which have a significant role to play, even if their character seems minor. It’s the kind of intricate web where it’s almost impossible to follow along completely because everyone has their own motivations guiding them. When you take into account that the opening title card of this film reads “Dune Part One”, it’s clear that Villeneuve had to make the conscious decision to split the book into two parts when adapting it to film. There’s just no way to take a book that dense and turn it into one film without losing so much of its intent (see: David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation). Once a decision like that is made, then comes how the film will be framed. That’s the magic of Dune. There’s this grander narrative initiated behind-the-scenes by the Emperor of the Imperium that forces House Harkonnen and House Atreides at each other’s throats. Spectacle and scale extend out from this conflict, giving Dune its massive scope and astounding setpieces. These range from the first time Paul encounters a sandworm to armies fighting in close-combat to flying through a sandstorm. All accompanied by a dizzying score from Hans Zimmer that features so much variety without losing the film’s scope. These setpieces also lend themselves to a visually gorgeous film that feels like a companion piece to Blade Runner 2049 – Villeneuve’s other ambitious science fiction film. Though this one has less emphasis on lighting and the overall noir aesthetic of Blade Runner, it makes up for it with wide vistas and an equal emphasis on mood and scale. Shot by Greig Fraser, there’s an oppressiveness to a lot of Dune’s composition that mirrors Paul’s own struggle to get out from everyone else’s expectations of him. The production design also helps with that, surrounding each House with brutalist architecture and the planet of Arrakis itself forcing House Atreides indoors to the dimly lit rooms shielded from the sun.  Down a layer from the spectacle is the relationship between Paul and his parents and their separate plans for him. That’s where the film finds its heartbeat. It is not until Paul steps foot on the sands of Arrakis that he appears to have autonomy over himself. A lot of Dune is shot close to the character’s faces, often because they are alone in a room or feel separated from those around them. The relationship between Leto and Jessica is almost entirely told visually with the two of them rarely speaking to each other and yet appearing to love each other wholly and completely. Then there are the relationships Paul has with so many other characters. As royalty, he doesn’t really have friends more so than he has strong bonds with allies. Jason Momoa’s first appearance as Duncan Idaho immediately establishes the close relationship that he and Paul have, even though he is also Paul’s combat instructor. Every character that Paul interacts with immediately feels like there’s a lifetime of camaraderie, even if he might be kept at an arm’s length from the more serious discussions surrounding his life. Dune also works really well because not only does every character feel lived in and end up feeling significant: they’re also played by extremely charismatic actors who do so much in the role. The supporting cast overall is stacked with actors all providing great performances. From Stephen McKinley Henderson to Josh Brolin to David Dastmalchian and Dave Bautista to Javier Bardem and Sharon Duncan-Brewster, there are so many fantastic performances that all lend themselves completely to Villeneuve’s vision. That’s just the supporting cast, all of whom give it their all as if they’ll never get to do a movie like this again. Not only does the casting in the film feel true to Herbert’s novel, it elevates the significance of everything within it. Nothing is just a role that needs to be filled. It’s a character that needs to be lived in. This is to say nothing of the two most important roles in the film, Paul and Jessica. Chalamet isn’t quite revelatory as Paul but he fits the role snugly and does a fantastic job carrying a film that relies heavily on introspection and carrying the burden others have placed on him. It’s really when Dune begins exploring Lady Jessica and starts prying at her character where the MVP of the film’s cast stands tall. Rebecca Ferguson is a powerhouse in this, turning Jessica into a fierce, independent woman, capable of operating with just as much precision in the shadows as in the light. She can juggle the most emotional sequences with ones that demand her to be brutal and royal at the same time. It’s arguably her best performance in a career that has already seen many great roles significantly elevated by her presence. The key to Dune is that it depends on its humanity, so while the science fiction and fantasy elements are there and done well, it’s making sure the characters never feel like “we need an evil henchman” that gives Dune its power. The stakes are just as real for one person as they are the other. Loss is loss, no matter who is involved. It’s easy to follow along with each character’s plight because they’re relatable in some way. This is evident in the recurring idea in House Atreides of the desire to do good when the world seems to be working against you and the attempt to be yourself when external forces pressure you into fulfilling a role. Unfortunately the downside to everything with Dune is that it doesn’t end in a way that will satisfy most narratively. It’s part one of an intended two-part series. Where it leaves things hangs a lot of loose threads that will be entertaining to pick back up with a character who makes a meaningful choice at the end that will define his entire being. As a whole movie, it’s impossible for it to feel complete, but there are not much better ways to end a first part than where it does. At the end of the day, Dune is a triumph. It builds a world and strings together so many narrative threads and characters that it’s mind boggling how well it works. There’s an entire universe to explore, but Villeneuve manages to let it wash over you and fully immerse the audience in its political and religious underpinnings. It’s hard to call it his best movie when it dangles so many unfinished stories in the air, but it is certainly his greatest achievement in almost every respect. Part Two cannot come soon enough.

"Feb 11, 2022",positive," Denis Villeneuve brings his distinctly grandiose style to a classic that has been begging for a big-screen adaptation in the age of blockbuster franchises. And he makes the final product stand out in a big way. Dune: Part One hits theatres on October 21, and you can stream it on HBO Max in the US on the same day from 6PM ET. Dune: Part Two and an HBO Max original series, Dune: Sisterhood are due out in 2023. The story follows the young Paul Atreides as he relocates with his family from his ancestral planet Caladan to the desert planet Arrakis. His father, a duke, has been assigned to oversee the planet by the ruling Empire. Arrakis is where “spice” — a rare and extremely valuable substance used for space travel — is harvested. But upon arrival, it’s clear the Atreides family is a target, most notably of the rival Harkonnen family who want to control the spice and the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen. All the while, Paul is training to master the powers passed down by his mother, a member of the Bene Gesserit, a typically female sect known to many as witches. Paul may be the prophesied Kwisatz Haderach, a powerful messiah, who could be instrumental in the upcoming conflicts on Arrakis. Dune is chock full of major stars too. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul, and he’s joined by Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, and more. The 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune lays out the “making of” a Dune adaptation that never actually materialized. The cult auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky’s take on the source material attracted immense talent, and some initial financial backing, but as its aspirations grew, so did pushback. The project eventually fizzled out. What was left, however, was a huge legacy of creative work that made its way into other projects. Jodorowsky’s Dune has its fingerprints on everything from Star Wars to Alien to Raiders of the Lost Ark to Blade Runner to The Terminator and so many more. Even David Lynch’s own largely reviled 1984 adaptation of Dune has traces of it. It’s fascinating to watch Denis Villeneuve draw very directly from those aesthetics, blending concepts and visuals from both the non-existent Dune and the many films it did inspire. I’m sure someone will eventually edit together a string of inspirations for Villeneuve’s vision, but for now, it’s incredibly rewarding to tease apart the look of the world onscreen and why it’s so familiar. That aesthetic is broadly a grim one. We see distinctly fascist architecture. Ugly brutalist buildings made of concrete populate all of the Imperial worlds. Grotesquely organic-looking machinery also peppers the landscape. And all of that is juxtaposed with gorgeous nature shots, with vast oceans of water, sand, and stars filling the screen. It’s all mesmerizing and verging on sublime. And that’s the bulk of the film’s appeal, really. It’s world-building writ large. There’s a narrative, of course, and characters. But the political intrigue is relatively convoluted. We get bits and pieces of it, often incomplete and drowned out by the majesty of the natural world constantly threatening to eat up the nasty human world — in the case of the giant sandworms of Arrakis, quite literally. Dune is big in every sense. It’s event viewing and doesn’t shy away from the bizarreness of its source material, from the repugnant Harkonnen clan to the recycling of sweat and spit to cryptic visions of a coming messiah. As with his previous film Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve takes a “more is more” approach here, and that means the scale of this thing is truly epic in the classical sense of the word. But it also means the pacing can feel a bit chaotic, rushing through exposition one minute and then just casually hanging out on some sand dunes the next to soak in the beauty. This suits the world-building elements, no doubt. I feel like I could actually visit the planets Arrakis and Caladan. But more, I can believe that they are part of a much bigger, inhabited galaxy without seeing it. These places exist. Their people are real. The resources they fight over are indeed precious and finite. This is the great gift of Dune. It compels us to suspend our disbelief and become immersed in its universe. The Imax screen I saw it on surely didn’t hurt. But I have no doubt Villeneuve’s efforts will still pay off on HBO Max. Of course, by splitting the film in two, Villeneuve is also denying us a great deal of narrative resolution. It would be nice for Dune to feel a little more complete on its own. Villeneuve picks a smart point to end on, but we’re watching the pieces being put in place on the game board without actually seeing a whole lot of gameplay. World-building only goes so far, and at the end of the day, this is effectively the first half of a movie. Maybe none of that matters though, as the film certainly left me wanting a Dune: Part Two. Hopefully, Warner Bros. lets this story live on to its conclusion."
"Feb 10, 2022",positive," Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited adaptation of Dune is contender a for one of the most beautiful science fiction movies of all time that's only let down by a screenplay that lacks any real flair.  It’s here, it’s beautiful, and it’s so bassy it makes you vibrate in your seat: Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited adaptation of Dune has finally premiered on the sunny shores of the Lido at the Venice Film Festival, treating audiences to an astronomically impressive film that favours characterisation over bombastic action.
 The epic—billed in its opening credits as Dune: Part One—isn’t just a contender for one of the most stunning science fiction movies of all time but perfectly strikes the balance of leaving you positively parched for Part Two while never feeling like half a film. With the best Hans Zimmer score of the past decade and endless crisp tableaus of jaw-dropping cinematography, Denis Villeneuve has delivered and then some of his mission to give Frank Herbert’s pioneering novel due diligence on the big screen.
 “Dreams are messages from the deep,” reads the opening message of Dune, setting the tantalizing scene for the following 155 minutes of sheer cinematic prowess. If you’re not overly familiar with the source novel of the same name, Villeneuve has you in safe hands—easily sketching the characters, locations, and backstories for any Arrakis newbies without an annoying sense of spoon-feeding for any diehard Duneheads. The year is 10191, and House Atreides—comprising of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), are readying themselves to leave their home planet of Caladan. Flanked by their Master of Assassins (Stephen McKinley Henderson), weapons master (Josh Brolin), swordmaster (Jason Momoa), and doctor (Chang Chen), they are set to take control of Arrakis, a desert planet home to ‘Spice‘. This sacred hallucinogen not only enhances mental capabilities but is hinted to have potential uses for interplanetary space travel.
 Despite Duke Leto’s early assertion that there is “no call, we do not answer, no faith we do not betray,” House Atreides is rightfully nervous about the move. Arrakis is populated by millions of Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants who are mistrustful of those who continue to colonise their home in order to harvest spice. Fremen members include Chani (Zendaya), a mysterious young woman who continues to appear in Paul’s dreams, and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of one Fremen group on Dune.
 What’s more, Arrakis’ previous rulers—House Harkonnen—aren’t too pleased about being usurped from their role of power and are already ancient enemies of House Atreides. The blancmange-like Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his henchmen Glossu (Dave Bautista), and Piter (David Dastmalchian) scheme to ensure House Atreides are doomed to fail, partnering with an Emperor who is threatened by the growing power and prestige of the family.
 Running alongside these more political struggles for power is a more spiritual search for The One, or ‘Kwisatz Haderach’: someone who can access memories, see the future and exercise superhuman cognitive powers. A mysterious female group known as Bene Gesserit, headed by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), have been cross-breeding different houses in order to try and locate The One. And if that wasn’t enough, the entire planet of Arrakis is in oscillating fear and awe of giant, subterranean sandworms that threaten to consume everything in sight every time they hear a thudding footstep.
 In undoubtedly his best performance since Call Me By Your Name, Timothée Chalamet shines as the central Homeric hero born with an albatross around his neck. He plays Paul Atreides with an athletic angst that stands strong in the film’s airtight ensemble, easily rising to the task of such a demanding, enigmatic role. As well as his trademark vulnerability, all furrowed brow and Byronic curls, Chalamet is forthright and fierce when needed: a believable fledgling leader that exudes his House’s trademark loyalty.
 Another highlight is Rebecca Ferguson, who serves as the film’s emotional core—not as a hackneyed weepy woman trying to protect her family, but a mysterious and spiritual figure who sees horror, fear and destiny in a way that others do not. Grande Dame of cinema Charlotte Rampling draws upon her long history of ‘cold fish’ roles to frighten everyone unlucky enough to cross her steely-eyed path.
 As the brusque weapons master to House Atreides, it’s a shame that Josh Brolin fades into the background; an early training scene with Paul feels merely expository to prove that the young boy can indeed fight when provoked, and the character has little significance beyond that in Part One. However, Jason Momoa proves for the umpteenth time his status as one of the most charismatic men in Hollywood, bringing a recognisable gentle-giant-that-bares-its-teeth energy to the screen. Only really making an appearance over two hours in, we’ll have to wait until Part Two to truly see how Zendaya chews the scene as the blue-eyed Chani and how Javier Bardem’s character will develop beyond an initial blank gruffness.
 Put simply, Dune is a visual feast—nay, banquet—that takes us from stunning locale to stunning locale before you even have time to drink in the exquisite composition. Villeneuve does an excellent job with world-building, making each location fleshed out and unique. Whether it’s the dusty climes of Arrakis with the air alive with specks of glinting gold or the windswept shores of the oceanic Caladan, the feeling is painterly, Turner-esque and truly breathtaking.
 Cinematographer Greig Fraser makes us choke on the dust and sand that fills the planet while never resorting to dull or muddy opacity. Thankfully, Dune avoids the ugly green-screen trappings of many modern films that rely heavily on CGI: it truly feels not like a two-dimensional dystopia but a frightening and possible version of the future, which is exactly what this world is meant to be.
 Filming also took place on location in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, adding real texture that technology often tries and fails to emulate. In particular, one scene that comes around the middle—where we witness spice harvesting interrupted by our first glimpse at a sandworm—is simply breathtaking. Costume designer Jacqueline Goya studied the ochre-toned paintings of Francisco Goya for inspiration in the characters’ clothing, balancing textural history with functional futurism. From the Reverend Mother’s Kamilavka-style headpiece to Lady Jessica’s gold-encrusted veil, each piece hides details about the characters.
 Evoking the eerie, pulsating rhythms that send sandworms into a frenzy, Hans Zimmer’s score is spasmodic, cinema-shaking, eardrum-bursting stuff. The chanting and wailing of female voices reflects the power that Lady Jessica and the rest of the Besse Gesserit have on the direction of the drama, as well as the feminine presence haunting Paul’s dreams.
 While Dune looks incredible, an area that perhaps suffers is the screenplay. Co-adapted for the screen by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Forrest Gump writer Eric Roth, there’s a real absence of literary flair considering the source prose. This is undoubtedly a choice to make the dialogue as natural as possible, but with such visual pomp and ceremony, more talky scenes often feel a little flat. Many characters deliver their lines in irritating, whispery vocal fry, often deployed by actors in an attempt to evoke a sense of hushed dramatism.
 Any poetic phrasing one might hope to see translated from the book seems to be gone, and what dialogue is written doesn’t seem to be utilized to its best effect. With a 400-page novel, you can take time to introduce your dystopia’s concepts and language, but with this film, sometimes the real significance of certain objects and concepts struggle to stick in the memory. A second watch might be needed in order to tell your Gom Jabbars from your Chakobsa.
 Dune is sure to satiate the scepticism of Herbert purists and win over fresh audiences alike. It’s not quite an emotional sucker-punch, but it’s cinema: loud, gorgeous and sorely missed. Denis Villeneuve has described this film as “an appetiser for the second part still to come, which is the main meal.” If that’s the case, then we’re all in for an absolute treat.

"Feb 3, 2022",positive," Of course, that didn't happen. Even the easy availability of free vaccinations didn't persuade a significant segment of the population to embrace science and community over conspiracy and hostility.  What's that have to do with me making my choices for the Best Movies of the Year, as I have done very year since (gulp) 1996?  But now there are reasons beyond convenience to stay home. I frequently go to the movies (the screenings are almost never crowded, and thus feel ""safe""), but who am I to tell you you should?  As a result of this ongoing pandemic reality, I've opened the doors to, well, everything. Though, of course, I've seen only a very tiny fraction of everything.  Most of the movies below did play at a Memphis movie theater or during the Indie Memphis Film Festival in 2021. But a few didn't. And most of those that did screen here probably found their largest audiences at home, via Netflix or Hulu or Amazon or some other streaming service. Opening the doors to everything is intimidating and humbling. I'm very much aware that I likely will encounter in the months to come many movies from 2021 that should be mentioned here.  An unconventional year calls for an unconventional approach. A Top 10 list can be found below, but what you mostly will find here are 13 categories containing most of my choices for the best new-release movies I saw in 2021. I picked ""13"" because this feels like an unlucky year. But it's actually been a good one for movies, if not for the theatrical movie business, and the evidence can be found in these titles. Nobody is making movies that feel more alive than those of Sean Baker. ""Red Rocket,"" the writer-director's follow-up to ""Tangerine"" and ""The Florida Project,"" introduces former MTV ""Veejay"" Simon Baker as Mikey Saber, an energetic but dishonest blowhard hustler on the skids who decides a small-town Texas teenager nicknamed ""Strawberry"" (Suzanna Son) will be his ticket back to the porn-industry big time; the alternately ludicrous and lubricious action occurs against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election, with Mikey functioning as a prophecy of the resilience of the winning candidate's delusional toxic-male narcissism. Working on location with a mostly amateur ensemble, Baker demonstrates yet again that his eye and instincts are unerring. ""Red Rocket"" deserves its R rating, but ""Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn"" — Romania's Oscar entry for Best International Feature — pushes into X territory: It opens with a sexually explicit videotape that lands a teacher (Katia Pascariu) in hot water when her consenting-adult bedroom acrobatics are shared online. With its contentious debates about privacy, its street scenes of pedestrians in protective masks, and its chaotic school conferences filled with preening mothers and leering fathers, Radu Jude's social/political comedy taps like an intubator into a culture gasping for breath. In February, the Japanese writer-director Ryusuke Hamaguchi delivered ""Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy,"" an original anthology film with three segments; he followed that five months later with ""Drive My Car,"" a three-hour Chekhov-infused adaptation of a short story by Haruki Murakami. In Hamaguchi's films, men and women turn to art to redirect the unsatisfying narratives of their lives; the filmmaker manifests this idea with images that are as uncluttered and direct as his stories are rich and his characters complex. Two of the most impressive streaks in cinema continued as Wes Anderson and Paul Thomas Anderson pulled from their youthful enthusiasms and experiences to craft films that function like prisms, refracting what feels like candid revelation into colorful, episodic narrative. Set in the 1970s San Fernando Valley, P. T.  Anderson's ""Licorice Pizza"" makes an instant movie star of pop-rock singer Alana Haim, while also resurrecting water beds, Wings and hairdresser-turned-Barbra Streisand boyfriend Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper). The vibe suggests ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" but goofy. Festooned to the edge of mania with visual marginalia and verbal rococo, ""The French Dispatch,"" meanwhile, is Wes Anderson's indulgent and meticulous homage to The New Yorker magazine, mid-century; the lapidary, peripatetic creativity — which includes animation, multiple frame ratios, and many digital effects — illuminates rather than obscures a hopeful but not naïve message about the agonizing joy of making art. Confesses a James Baldwin-like writer (Jeffrey Wright) in the film's heartbreaking yet energizing final episode: ""I chose this life. It is the solitary feast that has been very much like a comrade — my great comfort and fortification.” Fashioned by drummer-turned-director Questlove and editor Joshua L. Pearson into 117 ecstatic minutes from some 40 hours of footage, “Summer of Soul (Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised…)” teleports the viewer onstage with Sly Stone, Nina Simone, Mahalia Jackson and the other divinities who performed during the all-but-forgotten 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival; 50 years later, the event seems less a “Black Woodstock” (as it once was promoted) than a Utopian vision of Black art and community that a larger white establishment was too hostile or disinterested to validate. The “Utopian” judgment rarely was applied to the often dark, druggy and disturbing music of “The Velvet Underground,” but Todd Haynes’ documentary, sculpted largely from vintage materials, persuasively presents the Warhol-abetted, New York-incubated band as avatars of an enviable rock-and-roll authenticity. Meanwhile, Penny Lane’s revelatory “Listening to Kenny G” is less biodoc than inquisition into the value — as artist, as commodity, as metaphor — of the mega-successful but much-reviled smooth jazz saxophonist of its title. (Note: Peter Jackson’s epic “The Beatles: Get Back” would be included here, but I decided to follow the lead of the motion picture Academy, which excludes multi-part productions.) Updated by writer Tony Kushner for a modern era attuned to ideas of gentrification and racial identity but with its late 1950s setting and nonpareil Leonard Bernstein/Stephen Sondheim music intact, director Steven Spielberg's remake of 1961's ""West Side Story"" demonstrates that bodies in motion — especially when moving in partnership with a sympathetic and perceptive camera — remain the most thrilling movie special effect. A much less conventional opus (the songs are by the clever pop-rock duo Sparks), Leos Carax's catchy-yet-alienating sort-of-musical, ""Annette,"" asks whether a standup-comic ""Ape of God"" (Adam Driver) with a death on his conscience and a living puppet in his nursery deserves redemption. In what functions as director Pablo Larrain's companion to his ""Jackie"" (2016), which cast Natalie Portman as the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy, ""Spencer"" presents Kristen Stewart as a nerve-racked Diana, Princess of Wales, who endures a torturous Christmas weekend with her scornful royal in-laws while in a state of glam delirium. Something wicked this way comes? No, it's just the queen, trailed by her corgis. The wickedness is more deadly and the witches more literal in ""The Tragedy of Macbeth,"" a sinister Shakespeare adaptation from Joel Coen (directing for the first time without his brother, Ethan) that crowns Denzel Washington as the murderous title king and Frances McDormand as his damned-spot-stained lady. Presented in black-and-white and in the squarish aspect ratio of old movies, the film — indebted to the currently fashionable ""folk horror"" subgenre — arguably does little that Orson Welles didn't do in 1948 under the parsimonious oversight of Republic Pictures; but why argue with a new opportunity to experience the unbeatable combination of cinematic expressionism and Shakespearean expression? In Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog,” Benedict Cumberbatch is a 1925 Montana cowboy whose classics degree from Yale is only the most respectable of the extraordinary aspects he buries beneath a foul odor and a fouler temper. In Rebecca Hall’s “Passing,” centered on Harlem a century ago, a Black woman (Ruth Negga) ""passing"" as white disrupts the conventional domestic tranquility of a childhood friend (Tessa Thompson); the black-and-white photography exposes the absurdity of racial codification by reproducing every actor’s face in scales of gray. Finally, Shaka King’s “Judas and the Black Messiah” vividly reimagines encounters from history (""Power"" and ""Passing"" are based on novels) by revisiting the betrayal of Chicago Black Panther Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya, who won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his work here) by an FBI infiltrator (Lakeith Stanfield). Writer-director David Lowery, whose filmography includes 2017’s “A Ghost Story,” weaves another haunting and profound enchantment by tugging at the tapestry of Arthurian tradition in ""The Green Knight""; Dev Patel is Sir Gawain, whose quest —  highlighted by uncanny images that pierce the armor of space and time —  is essentially the literal date with death we all must make. Based in history rather than poetry, Ridley Scott’s “The Last Duel"" casts Matt Damon (who wrote the script, with Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener) and Adam Driver as a real-life medieval French knight and squire, respectively, whose soured friendship ends in a formal fight to the finish. Beautifully and brutally choreographed, the climactic combat is motivated more by the knight's ego than by his concern for the welfare and honor of his wife (Jodie Comer), whose rape by the squire is the cruel crux of a ""Rashomon""-like multiple-perspective story structure. With their most ambitious films to date, two very different filmmakers praise the loud but otherwise employ largely divergent but not entirely incompatible methods to inspire dread and wonder. Shot in Chile by the Cannes-conquering Thai writer-director Apichatpong Weerasethak, ""Memoria"" unfolds with a somnambulist's pace and a dreamer's logic. Tilda Swinton stars as a woman repeatedly startled by a sudden noise that no one else can hear; the climactic revelation is both awe-inspiring and deflating, retroactively and reductively recasting the woman's experience as more a puzzle than a mystery. With a budget of $165 million that could pay for dozens of the Thai filmmaker's projects, ""Dune: Part One"" is surprisingly patient and deliberate for a science-fiction would-be blockbuster. Adapted by director Denis Villeneuve from Frank Herbert's eco-conscious 1965 best-seller, the movie is mesmerizing for much of its three-hour length, especially during its first half, when it prioritizes statecraft and intrigue and augurs and artful arrangements of strangely costumed individuals and strikingly designed alien vessels; when the emphasis shifts to fights and chases, it loses a great deal of its grip. The mystery and trauma of time and the aging process inspired these very different works, each of which screened during the Indie Memphis Film Festival (as did several other films on this list). The first of these, written and directed by France's Céline Sciamma, is ""Petite Maman,"" which presents twins Joséphine and Gabrielle Sanz as 8-year-old girls whose friendship springs from a mystery that is part fairy tale, part ""Twilight Zone."" If Sciamma charms, Gasper Noé shocks (as always). Presented entirely in disorienting split-screen, ""Vortex"" casts Françoise Lebru and horror auteur Dario Argento as an elderly couple whose brains become as disordered as their book-and-memorabilia-crammed Paris apartment after the wife is stricken with dementia. (Honorable mention goes to ""Old,"" which is fearsomely compelling until a final unnecessary M. Night Shyamalan ""twist"" transforms a terrifying metaphor about the pitilessness of old age into what seems to be a pitch for a cable sci-fi series.) Framing its imaginative kills like transgressive artworks within mirrors and windows and gallery spaces, Nia DaCosta's reboot/sequel ""Candyman"" retains the Chicago setting of its influential 1992 predecessor but relocates the shocks to a bougie-artsy 2021 milieu where talent and education ultimately provide no escape or defense from the racist past or present; in this context, ""Say his name"" is more curse than affirmation. ""The Card Counter,"" meanwhile, is another of writer-director Paul Schrader's portraits of fracturing loner diarists (see also: ""Taxi Driver"" and ""First Reformed"") trundling toward penitential violence; Oscar Isaac is the title professional gambler, scarred by his experiences as a guard at Abu Ghraib. Colorful creatures sprung from their cells (in the plots of these movies) and from some type of mythology (in the origins of those plots) go on rampages of destruction and sometimes affection in this pair of tripped-out fantasy adventures.  Written and directed by Dash Shaw with animation directed by Jane Samborski, ""Cryptozoo"" employs watercolor, pencil and other techniques to painstakingly craft a not-safe-for-kids cartoon about a sort of ""Jurassic Park"" for ""cryptids"" from legend and folklore (mermaids, manticores, more). Derived from DC Comics, James Gunn's smart-aleck supervillain team adventure ""The Suicide Squad"" — not to be confused with 2016's one-word-shorter and many-times-awful ""Suicide Squad"" — is a labor of twisted love bursting with genuinely funny sick jokes and sicker characters (Polka-Dot Man shoots out lethal polka dots). As one creatively staged set piece follows another, Gunn's ringmaster's ability to keep the multiple personalities and plot threads distinct and the action coherent deserves a gold star the size of Starro the Conqueror (the giant alien starfish that squashes several cast members during the outrageous finale). If filmmaking for Julie functions as a form of demon-purging therapy, it's an activity that invites demons — or something dangerous and unknowable — in Iván Zulueta's ""Arrebato,"" a 1979 masterwork of Bava-esque colors, Bergmanesque dislocation and Cronenbergian raptures from Spain that was unseen in the U.S. until its restoration this year. Like ""The Souvenir,"" ""Arrebato"" contains a sophisticated junkie, in this case a maker of junky horror movies; masterfully played by Eusebio Poncela, he drives past elaborate Madrid movie marquees advertising ""Phantasm"" and ""Superman"" as he chases new ways of seeing — and being. The Top Ten (actually 11, in order of preference, more or less): 1. ""Red Rocket."" 2. ""Drive My Car"" + ""Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy."" 3. ""The French Dispatch."" 4. ""Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn."" 5. ""Spencer."" 6. ""Arrebato."" 7. ""The Power of the Dog."" 8. ""The Green Knight."" 9. ""Summer of Soul."" 10. ""Cryptozoo."" The Second Ten (in alphabetical order): 1. ""Annette."" 2. ""Candyman."" 3. ""The Card Counter."" 4. ""Dune: Part One."" 5. ""The Last Duel."" 6. ""Licorice Pizza."" 7. ""The Suicide Squad."" 8.

"Feb 1, 2022",positive," Mesmerising world building and a star-studded cast brings  a new aesthetic pleasing sheen to Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel Dune,  director Denis Villeneuve’s latest successful sci-fi action epic that brings  art back to the blockbuster. Set in the year 10,191, Dune stars Timothee Chalamet  as Paul, son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) leader of the affluent House Atreides.  Haunted by visions of his destiny on another world, Paul is thrust into a  political war when the emperor transfers power of resource rich desert planet Akkaris  from the tyrannical House Harkonnen to House Atredis. When House Harkonnen,  under the rule of the gargantuan and methodically evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen  (Peter Skarsgaard) attack House Atreides, Paul finds himself on the run and in  alliance with the Fremen, the indigenous people of Akkaris led by Stilgar  (Javier Bardem.) Where Christopher Nolan dropped the ball with the  frustratingly confusing Tenet, fellow thinking-man blockbuster director  Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2099) continues to impress with  his big-game approach to filmmaking the perfect alternative to those frustrated  with the superhero genre. While Dune deals with many of the same themes that  you would find in a Marvel movie, the source material by Frank Herbert combined  with the excellent craftmanship that Dune employs results in a sci-fi  fantasy epic that is uniquely its own, a first chapter to a different kind of  space epic that has a maturity to its character that doesn’t sacrifice from the  spectacle of its action-adventure elements.  With Grieg Fraser (Lion) as cinematographer,  along with production designer Patrice Vermette (Arrival), and  costume design by Robert Morgan and Jacqueline West (The Revenant), Dune must be the most aesthetically striking film of the year, a collage  of bold imagery that exceptionally presents its other worldly element. While  the term “world building” is used loosely, it is one that applies here and then  some, Villeneuve taking Herbert’s words and creating imagery epic and  beautiful, not to mention a sci-fi story completely engrossing in its tale of  fate, war, treachery and (of course) good versus evil. As with many sci-fi epics, there is a density to Dune that may take some not used to this style of sci-fi filmmaking a moment or two  to catch on, yet screenwriters Eric Roth (Munich), Jon Spaihts (Doctor  Strange), and Villeneuve himself, along with editor Greg Fraser (Zero  Dark Thirty) keep the story digestible and moving at a comfortable  pace.  An all-star cast of actors are terrific. Oscar Isaac  brings a gravitas as a king with the weight of a world on his shoulders;  Rebecca Ferguson is mesmerising as a queen who recognises her son’s greater  destiny; Jason Mamoa is savagely good as a warrior of honour and violence; and  Peter Skarsgaard is a horrifying vision of gluttonise greed personified. In the end it is Timothee Chalamet who is the figurehead  of this sure-to-be franchise, and as Paul the Oscar nominee brings not only the  dramatic and action-man chops to the role, but an ethereal quality to a saviour  figure character that is easy to root for."
"Jan 26, 2022",positive," The world is a confusing place right now. We believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs. Do you believe that too? Help TGC bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work. Twenty years ago this month, Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring released in theaters. I was a freshman at Wheaton College and went to see it with a group of dorm friends. It was a magical, memorable movie-going experience; awesomely cinematic and transportive. In retrospect, I wonder if that trilogy was the last great “big” cinematic event. With the exception of Christopher Nolan’s films and Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life, few movie-going experiences have matched the awe I experienced watching Lord of the Rings. Will we ever have movies like that again?  Movie-watching is changing. The screens are smaller, the experience less communal. For all but the biggest-tentpole superhero movies, most people seem to prefer watching movies from the convenience of home. How will the evolving economics of Hollywood change the nature of the films produced? Time will tell. In the meantime, interesting and soul-enriching films are still being made. On that note, the following is my list of the best films of 2021. These are the movies that, in my estimation, were the most excellent, memorable, thoughtful, theologically interesting, and redemptive releases of the year. As always, viewers should use discretion in terms of content. Though I chose only movies that are in some way edifying—depicting goodness, truth, or beauty in ways Christian viewers can celebrate—several films on my list are rated R or TV-MA and should be viewed with caution and discernment. Few films gave me more joy this year than Kenneth Branagh’s semi-autobiographical film about a working class family in 1960s Belfast. Though The Troubles of Protestant-Catholic conflict are in the background in important ways—the foreground here is family: three generations of a Northern Irish Protestant family who have called Belfast home for ages. I love so much about this movie: its depictions of traditional married love; the awe and innocence of 9-year-old Buddy; the beautiful embrace of membership in community and place; the celebration of cinema and beauty (dancing!) even amid the reality of death. But perhaps most of all, I love how Belfast captures the sehnsucht longing that another Northern Irish Protestant—C. S. Lewis—once described. As permanent as it feels in our hearts, “home” in this life is always a phantom, and family a photo-book of ever-fading memories. Yet even as they slip away, these things point our souls in the direction of the permanent place and everlasting community for which we were made. Now in theaters or available to stream at home. Rated PG-13. I went into Dune with zero context, having never read Frank Herbert’s novel or seen the 1984 movie version. I worried I’d be lost in such a complex sci-fi universe—and I was, a little. But it’s a testament to director Denis Villeneuve’s command of the cinematic language that tracking with the intricacies of plot didn’t matter as much as the big-canvas power of awesome visuals, sound design, and deep immersion into a well-established world. Villeneuve doesn’t spoon-feed audiences with tiresome exposition—he simply says, “Put on your seatbelt and come along for a ride.” What a ride it is (read TGC’s review). More than any movie this year, Dune gave me hope that big screen, big movies, with big ideas, have a future. In theaters now. Rated PG-13. When it released in July, I called Edson Oda’s Nine Days “2021’s most spiritually curious film.” I’d still stand by that. A Spike Jonze-esque surrealist drama about “soul candidates” vying for a chance at life, the indie film explores the most fundamental questions of existence. Why do we exist when we didn’t have to? If an omnipotent God has the power to create life, why doesn’t he intervene when life goes so excruciatingly awry? Even if not all of the film’s ideas are logical or sound, enough of them are provocative and profound to warrant the applause of thoughtful Christian viewers. This is the rare film that takes pain seriously but sincerely leads audiences to appreciate the preciousness, and sacred mystery, of life. Available to rent. Rated R. If you’ve seen Paul Schrader’s First Reformed (which topped my list in 2018), you know the Calvin College-educated director has a complicated Christian faith. Though less overt in its religious concerns, Schrader’s The Card Counter—starring Oscar Isaac as the titular character—is no less steeped in theology and Christian ideas like atonement, forgiveness, love, and reconciliation. What is Schrader trying to say about these biblical themes? It’s a fascinating film to watch and discuss (read my TGC review) because the answer to that question is far from obvious. Available to rent. Rated R. Sometimes you understand what you love about a movie by thinking about it in contrast to another. This was my exercise in June, when I saw A Quiet Place 2 and Cruella back-to-back. The piece I wrote about the two films—how one examines the making of heroism, while the other ponders the origins of vice—was probably the most enjoyable film analysis I wrote in 2021. It made me appreciate how John Krasinski’s film—in addition to being just a really taut, well-made thriller—effortlessly depicted the goodness and legacy of heroic, sacrificial fathers and mothers. Hollywood doesn’t love celebrating the virtues of traditional, one-dad-and-one-mom families. But audiences do, because it’s beautiful to see. Watch on Paramount+. Rated PG-13. Rare is the film that subverts expectations and surprises you. But when movies like this come along, out of the blue, it’s a thrill. Pig was the surprise, subversive, grace-soaked film of 2021. Nicolas Cage turns in one of his career-best performances as Robin, a Portland chef whose career lost its course after his wife’s death. When his beloved truffle-hunting pig is stolen, Robin is sent to the brink. A film about how we respond to tragedy and injustice, Pig is both timely and timeless. As Mitch Wiley wrote in his TGC review, it’s “one of the most subtly theological films of the year.” Watch on Hulu. Rated R.  Parenting is scary. That’s the short summary of Mike Mills’s resonant film, starring Joaquin Phoenix as an uncle who must watch over his nephew (Woody Norman) for an extended period of time. I don’t think I’ve seen a film that captures so well the unique terror, confusion, exhaustion, and joy of 21st-century parenting. But even while C’mon C’mon is honest about the challenges of raising kids in a world fraught with peril, it makes a beautiful case as to why it’s worth it. At a time of plummeting fertility rates, films like this both reflect the reasons for a decline in child-rearing—and challenge us to reverse course, embracing children as a miraculous gift. Now in theaters or available to stream at home. Rated R. As its title suggests, this is a pretty intense film. Decidedly arthouse and unusual in every way, Robert Machoian’s indie film is nevertheless a powerful apologetic for marital fidelity and a father’s leadership in the home. Even if it’s weird, stick with it for its brief duration (85 minutes). Clayne Crawford plays David, a man fighting to hold his family together after his marriage starts to fall apart. Though the film starts bleak, it progressively gets more hopeful (in fits and starts)—displaying both the dangers of trifling with a sacred covenant, and the valor of fighting to restore it. Watch on Hulu. Rated R. On one hand, Sian Heder’s CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) is a standard coming of age story. High school senior Ruby (Emilia Jones) faces the tension of staying to help her family’s fishing business, or going off to college to make her own way. The twist here is that Ruby’s parents and older brother are deaf—and Ruby has always been the family’s translator to the wider world. If Ruby, who is a talented singer, leaves for college, how will they fare without her? The film is a tender celebration of the resilience of a family unit and the beauty of mutually sacrificial, self-giving love. Watch on AppleTV+. Rated PG-13. Benedict Cumberbatch had a good year. He earned accolades for The Power of the Dog (a film I didn’t love) and played a big role in the year’s biggest blockbuster, Spider-Man: No Way Home. But for my money, his performance in The Courier was the best. Dominic Cooke’s historical spy film tells the riveting true story of a businessman (Cumberbatch) recruited by British intelligence agencies to deliver messages from a Soviet secret agent. Among its many virtues, the film contains an all-too-rare depiction of sincere and lasting male friendship, and celebrates a bygone era when it wasn’t abnormal to sacrifice one’s personal interests for the sake of a larger community or cause. Watch on Amazon Prime Video. Rated PG-13. Drive My Car, Encanto, The Green Knight, Mass (TGC review), Licorice Pizza, The Most Reluctant Convert (TGC review), Our Friend (TGC review), Spiderman: Far From Home, Swan Song, West Side Story. “One of the coolest feelings a human can experience is to feel so small in a world that’s so big.” This sentiment is expressed by solo climber ​​Marc-André Leclerc, the eccentric subject of this fascinating documentary (which also features commentary by Alex Honnold of Free Solo fame). It’s a powerful look at the intoxicating transcendence of pushing the limits of our “so small” capacity in a “so big” world. Watch on Netflix. Rated PG-13. Luke Holland’s Final Account is an important documentary about the final surviving participants in the Nazi regime. The film is based on over 300 interviews—compiled over 10 years—with German and Austrian men and women who had varying degrees of involvement in the machinery of Hitler’s Third Reich. As I wrote in my TGC review, the film displays the beauty of repentance, as well as the ugliness of refusal to take ownership for sin. Watch on Netflix. Rated PG-13. Are we living in a simulation? That’s the central question explored in Rodney Ascher’s mind-bending musing on games, reality, and virtual reality. At times philosophical, theological, and often just plain nerdy, the documentary is a thought-provoking addition to the growing discourse around the metaverse and the nature of reality in the digital age. Watch on Hulu. Not rated. This documentary is essentially a filmed version of illusionist Derek Delgaudio’s stage show—which is a fascinating blend of magic, memoir, and a sort of spoken word poetry for the Age of Authenticity. However you describe it, the film is captivating from start to finish, as much for its “how’d he do that?” trickery as for its “who am I?” existentialism. Watch on Hulu. Rated TV-MA. I’m a sucker for history documentaries, and this is a good one. Based in part on newly declassified or recently discovered documents, Sam Pollard’s film looks at J. Edgar Hoover’s surveillance campaign to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. as he rose in prominence during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. It’s a sobering and instructive film on a number of levels. Watch on Hulu. Rated TV-PG. Painful to watch, but essential viewing, Robert Greene’s film follows six men as they together process the trauma of being abused by Catholic priests as boys. Utlizing drama therapy, the men reconstruct harrowing memories from their #churchtoo experiences that are interspersed through the film. The stories of church abuse survivors must continue to be told in films like this. And Christians must have ears to hear. Watch on Netflix. Rated R.  “Generosity is the beginning of everything.” That’s a line spoken by the widow of a hero who died in the 2018 cave rescue of a Thai soccer team. It’s a sentiment that captures the overall feel of this stirring, feel-good film—an account not only of a massive and impressive logistical operation, but a testimony to the beauty of volunteerism, cooperation, and heroic sacrifice. Watch on Disney+. Rated TV-14. My expectations are admittedly low for faith-based films/documentaries. Too often they are unsubtle and agenda-driven, rather than truly curious about exploration. Send Proof was a surprise (read my TGC review). The film—directed and narrated by Elijah Stephens—is a balanced look at various perspectives on Christianity’s supernatural claims, particularly the present-day occurrence of miracles. Available to purchase and stream.  The directorial debut of musician Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, Summer of Soul is a concert film of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival—assembled from “found footage” that spent the last 50 years in a basement. Beautiful on its own terms as a record of a moment in cultural time, the film also raises questions about how our understanding of history is shaped by what gets recorded, what gets lost, and by whom. Watch on Hulu. Rated PG-13. If you watch one film about truffle-hunting animals this year, let it be Pig (see #6 on my list above). But if you watch two (and I hope you do), make time for The Truffle Hunters. Captivating, joyful, and beautifully shot, this documentary follows a handful of aging Italian men who forage for white Alba truffles in Piedmont forests, with their beloved dogs. Available to rent. Rated PG-13. Brett McCracken is a senior editor and director of communications at The Gospel Coalition. He is the author of The Wisdom Pyramid: Feeding Your Soul in a Post-Truth World, Uncomfortable: The Awkward and Essential Challenge of Christian Community, Gray Matters: Navigating the Space Between Legalism and Liberty, and Hipster Christianity: When Church and Cool Collide. Brett and his wife, Kira, live in Santa Ana, California, with their three children. They belong to Southlands Church, and Brett serves as an elder. You can follow him on Twitter."
"Jan 24, 2022",positive," Imagine if Star Wars: A New Hope, Part One ended overlooking Mos Eisley as Obiwan says, “You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.” Director Denis Villeneuve’s much anticipated rework of Frank Herbert’s Dune was held back from theaters an entire year, and film production reportedly stopped while waiting for a release date. Unlike David Lynch’s 1984 Dune trying to cram an entire book into one movie (and cutting it to ribbons trying to make it fit), Villeneuve wanted to take the time to tell the story. Film technology has come a long way in almost forty years, too, so better tools are available to realize the beloved science fiction novel. The trailers tease the vast scope of the saga and how small mere humans are in comparison, but since we’re only getting part of the first book, how complete can Part One actually be? The new Dune is, for lack of a better word, incredible — not just Arrakis but the entire production design. The dragonfly-looking ornithopters, for example, have never before looked so plausible or realistic, even down to the labels on the instrument gauges; the level of detail is astounding. Even taking its time, however, key parts of the story are still glossed over, particularly the political intrigue and machinations; its always a little sad when modern audiences can’t be trusted with in-story reasons why characters engage in action sequences. What does appear on-screen is exhilarating, making the runtime feel much shorter than it is by the time the credits roll.  Unlike The Fellowship of the Ring telling a lot of story up to a known stopping point, Dune Part One feels more like a down-payment on the promise of more. Zendaya’s Chani is barely in it, Chalamet’s Paul is just getting interesting before the credits, and the film ends on a glimmer of hope when things are darkest. It’s the bottom of the first huge hill on a spectacular roller coaster launching into a dark tunnel just before bonking your head on a “to be continued” sign and being asked to leave the ride. Not a spoiler, but withholding “Part One” from the title is like leaving “Of Mars” off of John Carter; you’re not fooling anyone, folks.  It isn’t fair to compare the Lynch film — with a production aesthetic eerily similar to Krull if you really think about it — to the Villeneuve film’s stillsuits and spacecraft following a decade of superhero movie effects. Dune 2021 looks huge; bigger screens and speakers are going to show and boom more. There’s also a lot of emotion packed into it — you can’t stage a coup without breaking a few people’s backs — and these folks enjoy seizing the day and night. The worst part now is the wait — locking down the cast, getting new things built, and actually filming and editing the thing — but as of this writing, Dune: Part Two is slated for Fall 2023. Dune Part One is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images, suggestive material, and whoa… sandworms! You hate ’em, right? I hate ’em myself! To be fair, David Lynch filmed many, many hours worth of material for the 1984 film. However, it wasn’t his choice for most of that film to hit the cutting room floor. In fact, it was the studio who requested the cut down. It’s part of the reason David Lynch wanted his name removed from the final theatrical cut. The studio wouldn’t agree. He did have his wish granted for the extended TV release when his name was removed and replaced by one of the last uses of the ‘Alan Smithee’ pseudonym. It’s too bad the studio, in 1984, didn’t have the foresight to agree to a multipart film series seeing the amount of film left on the floor. It certainly would have made the film more cohesive (and longer). However, one change that I didn’t really like was turning House Harkonnen into mostly disgusting blobs when I believe they were intended to be much more regal in nature, in similar form to House Atreides. Considering Jessica was the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, that blob issue doesn’t really make sense. The funny thing is, a few months ago I listened to the Dune audiobook. I found the 1984 film pretty much followed the book in lock step all the way to the end, save more description in the book and less details in the film. The DL Dune film did tell the vast majority of the Dune story to completion without missing the major beats. As for this updated film, I’ve not yet seen it. Though, I guarantee it will be compared to both the 1984 movie and 2000 TV Miniseries versions. Whether it will be ‘better’ is really a matter of opinion. I actually liked the 1984 movie. I’m probably one of the few who did. The reason I liked it was its cerebral nature. It required you to think through the plot even after the film was over. In other words, it took two or maybe three viewings before you “got” everything that was going on in the film. There are a lot of subtle, but important details throughout that film that are easily misunderstood. our group was divided on Dune.
the two guys who read the books liked it.
none of the girls did. hate might be a better word.
the two guys who did not read the book kinda/sorta
found it boring. boring, slow, and pointless. I suspect one reason the females didn’t like it was the general treatment of females in that universe. Females in the Dune universe are more-or-less not treated as equals to the males. The men hold the power, the females are treated as servants, concubines and forced into arranged marriages. The female group, which held any power in Dune universe, the Bene Gesserit, were almost universally hated. The Bene Gesserit were tolerated only because of their foreseeing abilities. Dune is a hard read, to be sure. However, it doesn’t help the way that the female gender is portrayed in the story material. This situation also doesn’t much improve in the later novels. To be fair, Frank Herbert completely avoids the “Damsel in Distress” theme throughout the Dune novels, at least the the ones I’ve read so far. He instead treats the characters more matter-of-factly and realistically. Meaning, when Alia goes insane because of her inability to handle her inherited memories, she isn’t treated as needing saving. In fact, it’s just the opposite. They treat her as damaged goods. Instead, she is effectively moved out of the way to “minimize” her damage. Her position of power within House Atreides combined with her abilities, does cause many to treat her with kid gloves, but never as a “Damsel in Distress”."
"Jan 11, 2022",positive," Home › Recommendation › Films To Watch › The bonus features accompanying Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part One” delight longtime fans while enriching the experience of the novice. There are some works of science fiction that never seem to let go once they get their grasp on society. William Gibson’s Neuromancer was published in 1984, but it still felt just as vital and prescient when I read it in graduate school in the mid-2000s in its exploration of humanity’s interlocking life with technology. It pre-dates the Wachowski’s The Matrix (1999), which is more widely known and is a film which clearly drew inspiration from Gibson’s novel. Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 was published in 1953, yet the concepts of government control of what information should or shouldn’t be accessed remains prevalent as Senate Bill 1142 is set to go into effect in the 2022-2023 school year, a law allowing parents to report inappropriate library books and earn a fee if the books remain, while the librarian will be punished. As much as we’d like not to panic in our quest to understand life, the universe, and everything, the notions of these great forward thinkers linger in the air even more now than they did at the times of their writing. Enter Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune. Inspired by his observations of a conservation attempt along the Oregon coastline, he imagined a story of incredible fantasy that explored the intersection of nature, tribalism, and capitalism. Though attempts have been made to adapt this work, none seem to have done so faithfully until Denis Villeneuve (Arrival; Blade Runner 2049) with his 2021 release, Dune: Part One, coming available on home video. In the year 10191, the expansion of life has grown to the point of interplanetary travel throughout the universe and families overlooking entire planets as part of the new empire, led by Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. In order to achieve space travel safely at near-light speeds, the ships require a key ingredient, called spice, found on the harsh planet Arrakis. This planet has been overseen by House Harkonnen for the last 80 years…that is until Shaddam transferred control from Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to House Atreides’s Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), whose family currently oversees the planet Caladan. Under direct orders, Leto moves his people to Arrakis, including his companion Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), making plans to develop a partnership with the natives of Arrakis, known as Fremen, so that there can be harmony where House Harkonnen used violence and discord to rule. But while the House that manages spice production has the opportunity to earn untold riches, Leto’s more interested in how he can best serve those around him, making him a formidable adversary in the emperor’s game of galactic chess. L-R: Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides and Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides in Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure DUNE, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Having never read the book, I will not be making a comparison between the two forms of the story. What I will do is offer a perspective on the film through the lens of someone who is not already versed in the Shakespearean tribulations that befall House Atreides and the potential rise of Paul Atreides as the One. L-R: Director Denis Villeneuve and Javier Bardem on the set of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure DUNE, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Credit to Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Doctor Strange), and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born) in adapting Herbet’s work because this film is a meal and it’s not even complete. Most screenwriters attempt to make their stories as accessible as possible, often using excessive exposition or taking additional steps to spell things out so that none in the audience are left behind. For the most part, Villeneuve isn’t interested in holding anyone’s hand in the film, presenting things naturally for the characters, placing them first above the audience. This reverence is apparent throughout the film, as characters discuss the faith system of the Bene Gesserit (of which Lady Jessica is a member), the prophecy of Lisan al Gaib (translated to “Voice from the Outer World”) that both the Bene Gesserit and Arrakians believe in, as well as just identifying but not explaining what a cyrsknife is, the true significance of the Gom Jabbar sequence, and many other moments. If the prior sentence seemed like a word salad, to an audience member without the reference point of the book, that’s what it feels like watching Dune for the first time. I say “for the first time” because, despite the feeling of separation as one tries to navigate the political and personal relationships of the characters, trying to understand the significance of some of the relationships to characters we barely spend time with and more, we *want* to come back. We *want* to understand. Villeneuve uses the full power of cinema to help connect relationships or intent so that, even if we can’t fully comprehend what’s happening, we’ll know that it has meaning, we just need to be patient to understand it. For instance, in an early scene where Lady Jessica is having breakfast with Paul, he asks for her to pass her some water and she tells him to use the Voice. They don’t explain what it is, but there’re plenty of context clues between what is spoken, the actors’ performances, and what Villeneuve shows us to understand what’s happening as Paul speaks and it’s more than Chalamet’s voice that’s heard speaking. We can infer from the tight focus on Paul that he’s focusing, we can infer some significance of the location as Villeneuve jumps to objects of historical significance in the room, and this allows us to consider that the voices we hear are the combination of Paul and the people tied to those objects. It’s a moment which implies that the training Paul’s receiving from his mother, the way of the Bene Gesserit, enables him to tap into his ancestors to use this gift. Did I make this realization on the first watch? Nope. But I could feel it meant something. Gratefully, it began to click with the second watch and the bonus features included with the home release confirmed it. In more than one home release review I’ve praised bountiful bonus features and mourned the entire absence of them. Whether a brief featurette or a short film, either of these enable the audience to learn something extra about a film they care enough about to purchase. Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One offers a feast of materials that compliment that meal that is the film itself. Good bonus materials will enhance the experience of the film through new insights into the narrative or by offering behind the scenes details. Dune: Part One does both *and* includes materials which elaborate on content that readers of the novel are more likely to be aware of, but that the movie didn’t take the time to discuss. Because of this, if you enjoyed the film, but didn’t read the book, I recommend jumping into the bonus features before rewatching the film. Not only is it a joyous experience (not sure I’ve ever seen so many cast and crew members absolutely giddy as they work or describe their work), but it’s incredibly informative. In the film, Lady Jessica is dressed down by Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) for having a boy when the Bene Gesserit are supposed to have girls, creating a suggestion that Lady Jessica made a choice rather than the usual 50/50 odds most parents face. Thanks to the two-minute featurette “Filmbooks: The Bene Gesserit,” I now know that members of the Bene Gesserit possess such control over their bodies that they are impervious to poison and can, yes, determine the genetics of their gestating children. On first watch, Reverend Mother’s line could be taken as disappointment at the accident of Paul, but, after watching the featurette, it’s easy to see that there’s more than disappointment, there’s frustration by Lady Jessica’s purposeful action of giving birth to a boy. This sets up a later reveal, courtesy of Paul’s psychedelic spice trip, that future Lady Jessica will join the Fremen and become a leader within it, displaying that while Lady Jessica is a loyal member of the Bene Gesserit, she has her agency — reckless or thoughtful is to be determined. Details like this are all over the featurettes, not just the filmbooks, offering bits of insight that benefit the novel illiterate and the cinematically impressed. If you reside in the latter, make sure to check out each of the technical featurettes. My personal favorites are “Designing the Sandworm” and “A New Soundscape,” as they overlap in their discussion of the sound design and mix present in the film. For those who have seen the film, you’re aware of the thumpers used on Arrakis to distract or attract the Sandworms. In “Designing the Sandworm,” not only are you walked through the process of how the creature was designed for the film from a physical and a physics perspective, but how they sound. In this case, it’s discussed how the sound of the thumper is intentional, mimicking the sound Paul hears when the Sandworm “speaks” to him. Watching the film once, the tool is merely understood as it’s explained to us, the audience, but, with this additional information, suddenly the Arrikian tool transforms into something far more deliberate and thoughtful. Going further, “A New Soundscape” explores not only how to capture the sounds of the fictional Arrakis, but the sounds of Dune itself, pushing composer Hans Zimmer (Gladiator) to find entirely new sounds and new instruments to create the score. As you’ll learn in the bonus features, both Villeneuve and Zimmer are enormous fans of the novel, so they strove to make everything as unique as possible. Zimmer even mentions watching a certain popular space opera/action film that opened with French Horns and, when seeing it, he wondered how humanity evolved so far away from us yet sounded just like us. It’s not a denigration on that particularly famous and beloved score or auditory cue, it’s an acknowledgement of how Zimmer wanted to approach Dune so that even the music felt unique and a bit foreign. Tidbits like this are strewn throughout the more than 71-minutes of materials included on the 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and digital editions. Keep in mind as you pick your home release edition that the bonus features may be included on these editions, but the 4K UHD disc itself contains no materials. You need access to the Blu-ray or the digital edition to enjoy the bonus features. The DVD edition only includes the eight-minute “The Royal Houses” featurette. L-R: Director/co-writer/producer Denis Villeneuve and Timothée Chalamet on the set of Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure DUNE, a Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary release. If you’ve seen the film, there’s a constant physicality to it that frequently makes the impossible feel as tangible as the device you’re reading this review on. Part of that is the intricate detail in every aspect of Patrice Vermette’s (Arrival) production design and Jacqueline West (The Revenant) and Robert Morgan’s (Maleficent: Mistress of Evil) costume design, as well as the fact that Villeneuve purposefully built as much as was reasonable in order to make the performances as authentic as possible. Only then did he use CG so as to marry the physical and the digital to create plausible sequences that trick the mind into belief. In the five-minute featurette “Constructing the Ornithopters,” it’s discussed in the process of designing the machines based on loose descriptions from the novel, showing how the cast and crew used these physical objects in their scenes, and then walking us through how the crew recorded helicopters to find the right camera angles so that they could then digitally replace them. Doing this may be a lot of work, yet the results speak for themselves as not once does the camera go somewhere inauthentic to reality, thereby supporting the illusion of cinema. As great as the bonus materials are, there is a small case of “buyer beware” that you should know about before deciding which version of the film to purchase. For context, I’ve seen the film in three forms: first in 4K UHD streaming via HBO Max (there was no local press screening offered), second in Blu-ray on my 63in plasma, and a third partial viewing in 4K UHD on my 43in 4K UHD television. I mention this because anyone who’s been a fan of Dune the property or who followed the entertainment news ahead of the theatrical release is aware that Villeneuve wasn’t happy about the HBO Max simul-release because he felt his film should be seen in theaters. It’s easy to be glib about this notion as COVID’s variants continue to plague us and the capitalist response continues to hurt the social one (right in line with Dune’s message, amusingly), but after enjoying all the bonus features, there’s a shift from viewing Villeneuve’s desire for theater-only viewing as an elitist one toward an artist’s plea. Everything about Dune: Part One is designed for the theater, from the IMAX cameras to the sound design and score. They knew that it would be viewed at home eventually, but the aim was to create as immersive a theatrical experience as possible. Why does this matter now? In revisiting the film via Blu-ray, I noticed that the more CG-heavy scenes felt flat by comparison to my initial 4K streaming watch. The lack of depth created even more distance between myself and the story (even though I was more familiar with the material) because I could sense the falseness in the art. To its credit, the home release mix is superb, my 5.1 Yamaha stereo producing immaculate sound, even in its geriatric age, which conveyed the otherworldliness that Zimmer intended. By contrast, when I went back to the 4K UHD disc and watched several of the scenes that felt off, the enhanced picture generated the sense of texture and depth which existed in my initial 4K streaming watch. The sound, coming through my far younger 5.1 Yamaha sound system, took full advantage of the TrueHD Dolby sound mix, convincingly making me feel as though as I traveling alongside Paul on his journey of self-discovery. In short, if you’re planning to purchase a copy and can watch it in 4K UHD, that’s the version you want. Anything short of that may result in a cinematic experience that won’t live up to the vastness of Dune. Dune is a narratively complex film. If I felt like I was capable of writing about that complexity with any authority, I would. As I haven’t read the book and what Villeneuve has given us is Part One, nothing I could write on its obvious correlation between global imperialism and the Middle East, capitalism, and conservation would hold water and water is a precious resource. Instead, all I can speak with any kind of certainty, for now, is that I *want* to see Part Two in order to complete the story and consider all its parts. If you’re interested in a deep dive of Dune: Part One and haven’t read Roxana Hadadi’s article “Dune Has a Desert Problem,” I can’t recommend it enough. That offered fascinating insights which I can’t possibly fully comprehend until after Villeneuve completes his adaptation. But before I saw Part One, I possessed zero interest at all in the film. Now, between a yearning to finish the story and Hadadi’s insights, Part Two has become an anticipated release in whichever form I am able to see it in."
"Jan 9, 2022",positive," Frank Herbert's Dune is… complex. Even that doesn't seem to communicate just how gigantic and seemingly convoluted the iconic book is. David Lynch famously adapted the 1965 novel into a feature film, which isn't fondly remembered by anyone and Alejandro Jodorowsky also tried to adapt the book into a movie in the 70s, but failed to complete the project. Dune has become notorious for being a difficult, perhaps unfilmable piece of science-fiction literature.  The latest to tackle the challenge is Denis Villeneuve. The director has already mastered complicated sci-fi with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, but can anything really prepare one to tell a story as massive as Dune? Villeneuve has certainly given it his all and the end result is a visually ravishing, but at times hollow film.  Dune follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) who is moved to the planet Arrakis. Paul has been plagued by strange visions of Arrakis as well as a mysterious girl with blue eyes, a characteristic of those who have lived on Arrakis and ingested the planet's valuable asset, Spice, for a long time. The House Atreides are an easy target on the ruthless planet and soon, they are betrayed, leaving Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) at the mercy of the desert. Dune, as expected, looks great. But looking good for a film of this scale feels like the bare minimum. The real challenge of adapting Dune is to make a coherent, entertaining film that not only makes sense, but never talks down to its audience and that's where Villeneuve succeeds, for the most part at least. The first 30 minutes of the film is clumsy and exposition-heavy; there is simply so much to set up, so much to cover that any filmmaker would buckle under that. Zendaya's soothing voice guides us into the world of Dune and introduces us to Arrakis, before we change to the point of view of Paul.  It takes a while for Dune to get going. Once the script, penned by Eric Roth, Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve, gets past the inevitable introductions, the story of political power struggles becomes compelling and Dune is constantly a thrilling watch. Some of the attempted humour falls flat and Dune takes itself way too seriously. Villeneuve's world often lacks warmth and even humanity as characters come and go without distinct personalities or agenda. Arrakis might be scorching, but Dune is at times cold.  Villeneuve's vision of Dune is clear and surprisingly concise. The story, while gigantic in scale, feels accessible and Arrakis feels both ancient and futuristic. It's mostly made out of sand and stone and unlike most science-fiction films, Dune's world is dirty and tangible, close enough to ours to feel real but fantastical enough to provide a sense of utopia. Arrakis can get visually a little bland and repetitive but cinematographer Greig Fraser captures the sand dunes and vast desert impressively.  The sound design of Villeneuve's film, including Hans Zimmer's monumental score, is eardrum-bursting, sometimes needlessly so. Increased volume doesn't always guarantee a more immersive viewing experience and Dune would be a stronger film if it didn't constantly try to outdo itself and be the biggest film of 2021. Villeneuve confidently guides the story but often gets too lost in it and Herbert's detailed mythology and loses the sense of intimacy he works to build. There are simply too many characters and too many actors, all of whom are on fine form.  All of Villeneuve's cast bring their A-game. Chalamet is confident, if at times comically brooding as Paul. Paul isn't an easy role as he's often frustratingly emotionless, like a blank slate but Chalamet is typically watchable. The film's biggest surprises are Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Momoa. Momoa especially is delightfully relaxed here and this is the actor's finest work to date. Ferguson gives a nuanced, complex performance as lady Jessica but most of the women in Dune are magical and while powerful, somehow lack agency.  Villeneuve's Dune isn't perfect, but it is impressive. It's clearly only half a story – the title reads Dune Part One on screen – but even as such, this is exciting work from one of the most assured, visionary directors working in Hollywood. "
"Jan 5, 2022",positive," Frank Herbert’s Dune, which was originally serialized in the science fiction magazine Analog between December 1963 and May 1965 before being published as a complete novel in 1965, has long been considered one of the cornerstones of modern science fiction literature, which accounts for why there have been so many attempts to translate it to the screen despite its being widely considered “unfilmable.” That “unfilmable” status, of course, is part of its allure, offering up the ineffable of challenge of cinematically rendering Herbert’s dense prose, expansive narrative, and heavy themes about power, politics, and messianic religion set 20,000 years in the future.  The Chilean-French provocateur Alejandro Jodoworsky was the first out of the gate in the early 1970s, envisioning a singularly bizarre spectacle that, had it ever made it out of development, would have featured a score by Pink Floyd and a starring role for the surrealist artist Salvador Dali. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien (1979), spent more than a year trying to bring it to fruition before abandoning it in favor of Blade Runner (1982), after which it was picked up by David Lynch at the behest of mega-producer Dino De Laurentiis. De Laurentiis got more than he bargained for, as Lynch’s innate weirdness and love of ambiguity ran headlong into the producer’s need for a viable commercial vehicle, and the result was a critical and commercial flop. Vestiges of Lynch’s grandly weird and perverse original vision remain scattered throughout the film, making it an experience that is both compelling and frustrating, an enigmatic provocation that melds wild art-film grotesquerie with post-Star Wars blockbuster ambitions. Sixteen years later, the Sci-Fi Channel produced a three-part miniseries in 2000 that was more faithful to Herbert’s novel and was considered a success, but the very fact that it gets so little mention attests to its ultimate lack of impact. And into this cinematic maw now ventures Denis Villeneuve, who is without doubt one of the most intriguing and compelling filmmakers working in the mainstream today. Although he first gained notice in Hollywood with the tense, violent crime-and-punishment dramas Prisoners (2014) and Sicario (2015), he has spent the past half decade working exclusively in the realm of heady science fiction (which has seen a significant resurgence at the box office), first with his elegant, emotionally rending alien encounter drama Arrival (2016) and then the long awaited sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017). Villeneuve’s proficiency with both intimate human drama and large-scale spectacle makes him an ideal candidate to tackle Herbert’s epic, which he and co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Passengers) and Eric Roth (A Star is Born, Forrest Gump) have wisely split in half (a second Dune film has already been announced, thus ensuring that this one doesn’t suffer the fate of Ralph Bakshi’s 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings, which covered one and a half of Tolkien’s three books, but wasn’t successful enough to warrant a concluding film). The general beats of the story will be familiar to those who have seen Lynch’s version (full disclosure: I have seen Lynch’s film at least a dozen times over the years, have never seen the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, and have not read any of Herbert’s Dune novels). Drawing on ancient epics and messianic religious myths, Dune’s story unfolds in an emperor-ruled universe structured around a feudal system in which planets are controlled by various royal families. There are two main rival “houses”—the Atreides and the Harkonnens—the latter of whom has been given the power to oversee the mining of the spice mélange, a special substance found only on the desert plant Arrakis, also known as Dune, where nary a drop of rain falls and the surface provides cover for giant, menacing sandworms the size of aircraft carriers. Spice is the most precious element in the universe because it expands the mind and allows for interstellar travel that would otherwise be impossible. Ruling over the two feuding houses is Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, who, unlike in previous adaptations, is kept entirely off-screen here, which renders him a shadowy and unknowable figure. His primary machination is setting the Atreides and the Harkonnens directly against each other by allowing the Atreides to take over spice production while secretly helping Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew Raban (Dave Bautista) plot a surprise attack with the help of the Emperor’s army to destroy them. The Atreides are led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a mystical female order that has been working for generations to produce the messianic figure known as Lisan al-Gaib, which may very well be Paul Atreides. While Lynch was much more fascinated by the vile Harkonnens, with their physical grotesquerie and leering ambitions, Villeneuve pays decidedly more attention to the Atreides, who he presents as models of humanity in a universe of cut-throat imperialism. Duke Leto’s treatment of Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, one of the leaders of the Fremen, the embattled native inhabitants of Arrakis, is telling of his fundamental decency (and the fact that the Fremen are cast almost entirely with people of color makes clear the film’s indebtedness to the realities of colonialism, past and present).  The problem, however, is that the weight of the film’s various subplots and narrative machinations leave only minimal room for character development, which makes Dune quite different from both Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, both of which were as intriguing dramatically as they were visually. Villeneuve was smart to cast Chalamet as the would-be messiah-warrior, as his slight frame and narrow face remind us that he is, as Herbert envisioned him, a teenager struggling under multiple burdens of expectation and troubling dreams—namely the ones that prominently feature of a Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya)—that he can’t decipher. However, Chalamet’s languid blankness often works against our investment in him, which leaves us with few options for emotional engagement. Interestingly, some of the peripheral characters, namely Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck and Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, are more interesting and engaging primarily because they have energy and anger and determination. Chalamet’s Paul starts to come into his own near the end, which is, of course, the point, but it makes the previous two hours slow going at times. There are no issues, however, with the visual elements of Villeneuve’s film, which are just as stunning and engrossing as you might hope. The digital effects blend seamlessly into the physical locations and sets, producing a world that is entirely convincing and provides an at-times breathtaking backdrop for Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser’s painterly compositions. Dune is a beautiful and austere film, composed primarily of sand and rock and metal (rarely is a primary color to be found). Villeneuve has an innate feel for the raw power of imagery, and he infuses the film with numerous moments that captivate the eye, whether it be the opening guerilla-style Fremen attack in which they literally explode from the sand, to the moment when Baron Harkonnen’s head slowly emerges from a vat of black oil like some creature from a horror film (Stellan Skarsgård’s corpulent physique, bald head, and slack face evoke nothing so much as Marlon Brando’s abstruse Kurtz in Apocalypse Now). Skarsgård plays the Baron as the opposite of Kenneth McMillan’s take in Lynch’s version, downplaying the bulge-eyed grotesquerie in favor of something more quiet and menacing, which Villeneuve emphasizes by often framing him out of focus in the background or at the edge of the frame. Thus, even though Dune isn’t entirely successful on a dramatic level, it has enough pull to draw us into its rich imagery and leave us wanting more; its sudden ending evokes the the serialized nature of Herbert’s novel while priming our hope something better is yet to come.

"Jan 4, 2022",positive,"Dune gives us a reason to celebrate the art of the Hollywood blockbuster for once, instead of condemning it."
"Jan 2, 2022",positive," You needn’t be much of a musical fan to find emotional and spiritual nourishment in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s feature directorial debut, hinged so shrewdly on a top-drawer Andrew Garfield performance. At once an adaptation of the late Jonathan Larson’s stage musical of the same name and a poignant tribute to the man’s curtailed life itself, Tick, Tick… Boom! soars on the strength of Miranda’s tenacious, visually dynamic direction, the diverse and toe-tapping tunes, and a wonderfully rambunctious lead turn from Garfield. For anyone who’s ever looked at their contemporaries and thought that they’re just not doing enough with their lives, Miranda’s film is sure to strike a mighty chord, wrapping its overpowering existential throughline around what is at its core a testament to Larson’s taken-too-soon artistic gifts. Michel Franco dishes up another fascinatingly provocative drama – though not nearly as rabble-rousing as his prior eat-the-rich thriller New Order – with this character study of a man (Tim Roth) who attempts to abandon his life and family while holidaying in Acapulco. Franco’s second collaboration with Roth after 2015’s mesmerising Chronic similarly asks a lot of audiences, both to stick with it through its airier moments – despite an 83-minute runtime – and to engage with subject matter that only becomes more discomforting as the pic wears on. Roth is typically excellent here, digging deep into a character who internalises so much until incredibly late in the story, while Franco’s filmmaking yet again dares to contort the audience into some squirm-inducing positions. Clint Bentley’s directorial debut may not offer up much in the way of surprises, but a familiar story well told can prove plenty entertaining in the right hands, as is most certainly the case with Jockey. It’s always enormously gratifying to see an extremely talented character actor finally get the push into lead territory, and here the opportunity arrived for the fantastic Clifton Collins Jr., who gives an outstanding, Oscar-worthy performance as ageing horse jockey Jackson Silva. Laudably straight-forward and unpretentious in both presentation and narrative, Jockey serves up just enough personal conflict without bogging itself down in treacly melodrama, while offering a perspective into a quarter of the sports world fairly under-served by cinema as a whole. Denis Villeneuve’s almost impossibly ambitious adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi opus Dune is one of the most meticulously crafted and downright awe-inspiring feats of blockbuster filmmaking ever made. For this critic’s tastes it is certainly a film easier to respect than it is to love, largely due to my own lack of emotional engagement with the story or characters – a problem I also had with the ’84 Lynch version – but so magnificent a feast is it aesthetically that it’s absolutely still a film I rush to recommend. The battery of eye-wateringly beautiful images and goosebumps-raising sounds combine with Villeneuve’s holistic world-building and a top-drawer cast to ensure that, despite its sparseness of feeling, Dune carves out a space for itself in the annals of all-time visionary sci-fi movies. Dune‘s narrative may be a lot less interesting than everything else around it, but there’s little arguing with the mastery of the filmmaking on offer. Ramin Bahrani rebounded from his massively disappointing Fahrenheit 451 adaptation with his most ambitious piece of work yet – a terrific, Oscar-nominated adaptation of Aravind Adiga’s 2008 novel The White Tiger. Without giving much of its narrative chicanery away, the plot centers around Balram (an excellent Adarsh Gourav), who uses his wiles to lift himself out of the impoverished Indian village where he was born. The Slumdog Millionaire comparisons are inevitable, and while Bahrani’s film similarly slaloms between stark social realism and frothy genre fare, this is far more concerned with indicting the Indian caste system and our character’s unfavourable place in it. Not a single living soul is going to watch Steven Soderbergh’s latest and call it anything but minor Soderbergh, but even the prolific director’s evident off-cuts usually prove to be more enthralling and entertaining than most filmmakers’ top-tier work. No Sudden Move is one such example, a low-key thriller elevated by the director’s extreme formal control throughout, the talents of an exceptional ensemble cast, and some deliciously barbed dialogue. Yes, the narrative is convoluted as is tradition for classic crime thrillers, but the cast is clearly having such a good time chewing through it all that you’d be forgiven for not really noticing or caring. No Sudden Move is far from top-tier Soderbergh, and even he would probably admit that, but it nevertheless glides on an uncommon, refreshingly calm rhythm for its genre. Lauren Hadaway makes a scintillating a debut as writer-director of this singular tale of pathological obsession, following a college freshman (Isabelle Fuhrman) who joins her university’s rowing team with the overpowering goal of becoming the best of the best. The Novice could be glibly compared to Whiplash, but this drama – which, through its intensity, sometimes verges on psychological thriller – is really quite different, eschewing a teacher-student dynamic in favour of focusing on the shattering mental and physical toll of striving for #1 above all else. If Hadaway’s direction occasionally verges on heavy-handed – especially the recurring visual motif of a crab which has specific relevance in rowing nomenclature – for the most part she creates a bracingly intense visual-aural landscape on which Isabelle Fuhrman delivers a stunning performance (one which scored her a Best Female Lead nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards). The Humans might well be the most unnerving non-horror film of the entire year, a home-for-the-holidays Thanksgiving psychodrama set largely inside a single New York City apartment as a fractured family unspools their various neuroses and traumas. Buoyed by a magnificent cast – especially a sublime Richard Jenkins – and Karam’s eerie, Kubrick-inspired framing and sound design, this is perhaps cinema’s purest recent distillation of how existentially horrifying year-end familial rituals truly can be. It’s easy to see how Karam’s unwieldy approach will turn many viewers off, but The Humans is one of the most tonally adventurous, skin-crawlingly uneasy films in recent memory. Daniel Craig’s long-delayed final sojourn as 007 didn’t quite live up to the brilliance of Casino Royale or Skyfall, but it slid confidently into third place and in turn delivered a fitting, shockingly emotional send-off for Craig’s James Bond. If you can forgive Rami Malek’s weak sauce villain and some needlessly convoluted story elements, there’s a remarkably well-calibrated Bond film to be enjoyed here, braced between the tried-and-true globetrotting formula and a clear attempt to move the series forward with the times. Thanks to Cary Fukunaga’s electrifying direction and the efforts of co-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge to tidy-up Bond’s sadly traditional sexism, No Time to Die feels like an exciting nexus point for the IP, that really anything could happen moving forward. With Craig giving fans the most cerebral, visceral James Bond portrayal to date, it’s fitting that he went out in unexpected, divisive, and deeply moving fashion. No Time to Die doesn’t hit the highs of Craig’s best Bond outings, but takes some hard swings to challenge audience preconceptions of what the franchise can and can’t do – and they mostly pay off. A film you almost certainly won’t see on any other top 50 list given its wildly divisive Sundance reception, Erin Vassilopoulos’ Superior ambitiously expands her 2015 short of the same name into a daring head-spinner of a feature debut. Without going into specifics – you’ll want to go into this one as cold as possible – Superior follows a woman, Marian (Alessandra Mesa), who flees her abusive boyfriend and hunkers down with her identical twin sister Vivian (Ani Mesa). What follows is a twisted, heady riff on identity that borrows lovingly from the David Lynch playbook albeit with its own gritty-yet-colourful sense of style, making the absolute most of the 16mm film it was shot on. The Mesa twins give outstanding performances in a film that’s as playful as it is twisted, constantly asking viewers to re-assess their perception of events through the regular switcheroo-ing of its two leads."
"Dec 31, 2021",positive,"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE is the type of epic filmmaking that many reach for and can't grasp. Full of emotional resonance and with the philosophical core of the book coursing through the film's veins like lifeblood, it puts other franchises to shame."
"Dec 30, 2021",positive," Por años, los habitantes del desértico planeta de Arrakis han vivido bajo la opresión del autoritario mando de la casa Harkonnen, encabezada por el ambicioso y temible Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård). La familia feudal se encarga de la extracción y la comercialización de melange, una especia color escarlata – única en la galaxia y considerada sagrada por los nativos – que es utilizada principalmente como guía instrumental en los viajes interestelares. El monopolio que poseen estos fuereños sobre el codiciado producto no solo les ha otorgado cuantiosas riquezas, sino también una importante posición de poder capaz de intimidar al mismísimo Emperador.  Es por ello que esta figura suprema ha decretado que sea la casa Atreides, eterna rival de los actuales gobernantes, quien tome el control inmediato de Arrakis, expulsando por orden imperial a los Harkonnen del caluroso planeta cubierto por rojizas dunas de arena y custodiado por enormes gusanos que viven debajo de la superficie. Para Paul (Timothée Chalamet), el joven heredero del ducado establecido en las tierras de Caladan, la noticia le hace cuestionar la naturaleza premonitoria de sus sueños. En días recientes, el espigado marqués ha tenido una visión recurrente mientras duerme: la imagen de una chica de ojos color azul, habitante del planeta en conflicto, quien lo conduce sigilosamente por unos rocosos cañones hasta llegar al que pareciera ser su fatídico destino. Consternada ante el significado de dichas revelaciones, su madre Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) convoca una reunión secreta con la Reverenda Madre, una mujer cubierta por un velo oscuro que posee poderes sobrenaturales, para poner a prueba el espíritu y la fortaleza del joven protagonista.  Tras su arribo al nuevo planeta, la tribu de los Fremen atestigua el cumplimiento de una profecía ancestral. La llegada del Mesías que tanto han esperado, quien los guiará hacia un camino de paz y de libertad. La precaria situación que se vive en Arrakis pronto se torna aún más difícil para el duque Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) y su familia, luego de un sorpresivo ataque orquestado por sus archirrivales. Dispuestos a recuperar el poder que les fue arrebatado por órdenes del Emperador, los Harkonnen lucharán a muerte hasta asegurarse que no quede ningún vestigio de la estirpe enemiga.  Guerras, traiciones, juegos de poder, religión y misticismo se combinan a la perfección en Dune (Duna), la adaptación de la exitosa novela de ciencia ficción, escrita por Frank Herbert, a cargo del aclamado realizador Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Una epopeya en toda la extensión de la palabra que construye monumentales universos cinematográficos con una proeza y belleza despampanante. Una experiencia audiovisual hipnótica, desafiante y de gigantescas proporciones que require de la pantalla más grande posible para poder apreciar y disfrutar cada uno de sus detalles.  Completamente opuesta al estilo psicodélico y camp de la adaptación cinematográfica de 1984 dirigida por David Lynch, esta nueva versión recurre a un tono mucho más solemne y contemplativo. Un blockbuster con alma de cine de arte que se toma su tiempo en plantear la mitología e introducir a sus personajes sin la necesidad de recurrir a frenéticas secuencias de acción ni a innecesarios despliegues de efectos especiales a cada segundo. Su ritmo tan sosegado no resulta pesado. Al contrario, nos permite admirar cada minucia de sus impresionantes sets y de sus fastuosos vestuarios, los cuales nos transportan de manera efectiva hasta nuevos y distintos rincones de la galaxia. Las piezas musicales, compuestas por Hans Zimmer, son ceremoniosas y hechizantes con su conjunto de cuerdas y percusiones.  Cada uno de los miembros del elenco realiza un trabajo de primera. Tras su paso por la escena del cine norteamericano independiente, Timothée Chalamet demuestra que tiene la presencia y el talento para encabezar una super-producción de Hollywood. Oscar Isaac y Josh Brolin cumplen, mientras que Stellan Skarsgård hace estremecer como el villano del filme. Y a pesar de sus breves intervenciones, tanto Zendaya como Javier Bardem sacan el máximo provecho a sus personajes. No obstante, son Rebecca Ferguson y Jason Momoa quienes terminan robándose la película gracias a sus memorables interpretaciones. Ferguson es sensacional en su enigmático rol, mientras que Momoa inyecta humor y heroísmo al suntuoso relato.  Quizá lo único que juegue un poco en contra de Dune sea su decisión por mostrarnos solamente la primera parte del relato. Se entienden las dificultades para intentar resumir una novela tan extensa en una película de dos horas y media de duración y, al mismo tiempo, se agradece la determinación por querer narrar la historia sin tanto acelere. Sin embargo, a diferencia de otras sagas cinematográficas que han sido desarrolladas en múltiples partes, aquí la mayoría de las tramas no llegan a ninguna resolución. El final resulta abrupto y sin un cliffhanger que logre mantenernos al filo del asiento, esperando impacientemente la llegada de la próxima entrega (aún sin anunciar).  Dune es una épica colosal y cerebral que funciona como una alegoría del colonialismo y la religión. Una historia de constantes dualidades, de la lucha entre el bien y el mal – a veces dentro de uno mismo –, de luz y oscuridad, de sueños y realidades, de opresión y libertad, de vida y muerte. Una apuesta ambiciosa y evocadora que nos recuerda del gran poder que tiene el cine para transportarnos a universos desconocidos a través de su inagotable fuente de magia e imaginación. "
"Dec 24, 2021",positive,These are complex dynamics. It's a reason why Dune has been so tough to crack in this medium. I think Villeneuve has done it.
"Dec 23, 2021",positive," the characters did not ""draw us into"" anything.it was all landscape and unheard whispers of a plot.maybe it would be better seen on the ""small screen""with pause and volume control. but, no. we're done."
"Dec 21, 2021",positive,"When the anticipation is feverish, it sets up movies to disappoint and fail. This long-awaited movie smashes those expectations."
"Dec 21, 2021",positive," Last year, I wrote about how hard it was to get two movie lovers to agree on a mutual top 10. This year, in the spirit of The Last Duel, Sean Fennessey and I decided to put our lists head-to-head—yet we still didn’t find room for the best Ridley Scott movie of the year, which will only make Sir Ridley crankier. The upshot of this exercise wasn’t just to spotlight as many worthy movies as possible, but to contrast different ideas about what constitutes cinematic value beyond taste. Even when there were instances of crossover in our lists, we seemed to be coming at the films themselves from different angles. Nayman: Back in April, I wondered whether anything would clear the bar set by Rose Glass’s uncannily well-executed debut. And unless you count the 40th anniversary rerelease and restoration of Andrzej Zulawski’s magnificently messed-up and terrifying Possession, no other horror movie came close. (However, let’s give a silver medal to James Wan’s Malignant for proving that the right way to spend all that Aquaman collateral was on a movie about a sentient tumor.) In a moment when critics and fans are caught up in debating the phenomenon and cinematic vocabulary of “elevated horror,” Saint Maud passed the audition as handcrafted, high-minded festival fare with Big Themes that didn’t sacrifice scares. It’s a beautifully made movie, as finely embroidered and darkly enveloping as a funeral shroud, and it’s carried by a heroic lead performance by Morfydd Clark as a woman whose belief that she can talk to God could be taken equally as delusions of grandeur or the pinnacle of humility. Glass knows how to ratchet tension, but also how to let scenes breathe. Topping it all off, Saint Maud sticks the landing with an ending that basically burns a hole through the screen. Ideally, horror movies show us things we can’t unsee; Glass’s money shot has been living rent-free in my mind’s eye for months now. Sean Fennessey: Adam, I had a kid this year—our first—and it’s poisoned my movie brain. Where once I could a watch an endangered child on-screen and hardly bat an eyelash at the fictional terror, now I recoil at even the suggestion of a little girl or boy in peril. I’m a cliché dad, prudish and fragile, and that’s OK with me (for now). But what I had not anticipated is how this can work in other directions. In Maggie Gyllenhaal’s often unsettling adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s novel, she crafts a portrait of mothers at the end of their wits that is perceptive and relatable and fearless. It’s a movie that withholds judgment, but shows women constantly confronting the joy, toll, and simmering frustration of motherhood. Gyllenhaal is a first-time writer-director and hers is the most assured debut of the year, anchored by four terrific performers (Olivia Colman, Jessie Buckley, Dakota Johnson, and Dagmara Domińczyk) tasked with four visions of motherhood—one in repose, one in retreat, one in recalcitrance, and one in anticipation. I’m pairing it with C’mon C’mon, another of Mike Mills’s gentle and episodic works of miniature opera. After tackling his father (2011’s Beginners) and his mother (2017’s 20th Century Women), Mills is focusing on his child and his relationship to parenting. He uses a proxy uncle character, played with the record-flip softness that Joaquin Phoenix likes to break out after every Joker or so, to animate the parental love for a young boy ping-ponging between precocity and arrested development. Shot in gorgeously creamy black and white across L.A., New York, and New Orleans, it’s a movie not without scares or drama, but ultimately warm and refreshingly free of guile. It made me feel as good about this stage of my life as anything that isn’t my daughter.  Nayman: I also had a kid this year—bringing our household’s grand total to two–which didn’t so much poison my movie brain (can’t poison something that’s already toxic) but cut into my movie-viewing time so significantly that I’ve missed enough key 2021 titles to make me wonder about making a list in the first place. For instance: I haven’t seen The Lost Daughter, C’mon C’mon, The Tragedy of Macbeth, or Ghostbusters: Afterlife. How can I properly assess the year in cinema without Ghostbusters: Afterlife? The other wrinkle to having two kids is that even when I have managed to catch up with For Your Consideration stuff, it’s largely been at home via DVDs and screening links, which is why I’m grateful that I actually saw The Power of the Dog in a movie theater, where the exquisite wide-screen compositions and stinging musical score could feel suitably overpowering. So yes, I’m adding my voice to the choral praise for Jane Campion’s latest, not least of all because I can’t remember watching a movie of this kind—big, intricate, and literary, with a cleanly diagrammed structure and heavily underlined themes (dial M for masculinity)—that wrong-footed my expectations so deftly. Some critics were annoyed that it takes the plot a long time to kick in, but that’s not just good scene-setting by Campion—it’s a way to show that for some of the characters, decisive action is a long time coming. I liked the way that what seems to be an emotional triangle between two brothers and a woman keeps revealing new vertices, and the last half hour is some of the greatest work yet from a filmmaker who plays havoc with expectations while honoring a larger and inexorable design.  Fennessey: With two notable exceptions, I saw every film on my list in a theater—a privilege I appreciate and don’t take for granted. That includes Hamaguchi’s epic tale of quiet contemplation, a movie about a man constantly on the move—in his vintage red Saab 900—but rarely able to move forward. Based on a rather terse Haruki Murakami short story, Hamaguchi’s rendition involves a theater actor and director channeling loss through a complex staging of Uncle Vanya that blends languages and symbols to cross cultures in Hiroshima. This is an audacious three-hour movie that is by turns restrained and remote, until an explosive finale that shifts the emotional turmoil from Hidetoshi Nishijima’s theater director to his driver and companion, played with a coiled power by Tôko Miura. Hamaguchi’s movie is beyond deliberate—it’s a study in pace and unknowable truths. But its mystery propels it forward to a feeling of autonavigation, the sense that life keeps hurtling toward you even if you want to run from it. Better to have seen it without the distractions of a life at home and a second screen in reach. Instead, let it drive right over you.  Nayman: It was a great year for Monsieur Hamaguchi, who also cowrote the no. 8 movie on my list—one directed by his old film-school instructor. The title of Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Wife of a Spy is very “it is what it is,” but starting with its brilliant, bristling screenplay and expanding outward through its director’s dexterous use of setting and shadow to evoke cloaked wartime motives, the film is as complexly pleasurable as any prestige thriller of recent years. Statuesque Satoko (Yu Aoi) is an actress married to successful importer-exporter Yusaku (Issey Takahashi), whose movements between Japan and Manchuria have piqued the interest of Kobe’s local authorities; when a woman in Yusaku’s circle turns up dead, she gets suspicious too. The chess board that Kurosawa keeps returning to in a series of symbolic close-ups summarizes the move-counter-move machinations of the plot, but what Kurosawa and his collaborators are really up to is more of a meditation on roles and performance. The devastating revelation of what Yusaku is really keeping hidden—or, perhaps, trying to expose—puts a political frame around the action while calling back to the apocalyptic horrors of Kurosawa’s previous genre masterpieces; superfans like myself can enjoy the shout-outs to Cure and Charisma while those unfamiliar Kurosawa’s cinema will simply recognize the touch of an old master.  Fennessey: There’s an awkward two-step happening in the dance of film discourse, swaying left to blindly stan actors and filmmakers no matter their cultural output or depth, and then swaying back right to adjudicate the moral and political valences of art above intention, or its absence. Movies are denounced before release based on a plot synopsis or ferociously defended in the face of criticism. Into this free-for-all parachutes Red Rocket. What to make of it? A gimlet-eyed portrait of a suitcase pimp returning home to Texas City, Texas, after a couple of decades working as a porn star in L.A., Baker’s movie at first feels like a provocation. His star, Simon Rex, is an ex-MTV VJ, alum of the Scary Movie series, and a post-Eminem shock rapper. He has a rubbery face and a whirling dervish spirit, all limbs and teeth and weathered skin. His character, Mikey Saber, wields a hustle that is cheery and destructive. He grooms young women, sells drugs, deceives his wife, and brags about it all to his lone friend. He’s disgusting. And yet, charming. Some of that is Rex, who is pure go-go-go, and some of that is the way Baker situates the character in a decrepit world where survival feels more important than decency. Saber is puerile but funny and ruthlessly determined—his story feels like a soft projection of all the hucksters and groping assholes who’ve blown into our political and social lives these past five (50?) years.  But is Saber really a stand-in for Donald Trump? That feels too elementary, and doesn’t do justice to the psychologically layered construction of the character, who desperately tries to win the audience (any audience) over even as he burns the world around him. Baker sets the antic pacing and boundary-challenging vim of Italian comedy against a gorgeously elegiac vision of a dying American center. (In the film, a doughnut shop operates in the shadow of an oil refinery—I’m not sure there’s a better metaphor for this country.) And while Baker doesn’t judge his characters, even when they’re monstrous, he’s manifested a unique confrontation for audiences, and perhaps the dreaded discourse, too. What to do with a problem like Mikey Saber? Get a close look at him. Maybe even hear him out. Just don’t stan him.  Nayman: “Just don’t stan him”—the eternal conundrum when it comes to M. Night Shyamalan, who arguably makes it easier on his haters than any major working American director even as he preaches blissfully to the choir. Back in July, I called Night’s mystery about, yes, a Beach That Makes You Old,  “a big swing that makes contact”—a reference to the oh-shit revelation in Signs that the only thing standing between Earth and an alien takeover was Joaquin Phoenix and his trusty wonderbat. Twenty years later, Shyamalan has lived down his reputation as a twist-monger, and he’s regrouped by taking and matching the pulse of a zeitgeist that had seemed to pass him by. The Visit found a genuinely inventive way to use found footage post–Paranormal Activity; Split and Glass simultaneously satirized and cashed in on the superhero cinematic universe trend. Old, meanwhile, takes on such trenchant, contemporary issues as the surveillance state, predatory pharmaceutical companies, and top 40 rappers called “Mid-Sized Sedan.” The moment when Mr. Sedan (Aaron Pierre) was identified as such by an ardent teenage fan was also the moment when Old won my heart, and I’m not likely to give it back anytime soon. In a period when even interesting filmmakers seem content to simply produce content, Shyamalan seems committed to keeping it weird. Thanks for the laughs, Night, and maybe, you know, hit me back …. just to chat. Truly yours, your biggest fan, etc. Fennessey: This was quite a good year for directorial autofiction. Joanna Hogg completed her memoiristic The Souvenir diptych with a righteous glee. Janicza Bravo’s Zola transposed the oh-shit virality of a stripper’s Twitter thread onto a larcenous fairy tale of cultural identity. David Lowery’s The Green Knight quested to the heart of his greatest fear only to discover a whole lot of cowardice, and some resolve, too. Wes Anderson even made a movie about a visionary curator wrangling all of his charges to create something bigger than all of them. Directors like to see themselves in their stories, in case you hadn’t heard (or asked M. Night Shyamalan). Nowhere was that more evident or vital than in the French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Løve’s Bergman Island. A skilled chronicler of millennial ennui and quiet longing, Hansen-Løve takes her story of a husband-wife pair of filmmakers (a perfectly cast Tim Roth and Vicky Krieps, finally rewarded with a worthy follow-up to Phantom Thread) to the Swedish island of Fårö, where Ingmar Bergman lived, worked, and died. In another director’s hands, this might amount to hoary homage. But this is a mash-up of movie-within-movie nesting doll symbolism, with Hansen-Løve creating an unofficial follow-up to her 2011 film Goodbye, First Love, and unraveling our expectations of conventional narrative in the process. When Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie arrive as exes reunited at a wedding more than halfway through the film, it transforms into something sensual but self-abnegating. You can almost hear Hansen-Løve asking herself, “Is this a good idea?” Few directors are willing to work out their feelings out loud, and Bergman Island is not a movie with thunderous conclusions. But it has something that few examples of autofiction can claim: humility. Nayman: You left out one key guy in your inventory of visceral autofiction. Say bonjour to Leos Carax, whose chaotic, seriocomic rock opera Annette is, among other things, a self-portrait of the artist—by the final scene, the wan, pencil-mustachioed Adam Driver (this year’s Best Actor) has become the spitting image of his director. I can’t say I found Annette’s mix of amour fou, fatal melodrama, puppet theatre, and pop-cultural pastiche completely successful or convincing. But no movie this year had higher highs, beginning with the opening, full-company sing-along that winkingly begs the audience’s permission to let the festivities commence, and peaking during a final duet between Driver and the titular child star that somehow echoes both Robert Bresson and Pinocchio. Is Driver’s caustic Bill Hicks routine as the “Ape of God” tough to sit through? Yes. Do all those pounding, tinny Sparks songs grow tiring after a while? Sure. Does Annette come out the other side of its annoyances and score the kind of bold, emotional coup we expect from the greatest movie musicals? For me, it did.  Fennessey: Forgive the double-up, but I don’t know how I could refuse. Consider the archival music documentary in which hardly any archival footage of the subject exists. That was the challenge Haynes conquered in his Velvet Underground film, adopting the ecstatic visual style of an Andy Warhol picture and the spelunking delight of an academic deep in his thesis to render a story about one of the more iconic, if not chronicled, bands of the 20th century and the New York artistic underground swelling around it. His Velvet Underground movie is downright electrifying, like watching culture get born in a tiny circle of noise.  Nayman: The same late-’60s spirit of Get Back and The Velvet Underground haunts Ephraim Asili’s ingenious collectivist comedy The Inheritance, whose characters are attempting to uphold revolutionary ideals in a modern context. “We are a shoeless home,” explains one of the inhabitants of The House of Ubuntu, a residence modelled after (and located nearby) the West Philadelphia MOVE commune that was made infamous in 1985 by a fatal and ulimately unpunished police bombing; the line is resonant in the sense that Asili’s characters are trying to follow in the footsteps of the past. Principled, intellectual, 20-something Julian (Eric Lockley) has inherited the house from his late grandmother, and filled it with friends, colleagues, and hangers-on committed to studying a treasure trove of artifacts that, taken together, comprise a syllabus of modern African-American artistry and activism: books, magazines, records, sculptures, murals, manifestos. Partially based on his own experiences in a Black Marxist collective and brimming with affectionately self-deprecating dialogue, Asili’s film serves doubly as a showcase for Julian’s hallowed texts and a sly, formally rigorous satire on the paradoxical compromises of group living—the way that even ideological solidarity can’t prevent people from getting on one another’s nerves.  Fennessey: I made a pact with myself a long time ago that when Paul Schrader adds another wounded creature to his menagerie of God’s Lonely Men, I will abide with its inclusion on a year-end list. This is made a bit easier when the films assume the same sense of grace and despair as 2018’s First Reformed—this year’s entry, The Card Counter, does just that. His latest examination of alienation, soul death, and the American lie follows a one-time Abu Ghraib prison guard-torturer named William Tell (ha), haunted by his past and seeking to escape one full house at a time via the roadside casinos of these United States. Oscar Isaac, with his boxy good looks and hooded stare, is a Schrader monk par excellence. When he stumbles upon a young guy (Tye Sheridan, wormish) looking to avenge his father’s death, Tell is forced to face down his trauma. This is not a subtle film and not a terribly good gambling movie, but there is a psychic blankness in the performances—ascetic control trumping actorly vanity—that had me once again plumbing the depths of the torture cell Schrader calls his brain. I can count on one hand the number of filmmakers who are capable of ripping out the insulation of our daily lives and dragging it into view for everyone to wince at. Schrader is 75 years old, and his social media presence suggests a somewhat loony crank, but I hope he’s got a few more films in him. As our pals on The Press Box podcast like to joke, the old guy’s still got it! Nayman: Speaking of old guys who’ve still got it: Paul Verhoeven takes pole position amongst 2021’s octogenarian success stories. As much as I enjoyed both The Last Duel and Cry Macho, neither Ridley Scott nor Clint Eastwood can claim to be working from a position of industrial weakness. They’re playing with house money, while, like Schrader, Verhoeven has to try to game the system every time out. He’s currently in his third decade of professional exile from the U.S.A., and since refashioning himself as a classy, classical art-house filmmaker, he’s made a few of the best movies of his brilliantly checkered career. Five years ago, the viciously terrific thriller Elle sniffed the Oscar race. Now comes this deceptively sleazy, intellectually searching fact-based period piece about a nun experiencing mystic visions in 17th century Italy. What Do You Do With a Problem Like Benedetta? As played by the superlative Virginie Efira, Verhoeven’s heroine is a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma—she claims to have a direct line to God, and one of the fringe benefits of her successful power grab at the local abbey is that she gets a private room to hook up with her fellow sister Bartolomea. Having been taught from a young age to hate her body, suddenly, she’s loving it. Is she a faker? An opportunist? A rebel with a cause? Or does the Lord work in mysterious ways? Certainly, Verhoeven does, mixing lurid, cynical exploitation with fluid storytelling and the principled irreverence of a satirist whose art always punches up against institutional dogma and scores a knockout—hopefully not for the last time. Fennessey: If the Beatles felt so big that they could not be confined to anything less than 468 minutes, imagine how long a film that purports to untangle the hidden connections that link national myths, artificial intelligence, collectivist fallacies, imperialism, China’s Cultural Revolution, and 2Pac should be. At least 10 minutes longer, according to Adam Curtis, who has been creating overwhelming recombinant visions of our cursed past and paranoid future for the BBC for the better part of four decades. His latest is his biggest, widest, and chewiest—a tapestry of conspiracy theory, lawyerly evidentiary presentation, archival wizardry, and Curtis’s trademark needle drops. Blended together across nearly eight hours, Can’t Get You Out of My Head remains my definitive document of quarantine power-watching. (The film has not officially been released in the United States, though it can be seen on YouTube.) I subjected my then-pregnant wife to the experience over two typically isolated days this winter and while I can’t say this is the kind of uplifting material you’d like to view as you prepare to bring life into the world, I remain tantalized by Curtis’s style and mission. Are some of his conclusions big-brained leaps of logic? Perhaps, but you don’t have to be convinced of anything beyond Curtis’s utter commitment to his truth. In less skilled hands, you’d have, well, a bad YouTube documentary. And maybe this is merely the steroidal version of subgenre that has wrought havoc on the minds of millions over the past decade. But Curtis’s deeply researched, literate, and cosmic sense of events suggests a world not of individual moments but a star system, flashes of light that when connected create a constellation of existence.  Nayman: The protagonist of Azor likes to give assurances: on assignment in Buenos Aires circa 1980 representing a high-end Swiss bank, Y​​van (Fabrizio Rongione) tells his clients that their money is safe. But the country is edging towards economic and political chaos, and Yvan’s boss and colleague Mr. Keys is nowhere to be found in a moment where Argentina’s ruling powers are known for “disappearing” anybody inconvenient to the regime. The missing-person subplot gives Azor a thriller hook, but beyond the machinations of its plot, the film achieves a kind of ambient creepiness in which every encounter, no matter how refined or banal, seems to point to sinister intentions. The film’s dark-hued, painterly images evoke New Hollywood thrillers like Chinatown and Night Moves, and, as in those films, it’s as if reality were rotting from the inside out. It’s a fine line between subtlety and stasis, and Azor’s slow-burn may be challenging for viewers who crave more consistent stimulation. But if marinating in paranoia is your idea of a good time, Fontana’s beautifully executed debut is as good as it gets. Fennessey: Sometimes bigger is better, goddamnit! This was a lousy year for conventional blockbusters, and I typically like to find one or two a year that rises to the level of visceral joy that only a shiny, noisy Hollywood production can create. I’m not sure Dune is a joyful film—that isn’t quite Villeneuve’s register—but I was transported by his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved, oft-adapted-but-never-nailed novel. The ambition and scope is invigorating. A longtime passion project, this is a movie where a filmmaker is attacking the source material head on with respect, admiration, and a visionary craftsmanship that perhaps even its author didn’t know was possible when he was writing. Herbert’s novel is a psychotronic tangle of heady imagery, and the film strips away the haze to focus on the arid desperation and religiosity of its characters without sacrificing the grandeur of sandworms, thopters, and the slug majesty of its villain Baron Harkonnen. Hollywood is going through a difficult transitional period with regard to big-budget movies—if it ain’t MCU/DCEU/Fast, it ain’t a sure thing. Unless—unless!—we entrust hundreds of millions of dollars to blindly driven auteurs adapting books they have loved since adolescence. Roger Ebert once wrote that movie theaters “unashamedly provided a proscenium for our dreams.” In Dune, Villeneuve dreams big and boldly. [Uses the voice] Go to sleep! Nayman: I’ve already written some thoughts on PTA’s freewheeling teen comedy. The only thing I want to add in this year-end context is that of all the top-tier auteurs who’ve released new work in 2021, Anderson seems to have been the most inspired by shooting under limited conditions. Part of what’s so beguiling about Licorice Pizza is how it seems to take place in a world where grown-ups aren’t really around—the San Fernando Valley circa 1973 becomes a playground for characters on the verge of maturity, whether growing up too quickly or not soon enough. The slightly uncanny quality of the location shooting can be chalked up to the director’s mandate to shoot closer to home (including some family cameos), but the vibes aren’t wholly cozy or nostalgic. Amidst all the hijinks, there’s a feeling of encroaching crisis, or maybe a bubble about to burst. Time keeps on slipping throughout Licorice Pizza, faster and faster, and Anderson and his ever-agile camera take it in stride. This is filmmaking that doesn’t break a sweat.  Fennessey: I have clear and undistorted memories of critical decision-making points in my late 20s and early 30s. Take this job, move to this city, befriend this person, go to that party, maybe pack it in tonight, three whiskeys is enough, sir. I live a more domesticated life these days, often homebound and unambitious, but occasionally I will think back on some of those choices. Did I miss out on meeting someone at that party who could have changed it all for me? Or have I played the notes of life as well as possible? I definitely blew it on more than one occasion, but I’m happy and healthy and … well, this all sounds like rationalization doesn’t it? What you’re reading right now is solipsism and I’m far from above it. Most people born after 1980, at least, aren’t either. Joachim Trier understands this: In the final third of his Oslo Trilogy, the Norwegian director trains his eye on Julie, an intelligent, vivacious young woman who frequently seems to make the wrong choice. They’re not cataclysmic decisions, but anytime a relationship or a career path makes some headway in her psyche, she flees. Renate Reinsve plays Julie, in what I believe is the performance of the year, as a woman with a deeply Millennial sense of false bravado—she’s a person roiling with feelings and beliefs but harboring self-doubt and confusion at every turn. I recognize Julie. If I am not her, I have met her, worked with her, had Zoom calls with her while she blithely presented her grand vision of the world to me. It is the confidence and passion of a person who was told that she can be anything she wants colliding with the reality that maybe, just maybe, she can. Trier and co-writer Eskil Vogt have an uncanny feel for this conundrum, crafting the movie into 12 discrete parts, a self-consciously novelistic approach that does, in fact, reflect how people tend to recall their youth. This movie knocked me over. Everyone should see it. Nayman: Sean, you already very accurately described Drive My Car as a movie that cruises right over you. And I know it’s a bit cliché at this point to roll over for Ryusuke Hamaguchi, but the guy is just such a controlled, intelligent filmmaker, and he’s on a hot streak. Where Drive My Car chugs along with brilliant linearity—leaping across weeks and years to chronicle an artist’s struggle to turn grief into inspiration—Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy turns curlicues about chance, fate, and heartbreak. It’s made up of three miniature 40-minute dramas, each featuring sexy, existentially angsty characters; each with a delicious twist; each whirling away in succession, one after another, like a perfect little anthology of short stories. No movies this year took more pleasure in the architecture and engineering of narrative. And no matter how precarious and intricate the structures get, they hold up, with Drive My Car’s chassis reinforced by Chekhov and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy dipping into speculative science-fiction in a finale that moved me more than anything else I saw all year.  Fennessey: Anyone who has read or listened to me over the years knows that Paul Thomas Anderson is my favorite filmmaker. I’ll admit I sometimes struggle to put to words why I remain ensnared by his films. I think the word is “ineffable.” Of course he’s a master filmmaker—he’s seen it all and knows what he likes. But what do I like? Perhaps it’s the overweening sense of intensity meeting the sneeringly hilarious disposition of his characters. (“There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.”) Maybe it’s the absolute delight he takes in capturing his characters in motion. It’s possible we share a sense of humor, and his frequency is coming over the airwaves loud and clear to me. He makes movies that feel Important, but I think that’s a feint. What we want from artists is purely individualized expression—PTA makes movies only he can make. Licorice Pizza feels like a perfectly reconstructed memory, like someone hopped in a time machine and brought a 35mm camera. Which is not to say it’s a documentary—it has all the clever set-ups, brisk editing, and euphoric climaxes of great filmmaking, like Hal Ashby got lost in the Valley and pulled over for a bite. He gets remarkable performances from Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim, two first-time actors representing the sensation of infatuation, if not consummation. He selects songs impeccably, as if touched by John Peel. He shoots L.A. like it’s Babylon, a place where people are born and eventually entombed in the glorious, dumb history of this company town. Licorice Pizza is a showbiz movie about all the reckless, dangerous ghouls who haunted the industry, and also a pie-eyed picture of kids just trying to make something of themselves. It’s hard to describe why I loved it. But I know that I did."
"Dec 19, 2021",negative," Directed by Denis Villeneuve, Dune: Part One follows Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides as he’s forced to embrace his destiny as the leader of his family and an entire race of people. Filmmaker Villeneuve, working from a script written with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, delivers a fairly faithful adaptation that is, for the most part, visually impressive yet dramatically inert, as the movie, much like its source material, suffers from an arms-length feel that’s exacerbated (and perpetuated) by an emphasis on dull, one-dimensional characters and dialogue-heavy sequences transpiring predominantly within dimly-lit environs – with the far-from-enthralling atmosphere preventing the viewer from working up much interest in or enthusiasm for the protagonists’ deliberately-paced exploits. It’s clear, consequently, that Villeneuve’s larger-than-life approach doesn’t fare nearly as well as one might’ve hoped (or anticipated), as the picture’s myriad of meticulously-crafted set-pieces are unable, generally speaking, to pack the exciting, visceral punch for which the filmmaker is obviously striving (ie the movie is, ultimately, big on spectacle but frustratingly short on everything else). By the time the nigh endless third act rolls around, Dune: Part One has cemented its place as a distressing misfire that seems to confirm that Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel is just not suitable for big-screen treatment (ie Dune: Part One and David Lynch’s Dune are about on the same level in terms of entertainment value)."
"Dec 17, 2021",positive," “Dune” has been built up as a potential turning point of 2021 cinema since its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. In the weeks since its release in October (simultaneously in cinemas and on HBO Max), that chatter has accelerated. In the wake of a successful box-office haul, the confirmation of a sequel, and predictions and concerns about the current state of western cinema, “Dune” feels momentous. That momentousness is not all for good, and not all in good faith, but “Dune has become, as is the case with films of this kind, something of a symbol for things that exist beyond it. When I say, “films of this kind,” I don’t mean science-fiction – but commercially successful films. There’s a lot that’s hanging on “Dune” and whether it becomes a success. Not just a potential sequel, but depending on who you talk to it portends so much more. It could be a signifier of the ubiquity of Timothee Chalamet, who is headlining two major films this year from two very different directors. It could be a signifier of the future of science-fiction adaptations. It could be a signifier of what kinds of texts are adapted and readapted to the big screen. And it could be a signifier of the still complicated question about cultural representation and appropriation on the big screen. “Dune” is many things to many people, which makes sense for a film that announces itself as an epic with very big ideas. But also, because this is a film based on a novel that comes loaded with swathes of context and consideration that exist way beyond director Denis Villeneuve. In spite of that context, I went into “Dune” eerily ignorant of any it. It’s more happenstance than deliberate avoidance, but my knowledge of Frank Herbert’s novel (1965), the David Lynch film (1984) or the John Harrison miniseries (2000) was scant. My fledgling interest in the new adaptation was predicated more on my interest in Villeneuve’s work as a director, more than any firm opinion on the source itself. I managed to see “Dune” without even seeing a trailer. My entry-point to this story was filtered through the lens of Villeneuve. It’s only in the days since seeing the film that I’ve waded into the context, the complications, the ellipses and the tensions of that work. And in thinking about “Dune” – the film and the mythos – considering the contexts feels like its own adjunct to the filmmaking. The film takes place some-time in the very distant future, where humanity has regressed emotionally while prospering scientifically. Earth is not the centre of this nebulous future, and although it’s some time before we understand quite where we are we come to recognise that a sandy planet (Arrakis) is central to this. An imperial family (the Atreides) are caught up in this intrigue. The Artreides patriarch (Oscar Isaac) is a noble ruler, his son Paul (Chalamet), is callow and uncertain but potentially heroic. Paul’s mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is mysterious and potentially powerful. It’s a science fiction text with explicitly realised tropes. You understand who everyone is from early on. The wise advisor to Paul. The unnerving older-woman who’s up to something. The female ingenue that will complicate Paul’s journey. We know these kinds of worlds even if we don’t know this world. The desert planet becomes a topic of concern for the main players, desperate for its wealth of spice. And soon an attempt at extraction becomes a game of political subterfuge. It’s not so much that plot isn’t important to “Dune,” so much that the plot isn’t necessarily built on twists that are out of line with our understanding of these kinds of stories. The most significant narrative concern is Paul’s potential role as a messiah figure who might be able to put an end to the worst of the world by following his destiny. In this first part of the novel, this is all more set up than follow through as Villeneuve invites us into the world and it’s here that “Dune” is notably exemplary. A lot of this is on cinematographer Greig Fraser, who is conjuring grandiosity, mood, and tension in his collaboration with production designer Patrice Vermette. Dune looks good and the stills of it going around the internet echo that.  Even better, though, is the way it sounds, a genuine recurring note of dread and anxiety pulsating throughout with some chilling work from sound designer Mark Mangini It’s a technical wonder and even if its detractors argue that it’s style with no substance, it feels like the style is the substance when the main preoccupation is a world that seems to seduce these characters. It was curious providence that I was thinking of “Dune” in the same week that the Cave Hill campus in Barbados was holding the West Indian Literature Conference. The topic of Caribbean science fiction emerged during the conversation. The contours of western (and mostly white) science-fiction, the way that historically science fiction has been regressive on issues of race and gender. Why is it that futuristics imaginings are so limited by ideas of race? A number of major releases over the next few months are adaptations of pre-existing material, some of the original texts are decades old. Thinking of adaptation studies as a field, and the relationship between source and adaptation feels critical right now. Can adaptations really transcend their source? Can they ethically address issues that create complications today? Which works do we adapt? And why do we adapt them? These are questions beyond “Dune” and that “Dune” has fostered a return to this conversation is beneficial even if, like so much about “Dune,” it is complicated. Reading Herbert’s issue with race into Villeneuve’s “Dune” or reading them out Villeneuve’s “Dune,” is a complicated venture. Denis Villeneuve is intentional about his filmmaking. But he cannot be a director onto himself. And he knows this. After all, his recent “Blade Runner 2049” attempted another complicated task of outrunning the shadow of the past with his sequel to Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner”. I need to sit with the contours of “Dune”. I am moved and haunted by its formal sharpness. The sand. The shots. The music. I can marvel at the sharp precision of Hans Zimmer’s score even as I wonder at the use of ululations in a film that seems still cagey at really embracing with Arabic culture. But then, this is a “future” world. Our contemporaneous cultures don’t exist in the future. But they exist now. And even if “Dune” is set in the then, it exists in the now. How do we wrestle with those paradoxes? I’m not sure “Dune” has the answers for that, and it’s probably too much for a single film to answer. Villeneuve’s control of this world, and the sharp precision is wholly compelling enough so that the sheer scope and power of the spectacle feels enough. My ignorance of the context of “Dune” became a boon, for me. But with the recent announcement of the sequel, one wonders what the future of “Dune” might look if we engaged those queries. What kind of futures can we imagine for science-fiction?"
"Dec 16, 2021",positive," Since it was first published in 1965, Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi novel has had quite a shelf-life. As well as—deep breath now—five Herbert-penned sequels, there’s a series of prequels/sequels co-written by his son, a bad 1984 film directed by David Lynch, an indifferent 2000 miniseries, even a 1983 Iron Maiden song called To Tame a Land, because Herbert wouldn’t let them use the title. Like Herbert, writer/director Denis Villeneuve is great at world-building, although his narratives sometimes run away from him—see Blade Runner 2049. Could he be the one to finally tame the material? The first step he and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth made was to cut the novel in half—a bold move seeing as a sequel isn’t yet guaranteed. Still, with part one running at a bladder-straining 155 minutes, they probably could have gone for a trilogy. In the future, the stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis is passed from House Harkonnen (aka the baddies), led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), to House Atreides (the goodies), led by Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). This takes Leto’s family—including young Paul (Timothy Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, who’s only 12 years older than Chalamet)—to Arrakis, where they must win the hearts and minds of the local Fremen people, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). All this while mining a valuable hallucinogen known as “spice” and avoiding huge, marauding sand worms. Lawrence of Arabia never had it so tough. Put simply, it’s your common-or-garden hero narrative, with Chalamet as a Jesus/Luke Skywalker/Neo figure slowly realising his power in the face of interplanetary tyranny. If it’s a little speechy and slow to begin with, at least Herbert’s words are brought to life by a world-class cast including Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Charlotte Rampling, Dave Bautista and Zendaya. But it’s Villeneuve and his crew that really dazzle. Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser is an expert at capturing extraordinary landscapes (Zero Dark Thirty, Lion, The Mandalorian), and some of the shots in Dune are so beautiful that a certain type of bachelor will want to frame them and put them on his wall/make love to them. Hans Zimmer’s sure-to-be-Oscar-winning score, which swells from rumbling bass to clamorous whispers to the mangled wail of a bagpipe, gives proceedings a suitably stirring heft. As anyone who’s seen Sicario or Incendies knows, Villeneuve is one hell of a director. And he directs the hell out of this, creating moments of spellbinding spectacle such as the Atreides’ huge spaceship emerging whale-like from roiling seas, or the sky over Arrakis split by fire as the Harkonnens attack, sending Paul and Lady Jessica out into the desert badlands. Occasionally, the material does feel a little overly familiar. Aside from the Baron himself, who rubs his head a la Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) in Apocalypse Now and, thrillingly, can levitate, the Harkonnens are the kind of generic goth baldies we’ve seen a hundred times before in the likes of Dark City. The Fremen, meanwhile, are often cast as cliched mystical natives, which isn’t helped by the eruptions of indigenous wailing on the soundtrack. But the main reason for this over-familiarity is that film-makers have been ripping off Dune for years; Star Wars for instance borrowed its desert planet and visionary teen, turning the sandworms into a Sarlacc pit. No wonder Herbert was so touchy about protecting his IP. Although fatigue sets in just before the end—at which point we are informed, frustratingly, that “this is only the beginning!”—Villeneuve has achieved something beyond an impressive adaptation. With streaming taking over the world, and the future of cinema at stake, his is a vision so huge, so overwhelming, that it demands to be seen on an IMAX-sized screen, so it can swallow you whole like some kind of subterranean invertebrate. Dune may not be for everyone, but what it has in spades is an unshakable belief in its own world-building, from a drop of sweat trickling down the ear of a desert rodent to the massive shimmering tsunamis of sand. Now, how about that sequel?"
"Dec 16, 2021",neutral," Dune, the much-hyped new film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, finally heaves its bulk into cinemas this week, kicking up a cloud of dust – and not much else. The dystopian blockbuster has gone all out to impress with its popular source material, a well-regarded director (Blade Runner 2049’s Denis Villeneuve) and an impressive cast (also featuring Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem) but somehow it still commits the ultimate cinematic sin of being, well, a bit boring. Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of a powerful duke (Isaac) in the far future of humanity, who is given the stewardship of the dangerous and unforgiving desert planet Arrakis, aka Dune. The planet, for all its difficult conditions – including giant sandworms, its hostile native people, the Fremen, and the necessity of wearing suits that recycle sweat (yum) – also yields the precious substance spice, the properties of which extend human life and make faster-than-light travel possible.  However, the planet’s previous stewards, the Harkonnen (led by Stellan Skarsgård’s grotesquely fleshy Baron Vladimir), are not willing to let go of Arrakis’ riches without a fight. Meanwhile, Paul is haunted by visions of the future, including that of Fremen girl Chani (Zendaya), as he exercises special powers encouraged by his mother Lady Jessica (Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit group, who train their bodies and minds to achieve superhuman abilities. So far, so sci-fi standard – but semi-entertaining. However, Dune’s key issue is its pacing, with every one of the film’s two hours and 35 minutes seemingly stretched out with not quite as much plot as you would expect to fill them. The build-up to the story’s major action takes almost the entirety of this movie, with a Dune part two confidently referenced (although not yet confirmed). With the slow pace, although the film is nicely shot by Greig Fraser, at times it’s hard to escape the overpowering sense of it really just being an awful lot of dust and quite a few sandworms. Bursts of action and plot give a glimpse at the exciting epic that Dune could have been the whole way through, but it doesn’t help with the movie’s dryness when they’re lacking. For a film that takes its sweet time setting out its premise, it’s also frustratingly short on some contextual detail, such as more on the mysterious Bene Gesserit and the reasoning behind Lady Jessica’s overall mode of ‘fraught’ (although that would have made the film indeterminately longer, so maybe not). Dune is not particularly helped by its harsh soundtrack either, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, which is a lot of similar-sounding futuristic crash-bang-wallop that seems to repeat on a loop, ready to indicate moments of high tension – even if nothing much ends up happening. One undeniable plus of Dune is its cast, with every performer committed to giving of their all, despite a general lack of zing in the script to help the film rise above other nondescript standard sci-fi fare. Chalamet proves a strong and convincing lead as Paul, a slightly uneasy young man forced to grapple with his future as a leader – in more ways than one. Jason Momoa injects some much-needed humour as the gung-ho Duncan Idaho, also playing noble soldier to a T in more sombre moments. Sharon Duncan Brewster is also a standout as a gender-swapped Dr Liet Kynes, a complex ally to House Atreides on Arrakis as an imperial planetary ecologist, and also a Fremen. And a warning for Zendaya fans – she only properly appears in the movie’s final 10 minutes. Dune is so obviously gunning for its second part that Villeneuve has rather let that ambition play havoc with this film’s content and pace. It’s tough to know whether to reward that with a sequel or not, although audiences are likely to be invested in a hopeful pay-off of more action in part two. Keen fans of Herbert’s source novel will likely find more to enjoy in the series getting a refreshed cinematic outing after David Lynch’s 1984 version, but for others it’s hard to escape Dune feeling very slow, and very dry, as a sci-fi.

"Dec 10, 2021",positive," The extraordinary story, the epic visual feast and the sheer immersive scale and majesty of it all on the big screen. Then there's a stone-cold unfathomably flawless cast, the Hans Zimmer score, and the gifted maestro Denis Villeneuve orchestrating it all from the director's chair. From the Frank Herbert novel we are transported to a universe ruled by those who control the one commodity they cannot live without - spice. The House of Atreides are sent to govern, including the enigmatic son of the Duke, Paul Atreides, fuelled by his mysterious dreams and on the cusp of uncovering his powers."
"Dec 7, 2021",positive," When I was a child, I had deeply disturbing dreams of vastness, like my unconscious mind was tapping into the sheer, unfathomable scale of the universe, the entire sweep of not just geological but celestial time, and the dim awareness of how small and finite I was when set against all that was terrifying. It was all very abstract; there were no concrete images that I can now recall, only the impressionistic sense of huge, unknowable shapes moving, perhaps rotating, in yawning space, and my insectile, flawed apprehension of something absolutely beyond my mind’s ability to fully and accurately encompass. Maybe that doesn’t sound like much written down, but it was annihilatingly horrifying at the time, enough to jolt me awake in a welter of uncomprehending and fearful tears more than once. I remember one time I was out the front door, through the front gate, and halfway down the street in the middle of the night before I recovered myself enough to return, barefoot and shaken, to my bed. Now, Dune — in any of its varied forms — isn’t exactly about that, but it’s a little bit about it. It’s about finite lives lived in infinite space and time, it’s about free will and prophecy, destiny, and what Hardcore History’s Dan Carlin calls the two schools of history: the “trends and forces” school, where vast and largely rudderless social and economic movements, combined with pre-existing conditions, shape the course of our existence; and the “great man” school which puts the blame squarely on charismatic movers and shakers — your Adolph Hitlers, your Napoleon Bonapartes, your Paul Atreideses. It’s about colonialism and imperialism and oil, and the new film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve handles those themes better than any other iteration thus far, even if it still doesn’t quite thread the needle. But what Villeneuve does exceedingly well is at least touch on that vastness that scared me half to death as a little kid. Sense of scale is an interesting thing in science fiction, and it’s far better communicated visually than in prose. You could argue with no small amount of justification that the key image in modern science fiction is that first shot of the Star Destroyer in pursuit of the Rebel Blockade Runner in the original Star Wars (1977), how the Imperial Ship looms into the frame seemingly from behind us and just keeps coming, an enormous metal sperm whale running down a minnow. Gareth Edwards, who already had Monsters (2010) and Godzilla (2014) under his belt at the time, got a similar, if less iconic, effect in 2016’s Rogue One with the shot of the Death Star’s super laser dish being lowered into place. The king of this sort of thing is sci-fi artist Chris Foss, whose paperback covers communicate the sheer size of his ships and planet-bestriding robots better than any other artist. Chris Foss actually worked on Chilean lunatic Alejandro Jodorowsky’s aborted but hugely influential attempt to film Dune back in the ‘70s, and while little of his influence is readily discernible in Villeneuve’s film (and that’s a pity, as we’ll talk about in a bit), Denis’ big, brutalist spaceships and buildings certainly pack a punch, especially on the big screen (and you should, if you can, make the trip for this one). Oppressively immense walls of metal tower over us, and even the quiet, airy spaces of the Atreides castles on Caladan and Arrakis seem too large for human use. The Spacing Guild Heighliners that carry House ships and personnel between the stars are so big you begin to understand how an ant must feel when a human fingertip stabs towards it with murderous intent. And we haven’t even got to the worms yet. The plot of Dune is both well-turned earth and a bit byzantine, but to summarize: it is the year 10,191, and humanity has a universe-spanning civilization organized under powerful noble houses with an Emperor at the top of the heap. Computers are banned, but human potential has reached its zenith, with human computers called Mentats handling the information processing, and all kinds of wild Shaolin-monk-level martial arts and psychic powers thrown into the mix for good measure, the latter chiefly wielded by the Bene Gesserit, an order of all-female witches who have been manipulating bloodlines for countless generations in order to produce the Kwisatz Haderach — a universal superbeing capable of bringing order to the cosmos (and whom they want to control). All space travel is controlled by the Navigators of the Spacing Guild, whose own mental abilities allow them to fold space and chart a course between stars. They derive this power from ingesting vast quantities of the spice melange, a potent narcotic and life-extending anagathic. Without the spice, all space travel would cease to exist. Melange is only found on one world, the desert planet Arrakis, also called Dune. This is a pretty valuable piece of space real estate, essentially analogous to the oil fields of the Middle East, which is also why it’s home to tribes of fierce desert warriors called Fremen, who are essentially Space Bedouin and have been fighting off every noble house tasked with mining spice for ages now. When the film opens (we got there eventually), the Emperor has ordered the brutal House Harkonnen to cede control of Arrakis to their ancient enemies, House Atreides, led by the honorable Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). House Atreides decamps for Arrakis, with Leto; his concubine, the Bene Gesserit Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson); his heir, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and their trusted servants and advisors, including swordsman Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), general Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Master of Assassins Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), and royal physician Doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) all making the trip. They know they’re walking into danger but do not suspect that the Emperor has set them up for a fall, and House Harkonnen, led by the loathsome Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew, the brutal Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), are planning a terrible betrayal. But Paul, who is reticent about his destiny as the leader of House Atreides, has been dreaming of Arrakis, and a Fremen girl, Chani (Zendaya). Are his dreams actually prophecy? Is he the Kwisatz Haderach? And does the future of House Atreides lie in the deep deserts of Dune, with its warrior cults and giant sandworms? That took a lot of typing, and here’s the thing: that’s half the book. The film released this year is Dune Part One, with Villeneuve leaving a big old sequel hook dangling just before the end credits. However, the film, as directed by Villeneuve and written by him, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, does an excellent job of relaying all that info above in clean and elegant ways, and more besides. Some changes to the source material have been made, but largely for the better; whereas the writings of the Princess Irulan (Miss Not Appearing in This Film) frame the narrative in the novel, and that character as played by Virginia Madsen delivered the opening voice-over info dump in David Lynch’s 1984 film adaptation, here the duty falls to Zendaya’s Chani, who muses “Who will our new oppressors be?” before we even meet nominal hero Paul and his ostensibly honorable family. While the film goes to great lengths to illustrate Leto’s steadfastness and the nobility of the Atreides to the Fremen, they’re just another cadre of invaders who’ve come to plunder the planet. That’s smart, and Dune the film is full of similar smart choices; the workings of the personal forcefields everyone uses are portrayed in a single, perfectly illustrative shot when Gurney is training Paul. Similarly, a shot of an ornithopter’s wings beginning to beat as it takes off, framed through the still wings of another ornithopter on the landing pad, communicates more about the aircraft of Arrakis than a whole speech could. We still get a speech describing the function of the stillsuits that are vital for survival in the open desert, though, but given it’s delivered by Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet Kynes, and Imperial Ecologist who has, to use a vulgar term, gone native, that’s just fine. Duncan-Brewster is stepping into the slip-fashion desert boots of Max Von Sydow, the character having been gender-flipped since the ‘84 film and novel, and to be honest, might actually be an improvement on the Swedish legend’s turn. Narratively, two things stand out for me. One is the film’s clear and vital trust in its audience. Dune is a big, weird story full of bizarre customs and conceits, oddball characters, alien (in the broadest sense of the word) technology, and more, and yet while Villeneuve’s film is deliberately paced to evoke a sense of grandeur and gravitas, it rarely, if at all, stops the action to sit us down and explain things. Rather, it communicates with us visually, giving us the data we need to extrapolate a decent understanding of what we’re seeing. The occasional exposition extravaganzas are taken from the source novel, and that’s hard to complain about. For all that Dune has been sitting in the “unfilmable” basket for ages, this adaptation is a clear a distillation of Frank Herbert’s novel as you could hope for, without getting bogged down in reams of talking head “As you know, Bill” dialogue (looking right at you, early 2000s SyFy Channel miniseries). The other thing that impresses is Villeneuve’s gift for locating the emotion in any given scene, a vital task in a film of this scale. It would be so easy to lose track of that small, human element in all the big, sweeping, epic action, but Dune is all about the interplay and contrast between the human and the infinite. Sometimes it’s a glance between Leto and Jessica, a shot of Paul looking at his father, a joke cracked by Gurney or Duncan. Often, it’s simply letting Ferguson’s Jessica drop her mask for a second and see how terrified she is for her son, as when the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) tests him in the film’s opening scenes. The cast is great, simply wonderful across the board. I’m not sure if I can see Chalamet as the warrior prophet Paul later becomes, but he’s perfect as the unformed young man being put through the gauntlet. Momoa’s cocky charisma brings Duncan, a character previously poorly served on the screen, to remarkable life, and the same goes for Brolin’s gruff charm as Gurney, while Isaac brings a doomed nobility, Leto. Other performers sketch out their characters with limited screentime; Bautista, a genuinely gifted actor, is stripped of all but his physicality in the role of Rabban, although Skarsgård is memorably grotesque as the horrifically corpulent Baron Harkonnen. Still, I think we really missed out on seeing more of David Dastmalchian as Harkonnen Mentat Piter de Vries — obviously, the process of adaptation is one of deciding what to cut. Though, I think his character suffers the most in this version. I do love the feral intensity that Javier Bardem brings to Fremen leader Stilgar, especially in his brief scene with Leto, but I also think the film missed a trick by not casting MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) actors as the Fremen. I also don’t think the choice Villeneuve did make sinks the ship, but it’s a missed opportunity, and if MENA actors and activists are angered, it’s not hard to see why. While this Dune is less guilty of Orientalism and endorsing colonialism than its forebears, it’s not guilt-free, and while it’s a complex text and you can argue that the overall series ultimately works as a condemnation of colonialism and “white savior” tropes, it’s a bit weak for fans to complain when people are engaging with and critical of the text as presented in this form. (For the record, a few years ago when I was ruminating on how you’d do Dune, I landed on three ten-episode TV seasons, with MENA Fremen led by Alexander Siddig’s Stilgar, and a Hispanic House Atreides, largely due to the bullfighting theme, under Antonio Banderas’ Duke Leto). A part of me does, at any rate. When you’ve got the fingerprints of certified freaks like Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch on the clay, it’s hard not to wish that Villeneuve had let his own personal freak flag fly a bit higher. This Dune is the most accessible version of the source material, and that’s great, but I wonder if it plays it too safe. The film makes mention of melange being a sacred hallucinogen, but we don’t get any hallucinations apart from Paul’s very literal prophetic dreams (recall the nightmarish visions in Lynch’s version, which are not a million miles away in tone from the nightmares that plagued my childhood). Greig Fraser’s cinematography is gorgeous, as is the production design by Patrice Vermette and the costumes by Bob Morgan and Jacqueline West, but the color palette is so subdued as to be mostly beige — even the lush planet Caladan is in muted greys and dark greens. While the visual realization of the Dune universe is impressive, I’m reminded of the “Mexico filter” American filmmakers use to evoke suburban notions of life south of the border. For sure, it makes those blue-within-blue Fremen eyes really pop, but the lack of color and art and culture feels off and maybe a little paternalistic. Indeed, we’re talking about fictional cultures, fictional people, but they’re meant to remind us of or at least key off of real-world cultures and people, and if history has taught us anything, it’s that you’ve really got to be hard up against it to stop making art. It’s a niggle, not a deal-breaker, but it’s one I keep circling and poking at. When commentators complain that much of Dune looks like a perfume ad, I wonder if that’s partly down to the brightness being turned down on the cultures against which the action is set. Perhaps I’m being precious, complaining about such things in what is, to my mind, a clear five-star film, but I think it’s a fair criticism, and besides, when so much is executed so well, any flaws are going to stand out all the more. Rest assured, Dune is a triumph of a film, certainly the best major science fiction film we’ve had in years (and the only real competition comes from movies also directed by Denis Villeneuve). It’s bold, ambitious, and staggering in scope, but that very ambition pushes it in a certain direction while leaving others less explored. Perhaps when Part Two rolls around, and we can watch the whole thing as one sweeping epic, even my minor gripes will prove unfounded. For now, we have this, and it’s great."
"Dec 6, 2021",negative," Dune is a triumph of mediocrity. What it does, it does well enough, but was it worth doing? It’s a cookie-cutter movie, a restatement of every trope that now impoverishes cinema: size rather than drama, action rather than character, adrenaline rather than engagement, imitation rather than creation. A book that sold 20 million copies because of ideas and vision becomes a movie with neither. Frank Herbert’s novels have been notoriously tricky to adapt, as David Lynch found in his earlier, much recut film version. The gifted Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve, after fine work on Arrival and Sicario, “solves” most of the problems by pretending they don’t exist. He has cut the book into pieces, to extend the life of the series (he’s already making part two). The first film retains some of the complexity of Herbert’s plot, but doesn’t bother with complexity of character – and without that, the characters just seem ridiculous, a set of medieval knights, barons and witches flailing around a desert planet in outer space, striking poses against big backdrops – an Arthurian legend with more sand than Lawrence of Arabia. The ethereal-looking Timothee Chalamet is Paul, heir to the throne of the Atreides clan on planet Caladan. Oscar Isaac is his father, the Duke, who rashly accepts his emperor’s command to take over mining operations on the planet Arrakis. Rebecca Ferguson is Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica, part of a secret order of crazy nuns led by Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam, who wields pain as a political weapon. Stellan Skarsgard is hilarious as the sleazy Baron Harkonnen – the flabbiest bad-ass since Jabba the Hutt – and Jason Momoa suits up with space armour to play Paul’s faithful warrior friend. The great and good are here in numbers – Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem, too – but with bugger-all to do. The hauntingly beautiful American actor-singer Zendaya plays the girl of Paul’s dreams – a warrior nymph from the blue-eyed sand warrior tribe, the Fremen. Basically, it’s the story of a messiah, born to rule in a world full of warring dukes and scheming ladies – something like France in the 12th century. Every once in a while, a giant worm pops up out of the sand and eats a space ship or a “spice”-harvesting contraption the size of a football field. “Spice” is a mineral so rare that empires rest upon its exploitation. Intergalactic navigation depends upon it. When the worm approaches, the cinema in which I saw it (one of the most technologically equipped in the country) started to vibrate. Even the seats shook with excitement – or Dolby wizardry. In an era of loud movies, this is perhaps the loudest I have experienced in four decades of reviewing. The strategy seems to be to beat us into submission: you will get excited, by physical intimidation if not by stimulation of your imagination. Dune is probably the first movie in history designed to appeal primarily through the posterior. It’s triumphantly arse-about, if you’ll excuse the expression. Herbert wrote Dune while experimenting with psychotropic fungi. He was trying to bring ecology into the realm of mythology while stoned on magic mushrooms. Villeneuve wants so desperately to break into the modern audience’s consciousness, to drag us away from our phones, that he resorts to an ever-present bass rumble that’s like a drone massage. Come on, feel the noise. Even then, in the best-equipped cinema in Sydney, much of the dialogue was inaudible. Greig Fraser has done a fabulous job as cinematographer, but what can you do with a movie that looks so good and sounds so awful? The book Dune inspired Star Wars. The creation of complete worlds, with their own languages and customs, was part of what excited George Lucas, but he added humour. Denis Villeneuve does this adaptation straight-faced: just another boring superhero instalment for the generations raised on Luke and Leia. You search in vain for the deeper ideas, the sense of a metaphor worth the name, a shard of meaning beyond the usual “a hero is born” guff. Good luck with that. The worm can have the whole thing."
"Dec 6, 2021",positive,"Villenueve has mistaken humourlessness for seriousness before now, but with a dream cast and a streamlined script, this Dune flies."
"Dec 5, 2021",positive," Early in Denis Villeneuve’s film Dune, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the teenage scion of a politically powerful family, is breakfasting with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), on their lush, rainy homeworld, Caladan. She tells Paul that his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), wants him dressed in full uniform today. Later, Paul stands on a podium alongside his parents and their key aides: weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Thufir Harwat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), the Mentat of House Atreides. Paul wears a crisply tailored black uniform with collar insignias and a gold braided aiguilette, his trousers tucked into knee-high boots. Banners flying, military forces ranked behind them, they watch an imperial delegate spaceship slowly descend. Its passengers disembark and process towards the podium. With great pageantry, the Herald of the Change (Benjamin Clementine) reads an official announcement from a scroll: the Emperor has granted House Atreides fiefdom over the desert world Arrakis, where the precious psychoactive spice melange is sifted from the dunes and used to power interstellar travel. Duke Leto ritually accepts the appointment — “We are House Atreides; there is no call we do not answer!” — and seals the deal with his ancestral signet ring. “Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!” shout the assembled troops. House Atreides cares about its traditions — its noble necropolis; its love of bullfighting; the proud burden of leadership, passed from father to son. Yet underlying their display of power and fealty is a sense of anxious foreboding. Later, Lady Jessica wakes Paul in the middle of the night and makes him dress again for another, private ceremony, a shadow twin of the first. Jessica, an acolyte of esoteric matriarchal order the Bene Gesserit, has trained Paul in her ways; and now her mentor, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), arrives in a different spaceship, in a different procession, to perform a ritual of testing upon Paul. The way Villeneuve repeats ceremonial motifs throughout the film is itself ceremonious. The descending aircraft; the ranked and waiting staff and troops; the formations and processions in formal dress; the fraught moments in which risk and safety teeter in balance; the simultaneous possibility and doubt that there’s something special about Paul. The chivalric gesture of holding a blade vertically against the heart, then horizontally across the head: performed first by Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), and then, at the film’s climax, by Paul as he begins a ritual duel. This isn’t a didactic film. Instead of explaining its feudal, courtly world, it immerses the viewer in that world’s formalist visual language. And the way it loops through fragments of Paul’s dreams and premonitions — which are relaxed, chaotic, un-ceremonial — builds a sense of anticipation… or dread. In one of his most terrible visions, he sees himself alongside Chani (Zendaya), the Fremen girl from Arrakis who has haunted Paul’s dreams. Now they’re the ones slowly descending in a spaceship; and they turn a pitiless, spice-blue gaze downwards as fighters swarm Caladan. Will Duke Leto’s ceremony of peaceful power transfer become Paul’s ceremony of lethal crusade? Humans are drawn to ceremony because it folds together contrasting ideas of time and space to create heightened, meaningful experiences. Ceremony takes place in an intense present moment, yet its events and gestures are traditional and unchanged, connecting participants to the long-ago past by the continuity of the repetition. Ceremony is also intensely spatial: it meshes the subjectivity of human experience with the objectivity of place. It can be sublime in the Romantic sense, in that ceremonies often take place somewhere special that transports us from the everyday, provoking overwhelming wonder and an awareness of our smallness in the grand scheme of things. Cinematographer Greig Fraser does amazing work here with bold contrasts of light in a film that would have been tempting to flood with warm gold at magic hour – indeed, Paul’s visions of Chani are a bait-and-switch, a teenage dream, a perfume commercial. Inside the Atreides stronghold in the Arrakis capital, Arrakeen, and in a later sequence in an environmental research station, light wells penetrate deep velvety shadows. When a poison dart sent by the displaced former spice barons – the pallid, insectile House Harkonnen – seeks Paul in his bedroom, he hides in stillness and light like a desert mouse: sheltering in a projection of vegetation thrown out by an educational film he’s been watching. (Villeneuve returns to this motif of the mouse, muad’dib, which, as fans of the novel will know, becomes Paul’s nom de guerre.) Ceremonies can also be mysteries in the sense of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece, understood only by initiates. Dune marshals the mood of such hidden power, represented here by the Bene Gesserit: I really enjoyed the film’s use of sound design to render “the Voice”, which commands its listener. The Bene Gesserit have basically weaponised ceremony: they have spent thousands of years secretly trying to breed the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who can fold time and space practically, as ceremony does magically. The eugenic and colonial politics of Dune are troubled, and this film has caught criticism for choosing soft, broad ‘representationism’ over either the source novel’s cultural specificity or a more radical revision. But it’s through Villeneuve’s emphasis on ceremony that we can sense the allure of cultural imperialism: it’s a practice that invites participation. While the Romantic sublime was essentially solitary, lonely as a cloud, participating in ceremony can also be powerfully communal: a surrender of the separate self to a larger shared experience. Cinemagoing is also a ceremony: a shared surrender to darkness and dazzlement. And what are film tropes and genres but rituals, which draw their power from the way they call to their own past as they unfurl along paths made smooth from repetition and anticipation? We don’t often express our spectatorship that way, though. We’ll talk about how some films feel more cinematic because they marshal spectacle on a grand scale, or because their deliberate framing, blocking and editing make small details and moments feel special and significant. Sometimes, we’ll say a moment in a film is “cool” or “awesome”. Plenty about Villeneuve’s Dune is big and spectacular, but its small motifs and gestures were what stayed with me. I don’t think it’s accidental that hands are so prominent here: Paul must place his hand in a box of pain; he touches the shifting Arrakis sands as spice sparkles in the air; he and his mother share a hand-signed language; hands offer and wield crysknives. I’ve never understood the hype about Timothée Chalamet, but I really enjoyed his performance in this film. Perhaps something about his acting feels at home in formalism, yet grates smarmily on me in a naturalistic mise-en-scène. Or maybe I, too, have been lured by the satisfaction of big-screen pageantry."
"Dec 4, 2021",positive," 
    To wade into the Dune mythology not knowing a whole lot about Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel — and with no agenda barring Incendies director Denis Villeneuve’s badass track record
    and the minor mythology of T. Chalamet’s runway-ready hair — is to bear witness to a fractured and bewildering future world. The machinations are a mind boggle but one thing is certain: every
    big-ticket shot, rolled out with determined intensity in this first instalment of Villeneuve’s planned two-part tale, means mega business.
 
    The commodity up for grabs is an invaluable, super-enhancing “spice” that, among other enviable things, makes interstellar travel a reality. Its home planet of Arrakis is a desert hellhole, but
    that’s not about to stop the covetous Duke Leto of House Atreides (Isaac), ruler of the planet Caladan, or his paramour, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), and their son and heir, Paul (Chalamet). The
    plan, orchestrated by their double-crossing Emperor, is ostensibly for the Duke and his tremendously armoured troops to unseat the ruling House Harkonnen and grab Arrakis and its spice haul for
    themselves. Unfortunately for the Duke, the Emperor doesn’t plan to stop there, as any corporate raider could have told him.
"
"Dec 4, 2021",positive," In a galaxy ruled by an evil Emperor, a young man is told he is the inheritor of a legacy that could change the course of history. On a harsh desert planet a war between good and evil begins, while powerful forces – some of which have access to powers akin to magic – begin to meddle and manipulate. Fanciful names and titles abound, while our hero has a name common on Earth today. Hang on, there’s no robots – this isn’t Star Wars after all. Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune was such a huge influence on Star Wars (mix Dune with Flash Gordon, throw in some decent special effects and you’ve pretty much got the winning formula) it’s no surprise it’s had two big budget adaptations over the last forty years. David Lynch’s 1984 attempt remains his one major misfire, a confusing and at times embarrassing mess. Can Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) finally bring it successfully to the big screen? Short answer: yes. In fact, go for the biggest screen you can. Where Lynch’s version focused on the strange and perverse nature of the galaxy circa 10,191 (and that date is counted from a point already thousands of years in our future), Villeneuve goes for sheer size and impact. This is a future where humanity is dwarfed by both its creations and the worlds it dwells on; if you’re after a drinking game you could do worse than take a shot every time we see a giant spaceship touch down (close up of landing gear optional) followed by a massive access gantry being lowered and a handful of tiny people walking down. It’s definitely impressive to experience, even if it’s slightly at odds with the source material. The future of Dune, which Lynch conveyed but Villeneuve skips over, is one where a religious war long ago wiped out thinking machines. There are no robots or computers. Everything has to be done by someone. So combat is mostly hand-to-hand with shields and knives; the future of humanity itself will be steered by an individual bred across generations for the role. Enter Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). While he chafes (lightly) against the confines of being a royal son, his father is overseeing a shift in galactic politics. The Emperor has given House Atreides rulership of the desert planet Arrakis, AKA Dune. It’s the only known source of spice, a hallucinogenic drug that, amongst other things, makes it possible for humans to guide interstellar travel. The previous rulers of Dune, House Harkonnen, aren’t happy, which is the point; the Emperor wants them to fight (and Harkonnen to win) to prevent either side from becoming powerful enough to challenge him. The Fremen, natives of Dune, have other plans. This backdrop of galaxy-wide intrigue and scheming is a major part of the appeal of the source material – it’s a big story about big issues – and Villeneuve gets that across in every scene. There’s room for human touches too, mostly Paul’s warmth towards his family and teachers, who are all-too-aware that in this universe human feeling gets you killed. But this is an epic in every sense of the term, and if it’s occasionally a little one-note in the thudding portentousness of it all, that’s a price Villeneuve is clearly willing to pay. Under the weight of the sheer epic sweep of this film, the story itself falters on occasion. Lynch’s version possibly told it better, or at least was more interested in it; while the plot itself is never muddled, many of the supporting characters here blend into the background more than they should. On the other hand, the insect-winged ornithopters used for travel on Dune look amazing. If narratively this isn’t as fully realised as it could be, visually there isn’t a dull frame to be found. This film focuses on the first half of the novel; a sequel telling the second half of the story (and possibly providing more of the backdrop) was greenlit a week or so into its release overseas. There’s perhaps a little too much emphasis on Paul’s mystical visions of the future here, pointing the way towards an ending that we’ll now get to see for ourselves in (supposedly) October 2023. It will be a long wait, but considering the epic scale of everything else about Dune, that seems only fair. Anthony Morris is a freelance film and television writer.

"Dec 3, 2021",positive," If history is anything to go by, it's been easier to fold space and time than to film Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi classic Dune, an epic far-future tale of feuding space dynasties, secret sisterhoods and New Age prophets that cleaves to – and critiques – the genre's classic hero narrative. Many have tried and perished in the sandstorm. Wild-eyed Chilean surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky had grand designs – a 14-hour version he hoped would star Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger and Orson Welles – that proved way too ambitious to realise. Ridley Scott toyed with the idea before giving up and moving on. David Lynch – a filmmaker in sync with Herbert's psychic visions – made it all the way to the screen with a memorably grotesque piece of pop art in 1984, only to have it chopped down to the point of near incoherency. The latest filmmaker to put their hand in the pain box, Canadian writer-director Denis Villeneuve, seems like a bit of an odd choice by comparison. He's the kind of filmmaker dubiously marketed as a 'visionary' by studios, even as his recent sci-fi forays – Arrival (2016); the deeply unnecessary Blade Runner 2049 (2017) – seem better suited to show off flatscreen TVs in designer apartments than evoke any kind of sweeping mystical future. So it's a pleasant surprise to report that his take on Dune, which finally descends upon cinemas this week, is an engrossing, well-mounted adaptation that makes good on his potential as a sci-fi craftsman – not exactly enough to qualify as a visionary work, but an ambitious and largely satisfying space opera that rises like an oasis against the desert of Hollywood's current superhero cinema. Boosted by Hans Zimmer's speaker-rumbling score – with its metronomic thump and guttural alien chants – the film is burnished and commanding, full of immense wide shots that dwarf the screen, jagged spacecraft that seem to emerge from misty oil paintings, and an admirable commitment to big, earnest movie myth-making. But Dune's prettiest effect might be its cast, especially its young leads, baby-faced androgyne Timothée Chalamet and galaxy-eyed princess Zendaya – two kids who're enough to suggest a brighter, or at least hotter, cosmic future. Chalamet is Paul, teenage heir to the noble House Atreides, a mall-goth glowerpuss who divides his time between learning mind tricks from his witchy mother, Lady Jessica (a soulful Rebecca Ferguson), and putting off the politics of the family business with dad, house boss and resident dreamboat, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). It's the very distant future – never mind the swords, faux-medieval trimmings and bagpipes – and the galactic Emperor has dispatched House Atreides to take custody of Arrakis, the desert planet rich in the spice that is essential to space travel. The appointment isn't going down well with the Atreides's bitter rivals House Harkonnen, a planet of sinister creeps who bathe in black slime, keep giant spiders as pets, and whose leader, Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), seems modelled after Marlon Brando's performance in Apocalypse Now (1979). Exploited for its natural resource, Arrakis – also known as Dune – is inhabited by the indigenous Fremen, a band of blue-eyed nomads who include Zendaya's Chani, the desert warrior who's been turning up in Paul's dreams. These premonitions also suggest that Paul might be a kind of space messiah; much to the concern of Lady Jessica's clan, the Bene Gesserit, a shadowy, distaff order of psychic witches who've been trying to summon forth a chosen one – via an Atreides daughter – to bridge space and time, past and future. ""So much potential wasted on a male,"" hisses the order's Reverend Mother, played by Charlotte Rampling in a neat echo of her all-female-cult queen in John Boorman's Zardoz (1974). It's certainly a lot to swallow for the uninitiated: a fact that undid Lynch's truncated version, in which poor Virginia Madsen (as imperial Princess Irulan, heir to the galaxy) had to dispense reels of exposition over the eerie, spectral opening moments. Villeneuve has the relative luxury of two chapters – be warned, this is only Part One – and he uses this to his advantage, allowing the narrative to breathe against the scope of the images. Shooting partially on location in Jordan, Abu Dhabi and Norway, Villeneuve, Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Rogue One) and production designer Patrice Vermette (Sicario; Arrival) give the story a sense of scale and lived-in detail, welding the wide-screen vastness of Lawrence of Arabia (1962) to the scrappy grit of the first Star Wars (1977), a film whose desert sequences were famously inspired by Herbert's writing. The vistas are enhanced by all the special effects a reported $165 million dollar budget can buy: combat holo-shields that glitch and glimmer, insect-like ornithopters that swoop through sandstorms, and titanic spacecraft that seem to have teleported right off the pulp paperback covers of the 60s and 70s. But the showy effects are also offset by an attention to less expected, human-sized details: Jason Momoa's easy, movie-star charm as Duncan Idaho, a swordmaster who Paul adores; the way the great Stephen McKinley Henderson, as human computer Thufir Hawat, parades a parasol during a military inspection; or the beverages distilled from sweat, tears, and spit – presumably not available in the Dune combo at the candy bar, unless you incur the wrath of a disgruntled teenage employee. What Villeneuve and his co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born) will do with Dune's overarching narrative – with its Messianic leader and looming holy war – is harder to assess, given the obviously unfinished nature of their story. At least initially, Paul is a character in conflict with his destiny – as an heir to a patriarchy that ravages an ecosystem; as a potential saviour to a people – and Chalamet plays him with a suitably furrowed brow. Villeneuve has also tweaked Herbert's novel to open the film not on the imperial princess's tale of Paul, but on Chani – effectively framing events through the eyes of the Fremen. Elements drawn from Arabic culture and Eastern mysticism run throughout Herbert's work, which tangles with themes of colonialism, ecological neglect and the corruption of power, though this mixing of cultures – a staple device of science fiction – sits less well with the current moment, where such creative license, however nuanced, is viewed with suspicion. The new Dune has drawn some intelligent criticism for flattening the nuances of Herbert's text, downplaying the source material's grounding in Middle Eastern culture even as Hans Zimmer's recourse to Arabic vocal tones – often used to underscore an emotional moment of pause for the protagonists – leans on a Western audience's notion of the 'mysterious' for dramatic shorthand. All of which might have been less noticeable had Villeneuve been more attuned to the psychic power of images in the way Lynch, and certainly Jodorowsky, understood – the kind of filmmaking that might transcend a real-world analogue and transport an audience to something genuinely strange or alien. His Dune is too polished and cautious to risk putting a foot wrong – which makes sense, given this project's history, but also means there's nothing here willing to court ridicule, and by extension, genius. (If we can't have pugs and space slugs, couldn't we at least have gotten Timothée Chalamet doing the worm in place of the sand walk?) But it more than captures the attention, and sometimes even inspires awe. If this is the beginning of a resurgence in ambitious, operatic space fantasy, then bring it on.

"Dec 3, 2021",positive," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Part 1 (aka Dune) instantly joins the ranks of the great, big-budget, mass-market sci-fi extravaganzas, including 2001, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Blade Runner, all of which it either references, pays homage to, or is clearly influenced by. In the case of Star Wars, the references become quite heady, because Star Wars is so clearly influenced by Dune, the novel, that Villeneuve’s imagery re-builds upon imagery influenced by his source material. Is this a sandcrawler that I see before me? What Villeneuve does so well here is make all this familiar stuff feel so fresh, and a huge part of it involves Hans Zimmer’s score, which is ominous, threatening, suitably alien, and omnipresent. It really sets the tone, and it’s really unique. I’m no musician, but I reckon its singular arresting sonic motif combines (or is inspired by) the bagpipe and an Islamic prayer call. This ain’t Also sprach Zarathustra, nor – very definitely – is it John Williams. No, this is darker all around; Zimmer’s intense, at times frightening score is clear about that. It’s dark and it’s serious: there is one clear joke, delivered by the one character who seems allowed to make jokes. Everywhere else, all is somber. In a way, it feels like Star Wars for grown-ups. What took me by surprise was how much action there was. The first act is world-building but acts two and three are both pretty much relentless action set-pieces. It may be ‘hard’ sci-fi, but it’s totally accessible. It’s also really fun, gorgeous to look at, vibrant, stimulating, and huge. It’s extremely gratifying to see this kind of massive entertainment being made with such inventiveness and intelligence (the adaptation of a notoriously challenging text is superb and deserves an Oscar nomination for Adapted Screenplay). It’s Villeneuve’s best film, and I greatly look forward to Part Two.

"Dec 2, 2021",positive," Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of the science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, begins with an ambush. Armed figures patrol a desert devoid of human life, guarding machines that mine swirls of sand for a rare and mysterious commodity called “spice.” Then attackers emerge from the sand beneath their feet, and the desert erupts in gunfire and explosions. The ambush is part of a campaign that is not successful; in voiceover, an enigmatic character named Chani (played by the actor Zendaya) reveals that “our warriors couldn’t free [the planet] from the Harkonnens,” the occupying force responsible for the mining operation. But the scene establishes a motif that recurs throughout the film: a landscape that appears static and unchangeable shifts under one’s feet. 




Dune is, by almost any set of criteria, a difficult novel to adapt into film. (Alejandro Jodorowsky’s failed attempt and David Lynch’s campy and largely unsuccessful 1984 adaptation provide evidence of the pitfalls.) The story takes place within looming spaceships and across ecologically distinct planets, including its main setting, the desert world of Arrakis, which is inhabited by enormous sandworms that regularly gobble up mining rigs and aircraft. (These worms produce the spice—a cross between a fossil fuel and a powerful hallucinogen—needed for everything from space travel to religious rituals.) Given the importance of alien fauna and futuristic technology to the story, it’s hard to avoid the slapstick of failed special effects—for example, in a climactic scene in Lynch’s adaptation, you can see bits of green screen floating in Kyle MacLachlan’s hair as he attempts to ride a sandworm.
Many of the book’s defining moments take place within its characters’ minds, in their apprehension of subtext, strategizing, or moments of enlightenment—another difficult hurdle for film. In Dune’s first section, members of the Atreides family engage in political machinations to avoid the downfall of their house after they are put in charge of Arrakis, and in its second, Paul Atreides (played by MacLachlan in Lynch’s version, and by Timothée Chalamet in Villeneuve’s) joins Chani’s society, the Fremen, and contends with his growing powers of prescience and his prophesied role as humanity’s savior. As the latest adaptation of a sprawling science fiction classic written in the 1960s, Villeneuve’s film meets a long-standing fan base primed to dissect any errors, and the context for its central themes—particularly religious war and totalitarianism—has changed significantly since it was first published.
Villeneuve handles these challenges well: His film, which tackles the novel’s first half, is comprehensible while retaining its alien quality, its dense, esoteric world depicted in a level of detail that feels compelling without being opaque (or, as in Lynch’s adaptation, cheesy and over-the-top). The narrative has been adjusted to place it closer to contemporary postcolonial theory (“They ravage our lands in front of our eyes…. Why did the emperor choose this path? And who will our next oppressors be?” Chani asks in the film’s opening scene), clarifying its political allegiances. The film’s greatest success is its understanding of scale: clusters of humans in vast landscapes of their own making, isolated from the past and future. These landscapes, and the structures humans build on top of them, appear stable and immutable—until something under their feet changes.

The appeal of science fiction comes from extrapolating the future of intelligent life from existing patterns in society. These stories can feel as endlessly fascinating as staring into a fun house mirror, marveling at how your face appears reflected across an unfamiliar topography. Where would I fit in if Earth became sentient and rejected humans? What would I do if an alien planet made the dead come back to life? But this need to extrapolate is also science fiction’s limitation. Many of the human patterns available to authors as the foundations of their worlds are arbitrary—the product of historical contingency, material fact, or luck—or the manifestations of power misunderstood as axioms, especially where they involve race and gender. “Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change,” Octavia Butler wrote in her 1980 essay “The Lost Races of Science Fiction.” “But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest.” The challenge of science fiction is in finding a premise expansive enough to avoid reproducing those errors.
Herbert’s Dune draws on a wide range of references—the idea for the novel began as a magazine article about Oregon’s sand dunes; Herbert also read sociology, poetry, Marxism, the history of 19th-century wars in the Caucasus—and both the novel and film are studded with bits of culture from recent human history, familiar things sealed against the passage of time: bagpipes playing at a military ceremony, bullfighting, the name Duncan Idaho (Paul’s combat trainer, played by Jason Momoa), snippets of Christian verse, religious habits that echo those of medieval nuns worn by a mystical order called the Bene Gesserit. In one scene, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), the powerful companion of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), wears an updated version of chopines, the 16th-century platform shoe that holds associations with nobles and courtesans. These details make the world of Dune feel more convincingly real: 20,000 years into the future, not everything has been replaced, and random artifacts of Earth’s history remain.
Beyond those details, the axiom at the center of the story is relatively simple in its pessimism. People will do incredible things and commit incredible acts of destruction for a charismatic leader; such leaders will use their followers to consolidate power. The political system of Dune, an exponentially more technologically advanced society than our own, is space feudalism built on extractive colonialism. Assassination attempts are common, oppression is an acceptable tool, and dinners matter a great deal. The film ends with Paul pursuing a path that will not fundamentally alter the system that destroyed his family, that instead will merely give him a better place in its hierarchy, while visions of a bloody religious war to be waged in his name loom in the future. (Villeneuve’s adaptation leaves this conflict for a sequel, which will be released in 2023.)

Still, the story takes place at a moment when its motivating axiom and the structures that reinforce it begin to lose their soundness. In an early scene, an elder of the Bene Gesserit, having put Paul through a potentially fatal test to see if he might be the messianic figure the order has worked to produce, rebukes Jessica for her concern about her son’s fate: “Our plans are measured in centuries,” she says, a scale that makes the life of any person other than the predestined leader insignificant. But the film soon contradicts this longer view: Once Paul and Jessica flee and join the Fremen in the desert, every unit of time matters, and no life is insignificant, even after death—bodies are recovered to preserve the water they retain, essential for survival on the desert planet. Fate is not abstract but an immediate existential problem—a familiar shift in perspective for those living in a time of historic floods, storms, droughts, and fires. This aspect of Dune reminds me of a line from an essay by Garry Wills on a new translation of the Bible, in which he argues that from the rushed, “traffic-jam” prose of the Gospels, one can glean how “every aspect of the New Testament should be read in light of [the] ‘good news’ that the world will shortly be wiped out.” Paul’s arrival on Arrakis bears the same apocalyptic assurance for the Fremen.
Perhaps this is what makes Dune still feel relevant: It offers a view from inside a planetwide cataclysm, when tenets that seemed unshakable fall, and their alternatives—some terrible, some utopian—become newly tangible. “When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock,” one character tells Jessica. Paul’s arrival signals to Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), a state official who secretly occupies an influential position in Fremen society, that her dreams of terraforming the desert planet might become reality: “Arrakis could have been a paradise…but then the spice was discovered. And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away,” she tells Paul and Jessica. Under the current imperial government, the undertaking was considered too costly and endangered a lucrative market; with the disruption the Atreides bring, altering the planet’s climate becomes conceivable.
For all its futuristic technology and sandworms, Dune is deeply humanistic, which does not mean it necessarily celebrates humanity, but rather in the sense that Greek tragedies of hubris and self-annihilation are humanistic. Its contribution to the sci-fi canon is the idea that the new order that replaces the old is never purely liberatory; it cannot be indifferent to its revolutionaries’ self-interest. The ideals that orient change are human inventions and always, on some level, are made in the image of their creators. Jessica describes the messianic figure her order seeks as one transcending biological limitations, possessing “a mind powerful enough to bridge space and time, past and future. Who can help us into a better future.” Villeneuve’s Dune shows its protagonist before he assumes that power, and it maintains a sense of ambivalence, an outlook that asks how the future a revolution produces will be better than what came before.
 Dune is, by almost any set of criteria, a difficult novel to adapt into film. (Alejandro Jodorowsky’s failed attempt and David Lynch’s campy and largely unsuccessful 1984 adaptation provide evidence of the pitfalls.) The story takes place within looming spaceships and across ecologically distinct planets, including its main setting, the desert world of Arrakis, which is inhabited by enormous sandworms that regularly gobble up mining rigs and aircraft. (These worms produce the spice—a cross between a fossil fuel and a powerful hallucinogen—needed for everything from space travel to religious rituals.) Given the importance of alien fauna and futuristic technology to the story, it’s hard to avoid the slapstick of failed special effects—for example, in a climactic scene in Lynch’s adaptation, you can see bits of green screen floating in Kyle MacLachlan’s hair as he attempts to ride a sandworm.
Many of the book’s defining moments take place within its characters’ minds, in their apprehension of subtext, strategizing, or moments of enlightenment—another difficult hurdle for film. In Dune’s first section, members of the Atreides family engage in political machinations to avoid the downfall of their house after they are put in charge of Arrakis, and in its second, Paul Atreides (played by MacLachlan in Lynch’s version, and by Timothée Chalamet in Villeneuve’s) joins Chani’s society, the Fremen, and contends with his growing powers of prescience and his prophesied role as humanity’s savior. As the latest adaptation of a sprawling science fiction classic written in the 1960s, Villeneuve’s film meets a long-standing fan base primed to dissect any errors, and the context for its central themes—particularly religious war and totalitarianism—has changed significantly since it was first published.
Villeneuve handles these challenges well: His film, which tackles the novel’s first half, is comprehensible while retaining its alien quality, its dense, esoteric world depicted in a level of detail that feels compelling without being opaque (or, as in Lynch’s adaptation, cheesy and over-the-top). The narrative has been adjusted to place it closer to contemporary postcolonial theory (“They ravage our lands in front of our eyes…. Why did the emperor choose this path? And who will our next oppressors be?” Chani asks in the film’s opening scene), clarifying its political allegiances. The film’s greatest success is its understanding of scale: clusters of humans in vast landscapes of their own making, isolated from the past and future. These landscapes, and the structures humans build on top of them, appear stable and immutable—until something under their feet changes.

The appeal of science fiction comes from extrapolating the future of intelligent life from existing patterns in society. These stories can feel as endlessly fascinating as staring into a fun house mirror, marveling at how your face appears reflected across an unfamiliar topography. Where would I fit in if Earth became sentient and rejected humans? What would I do if an alien planet made the dead come back to life? But this need to extrapolate is also science fiction’s limitation. Many of the human patterns available to authors as the foundations of their worlds are arbitrary—the product of historical contingency, material fact, or luck—or the manifestations of power misunderstood as axioms, especially where they involve race and gender. “Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change,” Octavia Butler wrote in her 1980 essay “The Lost Races of Science Fiction.” “But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest.” The challenge of science fiction is in finding a premise expansive enough to avoid reproducing those errors.

Perhaps this is what makes Dune still feel relevant: It offers a view from inside a planetwide cataclysm, when tenets that seemed unshakable fall, and their alternatives—some terrible, some utopian—become newly tangible. “When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock,” one character tells Jessica. Paul’s arrival signals to Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), a state official who secretly occupies an influential position in Fremen society, that her dreams of terraforming the desert planet might become reality: “Arrakis could have been a paradise…but then the spice was discovered. And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away,” she tells Paul and Jessica. Under the current imperial government, the undertaking was considered too costly and endangered a lucrative market; with the disruption the Atreides bring, altering the planet’s climate becomes conceivable.
For all its futuristic technology and sandworms, Dune is deeply humanistic, which does not mean it necessarily celebrates humanity, but rather in the sense that Greek tragedies of hubris and self-annihilation are humanistic. Its contribution to the sci-fi canon is the idea that the new order that replaces the old is never purely liberatory; it cannot be indifferent to its revolutionaries’ self-interest. The ideals that orient change are human inventions and always, on some level, are made in the image of their creators. Jessica describes the messianic figure her order seeks as one transcending biological limitations, possessing “a mind powerful enough to bridge space and time, past and future. Who can help us into a better future.” Villeneuve’s Dune shows its protagonist before he assumes that power, and it maintains a sense of ambivalence, an outlook that asks how the future a revolution produces will be better than what came before.
 Herbert’s Dune draws on a wide range of references—the idea for the novel began as a magazine article about Oregon’s sand dunes; Herbert also read sociology, poetry, Marxism, the history of 19th-century wars in the Caucasus—and both the novel and film are studded with bits of culture from recent human history, familiar things sealed against the passage of time: bagpipes playing at a military ceremony, bullfighting, the name Duncan Idaho (Paul’s combat trainer, played by Jason Momoa), snippets of Christian verse, religious habits that echo those of medieval nuns worn by a mystical order called the Bene Gesserit. In one scene, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), the powerful companion of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), wears an updated version of chopines, the 16th-century platform shoe that holds associations with nobles and courtesans. These details make the world of Dune feel more convincingly real: 20,000 years into the future, not everything has been replaced, and random artifacts of Earth’s history remain.
Beyond those details, the axiom at the center of the story is relatively simple in its pessimism. People will do incredible things and commit incredible acts of destruction for a charismatic leader; such leaders will use their followers to consolidate power. The political system of Dune, an exponentially more technologically advanced society than our own, is space feudalism built on extractive colonialism. Assassination attempts are common, oppression is an acceptable tool, and dinners matter a great deal. The film ends with Paul pursuing a path that will not fundamentally alter the system that destroyed his family, that instead will merely give him a better place in its hierarchy, while visions of a bloody religious war to be waged in his name loom in the future. (Villeneuve’s adaptation leaves this conflict for a sequel, which will be released in 2023.)

Still, the story takes place at a moment when its motivating axiom and the structures that reinforce it begin to lose their soundness. In an early scene, an elder of the Bene Gesserit, having put Paul through a potentially fatal test to see if he might be the messianic figure the order has worked to produce, rebukes Jessica for her concern about her son’s fate: “Our plans are measured in centuries,” she says, a scale that makes the life of any person other than the predestined leader insignificant. But the film soon contradicts this longer view: Once Paul and Jessica flee and join the Fremen in the desert, every unit of time matters, and no life is insignificant, even after death—bodies are recovered to preserve the water they retain, essential for survival on the desert planet. Fate is not abstract but an immediate existential problem—a familiar shift in perspective for those living in a time of historic floods, storms, droughts, and fires.

"Dec 1, 2021",positive," Despite reading Frank Herbert‘s 1965 novel many moons ago and viewing David Lynch’s bizarre 1984 adaptation during my youth, Dune was still a title that felt foreign to me when entering the theatre to bare witness to Denis Villeneuve‘s much-discussed imagining.  Sure, I can clearly see the inspiration this operatic story had on the science-fiction tales that came in the years since – namely a little series known as Star Wars – and the narrative surrounding the spice business at the core of the story lacks subtlety when held up to the petroleum industry of the now, but Villeneuve’s vision, in all its robust glory, is its own beast, and in adapting the novel with his own unique vision he’s made familiar material feel somewhat untapped. Dune (or Dune: Part One, as it’s so specifically stated during the opening credits) is a film so vast that we are thankful we have a confirmed sequel to look forward to as, perhaps to the frustration of many a viewer, this is a product that very much feels narratively unfinished.  It’s heavy on exposition that in some ways it feels designed as a precursor for a bigger, grander story to be told, one that Villeneuve and co-writers Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, A Star Is Born) and Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange) consistently tease throughout, with certain influential characters deliberately shadowed; anyone hoping Zendaya will have a constant presence best check their expectations as the starlet’s screen-time barely adds up to 5 minutes in total. Speaking of Zendaya, her character, Chani, is what seemingly drives the story forward for its protagonist, young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the ducal heir of the House Atreides, a royal family of sorts who have taken over ruling duties of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet known for its produce of “spice”, a valuable substance that bestows its users heightened vitality and expanded consciousness.  Under the ruling of his father, the stern Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his various aides – namely weapons master Gurney (Josh Brolin) and swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, one of the few actors on hand able to inject a genuine sense of fun into proceedings) – Paul is instructed in the ways of combat and self defence.  At odds with this are the teachings from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, simply luminous), a member of a divine sisterhood whose representatives possess advanced physical and mental abilities, attributes she is sharing with Paul, in spite of the fact that these only be shared with other women. Holding the power he has honed from his mother’s teachings – specifically something called “the voice”, a vocal tone that manipulates the minds and wills of others – signifies a future of greatness for Paul, and the visions that haunt him throughout, though unclear to him as to what they represent, connects him to the mysterious Chani and a tribe of warriors that will seal his fate; whether that be aligned with his salvation or doom is yet to be determined.  His father’s move to Arrakis indicates Paul’s vision holds weight, and the majority of Dune‘s significant run time – it clocks in around 156 minutes – bases itself around positional politics and a heft of double (and triple) crossing that, if you’re not paying attention, finding a narrative entry point may be a somewhat murky experience. Thankfully, so much of Dune works purely on an aesthetic level.  Though it’s a particularly muted looking film in terms of colour, it remains no less gorgeous in its visual sumptuousness as to what Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser (Rogue One, The Batman) create and display on screen, and the performances, though understandably heightened, never indulge in unnecessary melodramatics.  It’s a larger than life film, and though it easily could have rested on spectacle, it manages to have substance in its detailing of tyranny, rebellion, and respecting one’s culture.  A true achievement in every sense of the word. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Dec 1, 2021",positive," DUNE **** (155 minutes) M
Yes, it’s been worth the wait. Having been delayed for over a year thanks to Covid, Dune lands with grace, beauty and on a scale so awesome and majestic and immersive it often looks like they flew out and shot the thing on alien worlds. As jaw-dropping as the sweep of the film often is, writer/director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies; Prisoners; Blade Runner 2049) has done a superb job using the epic scope and grand designs that power the film’s rich visuals to frame an engrossing, intimate, character-strong story of dynastic ascendancy, colonization and interplanetary rivalry. The desert planet Arrakis contains a special spice in its sands. For the indigenous people, the Fremen, it has great health benefits. For those who come to plunder it, the spice gives them the power to traverse space. For mysterious reasons, the not-so-nice and rather ugly miners from House Harkonnen have upped stumps and left Arrakis in their gargantuan, brick-like ships and gone back to their dark, grotty home planet, Giedi Prime. Replacing them to harvest the spice are their enemies from House Atreides, a far more attractive bunch of people who reside on the far more attractive, postcard-friendly planet of Caladan. Awarded the planet by the Intergalactic Emperor – there always has to be an Intergalactic Emperor, just like in Star Wars – the Duke (Oscar Isaac) has a different agenda than his predecessors. Yes, they need the spice, but he wants kinder, gentler dealings with the local Fremen, whose powers and knowledge he wants to harness to secure dominion over the planet against the ever-present threat of the Harkonnen hordes. By his side is son Paul (Timothee Chalamet), a gaunt, eager young lad who would rather be at the rough end of operations with space jock and trusted pal Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). Duty, however, demands he keep within his ceremonial and diplomatic roles. After all, he is in line to take over House Atreides. Paul is also trying to master an inherited gift called The Voice, a mind control power not-at-all dissimilar to The Force from Star Wars. (A coincidence, surely. A-hem.) On top of that, Paul radiates a strong vibe that has those around him suspecting that he could be The One, again a concept not-at-all dissimilar to what we saw in Star Wars.  So, off they scoot to Arrakis the hot desert planet, again an idea not-at-all dissimilar to Luke Skywalker’s home planet Tatooine. (Anyone else sensing that it’s possible George Lucas might have read Dune before coming up with Star Wars? Just a thought.) We didn’t needed yet more proof that Australian cinematographers are world leaders in the art, yet here we have Greig Fraser (Last Ride; The Boys Are Back; Zero Dark Thirty; Foxcatcher) filling the film with luminous images that often make it look like they went off-world and shot the film in space. (Has somebody already said that?). With stately compositions that are often painterly, he captures both the jaw-dropping scale of the story and its intimacy, as when Paul connects with a tiny, big-eared kangaroo mouse that inhabits the hot sands of the planet. Lovers of movie spacecraft will love Dune for its design work and the marvellous extremes therein. On the one hand, when we’re in space we get an assortment of odd-shaped spaceships with smooth features and an imposing presence. On the ground, however, it’s a fabulously different design deal. Everyone flies about in things called ornithopters, which is like a helicopter, but instead of rotor blades there are these long, foldable wings that make the machines look like giant mechanical dragonflies. They’re beautiful to behold, yet they have the visceral nuts-and-bolts feel of a loud flying machine, with everyone having to yell to be heard through clunky headsets. It’s a stark contrast to the ships we see in orbit, a brilliant example of great movie design work. It’s the emotion and intrigue that matters most, of course. Along with staging some stellar action sequences – including a great rescue set-piece involving a sandworm – Villeneuve does a superlative job imbuing the drama with a fruity Shakespearean feel as the actors move about massive sets clearly inspired by the Brutalist school of making things look grand and commanding and a bit oppressive. The beleaguered Fremen have long been forced to fight for their survival in the face of a never-ending succession of invaders who come to plunder their home for resources without giving them a  cut. In this regard you can’t help but warm to the performance by Oscar Isaacs, who gives the Duke a real sense of regal decency. He knows the power of his vast forces, yet his intentions towards the Fremen is based on respect and partnership. And desperate though he is to get spice production up to speed he gallantly puts life before profit, as one scene boldly illustrates. It’s a really deft touch that really grounds the Duke as a man of honour. For his part, Timothée Chalamet does a fine job in the lead as Paul tentatively feels his way into the role he is destined for, reluctant though he might be to accept such huge responsibility. The film is, of course, based on Frank Herbert’s award-winning 1965 novel, a universally hailed work long regarded as one of the most influential in modern sci-fi, as George Lucas would no doubt attest. Those whose formative years were in the 1970s, the novel also holds the distinction of being the most popular unread novel of the decade. Everybody owned a copy but nobody ever got through the first few chapters because the story was so dense. After the incomprehensible garble of David Lynch’s 1984 film (whichever version you sat through), and the very good, if occasionally plodding 2000 mini-series Frank Herbert’s Dune starring William Hurt, it is heartening that this Dune has as one of its producers Frank Herbert’s son Brian, who has written many novels in the Dune canon. If only they’d worked in a cameo for Kyle MacLachlan or even David Lynch to complete the circle. Perhaps they’ll pop up in the sequel, which is already in pre-production."
"Nov 30, 2021",positive," When it comes to remakes and reboots, Hollywood has a natural tendency to stick what works. From comic book adaptations like Spider-Man, to dramas-turned-musicals like A Star is Born, to action-fests like King Kong, to period piece dramas like Little Women, to like-action transfers like Beauty and the Beast, to slasher-thrillers like Halloween, to iconic Westerns like True Grit. The rationale is obvious – if it’s made money before, there’s a good chance it’ll make money again. Dune goes against the grain. Yes, it’s based on the best-selling 1965 science-fiction novel from author Frank Herbert but when first adapted for the screen in 1984, it was both a critical and financial failure. America’s two leading film critics of the time, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, described it as “the biggest disappointment of the year” and “needlessly complicated”. It made just $30 million USD at the local box-office (below its budget) and even director David Lynch admitted it was “a total failure”. The most noticeable difference in this new adaptation from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival) is that it’s a two-parter with the second instalment slated for release in late 2023. Having five hours to work with, as opposed to just two, provides a far greater opportunity to explore this interesting world and flesh out the many characters within it. Utilising the latest technology in terms of both visual and sound effects also provides a leg-up over its cheaper-looking predecessor. The plot is hard to surmise succinctly but to do my best, Dune is a multi-way power struggle set in the distant future (the year 10191 to be precise). The desert planet of Arrakis contains the most valuable substance in the universe – a “spice” used as fuel for interstellar travel. Three key groups are looking to control it – the alliance-building House Atredies, the villainous House Harkonnen, and the native population of Freman. Oh, I should mention the planet is also home to some giant, people-eating worms! Whilst the film boasts one of the largest big-name casts of the year, this is Timothée Chalamet’s show. He’s front and centre throughout and his impassioned, note-perfect performance is the key reason why audiences will invest their emotions. He plays the stylish Paul Atreides, heir to his family’s throne and a powerful young warrior who is discovering and harnessing newfound skills, both physical and mental, that will be pivotal in deciding the future of Arrakis. Following on from his Oscar nominated performance in Call Me by Your Name and scene-stealing efforts in Little Women, I’m convinced the 25-year-old Chalamet is one of the best actors of his generation. Villeneuve has been publicly critical of a decision made by Warner Bros. to release his film simultaneously in cinemas and HBO Max in the United States. That view could be seen as arrogant and near-sighted (given everything that’s happened with COVID) but having seen the finished product, it’s easier to see why he wants it seen in packed movie theatres. Dune is as much an experience as it is a movie – an orgy of immersive visuals, music and sound that pull you into its enthralling world. I bought my first Hans Zimmer soundtrack three decades ago (Backdraft) and Dune will be the next addition to the collection. The 64-year-old composer is the master of adrenalin-pumping scores (Interstellar is a masterpiece) and this is another beauty. Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Lion) also deserves a shout-out for the distinctive contrasts he creates (interior v. exterior shots) and the use of tight facial close-ups in pivotal scenes. It resembles a poetic Terrence Malick film in places."
"Nov 29, 2021",positive," Welcome to my site! My name is Andrea Thompson, and I’m a writer, editor, and film critic who is a member of the Chicago Indie Critics and also the founder and director of the Film Girl Film Festival, which you can find more info about at filmgirlfilm.com! I have no intention of becoming any less obsessed with cinema, comics, or nerdom in general. Credit to director Denis Villeneuve and his fellow co-writers, they are serious about the latest adaptation of “Dune” and in doing justice to Frank Herbert’s novel. As in deathly serious, since I wasn’t the only one laughing at the screening when the film kicked off by announcing, “Dreams are messages from the deep.” I’ve not seen the other “Dune” adaptations and have really only bothered with any part of the franchise until recently, so I can’t say how well other attempts at bringing Herbert’s book to the big (and small) screen holds up. So it might just be my ignorance talking when I say that the 2021 version is one of the best, most skillful attempts at bringing an intricate, infamously dry world to life I’ve seen.  Let’s face it, it’s hard to picture anyone but the most ardent fans enjoying a discussion about the economics of spice, palace intrigue, and religious and political philosophy. But Villeneuve is determined to have his cake and get moviegoers to eat it too, because he actually manages to fill us in on the world of young nobleman Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), whose family is sent to manage the affairs on Dune, a desert planet containing the all-important spice, only to experience death and disaster at the hands of their enemies, the Harkonnens. That’s where things get kind of awkward, because humanism doesn’t exactly inform Herbert’s philosophy. The world he created is unapologetically elitist, and the Atreides family are the good guys mostly because they’re the more reasonable colonizers. The movie doesn’t try to avoid this at least, openly pointing out that Paul and his parents, the Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) are basically the new oppressors, especially to the desert people known as the Fremen. Leto has just enough time to prove how much they want to be nice before things go to hell, and Paul and his mother Jessica are forced to flee into the harsh desert environment of Dune in order to survive. Just how it comes to that is where the movie falters. In the book the Harkonnens were dangerous, calculating enemies who could believably triumph against the honorable Atreides family. They were going to undergo a few changes regardless, since main villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), embodied the worst villain tropes taken to an extreme - fat, decadent, and a predatory gay man with a nauseating predilection for teenage boys. It’s noteworthy then, that the only characteristic that survives from the original is the fat part, with the Baron an almost featureless floating blob, and the rest of the Harkonnens equally as lacking in development, and with their bald heads and all-black clothing, clearly on the side of evil. It’s not much for a genre that’s often defined by the opposition, but those who choose to view “Dune” in the environment they were clearly meant to will have a lot to enjoy. Many films have claimed to be strictly for the theatrical experience, but “Dune” is one of the few who can honestly make that claim, and its sound design is on par with “The Quiet Place.” Dialogue is raised and lowered as we’re meant to perceive it, and the all-encompassing world has the effects to go with it, leaving my chair literally rattled beneath me during some sequences. In other words, come to theater and you’ll live quite deliciously throughout the two and a half hour runtime. And if the villains are a bore, there’s plenty of side characters, which include Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa as the warriors Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho, respectively, to liven things up. Even the character of Paul bows to 2021 standards. It’s hard to picture the book version kicking off his morning with a joke, but thankfully Chalamet is allowed to bring some badly needed levity every now and then without having to fulfill the usual shirtless wonder requirements, with Isaac stepping up to give us a little thirst trap. Let’s hope it carries on to the next film, because there’s no guarantee that there’ll be one. It’s been a long time since the days of simultaneous filming and “Lord of the Rings,” and whether there’ll be a part two, hopefully with more Zendaya, isn’t a done deal, at least until Warner Bros. sees the box office receipts. That’s disappointing, because this is clearly a set up, one which introduces us to a world and tears it down. When Zendaya’s Chani says, “This is only the beginning,” it’s a meta prophecy in itself and the hope of studios everywhere."
"Nov 29, 2021",positive,Villeneuve's Dune is a triumphantly cohesive assembly of a very difficult to adapt novel by Frank Herbert.
"Nov 20, 2021",positive,Dune is easily one of the best visually & audibly crafted films of 2021. Hans Zimmer's score is perfection. Narratively? hmmm not so much.
"Nov 20, 2021",positive,"Dune: Part One is a stunning piece of work in that context, one that could well be for the ages."
"Nov 19, 2021",negative," There’s more of Timothée Chalamet in Dune, in considerably less whimsical mood, and more Oscar Isaac too – just as saturnine as in The Card Counter, but behind a severe fatherly beard. This long-awaited blockbuster is cinema’s third stab at Frank Herbert’s supposedly “unfilmable” science fiction epic. Outré visionary Alejandro Jodorowsky tried, but it never happened, while David Lynch did pull it off, but to somewhat murky effect. Now comes Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) with a Dune for the CGI age. His version certainly takes the novel seriously, and itself, too. It’s unfailingly sombre, as if determined not be written off as merely Star Wars sprinkled with sand. Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, scion of a planetary dynasty given the contract to extract the priceless material “spice” from the deserts of arid planet Arrakis. That pallid youth Paul may be the foretold Messiah who will one day bring about the liberation of Arrakis’s desert-dwelling Fremen – could this be any more of a “white saviour” fantasy? Still, it seems that Villeneuve won’t get round to grappling with that problematic issue until Episode 2, if it ever gets made (the most ominous closing words in recent cinema: “This is just the beginning”). This film gets as far as landing Paul and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in the desert: ’til then, we get a lengthy caravanserai of austere set pieces, a beautiful platform for Patrice Vermette’s extraordinary designs, and various striking performances. Stellan Skarsgård is the levitating villain Baron Harkonnen; Charlotte Rampling is her icy best as an intergalactic Mother Superior; Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa are burly bruisers with beards."
"Nov 19, 2021",positive," Craft-wise, Dune is a marvel; filled with impressive visual effects, imaginative costumes, and an otherworldly score by Hans Zimmer. But the cinematography falls victim to that all too modern trap of being drastically underlit and murky. All this is in service of a plot that feels shockingly threadbare for a film that's about intergalactic political intrigue and civil war. This is mostly due to this being Act I of a larger narrative, but if The Lord of the Rings managed to deliver three films with three act structures and fully rounded stories I see no reason why Dune can't do the same. There's clearly an interesting world here, one that provides an all-too-timely critique of wealthy elites vying for control of natural resources in order to gain political power, but Dune takes three hours to get to really get started and then it ends.  Perhaps it will ultimately work better when seen in it's full context once Part II is released, but Dune as it stands is a curiously weightless affair, all sturm and no drang, a vaguely intriguing setup that is shockingly unsatisfying. One can't help but feel that the narratives been robbed of its context, serving as little more than an appetizer for another, better film.  It's a first act without a climax, a sweeping visual spectacle that ultimately lacks the substance to justify its grim self-seriousness. Here's hoping Part II makes it all worth it."
